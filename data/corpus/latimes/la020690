PAYZANT IN RUNNING FOR MIAMI POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
San Diego city schools Supt. Tom Payzant is considering the top school position 
in Miami-Dade County, Fla., the nation's fourth-largest school district and one 
of the most innovative, Payzant confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant is one of 12 candidates for the post. The candidates will be revealed 
publicly at the Miami school board today. Payzant said he was strongly urged to 
apply by a consultant hired by Miami to suggest a replacement for the previous 
superintendent, who now heads New York City's schools. 
</P>
<P>
"They contacted me, and, after a lot of conversation with the consultant, I 
said yes" to applying, Payzant said Monday. "The consultant really encouraged 
me to throw my hat into the ring." 
</P>
<P>
Payzant said that Miami-Dade County interests him because "it is the only other 
big-city job that perhaps would be a real challenge to me. . . . It is doing a 
lot of the same things" as San Diego, including 
</P>
<P>
school-based management where teachers receive more autonomy for decision 
making. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant told his top administrators of the possible Miami job Monday. But he 
said he has made no final decision on whether he would leave if the position is 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego city schools board President Kay Davis said Monday that trustees have 
been aware of Payzant's application for about three weeks. She said several 
members of the Miami board told San Diego trustees Ann Armstrong and Susan 
Davis that "we want your superintendent" at a National School Boards Assn. 
meeting in Miami last month, but Kay Davis emphasized that Payzant has openly 
shared his application with the board. 
</P>
<P>
"We're nervous because the Miami job interests him intellectually," Kay Davis 
said. "It's unanimous that we would like him to stay. We are working on an 
improvement to his existing contract, to see what we can do to entice him to 
stay." 
</P>
<P>
Payzant has been superintendent in San Diego since Nov. 1, 1982, when he 
arrived from Oklahoma City. His current four-year contract earns him $110,000 
annually and expires Nov. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant's only other serious thought about leaving came two years ago when he 
was a finalist for the Los Angeles city school's post, but he took himself out 
of the running, saying he did not want to move at the time. Another former 
Miami superintendent subsequently took the Los Angeles post. 
</P>
<P>
Miami-Dade County has 280,000 students, contrasted with 120,000 in San Diego, 
the nation's eighth-largest district. It is nationally known for pioneering 
many school reforms now being tried in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be disappointed if he left," Hugh Boyle, president of the San Diego 
Teachers Assn. said Monday. "I'd have real concerns about getting things done 
if he left."

THE KEYS TO LEARNING;

<P>
EXPERIMENTAL MUSIC PROGRAM AT HARDY GETTING RAVE REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 10-year-old Trung Tran, the lack of a piano for practice at home is the 
only downside to the innovative new music class that he and his classmates take 
at Hardy Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't dimmed his enthusiasm for the weekly instruction in 
international song, musical rhythm and pattern on professional-quality 
synthesizers, as well as keyboard practice and song-writing. 
</P>
<P>
Tran has persuaded his father to take him each Saturday to the National City 
Fedco, where the fifth-grader busily practices the previous week's lessons on 
the store's musical instruments while his father shops. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the effect that the experimental course in music and creativity, now in 
its third month, is having at the small school neighboring San Diego State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Through the generosity of philanthropist Muriel Gluck, Hardy Principal Gail 
Guth is tapping the talents of two local musicians, both to show the school's 
328 students the creativity possible through music and to enhance their 
enjoyment of academics in general. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental program, if successful, could prove a potent example for a 
turnaround in elementary music education -- long neglected not only in San 
Diego but throughout the United States -- through a marriage of computer 
technology and a fresh new curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Once a week, each class at Hardy -- from kindergarten through fifth -- files 
into the computer lab where musical artists-in-residence Carl Hermanns and Gary 
Stokes put the students through a fast-paced 40 minutes about music. 
</P>
<P>
Key to their efforts are the 17 Roland synthesizers, at which two students each 
can hear and make music from all over the world. The equipment, worth about 
$23,000 and protected in a specially secured classroom, is being rented for 
$432 a month. 
</P>
<P>
District fine arts education director Kay Wagner hired Hermanns and Stokes 
using a small portion of Gluck's $3.75-million grant and then has funded the 
music project out of her own budget. As far as Wagner knows, no other district 
in the nation has designed an elementary program around keyboard synthesizers, 
which can replicate almost any kind of music through computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
Already, teachers at Hardy, who laud the program for motivating the children 
and for tying into language and science skills, are trying to interest 
businesses in their Montezuma Mesa neighborhood into providing an endowment so 
the class can become a permanent fixture. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real credit to Carl and Gary," teacher Art Geisler said. "Among other 
things, the kids learn how to listen." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, fourth- and fifth-grade students from Jack 
</P>
<P>
Shriver's class reviewed the way to find the middle C key on their keyboards 
and then practiced ensemble-style, using their index fingers, the playing of 
each white key four times from middle C to the next higher C key. As the 
students moved from key to key, Hermanns clapped his hands together, steadily 
increasing the beat. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, you guys found out we didn't keep to a steady tempo," he said to wide-eyed 
smiles. "This time, feel the tempo with your feet as well." And the group 
busily tapped their feet as they ran their fingers up the keyboard a second 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Then Hermanns and Stokes showed them how to play using the entire hand, keeping 
the thumb flat on middle C while gently curling the four fingers onto the 
adjoining keys. As a prompt, Hermanns played a little segment of a Michael 
Jackson song to tempt them into experimenting with sharps and flats as well. 
</P>
<P>
"See, it's black, black, black, white, white," Hermanns said, splitting the 
class into red and yellow teams, letting one team practice, using earphones, 
while the other team learned the names of the keys -- from A through G -- and 
how to distinguish sharps and flats. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the class had listened to a Linda Ronstadt rendition of a Mexican love 
ballad, a recording on which her words were repeated to the same melody by a 
male singer accompanying her. 
</P>
<P>
"What does this remind us of?" Hermanns asked the students, with several 
recalling the African "response" songs they had heard the previous week. The 
class stood in a group and swayed from side to side, moving their feet to the 
beat of Ronstadt's mariachi band accompaniment while Hermanns pointed out 
Mexico on the wall map. 
</P>
<P>
"Beating out the rhythm with your feet is also a good way to (look natural) 
when you want to dance," Hermanns reminded them, as several students continued 
to sway to the beat as they returned to their desks. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Hermanns and Stokes explained the theory behind the class. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to show kids that music is a way to be creative, to be expressive, but 
also a way to boost self-esteem, and to affect other skills like math and 
reading as well," said Hermanns, who has conducted Summer Pops programs for the 
San Diego Symphony as well as coordinating its school concert programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids learn that they also need a strong framework, that discipline comes 
right along with freedom in music, that there is work to do, that you don't get 
immediate gratification all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Stokes told of one student who wanted to know what button on the synthesizer 
she would press to hear the Michael Jackson rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized that she wanted not just the (background) sound but thought you 
could push a button and get the whole song done for you," Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
Hermanns said the program deliberately emphasizes students playing music first 
and then learning some of the reasons why the sounds develop the way they do. 
</P>
<P>
"While doing it, while playing a Michael Jackson chord, for example, I throw 
out the concept of tempo, so that they are learning naturally while doing. We 
make them concentrate for a while on a new idea, then letting them play around 
a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Hermanns and Stokes, a jazz musician by training, vary the curriculum slightly 
depending on grade level, giving students in lower grades more rhythm and song 
work and fewer concepts. 
</P>
<P>
The school's regular teachers are unanimous in their praise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm teaching all my science through songs," said Irene Harris who teaches 
fourth and fifth grades. "We sang songs about the thermometer, about the rain 
cycle and now we are singing about anatomy . . . it beats giving them another 
work sheet." 
</P>
<P>
The students are sold on the class, and some persuaded their parents to buy 
small synthesizers as Christmas presents. 
</P>
<P>
"I like experimenting with the different sounds," fifth-grader Nathaniel Russ 
said, "especially the 'ironworks' sound, which sounds like a hammer and a 
nail." 
</P>
<P>
Tran said he notices now that basketballs and tennis balls "have a rhythm" when 
they bounce or when you kick them. And Cassie Mahoney, a fourth-grader, said 
she has a better appreciation for the piano lessons her grandmother gives her 
on Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, I used to say, 'What is this?' " about the idea of lessons, Mahoney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Given the short duration of many experimental programs in the school district, 
Hardy teachers are apprehensive about whether the program will continue beyond 
its guarantee of one-year funding. The school is trying to find a "white 
knight" to guarantee the program by purchasing the equipment for $23,000 in 
return for having the computer lab named for the donor. 
</P>
<P>
"Wagner and Gluck have been extremely generous, but we don't want this to be at 
the whim of the district's priorities," Hermanns said, noting that music has 
not been high on the list of school trustees, despite evidence and testimony 
from teachers about the academic and social benefits from tackling the subject. 
</P>
<P>
"This program needs at least two years to prove its value, after which 
hopefully it would be permanent."

EXECUTION SET APRIL 3 FOR HARRIS; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE CONVICTED MURDERER'S LAWYERS, CONCEDING THAT THEY ARE "UP AGAINST 
THE GUN NOW," ARE STILL PURSUING POSSIBLE APPEALS TO KEEP HIM FROM THE GAS 
CHAMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Murderer Robert Alton Harris, convicted of the 1978 killings of two teen-age 
San Diego boys, was ordered Monday to die April 3 in the gas chamber at San 
Quentin, setting the stage for California's first execution in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez announced the date at a 
four-minute hearing Monday, a procedural formality that had been expected since 
last month's rejection by the U.S. Supreme Court of a broad challenge to 
Harris' death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The April 3 date actually is Harris' fourth scheduled execution date, but his 
first in eight years, San Diego prosecutors said. This time around, after more 
than 10 years of appeals, even Harris' San Diego lawyers conceded Monday that 
the end may be near. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really up against the gun now," attorney Charles M. Sevilla said after 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Sevilla said he and Charles M. McCabe, Harris' other lawyer, will file a 
request "fairly soon" with the California Supreme Court to put off the 
execution while it considers a new appeal the attorneys filed with the court 
Jan. 5. 
</P>
<P>
In that appeal, Harris contends, in part, that it would be cruel and unusual 
punishment to kill him because he has changed for the better in prison. Even if 
the state Supreme Court agrees to hear the new appeal, Harris must still 
persuade the panel to put off the execution now that the date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the court is not losing patience with us," McCabe said. "We are not 
being dilatory. We are not simply trying to delay 
</P>
<P>
the inevitable. There are strong constitutional issues that need to be 
resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Harris, whose appeals have been turned down four times 
by the U.S. Supreme Court and whose death sentence was affirmed in 1981 by the 
California Supreme Court, long ago exhausted any conceivable legal grounds for 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
But Louis R. Hanoian, a deputy attorney general handling the Harris case, said 
it is possible that Harris' lawyers could orchestrate further delay. If the 
state Supreme Court rejects Harris' new appeal, defense lawyers are virtually 
certain to turn to the federal courts for mercy, Hanoian said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think that we're near the end of the road, but as long as there 
are courts willing to listen to arguments, I can't judge whether we're near the 
end of that road," Hanoian said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, said in an interview last week with a San Diego radio station that 
his "spirits are up" but he tries not to think about San Quentin's gas chamber. 
Still, he said, "If it does come to me dying, then I'll just have to die." 
</P>
<P>
Harris was arrested July 5, 1978, by Steve Baker, a San Diego police officer 
who did not know at the time that Harris' victims were Baker's son, Michael, 
and Michael's friend, John Mayeski. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old boys had been eating hamburgers in the parking lot of a Jack in 
the Box in San Diego's Mira Mesa neighborhood when Harris kidnaped them at 
gunpoint so that he could steal their car and use it in a bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered them to drive to a canyon near Miramar Reservoir, where he killed 
them. Later, he finished their half-eaten hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego Superior Court jury convicted Harris of murder in January, 1979. He 
was sentenced to death by San Diego Superior Court Judge Eli Levenson in March, 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
During the nearly 11 years he has been on Death Row, Harris' case has 
progressed farther through the court system than that of any of California's 
272 other condemned prisoners. Sevilla said Monday that he recognizes that "a 
lot rides on this case." 
</P>
<P>
If Harris actually is put to death, Sevilla said, an "emotional barrier will be 
broken which will psychologically open the doors for many more (executions) to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, analyzing every detail connected to Harris' execution date, said 
the choice of April 3 was a good one. It is near the end of the 60-day time 
frame the law gave the judge in which to pick a date, meaning there could be no 
argument that Harris did not have every opportunity to protest, Hanoian said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, April 3, the 57th day and a Tuesday, is a better option than 
Friday, April 6, the 60th day, because bringing San Quentin "back to normalcy" 
after Harris' execution would be easier during the week with a full complement 
of guards, rather than on a partly staffed weekend, Hanoian said. 
</P>
<P>
Executions at San Quentin traditionally have been held on either Tuesday or 
Friday.

CURB ASKED ON ZOO SALE OF ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) sent a letter to Mayor Maureen O'Connor 
Monday urging her to forbid the San Diego Zoological Society from selling 
surplus animals to any person other than another zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The letter explicitly asked that the city of San Diego forbid the zoo from 
selling animals to Earl Tatum and Jim Fouts, two animal dealers who were 
featured in a recent "60 Minutes" segment that alleged they have sold zoo 
animals to private game farms, where they were shot by hunters. 
</P>
<P>
The letter also lauded Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles, who last week ordered 
the Los Angeles Zoo to stop doing business with Tatum and Fouts, and urged 
O'Connor to "expeditiously follow suit." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, a spokesman for the mayor, said that, by close of business Monday, 
O'Connor had not yet received a copy of the letter. But he said that, because 
O'Connor does not have any formal authority over the zoo, there is likely 
little that she can do. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm not mistaken, the L.A. Zoo is a city facility," Downey said. "In this 
case, the zoo is not a city-run facility, so there is nothing the mayor or the 
City Council can do." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles does run its zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Shallenberger, a consultant to the State Senate Committee on Natural 
Resources and Wildlife, which McCorquodale chairs, said she understood that the 
San Diego Zoo is a private institution. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think, if the mayor of one of the largest cities in California calls on 
their zoo to stop a practice, they certainly have a tremendous influence," 
Shallenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
Downey responded, "They may not understand the system of government here. We 
don't have a strong mayor-type of government." 
</P>
<P>
Downey said that, when the mayor receives the letter, her office will forward 
it to the zoo and ask them to respond. He noted, however, that last week the 
San Diego Zoo announced that it had severed its ties with Fouts, although it 
continues to employ Tatum. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a moot point," he said. "If there's any reason to look into their 
response, we will."

ASSEMBLY PANEL TO REVIEW HIRING OF LAIDLAW BUS DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state Assembly committee will look into the hiring practices and supervision 
at Laidlaw Transit, the largest school transportation contractor in Los 
Angeles, following the arrests of two Laidlaw employees accused of driving 
buses while drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said the Assembly Transportation Committee, 
which he chairs, will review Laidlaw practices at a hearing Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"Something's obviously wrong when a guy can get drunk and get behind the wheel 
of a school bus," Katz said. The second Laidlaw arrest in as many months 
"underscored the need to call Laidlaw in and have them start answering some 
tough questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Katz also said several state agencies agreed Monday to improve screening of 
applicants for jobs as bus drivers. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego-based driver, Joseph Bolden, was arrested Friday after crashing 
into a pickup truck. Injured in the collision were one of the 12 student 
passengers and two passengers in the truck. Blood-alcohol test results are not 
expected until the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
In January, another Laidlaw driver was arrested in Encino as he prepared to 
pick up students at Lanai Road Elementary. A breath test showed the driver, 
Harold Keith Lone, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.27%, more than three times 
the new legal limit of 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-area school districts that use Laidlaw's services say they are 
closely watching investigations of the two incidents. Laidlaw provides about 
one-quarter of the buses used in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said representatives of the Department of Justice, the California Highway 
Patrol and the Department of Motor Vehicles agreed to speed up state 
fingerprint checks and stop issuing temporary driver certifications as of June 
1. Currently, 618 drivers in the state are working with temporary permits while 
their backgrounds are checked. 
</P>
<P>
However, some district administrators expressed concern that the state's 
actions could lead to a shortage of drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern I would have is we need to be able to transport students," said 
Robert Smith, assistant superintendent for Ventura County schools. "What 
happens if there's no way to issue temporaries and half a dozen bus drivers 
quit or get sick." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura employs Laidlaw to drive about 500 special-education students to 
schools around the county, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw spokesman Dave Daley, vice president of operations, said the San Diego 
accident differed from the Encino incident because Bolden had a relatively 
clean record -- only one prior accident in the bus yard -- while Lone had 
adopted an alias to disguise a long history of drunken driving and criminal 
activity. Lone was driving with a temporary permit. 
</P>
<P>
After Lone's arrest, Laidlaw instituted a more thorough background check of its 
applicants' driving records. On Monday, Daley said he also plans to train staff 
members who have contact with drivers, such as dispatchers, field supervisors 
and trainers, in ways to detect and report suspected drug or alcohol use. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified has the ability to test any drivers -- their own, Laidlaw's 
and those who work for the other five private companies that have district 
contracts -- they suspect of substance abuse. However, Bud Dunevant, district 
director of transportation, said only a few drivers are tested each year. 
</P>
<P>
A district survey completed in 1988 and updated last year found Laidlaw's 
drivers were two to three times as likely to have accidents as were drivers 
employed directly by the Los Angeles Unified School District. Daley said a 
major reason for the difference was the district's practice of hiring away 
Laidlaw's top drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Dunevant agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We hire, basically, their best drivers," Dunevant said. District salaries 
range from $15 to $18 an hour, twice as high as Laidlaw's. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County schools, which also use Laidlaw drivers, have not had any 
comparable problems with the company, said Transportation Officer Charles 
Devlin. He said mixing alcohol and the transport of children is "unacceptable, 
unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
"They obviously were very serious incidents," Devlin said. "The question that 
has to be answered is: Is it all pervasive within that contractor? You begin to 
wonder."

MAN TO BE TRIED IN ACID ATTACK DURING HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Andres Chaidez, 22, came to the United States from Mexico five years ago in 
search of a better life but his prospects were dashed last September, when a 
robber threw a cupful of sulfuric acid in his face after Chaidez refused to 
give him money. 
</P>
<P>
Chaidez is blind, and doctors say he will never regain his sight. 
</P>
<P>
His face is badly disfigured. Instead of working, the former auto mechanic just 
sits at his mother's home in Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't do anything. I am staying home," Chaidez said Monday through an 
interpreter after a preliminary hearing in Van Nuys Municipal Court for Henry 
Gregory Tristan, 42, of Arleta. Tristan was ordered to stand trial for the 
attack on three felony counts of aggravated mayhem, assault with a caustic 
chemical and robbery. The charges carry a maximum sentence of life 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
During the preliminary hearing, Chaidez testified that he was driving to visit 
some relatives on the evening of Sept. 5 when a stranger approached him and 
demanded money. Chaidez said when he refused to give him the money, the man 
tossed a cup of liquid, later identified as sulfuric acid, in his face. 
</P>
<P>
Chaidez drove away, but he stopped when he could no longer see, he said. 
Although Chaidez could not identify Tristan as his assailant, police said 
Tristan's fingerprints were found on a coffee mug, left near the scene, 
containing sulfuric acid, a colorless, highly corrosive liquid used in the 
manufacture of paints, dyes, fertilizers and explosives.

OTHER CANDIDATES FOR SHERIFF REJECT ROACHE CAMPAIGN FUND CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache on Monday challenged his fellow candidates in this 
year's race for San Diego County sheriff to refuse any financial contributions 
from members of that department or from other county employees. 
</P>
<P>
But his request was quickly turned down by the other candidates, including Jack 
Drown, who, as an assistant sheriff, has drawn much of his financial support 
from within the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Roache, a sheriff's captain in Lemon Grove, issued the challenge after 
criticizing Drown last week for collecting $2,700 in campaign money from 
sheriff's employees or their wives. 
</P>
<P>
That money was raised late last year, despite a sheriff's policy against such 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The policy was reversed last week, on the eve of the deadline for candidates 
filing their first round of financial disclosure forms. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the policy reversal, Roache said he was concerned that some 
department employees may donate money to favorite candidates in return for 
special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for creating an obligation, or encouraging employees to seek 
favorable treatment, is just too great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant Sheriff Drown said he welcomes support from all sections of the 
community, including the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"I for one am frankly not at all ashamed or embarrassed by the fact that I 
enjoy the support of a lot of people in the Sheriff's Department and county 
government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If those people want to contribute to my campaign, then that's fine with me. 
They have a vested interest in the department and they have a right to 
contribute if they choose to do so." 
</P>
<P>
He added that Roache is asking all candidates to refrain from soliciting or 
accepting money from county employees because "I don't think Jim Roache enjoys 
a great deal of support in the Sheriff's Department and he realizes that I do." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a safe move for him," Drown added. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't going to get much in contributions from the department to begin 
with, and he knew that." 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate, former San Diego police chief Ray Hoobler, said he also will 
not agree with Roache's request to shy away from county donations. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Roache is only jealous that he doesn't have the same level of 
internal support as Drown in the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason he's against it now is that he hasn't been able to tap the 
well, and Drown beat him to it," Hoobler said.

BERNSON TO SEEK MORE ANTI-GANG FUNDING; 
</P>
<P>
PREVENTION: GANG-RELATED INCIDENTS IN THE VALLEY INCREASED 134% LAST YEAR. THE 
COUNCILMAN IS SEEKING A GREATER SHARE OF THE CITY'S $1.4 MILLION EARMARKED FOR 
YOUTH PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The San Fernando Valley, where gang-related crime more than doubled in 1989, is 
not getting its fair share of $1.4 million in city funds proposed to steer 
susceptible youths away from gang membership, a top aide to Los Angeles City 
Councilman Hal Bernson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Valley always gets less," complained Greig Smith, Bernson's chief deputy. 
To help remedy this, Smith said Bernson will seek city funding for an anti-gang 
program proposed by Project Heavy/San Fernando Valley, a nonprofit social 
service agency. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the council's Public Safety Committee, chaired by Councilman Richard 
Alatorre of the Eastside, adopted a $1.4-million anti-gang plan recommended by 
city staff. 
</P>
<P>
Project Heavy, however, was not among seven Valley-based social service 
agencies that would be granted money under the plan. The proposal next goes to 
a committee chaired by Councilman Joel Wachs, a Valley lawmaker, for further 
review. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said more anti-gang money should go to Valley organizations because of a 
recent spurt in gang crime. Statistics released last month showed gang-related 
crime in the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Bureau increased 134% in 
1989 over the prior year -- from 510 crimes to 1,191 -- a greater increase than 
in any of the department's three other bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau reported a 55% rise in gang-related crimes, and the West 
Bureau reported a 34% increase. The South Bureau had the smallest rate of 
increase, 6%, but the greatest number of gang-related crimes, 2,674. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said it was not clear how much money Bernson will seek for Project Heavy. 
Bernson was attending a seminar in Irvine on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies receiving the $1.4 million are to use it to provide services to 
youths susceptible to joining gangs, spending much of the money addressing 
problems in the families of potential gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Of the total city funding package, $222,928, or 15.2%, was allocated to the 
Valley. City staff recommended that El Centro de Amistad, a Canoga Park-based 
social service agency, coordinate the Valley program. 
</P>
<P>
El Centro would get $37,000 under the plan, while El Nido Services, another 
Valley agency, would receive $68,928, the largest single award among Valley 
agencies. Other agencies recommended for funding were: Juvenile Justice 
Connection, Pacoima Community Youth Culture Center, Maud Booth Center, SFV 
Child Guidance and Assn. of Educational Therapists. 
</P>
<P>
Because funding is allocated to each of the four Los Angeles Police Department 
bureaus based on its share of gang-related crimes, the Valley would receive the 
smallest amount, despite having the greatest rate of increase. Although Bernson 
has not opposed use of this formula before, it now makes sense to give 
additional funds to those areas experiencing rapid increases, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith noted that 35% of the city's youth -- ages 6 to 17 years -- live in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Using gang-related crimes is the wrong criteria for allocating funds," Smith 
said. "It misses the mark. Kids in gangs who are already committing crimes are 
not the ones we thought were to get helped by this program. We thought it was 
to help kids from problem homes not yet in gangs."

<P>
A speeding motorist being chased by police was killed when his car crashed into 
parked vehicles in Panorama City early Monday morning, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit began about 3:30 a.m. near Kester Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard when 
police sighted the speeding auto. It ended about three minutes later when the 
car slammed into three parked cars at about 70 m.p.h., ejecting the driver, 
Steven Daniels, 25, of Van Nuys, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels was pronounced dead at Panorama Community Hospital, officers said. 
Police were not involved in the collision.

A Simi Valley man was arrested in Redding in the death of a Cottonwood man, 
Shasta County sheriff's officers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Sgt. Rusty Brewer said Eric Warner, 25, was arrested in connection 
with the death of Felix Wusstig, 38, who was found dead Dec. 12 in his 
burned-out pickup truck near a Coleman Fish Hatchery. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer said Warner, Wusstig and a third man, who was being sought, were 
searching for wood to cut when they got into a dispute in which alcohol was 
involved. Wusstig apparently was shot in the neck, and his body and truck were 
set afire, officers said.

TORRANCE CENTER IS 'A DREAM REALIZED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 25 years of false starts, the Torrance Cultural Arts Center last week 
made it all the way to an official groundbreaking ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Beaming City Council members, shivering as a frigid wind whipped across the 
two-acre construction site, gave speeches of gratitude to more than 200 
community leaders who had gathered Thursday to watch the ceremonial tossing of 
earth from gold-painted shovels. 
</P>
<P>
"I really never thought that this day would come," Mayor Katy Geissert said as 
she recited the numerous obstacles the $12.2-million complex has faced since 
city leaders first discussed it more than 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a celebration of a dream realized." 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for completion in August, 1991, the 63,700-square-foot center will 
include a 497-seat theater, a visual arts wing, a performing arts wing, a 
children's art center, a community meeting hall with banquet seating for 300 
and a 15,000-square-foot festival plaza with a small outdoor stage. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Epson America, which this summer will complete construction of its 
national headquarters within sight of the arts complex, will pay for an 
authentic Japanese garden, expected to cost as much as $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although a city bond measure will pay most of the construction costs, private 
donors have given more than $1 million to the project, including $250,000 from 
developer Frank Torino to build the plaza, $250,000 from Watt Homes Industries, 
$500,000 from Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., and $30,000 raised by the Torrance 
Youth Council through bake sales and craft booths over a seven-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of other South Bay arts facilities said they welcome Torrance's 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"There is always the friendly competition between different cultural entities, 
but we really don't see Torrance . . . taking dollars out of our pockets," said 
Vincent Beggs, director of the Palos Verdes Arts Center in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
"There is plenty of room for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Lesnik, director of the Norris Theatre for the Performing Arts in Rolling 
Hills Estates, said the upcoming competition from the Torrance theater "will be 
a healthy thing." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like restaurants -- the more restaurants you find on a block, the more 
people tend to go to each one of them," Lesnik said. "The more theaters and 
culture and entertainment there is in an area, the more likely people will look 
there when they're thinking about spending an evening out." 
</P>
<P>
Lesnik and Bob Stewart, manager of the Torrance complex, said they plan to 
coordinate their bookings so the theaters avoid direct competition. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the four-building Torrance complex, to be built on a bare patch of 
ground in the northwest corner of the Civic Center, have changed numerous times 
through the years. 
</P>
<P>
It began modestly enough in 1964 with the completion of the city's Joslyn 
Center, a small building directly across from the police station. Originally 
intended to be the first of two arts center phases, Joslyn Center stood alone 
for years as the more pressing needs of streets, libraries and parks drained 
away money that city leaders had hoped to use to build more facilities for the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, hopes for an expanded arts complex were rekindled when sponsors of an 
$18-million parkland bond measure designated $1 million for a community 
theater. But voters rejected the measure and the city's attention turned to 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of nuts-and-bolts type projects being done," Geissert said. 
"The city had so many pressing needs." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, City Council members asked a consultant to study Torrance's 
recreational needs. The consultant recommended building a 400- or 500-seat 
theater, several exercise and arts studios, and a large meeting hall. 
</P>
<P>
The council adopted a cultural arts center master plan and began staging 
community hearings in 1983. For two years, debate over the complex's future 
raged, with one faction insisting that Torrance's cultural facilities were 
woefully inadequate while another argued that the city's money could be better 
spent and that any arts complex should be built entirely with private 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
On May 28, 1985, council members voted 6 to 1, with Councilman Bill Applegate 
opposed, to issue $9.4 million in bonds to pay for the complex. At the time, 
officials predicted that they would stage a groundbreaking within 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
One month away from the scheduled groundbreaking, however, the city received 
construction bids that were more than 60% over budget, leading to the 
architect's dismissal and throwing the project's future into limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Determined council members returned to the drawing board, hired a new architect 
and staged more public hearings. Last month, they accepted a construction bid 
10% over budget.

LERNER ON STATUS QUO

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading Lerner's long discourse on the need for fresh approaches to the 
ills of society, there is to my mind one salient feature to his views: He 
applies the term socialism to what has long been described in the classic 
philosophies as "civic virtue." 
</P>
<P>
Why not use the established classical terminology, with the realization that 
the civic virtue involved contemplates the human race as the citizenry, and 
planet Earth as the region inhabited? That would certainly be consistent with 
the fundamental Jewish hope that all mankind will accept the rule of a 
universal God of justice.

Let him also depict the other side -- the innocent, defenseless human being

Sadly, in these times of self-seeking attitudes, the unborn are treated as

<P>
They are the product of conception and a woman's property and lacking civil

Pro-choice is a misnomer; the child has no choice. One day abortion will be

SALES TAX ON RELIGIOUS ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russell Shaw ("Slouching Toward a Religious Levy," Editorial Page, Jan. 27) is 
put out with the media because they "yawned" at the U.S. Supreme Court's 
decision to tax the sale of religious items. 
</P>
<P>
I yawn at several of Shaw's points. 
</P>
<P>
First, his contention that parochial schools do a better job than public 
schools is his opinion, to which he is entitled. It is not a fact. Where it is 
true, it is true because private and parochial schools can and do dismiss any 
students who do not follow their rules. Public schools must take everyone, and 
cannot expel any but the most hardened criminals. You can be successful if you 
can select to serve only those who fit your expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Second, religious institutions are not taxed because they are nonprofit 
organizations. Jimmy Swaggart and his "ministries" are in fact businesses, 
fleecing people of all they can get. Taxing them should be only the first step 
the government takes in attempting to put them out of business.

<P>
India has ordered all foreign correspondents out of Kashmir (Part A, Jan. 28). 
The world's largest democracy is determined to continue its undemocratic hold 
on Kashmir and does not want the world to know about it. 
</P>
<P>
India's international commitment to a United Nations supervised plebiscite in 
Kashmir remains unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
The leadership in India presents this struggle as a resurgence of Islamic 
fundamentalism. The focus is thus shifted from the right of self-determination 
for Kashmiris, to an uprising of religious fanatics against secular India, with 
the implication that the movement is against democratic interests. 
</P>
<P>
Reality is that, in the four decades of Indian independence, free elections 
have been an exception rather than the rule in Kashmir. A protester in Kashmir 
is routinely branded as a fundamentalist and as pro-Pakistani. Even kids below 
10 years of age have been arrested under the anti-terrorism act. 
</P>
<P>
In Kashmir, the economic base has not expanded; what has expanded is the depth 
and breadth of corruption. Kashmir, once a bread basket for the neighboring 
areas, is now a net importer of agricultural and consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
True friends of democratic India need to impress upon the Indian leadership 
that for a democracy to survive, human rights cannot be the exclusive domain of 
some but must be universal. Kashmiris must have their basic human rights: the 
right of self-determination by free and impartial elections.

REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT WOULD LOSE.

By HENRY J. HYDE, Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) has been a member of the House of 
Representatives since 1974. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Imposing a limit on the number of terms that a U.S. representative or senator 
can serve -- thereby regularly sweeping clean the corridors of power in 
Washington -- seems to be the cause of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
People who advocate this proposal accept the logical fallacy that "new is 
better" and must believe that elective office is the one vocation where 
experience is an obstacle to good performance. 
</P>
<P>
In our nation's earliest years, the citizen-legislator was a useful idea. 
Leaving the plow and riding horseback to New York, Philadelphia or, later, to 
Washington was a workable arrangement in a largely agricultural country whose 
total population in 1790 was about 3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Today's America is vastly more populous, enormously more complicated and 
requires the full-time attention of someone. Should that someone be the 
permanent bureaucracy? Unelected, unresponsive and unaccountable, the power of 
bureaucrats in the day-to-day operations of government already far exceed that 
of elected and politically appointed officials, whose tenure is inherently 
transitory. A mandatory revolving door for elected officials would only 
strengthen the grip of the permanent bureaucracy. Representative government 
would be the loser. 
</P>
<P>
No one maintains that democracy always produces the best or most noble result, 
but as Winston Churchill reminded us, it's better than any other system. To 
deny the voters complete choice in who will represent them in Congress is to 
say that the people can't be trusted; that their options should be limited by 
requiring a turnover every few years. This would effectively deprive our 
country of the wisdom and experience, accumulated over long years of sensitive 
and sensible service, of many outstanding public officials. 
</P>
<P>
To believe, as some do, that America is governed by a permanent Congress is a 
great leap not supported by fact. Only 19% of House members elected before 1974 
are still serving. During Ronald Reagan's presidency, there was a 55% turnover 
in the House. 
</P>
<P>
To assume that a member of Congress can learn all about government in a few 
years is simplistic nonsense. If a district or a state is ill-served by a 
second-rate representative, the remedy is available. Incumbents can be 
defeated. Run better candidates and campaigns, and turn the electorate out to 
vote. A light turnout reflects the failure of the opposition to ignite the 
voters. Often people vote against candidates or for issues. But when they're 
satisfied, too many don't bother to vote at all. That's human nature. 
</P>
<P>
For Congress to truly reflect the diversity of America, its members should be 
drawn from the widest range of citizens possible. Because every age group 
brings a unique perspective. people in mid-life should be encouraged to join 
the young and the old in public service. If there are artificial limits on the 
years of service, then the young will begin their careers in Congress and the 
elderly will end their careers in Congress, but those in mid-life will be 
largely unwilling to devote their most productive, creative years to a vocation 
with no tenure and whose only prospect is enforced retirement. 
</P>
<P>
No, have faith in democracy, let the people choose and don't disqualify those 
who can bring sound judgment born of years of experience to the increasingly 
demanding tasks of elected office.

TRUMP L.A.: MARKING HIS SPOT; 
</P>
<P>
THIS GUY'S HERE FOR A WHILE; 
</P>
<P>
HIS BUILDINGS DON'T SO MUCH STAND AS STAND FOR SOMETHING. THEY'RE PART OF A 
LARGER SCHEME HAVING LITTLE TO DO WITH THE CITY, EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE 
BUILDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANCIS WILKINSON, Francis Wilkinson is a writer in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere between the end of the '80s and the beginning of the '90s, it 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
There was no announcement, nor even any public discussion of it, really. But 
every soul in New York City felt it, knew it instinctively. Bloated, slightly 
numb from a decade of forced feeding, the city had finally, painfully reached 
its saturation point. 
</P>
<P>
We could not tolerate a single silver spoonful more of Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Trump must have realized it, too. For though he owns the single largest private 
tract of land on the island of Manhattan -- a space that, for several years, he 
has vigorously sought to overdevelop in typically Trumpian fashion -- it 
appears that he is now prepared to focus his attentions, and his erector set, 
in someone else's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
I am sorry, Los Angeles, but it had to be you. Donald Trump simply does not do 
Peoria. Trump's proposal to construct a commercial-residential tower near 
downtown Los Angeles was, of course, intended to raise a ruckus. Mr. Trump 
likes to be announced whenever he enters a room. I'm sure one can think of many 
good reasons to welcome him to Los Angeles. Some solid citizens no doubt 
envision new jobs, an expanded tax base and the economic vitality that such 
huge construction projects usually entail. Others reasonably worry about the 
dangers of increased pollution, unnecessary congestion and a sinking quality of 
life. Then, too, there are bound to be concerns on purely aesthetic grounds. 
For instance, how would the proposed tower fit in with the existing skyline and 
the community of buildings surrounding it? 
</P>
<P>
I confess I have no idea what exactly Trump plans to build on Wilshire 
Boulevard. However, as a strictly pedestrian New Yorker, I have ample 
experience with Trump Palace, Trump Plaza and Trump This-and-That to get the 
gist of what you are in for. Even if the proposed tower were to be a graceless 
clunker, there can be no doubt that it will merit the three letters most 
precious to Trump in all the alphabet. Every Trump project is by decree the -- 
-- -- est in the whole darn world. (In this case, I am told, the larg-est 
ballroom in Los Angeles is planned, though the fill-in-the-blank part is not of 
particular concern.) 
</P>
<P>
The funny thing about Trump buildings, however, is that they don't so much 
stand as stand for something. New York is chock full of graceless, 
proletarian-looking towers. Trump's most audacious projects, which rise 
throughout midtown Manhattan, are somewhat imposing and unimaginative 
monoliths, but they are superior in design and construction to many of their 
neighbors. What really sets Trump buildings apart is that they serve as part of 
a larger scheme having little to do with the city and everything to do with 
Trump. 
</P>
<P>
Not unlike a dog that leaves a special part of itself at every hydrant in the 
neighborhood, Donald Trump feels compelled to let us know that he has been 
around the corner, across the street, down the block. Consider the following: 
It is possible to fly into New York on the Trump Shuttle, take a Trump 
helicopter across the city, during which time one reads a full-page Trump ad in 
the New York Times and a Trump feature story in New York magazine. Arriving in 
Manhattan, one may drive up the West Side and spot the gargantuan Trump yacht 
plying the Hudson, meanwhile becoming entangled in traffic beneath a billboard 
hawking Trump casinos, finally breaking free to cruise down Central Park South 
past Trump Parc condominiums. Justifiably in need of refreshment, one may stop 
for a drink on the corner of the park at Trump's Plaza Hotel before walking a 
few blocks down Fifth Avenue to Trump Tower to purchase Trump, the game. 
Exiting Trump Tower, one need only cross the street to find the ubiquitous 
Trump autobiography, written by Trump's ghostwriter (see aforementioned New 
York magazine). 
</P>
<P>
So you see, the real debate before you, Los Angeles, has little to do with the 
merits of a single building. It is a shallow exercise to determine whether you 
find such and such aspect of the proposed tower aesthetically pleasing or 
appropriately functional. The real questionis whether you are prepared to 
sacrifice your landmarks, your press, yes, even your sacred life style, to a 
full-scale cultural-physical invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The question is not: Can you afford another skyscraper in Los Angeles? The 
question is: Can you afford to open the door to a guest who will likely never 
leave?

SOUTH AFRICA: EVEN COMMUNISM IS DE-DEMONIZED. BARNACLES OF APARTHEID REMAIN, 
BUT REPRESSION IS THE LOSER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY HAZLITT HEARD, Anthony Hazlitt Heard is a former editor of the Cape 
Times, Cape Town, South Africa. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A journalist friend in Cape Town arrived home after heavy celebrating last 
Friday evening to find a message from the South African Communist Party on his 
telex machine. 
</P>
<P>
This would have been unheard of the day before, when hobnobbing with the 
Communist Party could have resulted in a prison term. That is the measure of 
change introduced by President Frederik W. de Klerk the same day. 
</P>
<P>
Uncharacteristic response from black opposition leaders, such as "incredible" 
and "deeply impressed," greeted news that African National Congress stalwart 
Nelson Mandela is to be freed, banned organizations legalized, some press 
restrictions lifted, political prisoners released, the death penalty suspended 
and exiles welcome to return home. 
</P>
<P>
The masses marched for joy in the cities, watched by low-profile police. 
</P>
<P>
The "de-demonizing" of the Communist ogre -- for years the main focus of 
government hostility toward black nationalism -- was perhaps the most 
unexpected and symbolic event. It placed South Africa in fairly enlightened 
Western company. 
</P>
<P>
Shorn of its underground mystique, the Communist Party must now show its 
strength -- or its weakness -- in an environment of freed black nationalism. 
Its leaders concede in the aftermath of the shocks in the East Bloc that 
strategic reconsideration lies ahead. There is no doubt that the new freedoms 
and ideological confusions in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have 
contributed directly to the de-demonization process in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The old South African propaganda target -- repressive Stalinist communism -- 
hardly exists. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's quantum leap -- which this writer judges to be at least 75% of the 
way necessary to create conditions for realistic talks with the ANC -- 
underscores a modern-day truth: The world of the microchip and fax machine, 
notably the capacity to speed freedom ideas from one corner of the earth to the 
other, ensures that things will never be the same. Repression is the loser. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa is poised for the first time since the 1950s to negotiate rather 
than fight over the question of democratic rights for all. The crass bans on 
the Communist Party in 1950 and on the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress in 
1960 have been rectified at last. We are back to the 1950s, but in a much 
changed world. 
</P>
<P>
Stubborn, crusty barnacles of apartheid remain to be pried from the body 
politic. Whites must get used to the idea of taking their place in society 
according to their skills and numbers, like everyone else. The bad news is that 
this enormous adjustment process could be lengthy and dangerous -- and could 
yet founder. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's reforms are a shiny but relatively small pool of freedom in an 
environment of entrenched repression and racial discrimination. That 
environment is a continuing state of emergency (with, for instance, police 
power to detain without trial for up to six months), laws that restrict 
individuals and organizations and crucial apartheid measures in government 
schooling, living areas and land allocation, a racial population register and 
separate constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
The government is wedded to these, in some degree or other, and it will take 
tough bargaining and pressure to change this. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's generalized references, for instance, to "universal franchise" and 
"equality before an independent judiciary," require fleshing out. He still 
clings to the concept of group rights -- or "national entities" -- which could 
mean a white veto over major decisions. A single one-person one-vote 
constitution has so far not been acceptable to him or even to many in the 
cautiously liberal Democratic Party opposition -- not to mention the 
right-wing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet black leaders of any standing will refuse a deal that they see as a ruse by 
whites to appear to "share power" while in reality dividing and ruling the 
black majority. They want majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
That is the nitty-gritty of the months -- and probably years -- of negotiation 
that lie ahead. De Klerk will no doubt seek to spin out the talks as long as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, though, the beginning of the end of white rule has been sounded by 
De Klerk himself. He has firm control of the process and will want to retain 
it. Right-wing whites might well kick up a fuss. But judges who are relatively 
independent in South Africa will be called on to deal with any excesses. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country is promised a respite from the bloodletting and economic 
and social damage of past years. If the potentially powerful economy starts to 
reflect the hopes rather than the fears of all the people, that locomotive will 
move to underpin the talks. Consequently, whites might fear a bit less and 
militant blacks be a bit less angry. A tolerably free non-racial democracy at 
the foot of Africa could emerge to match Eastern Europe's experiences in 
freedom.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A construction crew accidentally damaged three underground telephone cables 
Monday afternoon in El Cajon, disrupting service for several hours to as many 
as 60,000 East County Pacific Bell customers, a telephone company spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Tom McNaghten said customers in El Cajon, Lakeside, Santee, Alpine 
and Pine Valley were affected when one cable was severed and two others damaged 
by a private construction crew digging in the 1100 block of Murray Drive, 
across from Grossmont High School. 
</P>
<P>
Callers from outside the area were unable to get through, while callers in the 
East County communities were likewise unable to place long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
Local calls made in a community -- within El Cajon, for example -- were able to 
get through, though calls placed between communities -- such as from Santee to 
El Cajon -- in many instances were not, McNaghten said. 
</P>
<P>
The cables were damaged at 12:50 p.m., and partial service was restored to most 
areas by 6:30 p.m. The telephone company expected to have full service restored 
to all areas by 8 a.m. today, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Calls to emergency 911 numbers were not disturbed. A spokeswoman for the El 
Cajon Police Department said some 911 calls were delayed slightly, though 
response was not a major problem.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
BAD IDEA: PARAMEDIC 'USER FEE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's understandable but unfortunate that the Orange County Board of Supervisors 
has decided to start charging people for emergency paramedic services. Such 
"user fees" have become popular with local governments since the tax-cutting 
Proposition 13 was approved nearly 12 years ago, but that doesn't make them 
right. Lifesaving services -- such as paramedic responses -- should be included 
as a part of the basic services paid for under general taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The new paramedic charges are part of a County Fire Department restructuring 
plan that would raise $4.2 million a year through "user fees" on a wide range 
of department services. Before the proposal goes into effect, the county board 
and each of the 13 cities that contract with the county for fire services need 
to approve it. The cities are Cypress, Dana Point, Irvine, La Palma, Los 
Alamitos, Mission Viejo, Placentia, San Juan Capistrano, Seal Beach, Stanton, 
Tustin, Villa Park and Yorba Linda. Five cities that have their own fire 
departments -- Huntington Beach, Santa Ana, Orange, Anaheim and Fullerton -- 
already charge similar fees for paramedic services. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal approved by the Board of Supervisors represents a compromise with 
Leisure World in Laguna Hills, where elderly residents are understandably 
concerned about having emergency medical services readily available. The plan 
approved by the board requires that the Fire Department develop a fee schedule 
that takes into consideration discounts for senior citizens as well as the 
user's ability to pay. A plan to allow whole communities to subscribe to 
paramedic services will also be studied. 
</P>
<P>
While it is true that paramedic services represent an expansion in the 
traditional services provided by fire departments, it would be better for local 
governments to find other ways to pay for them. The mere existence of such fees 
is an added worry for low-income or fixed-income people, particularly the 
elderly.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SANTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santee man who pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and possess 
methamphetamine was sentenced Monday to 20 years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Sweeney, 31, was one of 91 defendants charged in the "Operation 
Crankcase" sting, in which undercover agents operated out of the Tripleneck 
Scientific chemical store. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney's attorney, Charles Adair, said his client entered into secretly taped 
discussions about methamphetamine production with undercover agents. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney distributed methamphetamine on at least four occasions in 1988 and 
1989, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Adair had recommended the minimum sentence of 10 years, and the prosecutor had 
suggested a 20-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney's sentence, imposed by U.S. District Judge Howard Turrentine, is one of 
the longest given in the case, but one defendant received a 26-year sentence. 
Most of the defendants have pleaded guilty.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: FOR WILKERSON, THIS VICTORY BIGGEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Wilkerson, Grossmont Community College's men's basketball coach, called 
Saturday's 81-77 victory over Imperial Valley the Griffins' biggest in the 
regular season in his nine years at the El Cajon school. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Valley, the home team, had been unbeaten and ranked No. 1 in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a couple of outstanding teams here, one that was 28-4 and another 
24-6," Wilkerson said, "but I don't know that I've ever beaten a No. 1 
undefeated team before. That was pretty big. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their crowd (2,000-plus in standing room only) always brings out the 
best in us. They have big crowds, and it's an exciting atmosphere down there." 
</P>
<P>
The Arabs, which fell to 27-1, 8-1 in the Pacific Coast Conference, had been 
ranked No. 1 in the state for four weeks. Grossmont improved to 17-12, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont never trailed, led by as many as 17 and survived two late runs by 
Imperial Valley. Tony James had 20 points and nine rebounds, Brian Sims 11 
points and 15 rebounds and Rafid Kiti 11 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Kiti is playing this year after missing the last part of last season at 
Valhalla with a punctured lung. 
</P>
<P>
"That has healed totally," Wilkerson said. "It was a problem at birth where he 
had a hole in his lung. (Surgeons) went in there and actually sewed it up. It 
is not a problem now." 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Valley's Keith Balzer, the leading scorer in the PCC, had 27 points. 
The Arabs, however, were without their second leading scorer, Phil Clark, who 
had flown to Georgia for his mother's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
A former U.S. International University women's golfer was voted the European 
Ladies Professional Golfer's Assn. rookie of the year for the second 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Alfredsson, of Gothenburg, Sweden, won the award for the 1989 season. 
Laurette Maritz, of Johannesburg, South Africa, won in '88. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredsson was a second-team All-American in 1987, her junior year at USIU. 
Maritz is the only women's golfer in NCAA history to earn first-team 
All-American honors four times. She was also the 1987 NCAA player of the year 
as voted on by the National Golf Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State's baseball team has had just six no-hitters in its 52 years. On 
Friday, Rick Navarro had one going before being relieved in the seventh inning 
of a 11-4 victory over The Master's College Friday. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU was leading, 11-0, at the time, but Coach Jim Dietz said it was too early 
in the season for him to go the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro, a graduate of Helix High, pitched a no-hitter against Grossmont High 
his senior season during which he finished the year 14-0 with a 1.21 earned run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
He was 1-0 with two saves and a 2.12 earned run average as a freshman in 1989 
meaning he has not lost a game since his junior year in high school -- or three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU will play Spain's national team in an exhibition game at 5 tonight at 
Smith Field. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego will be playing on a new baseball field when it opens its season 
at 2 this afternoon against Christ College Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The old field, about 500 yards away, is now the site of the new medical center 
being built at UCSD. Part of the arrangement for building the hospital was that 
the Tritons would get a new field.

Revenue totaled $4.7 billion, down 5%. The oil drilling and oil field service 
company attributed results to the previous year's $1.2-billion stock buyback, 
which reduced interest income in 1989 by $63 million. However, higher oil 
prices in late 1989 helped its oil field businesses recover from a slump in 
1988.

TAKEOVER ISN'T A BITTER PILL TO BIOTECH INDUSTRY; 
</P>
<P>
BIOTECHNOLOGY: SWISS ACQUISITION OF KEY COMPANY GAINS MOSTLY FAVORABLE RESPONSE 
FROM SAN DIEGO FIRMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Local biotechnology executives reacted favorably Monday to Swiss-based Roche 
Holding's $2.1-billion acquisition of a 60% interest in Genentech as the 
industry began to sort out the implications of the landmark deal announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Having found themselves in similar financial straits at one point or other in 
their careers, most of the executives sympathized with Genentech's decision to 
sacrifice its independence to accept nearly $500 million in badly needed 
capital from Roche to continue its product development. 
</P>
<P>
Given the short-term focus of U.S. capital markets that increasingly turn their 
backs on biotechnology companies, it is not surprising that a foreign company 
is providing the capital to Genentech, the executives said. Several of the 
local executives said their companies have already sold sizable equity slices 
to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
"We have all been talking about it for years -- Wall Street's focus on 
quarter-to-quarter progress makes it difficult to manage a company for 
long-term success," said Andrew Barnes, executive vice president of Mycogen, a 
manufacturer of biopesticides. "We face the same problem as Genentech, though 
not on that scale: how to balance making investments for the future with how it 
will effect quarter-to-quarter performance." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mycogen decided it could best strike that balance by selling a 14% 
interest in the company to a Japanese company, Kubota Ltd., for $10 million. 
The price Kubota paid was a 15% premium over what Mycogen's stock was selling 
for at the time of the investment, Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Respess, vice president and general counsel of Ligand Pharmaceuticals of 
San Diego said Monday that "the Japanese and the well-heeled Europeans are 
ready to step in" when U.S. biotechnology companies "come up against the wall." 
A significant portion of the $9.6 million in venture capital that Ligand has 
raised to date has come from French and United Kingdom investors, Respess said. 
</P>
<P>
All those contacted conceded that the Genentech deal has major implications for 
biotechnology in general because of the South San Francisco-based company's 
status as a well-established biotechnology firm. 
</P>
<P>
One outstanding feature is the price being paid by Roche, the parent of F. 
Hoffman-La Roche. In exchange for the nearly $500 million in cash, Roche will 
receive 22 million newly issued Genentech shares. In addition, Roche will buy 
half of the company's outstanding shares for $36 each, a 65% premium over the 
stock's closing price the day before the deal was announced. Until 1995, Roche 
has options of buying the rest of the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal is very positive from the standpoint that it sets a very high value 
on the importance of the technology and products that are being developed by 
the industry as a whole," said David Hale, chief executive at Gensia 
Pharmaceuticals of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Howard (Ted) Greene, partner in Biovest, a venture capital firm that is lead 
investor in half a dozen San Diego biotechnology companies, said the deal fits 
an emerging pattern of giant pharmaceutical companies buying smaller 
technology-driven companies so as to keep the pipeline of new drug products 
flowing. 
</P>
<P>
And Roche is "in the category of companies with enormous marketing presence 
worldwide but with some pipeline problems in technology," Greene said. Roche, 
whose best-known products are Valium and Librium, is in need of new products, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many companies in San Diego, which is the nation's fifth-largest biotechnology 
hub in terms of companies (72) sixth-largest in employees (3,500), looked to 
Genentech as an industry bellwether. The company's patents are considered the 
strongest and most sweeping in the industry and it has introduced and marketed 
two highly successful products, an anti-clotting drug called Activase and a 
human growth hormone called Protropin. 
</P>
<P>
But very few of the executives expressed any reservations about a foreign owner 
gaining control of what many decribed as the nation's premier biotechnology 
company. Greene insisted that the United States is not in danger of losing its 
technological patrimony. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any difference in having corporate headquarters in Basel, 
Switzerland, or Indianapolis," Greene said. "One thing that is very clear as we 
near the end of 20th Century is that the world is becoming global and that 
boundaries are becoming meaningless." 
</P>
<P>
Greene disputed the contention that the United States is losing a national 
resource by virtue of the Genentech buyout. "Keep in mind that Roche is buying 
assets that go out the door every evening. Genentech's primary asset is its 
intellectual capital," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
Hale took a somewhat more pessimistic view. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people in the biotech industry felt that Genentech had a very significant 
opportunity to grow up and become an independent U.S. pharmaceutical company, 
the first one since (the founding of) Syntex" more than two decades ago, Hale 
said. "Now that opportunity is gone, and I don't think that's good." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Crooke, chief executive of ISIS Pharmaceuticals in Carlsbad, conceded 
that the deal means "we are losing a piece of Americana" but said the deal, 
overall, is a positive one for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It says that a company can begin and proceed along a course that's well 
charted, and that at the end of it there are solutions that are positive," 
Crooke said. "This will provide the stability (Genentech) needs to expand its 
pharmaceutical base without worrying day to day about the stock price."

SON OF AMWEST'S CHAIRMAN IS APPOINTED NEW PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amwest Insurance Group, ending any speculation about who will eventually 
succeed its 70-year-old chairman, Richard H. Savage, replaced its president and 
chief operating officer with Savage's son, John E. Savage. 
</P>
<P>
John Savage, 37, replaced Gary R. Peterson, 55, who had been Amwest's president 
since 1984. Peterson is now executive vice president overseeing Amwest's 
marketing efforts and branch offices, and he remains president of Amwest 
Surety, one of the company's main subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
John Savage's new role includes, among other things, overseeing Amwest's 
underwriting business. Amwest also gave its chief financial officer, Robert C. 
Goodell, the added position of executive vice president in charge of finance, 
claims, data processing, training and other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Savage said in an interview that Peterson had not been demoted, noting 
that it had long been planned that his son would one day run the business. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not being eased out," Savage said of Peterson, adding that Peterson's 
salary would not change. (Peterson said his salary is about $164,000 a year. 
His cash compensation, including salary and bonuses, totaled $206,000 in 1988, 
according to the most recent proxy statement.) 
</P>
<P>
The Savages and certain board members began discussing the changes three months 
ago, and "the more we talked the more we decided it would be a good time to 
start on this program at the beginning of this year," Richard Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said he was not surprised at the change, "which obviously is to get 
John Savage, who is the owner's son, from a lesser position to running the 
company. This is as good a time as any." Peterson said he planned to stay at 
Amwest. 
</P>
<P>
Although a publicly held concern, Amwest in many ways is a Savage operation. 
Richard Savage, a former narcotics police officer and bail-bond salesman who 
organized Amwest in 1970, and his family still owns about 40% of Amwest's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Amwest sells bail bonds and other so-called surety bonds, which guarantee the 
performance of the policyholder, such as a building contractor, to a third 
party. If the policyholder does not fulfill its obligations, Amwest has to step 
in and make good on the bond's amount. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the 1980s, Amwest could do little wrong financially. Its profit and 
revenue climbed steadily each year, and in 1988 it earned $3.6 million on 
revenue of $25.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
But 1989 did not go Amwest's way. Some disputed claims and the uncertainty of 
Proposition 103, the insurance rate-cutting initiative that has forced Amwest 
to set aside cash in case it has to pay rebates, cut its profit for the first 
nine months of last year by 16%. And in the fourth quarter, Amwest estimated 
that it lost between $750,000 and $1 million, which will leave a full-year 
profit of between $1.3 million and $1.6 million -- less than half what it 
earned the previous year. Its actual 1989 results have not yet been released. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Savage said the rocky year did not contribute to Peterson's removal as 
president. "Peterson didn't do a bad job in 1989," he said.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: AUDIOTRONICS CORP. SEEKS CHAPTER 11 PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Audiotronics Corp., a North Hollywood maker of audiovisual products for 
classrooms, said Monday it has filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
Under Chapter 11, a company is shielded from creditors' lawsuits while it works 
out a plan to pay its bills. 
</P>
<P>
Audiotronics said it has hired Kenneth C. Cleveland &amp; Associates to help it 
develop a reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
Audiotronics said late product deliveries, parts shortages and new-product 
delays left it with a severe cash-flow shortage that forced the company to miss 
a debt payment and seek protection from the bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said its stock and debentures, a type of debt, will no longer 
trade on the American Stock Exchange. The stock closed Monday at 31 cents a 
share; it reached a record high $11.50 a share in November, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In its fiscal year that ended last June 30, Audiotronics lost $1.53 million on 
sales of $6.15 million.

Amgen and Swiss pharmaceutical giant F. Hoffmann-LaRoche &amp; Co. have filed 
for approval in the United Kingdom to sell a new biotechnology drug that 
produces white blood cells that help alleviate anemia in cancer patients who 
are undergoing chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, has developed a drug called G-CSF that has shown 
considerable promise in human clinical trials. The company has already filed an 
application to market the same drug in the United States, but Food and Drug 
Administration approval isn't expect to be forthcoming for at least 18 months. 
Amgen is one of several companies that is developing biotechnology-engineered 
drugs that trigger production of white blood cells.

ART BUCHWALD: IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF GETTING THE FAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most important new word in the English language is "fax." It is a method of 
sending paper by telephone. For example, if I want to shoot you a clipping from 
this newspaper, I put it into my fax machine and it is transmitted to your fax 
machine in seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Because the United States shuffles more paper than any other country on the 
planet, the fax machine has changed the way we deal with problems. 
</P>
<P>
This is all you hear in offices these days: "Will you fax me that report? . . . 
I'll fax you my objections and then you fax everything to the client in San 
Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with faxing papers is that people judge how hard you are working by 
the amount of faxing you do. In most offices, those who only fax every hour are 
thought to be less productive than those who fax every 15 minutes. John 
O'Connor is one of the great faxers of Washington. He has a fax in the office, 
one at home and one in his car. During his lunch hour he thinks nothing of 
faxing the U.S. budget to a friend in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
"You were an early faxer before it became popular. Does it discourage you that 
everybody is doing it now?" I asked him. 
</P>
<P>
"The more the merrier," he replied. "Don't forget, it takes two to fax. Excuse 
me, I have to fax an anniversary card to my wife." 
</P>
<P>
"Does she mind getting her anniversary greetings by fax machine?" 
</P>
<P>
"Why should she? It's on her desk right away." 
</P>
<P>
"Is there a knack to faxing?" 
</P>
<P>
"Like everything else, there are good faxers and bad ones. A good faxer knows 
exactly how to insert the paper so that the print comes out nice and clean at 
the other end. Some people are born faxers -- lawyers, for example. They can 
service two clients on two different telephone lines at the same time, and 
charge them both the full fee. Doctors are starting to fax throat cultures to 
each other, and people are even sending love letters on the machine." 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" 
</P>
<P>
"When you're in love you want the whole Bell system to know it." 
</P>
<P>
"Do some people in your office fax more than others?" 
</P>
<P>
"Damn right they do, and it's costing us a bundle. There is a guy here who 
faxes all the baseball scores to his bookie in Las Vegas. We have a woman who 
transmits Ann Landers' column to everyone in her aerobics class. We're looking 
at an electronic revolution that will change our lives. Today we're faxing 
paper -- someday we could be faxing people." 
</P>
<P>
"You mean we'll be sending people by telephone?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's well within the realm of possibility. The world is getting smaller thanks 
to the fax machine. First we communicated by Morse code, then by voice and now 
paper. Tomorrow we may place our kids in fax machines and send them to camp." 
</P>
<P>
All the time O'Connor was talking to me he was inserting memoranda into one 
machine and ripping off messages from the other one. 
</P>
<P>
"The trick," he said, "is to fax more outgoing material than you take in." 
</P>
<P>
"How do you do that?" I wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"Fax everybody. My greatest moment as a faxer was when I sent an entire 
manuscript to a publisher I had never met. I tied up his line for nine hours 
because there was no way he could turn his machine off."

ERMA BOMBECK: SNIFFLE'S PLACE IS IN THE HOME

I have never understood the dynamics of a cold. We all know it carries with it 
chills, fever, nausea, a runny nose, coughing and headache, not to mention the 
ability to spread germs. But it carries another side effect that is rarely 
mentioned: A cold makes you social. 
</P>
<P>
I've seen recluses who have not been out of their homes in 10 years. The moment 
they get a cold, the first thing they do is to drag themselves out of bed, get 
dressed and go to a crowded theater. 
</P>
<P>
That's why colds are considered the gift that keeps on giving. 
</P>
<P>
At a supermarket the other day, I met a friend hanging over her cart. Her eyes 
were puffy and red, her cheeks were flushed, she dabbed at her nose, and her 
voice was barely audible through parched lips. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you doing here?" I asked. She coughed on my cauliflower. 
</P>
<P>
"If I stayed home, I'd think about dying," she said. "I might as well be on my 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
It seems the most cruel and inhumane advice a doctor can give to a cold 
sufferer is, "Go to bed and drink lots of liquids." 
</P>
<P>
I can just hear her responding: "Let me get this straight. You want me to 
stretch out on a nice warm bed and sleep and watch TV all day and not spread 
germs to the entire city? You quack. I'm getting a second opinion. This is my 
life we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
The tendency to walk a cold to death and to entertain it at parties, concerts, 
lectures and restaurants has to be a part of the disease. Why else would the 
schools be full of children who would skip school if they slept on their hair 
"funny" but not if they had walking pneumonia? 
</P>
<P>
There's an adage, "You can lead a cold to bed, but you can't make it lie down." 
Scientists thought they had found a vaccine that made rabbits develop 
antibodies. Then someone remembered rabbits don't get colds anyway. Our only 
hope is to find a cure for the common cold. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, I'd advise all well people to stay in bed, drink plenty of liquids, 
and let the sickies run the world.

What Kind of Life: The Limits of Medical Progress by Daniel Callahan (Simon and 
Schuster: $19.95; 303 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows he's going to die, but most people don't believe it. Both points 
are sad but true. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, the marvelous successes of medical science in this century have 
fostered the notion that immortality is achievable if not quite within our 
grasp. We believe there is no limit to progress. Antibiotics and organ 
transplants are just the beginning. Heart disease, cancer, stroke, Alzheimer's 
-- all can be overcome if only we will spend enough and think hard enough about 
doing it. 
</P>
<P>
This belief is basically wrong, says Daniel Callahan, one of the country's 
foremost experts on medical ethics and the director of the Hastings Center, 
just north of New York, the think tank that inquires into such issues. 
</P>
<P>
In "What Kind of Life," a sober, bracing and important look at the realities of 
medicine and its costs, Callahan argues that the ideal of unending medical 
treatment and limitless medical progress is both unaffordable and unattainable. 
The quest for immortality is misdirected, unachievable and doomed to expensive 
failure. What's more, he says, it diverts our energy and resources from more 
appropriate social goals. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how far we push the frontiers of medical progress we are always left 
with a ragged edge," Callahan writes, "with poor outcomes, with cases as bad as 
those we have succeeded in curing, with the inexorable decline of the body 
however much we seem to have arrested the process." 
</P>
<P>
Asking medicine to save us from death, he says, is "a recipe for endlessly 
increased expenditures and perpetually needy, dissatisfied people." Callahan 
rightly attributes the out-of-control cost of medical care to our insistence on 
all things for all patients. No procedure is to be spared, no high-tech 
treatment avoided, no stone left unturned in the battle against disease and 
deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
The result, he says, is that "people are saved from one disease only to be put 
in a position to incur the costs of another disease and in general to be led by 
the power of high technology to ever higher levels of desire and aspiration, to 
want cures for each succeeding illness." 
</P>
<P>
We should be more concerned with care, not cure, Callahan argues. There is a 
limit to what medicine can do, and beyond that point we are simply using more 
and more technology to preserve less and less of the quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
The law of diminishing returns has set in with a vengeance, he says. In an era 
of limited resources, the blank check we have written to medicine has distorted 
our spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
We "spend too much on health in comparison with other social needs, too much on 
the old in comparison with the young, too much on the acutely ill in comparison 
with the chronically ill, too much on curing in comparison with caring, too 
much on expensive individual health needs in comparison with less expensive 
social health needs, and too much on extending the length of life rather than 
enhancing the quality of life," Callahan concludes. 
</P>
<P>
This is all well and good as social analysis, but try telling it to an acutely 
ill person in a hospital, or to his family. 
</P>
<P>
Most people would probably agree that we are spending too much on medicine but 
only if you're talking about medical care for other people, not for me. 
</P>
<P>
On average, fully half of a person's lifetime medical expenses occur during the 
last six months of life, but you can never be sure beforehand when those last 
six months begin. We all know of people who made remarkable recoveries from 
life-threatening illnesses and went on to enjoy many more years of high-quality 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan's solution is to alter somehow our basic thinking about life and death 
and to impose limits on medical treatment -- by political force, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Fat chance. This is the weak part of the book. Hasn't he noticed that it is 
politically impossible to get anybody to give up anything? That's why the 
federal deficit cannot be controlled. That's why the only stumble that Ronald 
Reagan made in the first term of his presidency was the suggestion that Social 
Security benefits might be reduced. And that was talk about reducing money. 
Callahan wants to put limits on something much more fundamental. 
</P>
<P>
The argument he makes is undeniably true, and perhaps people will one day come 
face to face with the fact that we simply cannot afford all the medicine that 
we demand. But it is unlikely that we will be satisfied with less or that we 
will have the political will to impose it. 
</P>
<P>
Like many people in many fields, Callahan is an expert on the problem, not on 
the solution.

REDUCING NICOTINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I see where one of the leading cigarette companies is coming out with 
a cigarette that has practically no nicotine, just the way decaffeinated coffee 
has no caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
Do you see anything wrong from a health standpoint with these cigarettes? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I think it's very revealing that the cigarette company emphasizes the 
low level of nicotine in its product, but says nothing about the level of tar. 
Tar is a major cause of lung cancer and heart disease. Presenting 
"de-nicotined" cigarettes as a safe alternative to regular cigarettes may be a 
good advertising ploy, but it's not honest. 
</P>

KID BEAT: SHARON, LOIS AND BRAM: FUN FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Young kids love Sharon, Lois and Bram. The Canadian trio was a big hit at the 
Wiltern Theatre Sunday, and the festivities continue at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center tonight . 
</P>
<P>
But enough about the kids. What about the parents who have to pay for and sit 
through the concerts? 
</P>
<P>
No problem. Sharon, Lois and Bram are fun for the grown-ups too. 
</P>
<P>
In concert, the trio -- perhaps best known as the stars of "The Elephant Show" 
on cable TV's Nickelodeon -- offers the contrasts that simply come from being a 
trio, as opposed to the male solo acts that dominate the major leagues of the 
children's concert circuit. This group doesn't just sing, it harmonizes. 
</P>
<P>
Bram's low-key wit keeps the parents amused. Sharon and Lois are perky but 
never precious. And if the women begin to seem interchangeable, they've 
eliminated the confusion in concert by wearing sweaters bearing their initials 
-- and explaining that short-haired Sharon's initial also stands for "short" 
and long-haired Lois' initial also stands for "long," while bald and bearded 
Bram's initial also stands for . . . "beard." 
</P>
<P>
Details like this mean a lot in a children's concert. 
</P>
<P>
The musical arrangements in concert are not quite as rich and sophisticated as 
on the group's recordings, but the five-piece band is composed of pros, and the 
variety of musical sources remains admirably eclectic. 
</P>
<P>
The group gets the audience moving without putting any particular child on the 
spot, and they insert a plug for UNICEF as well as one for their TV show. While 
the kids in the back may not be able to see what's happening very well, those 
farther up in the hall will get a kick out of seeing these charming electronic 
images spring to life. 
</P>
<P>
 At Orange County Performing Arts Center, Costa Mesa, tonight at 7. Tickets: 
$8-11; (714) 740-2000 or (213) 480-3232.

Warner Bros.' "Driving Miss Daisy," a multiple winner at the recent Golden 
Globe Awards, continued to lead the national box office chart during its second 
weekend in wide release. 
</P>
<P>
The story about the relationship between an elderly Jewish matron and her 
Atlanta chauffeur took in $6 million in ticket sales to bring its total 
receipts to nearly $22 million. Walt Disney Studios' "Stella," starring Bette 
Midler in a remake of the sudsy "Stella Dallas," withstood a tidal wave of 
negative reviews to grab the No. 2 spot with opening weekend ticket sales of 
$4.3 million. In fifth place was Paramount's just-released "Flashback," which 
had ticket sales of $2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Warner Bros.' "Men Don't Leave," starring Jessica Lange as the recently 
widowed mother of two sons, opened at three theaters with ticket sales of 
$62,419.

Missing Anchors Resign: Two Waco, Tex., television news anchors who were 
reported missing last week and then turned up together in New Mexico have 
resigned from the television station KWTX-TV. 
</P>
<P>
The anchors, Wendy Sheldon and Mike Reeder, gave notice Friday during their 
first meeting with station executives since they left in January, said Virgil 
Teter, the station's vice president for news. Police began looking for Reeder, 
a weekend anchor, when a company car he checked out Jan. 26 was found abandoned 
at a nearby medical center. The two anchors were found at an Albuquerque, N.M., 
hotel the following Monday. BETH KLEID

Good Evening From Moscow: More than 30 U.S. public television stations will 
broadcast "Vremya," a state-run Soviet news show along with an English 
translation, for a two-week test period beginning Feb. 12. KCET Channel 28 
spokesman Greg Krizman said the station will offer the half-hour program 
Mondays through Thursdays at midnight and Fridays at 5:30 p.m. Three other 
stations in California, including KOCE in Huntington Beach and KQEC in San 
Francisco, will broadcast the program. Stations are trying to line up 
underwriters for "Vremya," which could cost $1 million a year, according to 
Alan Foster, news director of WGBH in Boston. BETH KLEID

AKIYOSHI BAND LIVES UP TO 'SOUNDS OF GENIUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presentation of the Toshiko Akiyoshi Orchestra at Ambassador Auditorium in 
Pasadena was part of the "Sounds of Genius Series." Genius is a term tossed 
around too often by hucksters, but if ever it was merited, this unique 
composer-arranger-pianist-bandleader deserves it. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the band she co-led in Los Angeles from 1973-82 with the tenor 
saxophonist and flutist Lew Tabackin was never invited to the Ambassador. 
Thursday's concert, their first ever in this acoustically splendid hall, was 
given by the orchestra she and Tabackin formed in New York after moving back 
East seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Both orchestras were the creatures of Akiyoshi's intensely fertile mind. More 
than any other writer in modern times except Gil Evans, she has been a 
wellspring of melodic invention, of textural colors that far transcend the 
simple brass-reeds-rhythm patterns of the traditional big band. 
</P>
<P>
In "Blue Dream," one of two consecutive works that made the 5/4 meter seem as 
natural as a heartbeat, she juxtaposed Tabackin's flute with low, contrasting 
brass sonorities. Her own sublime piano solo on "Remembering Bud" (dedicated to 
the late Bud Powell) led to a passage in which five flutes were backed by 
trombones and muted trumpets. The changes of color, tempo, meter and dynamics 
within the body of a given piece were handled with superb finesse by this 
incomparable ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Tabackin as always is the principal soloist, surely the premier tenor 
saxophonist and arguably the finest flutist on today's jazz scene. Among the 
other soloists, Scott Robinson and Jim Snidero on baritone and alto saxes were 
the best of an adventurous bunch. 
</P>
<P>
From the opening "Strive for Jive" (built on a basic "I Got Rhythm" line) 
through the complexities of "Feast in Milano" to the familiar shuffle blues 
played as an encore, Akiyoshi paid as much attention to diversification as to 
the act of creation. That she is able to keep this orchestra together only for 
two or three months a year seems almost criminal at a time when mediocrity on a 
mass scale rules the airwaves and the rock concert halls. LEONARD FEATHER

GERALD WILSON'S HOMAGE TO BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday evening at the Wadsworth Theater, Gerald Wilson offered his homage to 
Black History Month in the form of a program saluting great black jazz 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
As has long been his custom, he began by taking the 18-man ensemble through an 
extended workout on a blues, affording solo opportunities to, among others, 
George Bohanon on trombone, to his own talented son Anthony Wilson on guitar, 
and to the young ex-Basie alto sax virtuoso Danny House. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the tributes: to John Coltrane ("Equinox," a lesser Coltrane opus 
that succeeded only because Wilson's arrangement made it happen); Miles Davis' 
"Milestones," graced by another buoyant young alto star, Scott Mayo. By the 
time Carl Randall had completed his somewhat routine treatment of Ellington's 
"Sophisticated Lady," you wondered whether Gerald Wilson had forgotten that he 
himself is a great black composer who deserved a share of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, he moved immediately into his captivating "Blues for Yna Yna," the 
perennial band theme that has still not lost its luster, and from there shifted 
into high gear with a work characteristic of Wilson's long love affair with the 
corrida. "Carlos," dedicated to the matador Carlos Arruza, found the 
multi-textured Wilson sound in full glory, with the vivid trumpet of Oscar 
Brashear as its centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who appears Friday-Saturday at Maria's Memory Lane in Los Angeles, was 
preceded by a set by Michael Wolff. Now leading the band on the Arsenio Hall 
Show, Wolff, a one-time Cannonball Adderley pianist (as is his drummer, Roy 
McCurdy), turned out to be not only a fluent mainstream-bop pianist but also a 
comedian whose routines included a blues satire, black and Jewish jokes, and a 
hilarious put-down of New Age ("Yuppie Muzak") complete with an imitation of 
George Winston. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff may not yet be the Victor Borge of jazz, but since he's young enough to 
be Borge's grandson he may well develop along those lines. The supple bassist 
John B. Williams completed Wolff's trio, playing upright bass except for one 
electric interlude. LEONARD FEATHER

'DISGUISES': BATTLEFIELD GAMES NATIONS PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Disguises of War," airing tonight at 8 on Channels 28 and 15 and at 9 on 
Channel 50, offers an absorbing look at the never-ending shadow games that 
countries play. This "Nova" episode could also have been titled "How to Win 
Wars by Fooling the Other Guy." 
</P>
<P>
A technique probably as old as organized warfare (see index under "Horse, 
Trojan"), "Disguises" examines the modern methods of camouflage and battlefield 
deceit. 
</P>
<P>
As practiced by the armed forces of the world, the art and science of deception 
takes many forms, ranging from simple camouflage to complex systems to make 
even a bomber or submarine undetectable. 
</P>
<P>
Through a series of interviews mixed with war footage and some excellent 
graphics, "Disguises" explicates the workings of devices ranging from simple 
two-dimensional plane cutouts parked on airfield runways to the elaborate -- 
and enormously expensive -- B-2 Stealth bomber. Both sides of this deadly game 
are covered -- hiding your own troops and equipment and finding the enemy's. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best material comes from the World War II archives. The Germans, 
for example, constructed a 60,000-acre roof painted with patterns of streets 
and buildings over the industrial harbor of Hamburg to trick Allied bombers. 
Not to be outdone, Lockheed had Disney Studios construct an entire tract of 
fake suburban houses on top of its Burbank aircraft facility. 
</P>
<P>
The segment on the B-2 Stealth program is very timely; Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney is considering cuts in the budget for the futuristic bomber. "Disguises" 
shows how the offensive nature of the plane may doom it in an era when the 
Soviet bloc is crumbling. In contrast, the F-117 fighter -- another plane that 
can elude radar detection -- may be a success because of its flexibility in 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
"Disguises of War" drags a little bit during some of the interviews, but on the 
whole continues "Nova's" fine tradition of rendering clear subjects that are 
not easily explained or understood.

RADU LUPU IN PIANO RECITAL AT CHANDLER PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From pianists in recital, sometimes what you see is what you get. Demonstrative 
types often produce music as colorful as the music maker looks. Conversely, 
quiet and introspective pianists may achieve results as spiritual as their 
visual image. 
</P>
<P>
With Radu Lupu, who returned to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Sunday night with 
a program of music by Bach, Schumann and Liszt, a certain distancing in his 
physical presentation is exactly mirrored in his musical one. 
</P>
<P>
What you don't see, you don't get. 
</P>
<P>
For all his superior and elegant accomplishment, the 44-year-old Romanian 
musician remains a pianist who does not connect with his audience -- and 
appears to want it that way. 
</P>
<P>
He seems to play for himself alone, and to very high, self-set standards. But, 
Sunday at least, when his latest local recital -- he has been appearing here 
for the better part of two decades -- drew a large and vociferously 
appreciative audience to the Pavilion, he communicated not a lot more than 
tremendous self-absorption. 
</P>
<P>
For many listeners, that is enough: They hear the music, and appreciate being 
allowed to watch the performer commune with himself. For others, those who see 
musical performance as a two-way thoroughfare, it is much too little. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the evening, after a very impressive run-through of Liszt's 
B-minor Sonata, Lupu did mesmerize the serious observer with an exquisite 
encore: the slow movement from Schubert's Sonata in A, Opus 120. This exquisite 
performance, in moments so inward-looking it almost became inaudible, 
reinstated one's admiration for Lupu's pianism. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, that admiration flagged. 
</P>
<P>
Bach's "Italian" Concerto became an occasion of rectitude, not joy, a thinking 
person's walk through a pleasant place. Beauties of linearity raised the middle 
movement above mere pedestrianism -- Lupu conjured up a thread of thought which 
extended from beginning to end in the familiar piece -- but the outer movements 
had a stubborn objectivity that nearly denied their true feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Schumann's "Kreisleriana," a work so personal it sometimes seems to change its 
facets from day to day, showed Lupu in his most inward mode: the poet deep in 
meditation. 
</P>
<P>
This approach, if bolstered by a huge palette of pianistic touches and a wide 
spectrum of soft-playing, can work. But Lupu's command of dynamics is 
endangered by a lack of variety and by an energy which seems to evaporate below 
mezzo-piano. No wonder a lot of coughers took this opportunity to compete with 
the sounds on the Pavilion stage. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Liszt Sonata, battleground of warring emotions and the scene of 
uninhibited passions, turned, in Lupu's hands, into a survey of contrasts 
accomplished from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
At no point did the pianist seem to be participating in the musical scenario; 
he appeared to play the piece without bringing himself into it. This produced 
an unexpected dichotomy: He played it in a shorter time than some do, yet made 
it seem longer. Without feelings -- true and shared and expressed -- the world 
can seem gray. DANIEL CARIAGA

RETAIL ROBOTS NO DUMMIES -- BUT CAN THEY SELL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He's sophisticated-looking and well-spoken. She's a glamorous brunette. Put 
them in a room together, and you can see the electricity at work. 
</P>
<P>
But the only one they are supposed to seduce is the American consumer. The two 
are androids -- computerized mannequins designed to look, gesture and "talk" 
like real people -- and the plan is to use them to grab attention and provide 
information at stores, museums, conference halls and trade shows. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, several firms have gotten into the business of supplying computerized 
mannequins and other types of portable robots for retail displays and 
educational exhibits, and chains such as Nordstrom and Dayton-Hudson have tried 
them. But for all of the entrepreneurs' optimism, it's still a tough sell to 
retailers. Many would-be buyers aren't sure what animated mannequins do or what 
purpose they serve. 
</P>
<P>
One retailer who recently witnessed an android demonstration found the concept 
promising but "a little spooky." 
</P>
<P>
"Inside a store, you'd rather have a warm body, a live person, rather than a 
robot," said the retailer, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Still, android entrepreneurs take heart from the success of similar creations. 
Theme parks for years have operated sophisticated, permanently installed 
android displays costing hundreds of thousands or more to capture the 
imagination of children and other visitors. One leading example: the replica of 
Abe Lincoln at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping malls, for their part, have long used simple mechanical Santa Clauses 
and miniature characters to greet and entertain customers at Christmastime. 
What the new breed of android makers is trying to do is "fill that wide, wide 
gap between something that uses just a single limb . . . and something that 
costs $200,000 to $400,000," said Richard Gilbert, general manager of Steren 
Robotics, a San Diego firm that has made computerized mannequins. 
</P>
<P>
The quality, cost and capabilities of the middle-market androids vary widely. 
Gilbert's firm sells mannequins for retail displays priced at $3,100 that move 
their heads, torsos and arms, but offer no audio. Like other manufacturers, the 
firm also makes more expensive customized robots. 
</P>
<P>
Newly formed Mannetron Productions of Glendale is marketing a more advanced 
off-the-shelf system for $26,000, whose basic components are a male mannequin, 
a female mannequin and the personal computer that runs them. 
</P>
<P>
Flip a switch, and the Mannetron mannequins can shift their eyes and nod their 
heads. Their lips move in sync with audio recordings that blare over a speaker. 
On top of all that is a video option that allows the mannequins to turn toward 
a television screen and banter news anchorperson-style with "correspondents." 
</P>
<P>
Sally Industries of Jacksonville, Fla., a leading maker of animated characters 
for theme parks, recently has focused more attention on robots for stores and 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
Howard W. Kelley, the company's president, said retailing robots account for a 
small but growing share -- perhaps 15% to 20% -- of the estimated $15 million 
to $20 million spent worldwide every year on displays featuring robot 
characters. He believes that demand will be strongest for robots that entertain 
customers as retailers increasingly look for innovative ways to bring in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Among Sally's creations is a singing Maurice Chevalier robot made for a 
shopping center in northern England. 
</P>
<P>
Other manufacturers are stressing the virtues of ordinary-looking electronic 
dummies. At trade shows, they are less threatening than some real-life 
salespeople, said Dru Alan Jeanis, a part-owner of Mannetron Productions. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors, he said, know that a mannequin "isn't going to twist their arm and 
say, 'sign on the dotted line.' " 
</P>
<P>
In stores, talking mannequins could recite descriptions of products and perhaps 
hand out free samples of grocery items. It would, enthusiasts say, cut down on 
labor costs and attract more attention from customers at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had them say, 'Look at these tomatoes, they're wonderful, they're 
organically grown,' that would certainly catch a customer's eye," said Sandy 
Gooch, founder and marketing director for the Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods 
Markets chain. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, though, Gooch said she isn't ready to put robots in her produce 
sections. "We're a people business," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Gooch's chain is considering buying a robotic mannequin for window 
displays to help create a special mood for its stores. 
</P>
<P>
Industry executives concede that a number of technological, social and economic 
factors limit how far retailing robots can go. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, don't expect to see an army of of mobile robots wandering around 
stores any time soon. Robots that walk -- or, more accurately, roll -- are hard 
to power and control. Worse yet, they tend to frighten young children and pose 
legal liability issues. 
</P>
<P>
Other advanced robot features, such as refined arm movements, are available, 
but only at great cost. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute you get into sophisticated stuff that doesn't look herky-jerky, the 
price gets out of sight," said David Schweninger, president of Sequoia 
Creative, a maker of theme park attractions that sells android characters for 
up to $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
Many industry officials believe that the cheaper androids retailers will use 
won't impress consumers who are accustomed to the quality of theme park robots. 
Even among people who initially are intrigued by the retail robots, the novelty 
could wear off quickly.

Among the skeptics about the prospects for computerized mannequins is Gerald J. 
Greenwood, executive director of the Western Assn. of Visual Merchandising. 
"For 15 years people have been trying to get it off the ground," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the mannequin companies would like to have something like this as a 
gimmick, but I've never seen a successful one," he added.

Ford May Build Trucks With Mazda: Ford Motor Co. said it is in talks with Mazda 
Motor Corp. to jointly build a new compact pickup truck. A Ford spokesman 
declined to give a specific production time for the vehicle, other than to say 
it would be in the 1990s but added that Ford favored a U.S. production site. 
The trade publication Automotive News, citing Ford planning documents, said the 
new vehicle will debut in the 1995 model year to replace the Ford Ranger.

U.S. VEHICLE SALES DIP 1.5% IN LATE JANUARY

Sales of North American-made cars dropped 6.6% in late January, but strong 
sales of light trucks meant that the overall vehicle sales rate was down only 
1.5%, auto makers reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic truck sales during the Jan. 21-31 period rose 8.1%, spurred by strong 
sales at Chrysler Corp., which offered incentives on its popular minivans. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said its late-January truck sales rose 42.7% from the same time last 
year. For all of January, Chrysler's truck sales were up 39.7% from January, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sales results in the year-earlier period were inflated somewhat by 
heavy fleet sales, a condition analysts said made this year's late January 
figures look relatively encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, a large percentage of January and February car sales go to fleets, 
including auto rental companies and large corporations. But this year, because 
of severe cuts in production last month, fleet deliveries were put off. 
</P>
<P>
"January a year ago was an especially strong fleet sales month for Ford," said 
Robert Rewey, vice president for Ford Motor Co.'s North American Automotive 
Operations. "Due to downtime at a number of our plants in the early part of 
this January, assembly and shipment of many fleet units was delayed." 
</P>
<P>
Given the lack of fleet sales, said analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; 
Co. of New York, the car sales rate fell far less than might be expected. 
</P>
<P>
While car sales in January were weaker than a year earlier, truck sales have 
maintained their strength, mainly because of Chrysler's incentives on minivans, 
which expired at the end of last month. The incentives for other vehicles were 
continued through February.

PRODUCTIVITY POSTS SLUGGISH 0.9% RISE

<P>
American workers' productivity rose just 0.9% last year -- the worst showing 
since the 1981-82 recession -- while hourly labor costs sped upward, the 
government said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the 0.9% increase in non-farm productivity -- defined 
as output per hour of work -- was less than half of the 2% gain recorded in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
While blaming part of last year's poor performance on an overall slowdown in 
economic growth, analysts worried that the combination of weak productivity 
growth and rising labor costs would further weaken America's ability to compete 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a recipe for trouble," said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Boston Co. 
"It's very distressing. . . . It's symptomatic of an economy that is near the 
end of expansion." 
</P>
<P>
The report showed that while productivity was slumping, hourly labor costs -- a 
major inflation measure for businesses -- escalated significantly, jumping 
5.5%, up from the 4.7% rise of 1988 and the biggest increase since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Labor cost increases are probably the scariest part of the report," said David 
Wyss, chief economist at DRI-McGraw Hill. 
</P>
<P>
For the October-through-December quarter, non-farm productivity rose a barely 
perceptible 0.2%, the report said. Hourly labor costs rose at an annual rate of 
6.9% in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Output in the non-farm sector was up 3.3% in 1989, while the number of hours 
worked rose by 2.4%, giving the 0.9% increase in productivity. 
</P>
<P>
The report was certain to revive the debate over America's lagging 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the 1981-82 recession, productivity growth has averaged 1.8% a 
year. While a slight improvement over the 1.2% average growth rate in the 
1970s, it was still far below the 3.3% rate of increase posted in the two 
decades after World War II, when American workers enjoyed healthy wage gains 
and a rising standard of living.

Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons, who launched a $1.1-billion tender offer for 
Georgia Gulf Corp., said he would seek to oust the chemical concern's board. 
</P>
<P>
A Simmons-controlled company, NL Industries Inc., said it intends to seek 
shareholder approval "to remove all the current members" of Georgia Gulf's 
board. 
</P>
<P>
NL Industries of Houston already holds a 9.9% stake in Georgia Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
NL said it intends to solicit the written consents of other Georgia Gulf 
shareholders "in support of the removal of the current directors and the 
election of the NL nominees to the company's board of directors." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Georgia Gulf asked a Delaware court to declare its 
shareholder rights plan -- known as a "poison pill" takeover defense -- valid.

Major Bank Fined for Money Laundering: U.S. District Judge William Hodges 
ordered Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International to forfeit more than $15 
million after pleading guilty to drug money laundering charges in a case with 
links to deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega and Colombian cocaine 
traffickers. Hodges also placed two divisions of the Luxembourg-based bank on 
five years' probation for their role in a $32-million laundering operation. The 
sentence imposed by the judge was in line with a plea bargain deal that BCCI 
reached with federal prosecutors in mid-January to avoid facing a criminal 
trial in Tampa, Fla.

Honda Considers Selling Chryslers: Honda Motor Co. is considering a request by 
Chrysler Corp. to market the American manufacturer's automobiles in Japan, a 
Honda spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Honda spokesman Hitoshi Dewa said Chrysler suggested that the two companies set 
up a joint venture. All other details, including the Chrysler models, number of 
sales and distribution channels in Japan have yet to be completed, Dewa said. 
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest business journal, said Honda will 
concentrate on selling 5,000 to 6,000 Chrysler Jeeps and Cherokees a year 
through one of Honda's three distribution networks in Japan.

LABOR: PRESCRIPTION FOR PHARMACIST SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America is short of pharmacists to properly dispense the more than $70 billion 
in prescription drugs that we take each year, and the serious shortage is 
expected to get worse. 
</P>
<P>
With all of the world's other problems, the need for more pharmacists may seem 
to be minor. But they are a crucial part of our health-care system, and their 
mistakes can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
As the number of the elderly rises, so does the demand for prescription drugs 
and therefore for people to fill them. And we also need increasingly skilled 
pharmacists, as they must deal these days with the complexities of nuclear 
medicine and new drug therapy programs. 
</P>
<P>
Several studies have shown that hundreds of thousands of people are in 
hospitals because of medicines wrongly prescribed by doctors or improperly 
filled by pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
To try to cope with the shortage of pharmacists, drugstores have raised their 
salaries. Boosting the income of the country's 150,000 practicing pharmacists 
is attracting more students to the 74 schools that offer pharmaceutical 
degrees; about 28,000 are enrolled now, compared to 23,000 in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But that enrollment increase isn't enough. While the need for more pharmacists 
increases, a just-concluded study shows that pharmacists entering the 
profession are barely replacing those who are leaving it. 
</P>
<P>
One would think that the salary increases would entice more young people to the 
job. The increases have been significant, especially in Southern California, 
where salaries are the highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
In this area, union pharmacists earned $13.25 an hour in 1980 compared to 
$25.50 today. That's pretty good, considering that their pay hike was nearly 
42% greater than inflation during that period. 
</P>
<P>
It is particularly impressive when compared to the average worker, whose real 
income (after adjusting for inflation) has dropped about 10% since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Also, many pharmacists earn even more because they have to work overtime to 
keep up with the growing demand for prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The extra money that overtime brings is welcomed, but as the hours on the job 
increase, the pharmacists can be overworked to the detriment of their health 
and that could result in a greater chance of error in filling prescriptions. 
These factors, along with the fact that the work can be tedious and 
high-pressured, tend to discourage more people from entering the profession, 
despite the relatively high pay. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmacists are certainly doing better than nurses, however, not only in pay, 
but arguably in working conditions, too. And nurses, who are an integral part 
of the health-care system, are in much shorter supply than pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
Under that old, very inexact theory of supply and demand, nurses, like 
pharmacists, should have been getting nice salary increases to attract more 
people to their essential profession. 
</P>
<P>
The theory isn't working. Nurses' salaries aren't even keeping up with the cost 
of living, which jumped 53.2% during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
More money and better working conditions probably could bring many nurses back 
to the profession and attract new ones, but the problem of getting more 
pharmacists is different. Most are male, although that is changing rapidly, and 
nearly 40% of those now in pharmacy schools are women. 
</P>
<P>
Arguments over what to do about the pharmacist shortage are many and 
increasingly heated. 
</P>
<P>
Some pharmacists think that higher salaries will do the trick, but they don't 
really press the point. 
</P>
<P>
However, they and many others believe that more clerical help and licensed 
pharmacist technicians could ease the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty there is that it takes five to seven years of college to become 
a pharmacist, and extensive use of less well-trained assistants could increase 
the possibilities of error. But that is a risk worth taking. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a trend in pharmaceutical schools to offer only six-year courses 
leading to degrees as doctors of pharmacy. Many in the profession want the 
Pharm.D. degrees to be mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Four-year bachelor of science degrees are now commonplace, but a number of 
pharmacy schools, including all three in California, offer only Pharm.D. 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
If the six-year degrees are mandated, the schools will be able to turn out 
fewer pharmacists. The drugstore chains are fighting that trend because they 
need more pharmacists. 
</P>
<P>
California and Florida have particular problems: They will not grant 
pharmacists licenses to practice until they pass tests given by their own state 
examiners. All other states grant licenses to those who pass a less rigorous 
national exam, and those who pass can practice in any state -- except 
California and Florida. That makes recruiting more difficult for those two 
states. 
</P>
<P>
The supply and demand theory isn't working for nurses, but it is for 
pharmacists. Until the shortage began in recent years, large chain pharmacies 
had little trouble keeping wages and benefits down and replacing those who 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
That has changed, and the future for those in pharmacy looks bright. But to 
ease the shortage, pharmacists at least must have more skilled assistants and 
pharmacy schools must increase their enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the shortage of pharmacists affects everyone who must get a 
prescription, and that means all of us at one time or another. 
</P>
<P>
And don't think that keeping a lid on pharmacists' salaries will hold down the 
price of prescription drugs. Remember that a Congressional hearing held last 
summer showed that drug manufacturers were primarily responsible for the 
soaring prices.

Whittaker Corp. announced Monday that it will sell its specialty chemical 
business to a Chicago firm for $225 million and use the proceeds to reduce 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
The diversified Los Angeles company had previously said it wanted to sell its 
chemical and some other businesses to concentrate on its aerospace and 
biotechnology segments. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the specialty chemical units to Morton International, a chemical 
and manufacturing firm, must receive approval from the Justice Department and 
from the Ministry of Finance in France, where Whittaker has a plant. 
</P>
<P>
Whittaker's specialty chemical operations, which include separate divisions 
that make industrial coatings and adhesives, posted combined revenue of $180 
million for the fiscal year ending Oct. 31, 1989. The chemical businesses 
consist of 13 factories and two research laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Whittaker had originally planned to keep its adhesives division but decided to 
sell that business to reduce more of its debt. 
</P>
<P>
"Selling our adhesives business provides us with the opportunity to make a 
substantial reduction in our outstanding debt, which we consider a priority at 
this time," Joseph F. Alibrandi, Whittaker's chairman, said in a statement 
released by the company. 
</P>
<P>
Whittaker has already sold off numerous businesses, including a batteries and 
metals unit, and plans to shed another half-dozen units, according to a company 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a year ago the company announced a stock buyback and plans to sell 
numerous divisions, apparently in an effort to discourage an unwanted takeover 
bid by a New Jersey investor.

OGILVY GETS PARAMOUNT PICTURES AD ACCOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The scramble for the largest available film studio account in the nation ended 
on Monday when Paramount Pictures handed the bulk of its estimated $60-million 
to $70-million advertising business to the Los Angeles office of Ogilvy &amp; 
Mather. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy's Los Angeles office will split a portion of the business with the giant 
firm's New York office. 
</P>
<P>
"Ogilvy &amp; Mather has an exceptional and enthusiastic team with extensive 
knowledge of the entertainment industry," said Arthur Cohen, president of 
worldwide marketing for the Motion Picture Group of Paramount. "Their marketing 
skills and competitive spirit are unmatched," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
For Ogilvy, the win represents a spectacular return to the film entertainment 
business. About two years ago, Ogilvy lost the Columbia Pictures advertising 
account after handling it for nearly six years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is as big as it gets for an advertising agency," said Gerald D. McGee, 
managing director of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Los Angeles. "If you're an agency in 
this town and you're not in show business, you might as well not be in this 
town." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the windfall, the agency plans no new hires. "We still have a lot of 
people on board from when we had Columbia," said McGee. The agency, which 
creates ads for American Express and Carnation Co., will not actually create 
ads for Paramount. The ads will continue to be mostly developed by Paramount 
and several smaller, speciality agencies it hires to help make movie trailers 
and print ads. 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy will primarily be responsible for purchasing TV and radio broadcast time 
and print ad space for upcoming Paramount films. Ogilvy will also help with 
strategic planning for the marketing of such upcoming Paramount films as "Days 
of Thunder," scheduled for late May release, starring Tom Cruise as a race car 
driver, and "Another 48 Hours," starring Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte, which is 
scheduled for summer release and features the duo banging heads with an Aryan 
motorcycle group. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, which released 14 pictures in 1989, says it expects to release 18 
films in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The agency that formerly purchased Paramount's advertising time said Ogilvy has 
plenty of work ahead. "I think they're a fantastic agency, but they'll have 
their hands full," said James D. Helin, managing director of the Los Angeles 
office of D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles. "It's a load of a responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy employees celebrated in true Hollywood style late Friday when the agency 
was told the good news. The ad firm's entire staff was called into the lobby 
for a meeting. Employees were entertained by several of the agency's top 
executives -- including McGee -- who sang and danced to the Broadway tune 
"There's No Business Like Show Business."

NORTHROP LOSES ATTEMPT TO DISMISS FRAUD LAWSUIT; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: EMPLOYEES ARE CHARGING THAT THE FIRM OVERCHARGED THE GOVERNMENT ON THE 
B-2 STEALTH BOMBER BY ABOUT $20 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. district court judge Monday rejected Northrop Corp.'s request that she 
dismiss a civil fraud case, filed by current and former company employees, 
which alleges that Northrop has overcharged the government by about $20 billion 
on the B-2 Stealth bomber program. 
</P>
<P>
After lengthy and heated arguments in the increasingly hostile case, U.S. 
District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer said she would allow the case to continue. 
At one point, she admonished the lawyers: "Excuse me gentlemen. This is my 
courtroom. Calm down." 
</P>
<P>
Pfaelzer spurned contentions by Northrop lawyer P. David Richardson that the 
plaintiffs had not filed specific enough charges to justify the case going 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the complaint in the massive suit is that Northrop's performance 
on the B-2 has been riddled with fraud from its initial work and that it has 
used a host of methods to overcharge the government. 
</P>
<P>
These allegations include giving the government falsified progress reports on 
its production of the B-2, submitting false data on the amount of money spent 
to perform work on the B-2, mischarging labor costs, submitting false vouchers 
for the purchase and procurement of parts and materials and knowingly 
misrepresenting the progress made in the production and engineering status of a 
key electronics system. 
</P>
<P>
The original suit was filed in February, 1988, and it has been amended three 
times by plaintiff's lawyer Herbert Hafif of Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed under the Federal False Claims Act, which allows private 
citizens to file suits on behalf of the government and share in any damages 
that the government ultimately recovers. The statute allows the government 60 
days to decide whether to intervene in a False Claims action and allows the 
government to take over any such suit, though the original plaintiffs are 
permitted to retain an active role in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1988, the Justice Department announced that it had declined to 
intervene in this case. However, in November, 1989, after Hafif filed the 
latest amendment to the case, it was learned that the Justice Department had 
reopened its investigation of the case. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Assistant U.S. Atty. Howard F. Daniels requested that the government 
be given 90 days to decide whether to intervene in the case. Judge Pfaelzer 
granted the request. 
</P>
<P>
Cases filed under the False Claims Act normally are kept secret, under seal, in 
an attempt to allow the Justice Department to conduct its investigation 
unimpeded. In early November, when Hafif amended the suit, Judge Pfaelzer 
unsealed the case after a court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
However, upon Hafif's request, she resealed the case again Monday for at least 
90 days. The judge said it had been her clear impression that Hafif's 
associate, Philip Benson, had wanted the case unsealed. But Hafif said he felt 
that was a misunderstanding and Pfaelzer granted the request.

MUSICIANS UNION AGREES TO NEW CONTRACT; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE ACCORD PRESERVES TWO SPECIAL FUNDS THAT THE INDUSTRY HAD 
SOUGHT TO ELIMINATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Federation of Musicians, which had threatened to strike over 
proposed record industry cutbacks to two special union funds, agreed Monday to 
a new contract that boosts wages and preserves the two controversial funds. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement on the new contract, which totals $50 million over three years, was 
reached after a week of tense negotiations and a nationwide union lobbying 
effort to enlist public support for the continuation of the funds. The Music 
Performance Trust Fund was set up in 1948 to pay for free live concerts at 
schools and other public facilities, while the Special Payments Fund pays 
musicians royalties from the sale of records, tapes and compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
The battle between the record industry and the union grew so heated that it 
drew Mayor Tom Bradley into the fray. Bradley wrote A&amp;M Records President 
Gil Friesen Jan. 26 to complain that "I am concerned about the possibility of 
drastic cuts . . . by the recording industry." 
</P>
<P>
"We started so far apart that it almost seemed impossible to reach an 
agreement," federation President J. Martin Emerson said Monday. But "I was able 
to hammer home to the recording industry that if they took these (two) funds 
away, it would ruin the union, and they would be worse off not having a union 
to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Emerson and record industry negotiator Norman Samnick said federation members 
will receive a 3% increase in wages in each year of the new agreement. The 
record industry also agreed to increase contributions to the musicians' Health 
and Welfare Fund. 
</P>
<P>
There was no change in the amounts that record companies will contribute to the 
controversial Music Trust Fund, which helped finance about 35,000 live musical 
performances last year, or to the Special Payments Fund, which has been 
shrinking over the past few years because royalty fees have been lowered for 
all recording formats and because sales of LPs, which have the highest royalty 
rate, have slumped. 
</P>
<P>
The pact is subject to ratification by eligible musicians, which is expected to 
take about a month. 
</P>
<P>
The music trust fund that touched off the union strike talk has been the 
subject of a heated dispute since at least 1973, when the record industry began 
arguing that its original purpose -- to provide jobs for live concert musicians 
displaced by the growth of the modern studio-based recording industry -- has 
become obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Samnick said about $320 million has been paid into the performance fund to 
finance free concerts. But federation officials said the fund has received less 
industry support in recent years. In 1989, for instance, royalty fees paid to 
the fund totaled $8.3 million, compared to $10 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Because of slumping LP sales, the Special Payments Fund, which pays royalties 
to about 4,000 musicians, had also shrunk to about $9 million currently from 
its peak of $24 million in the 1970s.

MAN BEHIND MALATHION SAFETY STUDY DISAVOWS IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN and MAURA DOLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a potentially embarrassing blow to the state's aerial spraying campaign to 
eradicate the Medfly, an author of a 1980 state study used to demonstrate the 
safety of malathion has disavowed the report's findings, saying the pesticide 
may pose a danger to infants, the elderly and the sick. 
</P>
<P>
Marc A. Lappe, a professor of health policy and ethics at the University of 
Illinois, who was part of a state risk assessment team, said he found in 1980 
that malathion could cause six extra cases of cancer for every million people 
-- six times greater than what the report officially concluded. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials, however, immediately discounted Lappe's criticism, 
calling the changes made in the report scientifically insignificant. Moreover, 
they said, later studies by federal health authorities found the chemical did 
not cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the later studies, Lappe said in an interview Monday, he is concerned 
about the possible health hazards of spraying. While six cancer cases in a 
million people are relatively few, he said, they suggest a potential hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has been ramrodded into accepting this without their basic right to 
have a full airing," said Lappe, who resigned his state post in 1981 because of 
the changes made to the report. "It could be quite dangerous to infants, the 
elderly and the infirm." 
</P>
<P>
Federal policy generally assumes that a one-in-a-million risk is insignificant. 
But state regulation puts the standard at less than 1 in 100,000 for the 
enforcement of Proposition 65, the 1986 ballot initiative that requires 
businesses to warn people who are exposed to certain toxic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James Stratton, a medical epidemiologist with the state Department of 
Health Services, said that five years after the state's report was released, 
the National Toxicology Program determined that the cancer risk from malathion 
was virtually undetectable. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ephraim Kahn, Lappe's supervisor in 1980, said the study purposely assumed 
an exaggerated cancer danger. Such "worst case" assumptions make the difference 
in Lappe's numbers insignificant, Kahn said. 
</P>
<P>
"The implication that his numbers were changed to hide some serious effect is 
just ridiculous," said Kahn, who is known within the department as a supporter 
of strong pesticide regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the report erupted this week because of an affidavit Lappe 
filed in support of a suit by the cities of Garden Grove, Huntington Beach and 
Westminster to stop the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the controversy is National Cancer Institute study that looked 
at the possible cancer risk of malathion in rats and mice. Researchers found a 
slightly higher incidence of liver cancer in the animals, but nothing that was 
statistically significant. Nevertheless, to be on the conservative side, Health 
Services decided to use the institute's worst-case figures in its 1980 report. 
</P>
<P>
Lappe -- who is recalled by former colleagues as brilliant, but stubborn and 
single-minded in his views -- said he took the strictest approach he could 
imagine. He assumed the greatest cancer risk possible from the institute's 
study, even though it was statistically insignificant; he chose as his 
hypothetical subject a naked baby lying outside and assumed that the baby had 
come in contact with all the malathion sprayed over 30 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Lappe's calculation showed that there could be as many as six extra cancer 
cases in a million people, assuming six sprayings. He said the figure could go 
up to 10 in a million with 12 sprayings -- what the state proposes for some 
Southland areas. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn said he later adjusted the figures downward by assuming slightly less 
exposure to the hypothetical baby because he believed the change was 
scientifically insignificant and the result would be better understood by the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lynn Goldman, chief of environmental epidemiology and toxicology section at 
Health Services, said she also believes such a change is virtually meaningless 
in a risk assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of uncertainity in risk assessment," said Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of Lappe's calculations, Stratton said the 1980 study became 
irrelevant five years later when the National Toxicology Program, in 
conjunction with the National Cancer Institute, released a new study that found 
malathion noncarcinogenic. 
</P>
<P>
"Malathion is frankly not among the list of chemicals that your readership 
should be worried about" as a cancer risk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials Monday revealed plans to set up a Southern California malathion 
health advisory panel and conduct air and water quality reviews in local spray 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The panel -- to be formed as early as this week -- would be made up of area 
health professionals. It would advise the state on the possible health 
implications of the spraying, as well as educate the public on its findings, 
Stratton said. Officials of the Department of Food and Agriculture said they 
were confident that the local panel's conclusions would mirror the state's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Dr. Paul Papanek, chief of the Toxics Epidemiology 
Program of the Los Angeles County Health Department, proposed that the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture pay for free testing for people who believe 
they have had an allergic response to malathion. He estimated the tests would 
cost $200 to $300 per person and involve about half a dozen people a week. 
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal was spurred by telephone calls from concerned spray zone 
residents and by the stepped-up spraying schedule. 
</P>
<P>
An independent lab in Palm Desert, meanwhile, is offering to provide malathion 
testing of produce, ground water and soil samples, at cost, to residents, said 
Craig Eaton, the lab's marketing director. For $25, the lab will analyze 
mail-in samples. 
</P>
<P>
Eaton said he is working with representatives of the Mt. Washington Assn., 
which has been active in the movement to stop malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The lab, which opened in December, is registered by the state Department of 
Food and Agriculture but not yet accredited, said a department spokesman. 
Registration is mandatory but accreditation is not.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAYOR BACKS PLAN TO TRIM AMBULANCE RESPONSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley declared his support Friday for a controversial $7.1-million 
Fire Department budget proposal for 1990-91 aimed at improving ambulance 
response times in Los Angeles by having firefighters replace paramedics on 
emergency calls that do not involve life-threatening situations. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, backed earlier by the City Fire Commission, would fund the purchase 
of seven new ambulances and the hiring of 40 firefighters and 20 supervisors 
and support staff members, with the goal of lowering the average citywide 
response time to eight minutes for heart victims and others in life-or-death 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hurtado, president of United Paramedics of Los Angeles, criticized the 
proposal. He said that it would provide residents with less service because 
firefighters would not have the same emergency medical training as the city's 
450 paramedics.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Harbor City teen-ager has been sentenced to 27 years to life in prison for 
the fatal drive-by shooting of a 16-year-old boy who was killed as he walked 
home from his Wilmington church two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Acuna Garcia, 18, received the maximum sentence in Long Beach Superior 
Court for the murder of Rafael Pereda, who was killed moments after he left a 
youth meeting at Holy Family Catholic Church in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who was 17 at the time of the murder, also has been sentenced to 37 
years to life in prison for a double murder in a drive-by shooting in August, 
1988. The two sentences will run consecutively, bringing Garcia's prison 
sentence to a total of 64 years to life.

<TEXT>
<P>
A state Assembly committee will look into the hiring practices and supervision 
at Laidlaw Transit, the largest school transportation contractor in Los 
Angeles, following the arrests of two Laidlaw employees accused of driving 
buses while drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said the Assembly Transportation Committee, 
which he chairs, will review Laidlaw practices at a hearing Feb. 15. 
"Something's obviously wrong when a guy can get drunk and get behind the wheel 
of a school bus," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego-based Laidlaw driver was arrested Friday after crashing into a 
pickup truck. Last month, a Laidlaw driver was arrested in Encino as he 
prepared to pick up students at Lanai Road Elementary School.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROPOSAL WOULD BILL HOSTS FOR COST OF NOISY 
PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council panel endorsed a proposed ordinance Monday that 
would allow police to recover the costs of quelling noisy parties by billing 
the hosts. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, approved unanimously by the Public Safety Committee, would 
require the hosts to pay police costs into the thousands of dollars for two or 
more visits to quiet down unruly celebrants. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Cmdr. Larry Fetters said that under the ordinance -- which 
will now be considered by the full council -- party hosts would be handed a 
written warning during the first police visit, advising them that a second 
encounter with authorities could result in fines.

HUNDREDS OF CASES, TO HEAD THE RETRIAL.

Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner on Monday named veteran prosecutor Joe Martinez to retry 
McMartin Pre-School defendant Ray Buckey on some of the counts that left a jury 
deadlocked last month. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, a former social worker, has spent 23 years in the district attorney's 
office and has "handled hundreds of cases," including about three dozen murder 
trials, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
He recently won convictions against two drug dealers in the murders of two 
undercover federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez replaces Deputy Dist. Attys. Lael Rubin and Roger Gunson, who had 
asked for reassignment before jurors acquitted Buckey, 31, and his mother, 
Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, on 52 counts of molestation and conspiracy, the 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gunson was named to head the district attorney's Special Investigations 
Division late last year, and Rubin asked to be transferred to a special trials 
unit in Santa Monica. Both said they will work with Martinez as he prepares for 
the trial scheduled to begin March 9, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Legal observers, however, said that the trial will certainly be delayed by a 
defense motion to disqualify Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders, 
who presided at the first trial, and by various other pretrial motions. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had said they intended to proceed on all 13 unresolved molestation 
and conspiracy counts. But Reiner said last week that he will pursue only five 
counts involving two girls -- one a new witness who did not testify at the 2 
1/2-year-long first trial. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the prosecution Monday listed 17 potential witnesses, including 
all five children named in the 13 charges. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Buckey told Cable News Network television talk show host Larry King 
on Monday evening that the two girls are among the "weakest witnesses" against 
him, and that he believes Reiner is switching prosecutors "because he thinks he 
could do a better job with someone else." 
</P>
<P>
In an hourlong interview, Buckey said most of the decisions in his case are 
"political," adding that Reiner, who is running for state attorney general, "is 
looking for a sacrificial lamb. He's going to sacrifice these two children to 
make his political career." 
</P>
<P>
Buckey said that if he is acquitted, he will file a civil suit similar to the 
multimillion-dollar action filed by his mother, charging malicious prosecution, 
defamation and violation of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a casual, reindeer knit sweater, and showing occasional flashes of 
anger, Buckey said his initial reaction to the charges against him and the 
other original McMartin defendants was a mixture of "shock and disbelief." He 
said he assumed his mother "would clear this up." Instead it became a 
six-year-long ordeal, five years of which Buckey spent behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
Insisting on his innocence, Buckey admitted he had been fearful of the original 
trial jury's verdict -- and will be the second time around as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid they'd say, 'Where there's smoke, there's fire" -- particularly 
after Pounders slashed dozens of witnesses from the defense roster in an effort 
to get the case to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
But, Buckey said, "You fight because you have to." 
</P>
<P>
While in jail, he said, he learned "to block out people" and was sustained by 
"my innocence, my family and faith in people." 
</P>
<P>
"You either stand up and fight, or lie down and die. But there are moments when 
you have despair."

ARSON PATROL LEADS POLICE TO SUSPECT 
</P>

A group of watchful North Hollywood neighbors, who took up all-night patrols 
after a monthlong spate of fires hit their street, led police to a suspect 
early Monday just minutes after a carport fire erupted in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Reunald Parker, 31, who lives near where seven arson fires have engulfed 
garages and trash bins, was arrested by police on suspicion of arson soon after 
four residents saw a man enter and leave a carport that caught fire about 1:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, an X-ray technician, is also under investigation in seven other fires 
that broke out in the past month in the 5400 block of Bellingham Street, said 
Inspector Ed Reed of the Los Angeles City Fire Department. Parker was being 
held in lieu of $10,555 bail at the North Hollywood police station. 
</P>
<P>
"The message here is that authorities do not have enough staff to cover every 
area," Reed said. "These residents kept watch and provided us with the 
information so that we could arrest the suspect at his home." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Bellingham Street, a quiet block of apartment buildings, said they 
had felt so terrorized by the fires that two weeks ago they organized a patrol 
to track down the arsonist. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt like we were under siege," said Bill Carver, one of the residents who 
spotted the suspect behind his apartment Monday morning. "We never knew when we 
would wake up to a fire. Everyone was nervous. No one could sleep well at 
night. I have been up all night watching the back garage every five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Two women equipped with binoculars, walkie-talkies and a cellular phone had 
perched themselves on the block's highest rooftop at 11 p.m. Sunday, the second 
night of the surveillance. Two men carrying radios patrolled the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We spotted a man walking around the building and within seconds the carport 
was in flames," said Stephanie Tapper, a patrol leader watching from the roof. 
Tapper said she called 911 to report the fire while her partner radioed the men 
who were on patrol. The men also saw the suspect walk into the carport area. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Sam Sibercheim said he followed the man as he walked away from the 
fire to a parking lot at the rear of an apartment house two buildings away. The 
suspect watched firefighters battle the blaze from there, where he lived, 
Sibercheim said. Neither Tapper nor Sibercheim said they actually saw the man 
ignite the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept an eye on him," Sibercheim said. "He was looking over the side of the 
wall, watching the fire. We didn't think to physically handle him. . . . The 
guy was wearing a trench coat. He could have had a shotgun. . . . When the 
police arrived we pointed him out and they arrested him." 
</P>
<P>
It took firefighters about 18 minutes to extinguish the fire, which destroyed 
five cars. The apartment building was not damaged and no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the arson-watch group said they did not know Parker. His apartment 
manager said Parker had lived in the building "for a couple of months," but 
declined to say anything more about him. One of the seven fires had erupted in 
the garage of the building where Parker lived. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday afternoon, residents said they still felt jittery about the fires. 
Several vowed to continue their patrol group. 
</P>
<P>
"He is just a suspect right now," Culver said. "There could be others involved. 
But God, I hope this is the guy so I can get some rest."

FATHER OF FUGITIVE BOY SEEKS GUARANTEE

<P>
The father of a 16-year-old boy suspected of shooting two deaf brothers refused 
to meet with Los Angeles police Monday to discuss turning in his son. 
</P>
<P>
Joey Bellinger remained in hiding Monday evening after his father failed to 
show up for a scheduled interview at the Devonshire police station to discuss 
the Jan. 28 murder of Cesar Vieira, 30, and the wounding of his brother Edward, 
25, in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The fugitive's father, Joe Bellinger, 40, has said he is in contact with the 
boy, but that he will not turn him in until authorities promise to try him as a 
juvenile. Police have refused to make such an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my son's life," Bellinger said. "I'm doing everything I can to see 
that the truth is brought out." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they will not arrest Joe Bellinger for harboring or aiding a 
suspected felon, although they believe they have grounds to do so. "That would 
only push him underground," said Detective Michael Brandt. "The point is to get 
the kid surrendered before he hurts anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Bellinger has gone to extraordinary lengths to defend his son, 
including embarking on a five-day hunger strike and arranging media interviews 
at his Long Beach home Sunday with a 17-year-old girl, who told reporters she 
witnessed the shooting of the two deaf brothers. The girl's version of the 
story, which depicts Joey as firing on the two men in self-defense, differs 
from that of the surviving brother, who told police the youth fired without 
provocation after forcing the brothers' motorcycle off the road. 
</P>
<P>
Police have declined comment on the girl's story but confirmed they have 
interviewed her. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Bellinger produced for reporters a 15-year-old boy who said he also was 
in the car with Joey and witnessed the shooting. The boy, who said he 
understands sign language, claimed Joey acted in self-defense, and that the 
deaf brothers were belligerent and made no attempt to communicate before the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said police have interviewed the youths in the car, but "no one in the 
car understands American sign language. The father is just trying to cover his 
son's trail, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
The boy later told The Times that, although he was interviewed by police, they 
did not ask him whether he knows sign language. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the Bellinger family has appeared in the news. Three 
years ago, the body of Joey's older sister, Michelle, 16, was found stuffed 
into three plastic bags on a hillside in the Silver Lake district, her hands, 
chest and ankles bound with duct tape. The elder Bellinger dogged the 
investigation. He drove the streets of Silver Lake and sat on hillsides with 
binoculars, searching for a car that a friend of Michelle said might have been 
involved. Even after a 15-year-old boy was arrested and convicted in the 
killing, Bellinger continued his search for what he believed were others 
implicated in his daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the Fairfax district neighborhood, where the Bellinger family 
lived at the time, say Joey's behavior changed for the worse after his sister's 
death. He dropped out of high school with his father's permission and became 
known in the neighborhood as a troublemaker. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the family's former landlord said Joey's behavior caused the 
family's eviction from their Fairfax apartment late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Joey is the head of a youth gang dubbed KAOS, an acronym 
borrowed from the television series "Get Smart," which for the gang stood for 
Kids Against Our Society. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Joe Lumbreras of the West Bureau's anti-gang unit said Monday that 
KAOS was known to police as a "wanna-be gang of white youths who probably used 
narcotics and believed in racial segregation." Lumbreras said the group of 
youths was primarily known for defacing the Fairfax district with graffiti.

REAGAN TOLD HE MUST TESTIFY VIA VIDEOTAPE 
</P>

<P>
A federal judge on Monday ordered former President Ronald Reagan to give 
videotaped testimony as a defense witness in the Iran-Contra trial of former 
White House National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene brushed aside Reagan's claim that the 
dignity of the presidency would be damaged by requiring a former President to 
give evidence against his will. "It would not be fair . . . to refuse 
(Poindexter's) request for the testimony of the former President under whose 
direct supervision he was working" at the time he is accused of committing five 
felonies, Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter "is fighting for his reputation and his liberty," the judge added. 
"To have a fair chance in that fight he must have appropriate scope in 
attempting to penetrate the traditional presidential curtain." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the judge rejected Poindexter's request to require Reagan to 
testify in person in the courtroom because he said the former President might 
inadvertently blurt out national secrets. He said the videotaped deposition 
could be edited to eliminate any problems of national security. 
</P>
<P>
"In the exceptional circumstance of testimony by an individual who was the 
President of the United States until a little more than a year ago, it is best 
that . . . testimony (be) taken in more private surroundings than a courtroom 
where the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information would be beyond 
recall," Greene ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Greene also renewed his order to Reagan to turn over portions of his diary to 
Poindexter's lawyers, rejecting a request for delay which was filed Friday by 
the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Under Greene's original order, Monday was the deadline for Reagan to surrender 
the papers. However, shortly before the courthouse closed for the night Monday, 
Reagan's attorney filed a new motion asserting that the diary was protected by 
"constitutionally protected privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's lawyer, Theodore B. Olson, argued that "Former President Reagan has 
not only the right to request privacy for his personal reflections, but a duty 
to the presidency and, as a surrogate for future presidents, to ensure that 
presidential diaries remain entitled to the fullest protection the Constitution 
affords." 
</P>
<P>
However, Olson's motion did not contain the words "executive privilege." The 
former President has been reluctant to invoke that doctrine, presumably because 
it is inseparably associated in the public mind with former President Richard 
M. Nixon and the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s. In effect, Olson 
asserted that Reagan has constitutional rights to privacy which go beyond 
executive privilege. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, both in his Monday order for videotaped testimony and in his earlier 
order for Reagan to turn over the diary excerpts, noted that the former 
President had not claimed executive privilege. The judge said he would 
seriously evaluate any executive privilege claims Reagan may make in the 
future, but he gave no hint as to how he would rule on them. The judge's 
decision, issued before Olson filed his latest motion, did not deal with the 
lawyer's argument that Reagan can protect the papers without specifically 
claiming executive privilege. 
</P>
<P>
"If such a claim (of executive privilege) is made, Mr. Reagan will be required 
to testify only if the court rules at that time that (Poindexter's) need for 
the information outweighs the claim of privilege," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge was careful to avoid making such a determination in advance. But he 
noted that Reagan has already provided a great deal of information about the 
Iran-Contra affair to the Tower Commission, the independent counsel's office 
and a grand jury. The information turned over earlier weakens Reagan's case for 
executive privilege, Greene said, because it "surely demonstrates a diminished 
expectation of confidentiality." 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Mark Weinberg, Reagan's spokesman in California, said 
the former President was determined to avoid surrendering the diaries. 
</P>
<P>
"While it might be politically expedient for President Reagan to submit the 
diary excerpts, it would be incompatible with his responsibility as a former 
President to the institution of the Presidency," Weinberg said. "Unless he 
takes reasonable steps to ensure that the privacy of these diaries is not 
invaded unnecessarily and without a proper need for them, future presidents may 
be inhibited in maintaining personal diaries for their own reflection and 
personal deliberation." 
</P>
<P>
Weinberg added that because Greene's order for videotaped testimony was being 
evaluated by Reagan's lawyers, he would not comment on it. Olson also declined 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh urged 
U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson to reinstate 11 charges against former 
Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord which were dismissed after Secord pleaded guilty to 
a single count as a result of a plea bargain. Walsh said Secord had committed 
"an act of bad faith" and violated part of the bargain by appealing his 
sentence of two years' probation and a $50 fee. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said the 11 other counts should be kept on the books until he had a 
chance to decide if Secord's appeal warranted canceling the bargain and 
bringing Secord, who served as a middleman in the sale of arms to Iran, to 
trial on all of the original counts. 
</P>
<P>
In the ruling regarding Reagan, Greene said the former President's testimony 
must be videotaped before the Poindexter trial, set to begin Feb. 20, gets 
underway. The judge said he would preside at the videotaping session, ruling on 
objections that might be imposed by lawyers on either side. He said the 
testimony would remain secret until the tape is played for the jury at an 
appropriate time in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter's lawyers submitted a list of 183 questions they wanted to ask 
Reagan. Greene ruled that 29 of the questions were irrelevant, but he said the 
other 154 could be put to the former President. Follow-up questions would be 
permitted, but no other subjects could be introduced, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said the approved questions fall into 12 broad categories, including 
Reagan's knowledge regarding shipment of missiles to Iran and Reagan's 
understanding of the Boland Amendment prohibiting U.S. aid for the Contra 
rebels in Nicaragua. Also included are discussions Reagan had with Central 
American leaders concerning aid to the Contras, and discussions between Reagan 
and Poindexter over actions that might be taken if Congress continued to refuse 
to aid the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Other categories for questioning, Greene said, include Reagan's knowledge of 
the relationship between former Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and specific 
individuals involved in Iran-Contra activities, and Reagan's instructions to 
Poindexter concerning communications with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter is facing five counts of obstructing Congress, making false 
statements and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Said Greene: "Although (Poindexter) might not have a valid defense based 
directly on the claim that his illegal activities, if any, were known to the 
(former) President, the fact of the President's knowledge of, and apparent 
acquiescence in, such activities -- if that is what occurred -- would be 
material evidence, for it would bear on (Poindexter's) specific intent to 
commit various offenses"

NEW GERMANY NEED NOT BE IN NATO, U.S. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration said Monday that a new, united German state would not 
have to be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but rather need 
only maintain "ties" to the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The shift in U.S. policy is the latest and most significant in a hectic series 
of revisions as Administration policy-makers run to keep up with the rapidly 
changing European situation. If it becomes reality, the new position on Germany 
would substantially reshape the Western alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, under the NATO treaty, West Germany is the location of the bulk of 
the alliance's front-line troops. The West Germans themselves contribute a 
340,000-member army to NATO's forces. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, U.S. policy toward German unification has been guided by four 
principles: self-determination, alliance with NATO, gradual change and 
reaffirmation of Germany's eastern borders. Those principles were announced by 
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III after Bush's summit with Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Malta. Now, said a senior White House 
official, "Forget about the four points. Events are just moving too fast. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to shift to face reality," the official added. 
</P>
<P>
The new reality is that the U.S. government, after resisting for years, now 
would be willing to accept German neutrality, at least in the sense of Germany 
no longer being part of a formal military alliance, so long as the Germans 
remain oriented toward the West in their political and economic system. 
</P>
<P>
"We would prefer Germany to stay in the NATO alliance," the official said, "but 
it's going to have to be the decision of a united German government" after a 
new single state is formed. Should the new government choose to quit the formal 
alliance structure -- an idea that has been advocated by some leading German 
politicians -- the United States would accept a looser sort of link. 
</P>
<P>
Neither government officials nor outside experts could say what exactly the 
Administration means by saying that Germany would be aligned with the alliance 
but not necessarily in it. 
</P>
<P>
"Confusion reigns," William J. Taylor of the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies here declared. With events moving so rapidly, he said, 
"anybody would be confused right now." 
</P>
<P>
The shift in U.S. policy trickled out to the public in an unusually convoluted 
manner Monday. At the daily White House briefing, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater 
was asked a question that called on him to restate what had been firm U.S. 
policy -- that any future German state would have to remain in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the standard answer, Fitzwater demurred. The potential status of 
Germany, he said, is "under discussion." 
</P>
<P>
"If you want further definition," he added, "there is none." 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler was prepared with a 
similarly ambiguous statement to read in case reporters asked her about 
Germany's future during the department's daily press briefing. No one asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that the West German government has spoken about the importance 
of maintaining ties to NATO," the statement said. "We agree that these ties 
should not involve a threat to the security in Europe but rather maintain 
security in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
The statement, officials said, was personally drafted by Baker after he met 
Friday with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration already accepts a form of neutrality for part of Germany. On 
Monday, the State Department, in a prepared statement, announced the United 
States now agrees that after reunification, NATO would not extend its area of 
operations east into what is now East Germany. Genscher had put forward that 
idea last week, but Baker had declined to comment directly on it after his 
meeting with the West German official Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher's policy could effectively leave eastern Germany without foreign 
troops. Although the Administration has proposed that the United States and the 
Soviets be allowed to keep 195,000 troops each in Central Europe, officials and 
non-government experts consider it inevitable that the Soviets will choose to 
pull their troops out, instead. 
</P>
<P>
With the Soviets likely to withdraw from Poland and Czechoslovakia, where 
demands for them to leave are continuing, any Soviet troops left in Germany 
would be so vulnerable as to be militarily useless, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
How many troops the United States might leave in Europe continues to be a 
subject of considerable debate. The Administration on Monday reaffirmed its 
number of 195,000, but Congress and many former defense officials have 
suggested a far lower number would be adequate if the current trends in the 
Soviet Union continue. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, any suggestion of German neutrality set off major alarm bells in 
Washington. Now, however, "the definition of what we mean by security is 
changing," said Robert Hunter, who headed the National Security Council's 
European division during the Carter Administration. "For the world that seems 
to be emerging, if you hadn't invented NATO, you wouldn't need it." 
</P>
<P>
Allied opinion may not be as sanguine. The British government, in particular,

BUSH IN STATE FOR 2 DAYS OF FENCE MENDING; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: GOP INSIDERS SEE THE TRIP AS A BID TO EASE CONCERN THAT CALIFORNIA IS 
BEING SHORTCHANGED IN WHITE HOUSE APPOINTMENTS.

<P>
President Bush's two-day California tour, which begins today, is viewed by 
state Republican insiders as part of a stepped-up effort to allay concerns that 
the White House has given short shrift to California, particularly in 
high-visibility appointments. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to mend fences comes as the state faces a crucial gubernatorial race 
that will be pivotal to the redrafting of congressional lines. California is 
expected to gain five to seven new seats when the governor and state 
Legislature draw new boundaries after the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who made only one extensive trip to California last year and a short 
visit to tour earthquake damage in the fall, plans to return again at the end 
of the month and is likely to make several more trips before year's end. Vice 
President Dan Quayle also plans frequent visits, largely to raise money for 
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson's campaign for governor. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense the White House has an East Coast focus and has not really 
been in touch with California, Californians and California issues," said Steven 
A. Merksamer, Gov. George Deukmejian's former chief of staff who is now a 
private attorney and part-time Wilson adviser. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, while aware of the grumbling in the nation's most populous 
state, maintains that Californians have gotten at least their fair share of 
senior appointments. 
</P>
<P>
"The previous President was a Californian, and there was much more emphasis on 
California because he was from the home state," said White House Personnel 
Director Charles G. Untermeyer. But he maintained that the complaints about 
insufficient appointees are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
California is listed as the residence of more Bush appointees to senior 
government positions requiring Senate confirmation than any other state except 
Virginia and Maryland, with their large number of career federal employees, 
Untermeyer said. The state's share of the approximately 745 higher-level Bush 
appointments, he said, is comparable to the numbers from Texas, Bush's adopted 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, say the White House statistics are misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"The real question is not overall numbers but clout," said Dixon Arnett, a 
Washington lobbyist who was once Wilson's legislative director. "And California 
clearly does not have people with clout in appointments as much as we used to." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, several prominent appointees are officially listed as Californians 
but have little connection with the state's political machinery. These include 
the three highest-ranking appointees on Untermeyer's list: U.S. Trade 
Representative Carla Hills, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins and Michael J. 
Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
The two highest-ranking members of the present Administration who are 
recognized within the state as bona fide California political appointees are 
Deputy Agriculture Secretary Jack C. Parnell and Deputy Transportation 
Secretary Elaine L. Chao. Both had the active backing of Wilson and Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Given the state's enormous political importance -- it will provide roughly 
one-fifth of the electoral votes needed by a presidential nominee and as much 
as 12% of the House of Representatives in 1992 -- some GOP activists maintain 
that it is in Bush's interest to have someone highly placed in his 
Administration as an informal liaison to the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have thought the Administration would have wanted an ear to the 
ground, someone from California who would be an ambassador to California as 
well as whatever function they were appointed to," said a prominent California 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the state's Republican leaders deny that California has been overlooked 
politically. They note, for example, that Steve Kinney, a former Deukmejian 
fund-raiser, has been appointed the national party's director for the Southwest 
region, which includes California. The appointment was made by Republican 
National Chairman Lee Atwater, Bush's premier political strategist. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints about a lack of appreciation of California's assets have been 
registered against a backdrop of eight years when Reagan and an inner circle 
filled with Californians ran the government. Previously, Richard Nixon, another 
Californian, put his stamp on the capital's political hierarchy for six years 
between 1968 and 1974 -- giving the White House a California flavor for 14 of 
the 20 years that preceded Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"George Bush's circle of friends are not from California necessarily. They are 
from Texas and the East Coast," said Kenneth L. Khachigian, a San Clemente 
lawyer who was Reagan's chief speech writer and a senior adviser to Quayle 
during the campaign. "The vice president's from the Midwest. Those are always 
the two greatest forces in any appointments process." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Khachigian and others point out that while Bush raised millions of 
dollars in the state, California did not play a central role in his nomination. 
Deukmejian steadfastly refused to endorse in the primary and many of the 
state's top Republicans followed his lead. 
</P>
<P>
"More than anything else you remember those states that were with you before 
the convention," Khachigian said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, who was considered at one time as a possible running mate for Bush, 
put his organization to work for the GOP ticket in the general election. The 
Republicans narrowly carried the state despite a massive grass-roots effort for 
Democrat Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, since Bush's election tensions have flared between the White 
House and Deukmejian as well as Wilson, the GOP's probable gubernatorial 
nominee this year. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian felt he was snubbed during a Bush visit to the state last April; 
Wilson has sparked anger in the White House by opposing Bush on votes against 
the development of the FSX fighter plane for Japan and, last month, on China 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
But, with this antagonism reportedly smoothed over, Bush will attend a 
$1,000-a-ticket fund-raiser for Wilson and the California Republican Party at 
the Century Plaza in Los Angeles this evening. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Robert J. Moore, director of the governor's Washington 
office, said that, after a slow start, the White House has stepped up 
California appointments recently. 
</P>
<P>
He cited the selection of Californians Bill Medigovich as the Western regional 
director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; Dennis Underwood as 
commissioner of reclamation, and Oscar Wright as Western regional director of 
the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Some Californians who have been involved in the appointment process acknowledge 
that some of the most eligible California talent -- including Deukmejian -- was 
not interested in seeking positions in the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a number of the most prominent candidates for Cabinet-level 
positions were not necessarily in the mold of Bush's moderate, 
non-controversial selections. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the list of the high-profile disappointed was Craig Fuller, Bush's vice 
presidential chief of staff who lost out to John H. Sununu for White House 
chief of staff. Fuller, who was California's best bet to have influence at the 
highest level, decided to join a Washington public relations and lobbying firm 
rather than accept another position in the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Next in prominence was Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), co-chairman of 
Bush's California campaign and the first congressman to endorse Bush publicly. 
Dornan, an outspoken, controversial conservative whom Bush called "my number 
one surrogate speaker," had sought appointment as drug czar, a job that went to 
William J. Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
"He clearly wanted it," said one of those familiar with the appointment 
jockeying. "But he's not really in the Bush Administration mold."

U.S. PROBES LEGAL AID FIRM'S ROLE IN ABORTION CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILES CORWIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Federal officials on Monday began an investigation into whether California 
Rural Legal Assistance violated a ban prohibiting federally funded law firms 
from using public funds in abortion cases. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Padilla, director of CRLA, said the investigation is retaliation for its 
challenge of Gov. George Deukmejian's attempt to slash $24 million from the 
state's family planning clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, bowing to pressure from fellow Republicans, allowed a $20-million 
family planning bill to become law without his signature last week, putting an 
end to what had been an embarrassing political issue for the governor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is clearly a case of political harassment," Padilla said. "They should be 
praising us for ensuring that poor women are now able to get health care, not 
investigating us and threatening to reduce our funding." 
</P>
<P>
Four investigators for the federal Legal Services Corp. began questioning 
attorneys at CRLA headquarters in San Francisco and reviewing documents Monday, 
Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
Terrance Wear, president of the Legal Services Corp., said the investigators 
are simply trying to determine whether CRLA twice violated the federal 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent case, CRLA filed suit against the state to restore state 
family planning funds that Deukmejian had slashed last year in a budget veto. 
The case particularly rankled the governor because the suit was successful in 
the lower courts, and had been under appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, Deukmejian had expressed concern that the clinics were 
promoting abortion. But, said Joel Diringer, a CRLA attorney who filed the suit 
against the state, the clinics are prohibited by law from providing or 
promoting abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The 500 clinics throughout the state provide a wide array of services, 
including birth control services, Pap smears to detect cervical cancer, breast 
exams and tests for sexually transmited diseases and the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Wear said he decided to send a team to investigate CRLA after he saw a 
newspaper article about the law firm's suit against the state. The article, he 
said, led him to believe "the clinics were giving advice on abortion." 
</P>
<P>
"I asked our people to check up on it," Wear said. "This is a routine type of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
The second case federal investigators are looking into involves a lawsuit, 
filed in 1979, in which CRLA joined five other public interest law firms in a 
suit to maintain Medi-Cal funding for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The case was decided in 1981, but CRLA has continued to fight for abortion 
funding in state legislative battles. Padilla said the lawsuit and other legal 
work on the issue did not violate federal law because CRLA paid the lawyers 
involved with funds provided by the State Bar of California, not public funds. 
</P>
<P>
Wear said CRLA was being investigated now because federal investigators just 
learned of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect," Wear said, "if we had known about it earlier, we would have 
investigated it earlier." 
</P>
<P>
Legal Services Corp. is a private, nonprofit organization established by 
Congress in 1974 to provide legal help to low-income people. The President 
appoints its 11-member board, which names its own chairman. 
</P>
<P>
CRLA, which has 15 field offices throughout the state, employs 50 attorneys, 
and receives 80% of its funding from Legal Services Corp.

SPEED OF MAIL TO BE TRACKED BY ACCOUNTANTS

Dogged by stories of letters taking 10 years to cross the street, the U.S. 
Postal Service announced Monday that it has hired the Price Waterhouse 
accounting firm to formally determine not so much whether the check is in the 
mail but how long it will take to get to you. 
</P>
<P>
Price Waterhouse will measure the travel time of more than 2 million pieces of 
mail a year in 86 cities that account for 60% of the nation's first-class mail 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
The $23.4-million, 3-year contract, paid for by postal ratepayers, represents 
something of a gamble for the post office, Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank 
said Monday at a news conference in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"When we talk about service in the Postal Service, we're a little like Henny 
Youngman's tired old joke, 'How's your spouse?' 'Compared to what?' " quipped 
Frank. 
</P>
<P>
Such service studies already are done in Great Britain and Canada, and the U.S. 
Postal Service conducts its own internal measurements. But this marks the first 
time an independent firm has tried to figure out how long it takes a letter to 
get from Point A to Point B. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very, very exciting attempt to level with the American people about 
how good or bad our service is," Frank said. "I think it's an essential move 
for us to measure our service externally and report it to the American public." 
</P>
<P>
Frank expects the study to have a positive impact on service, because "if you 
measure something, it behaves differently." The 800,000 Postal Service 
employees will react, "particularly if (the numbers) are low, as they were 
initially in Great Britain and Canada." 
</P>
<P>
The study will involve 2,000 "reporters," including households and small 
businesses, who will call a toll-free number each time they receive a piece of 
test mail. The 26 types of mail will come in different sizes and colors, in 
order to look like regular first-class mail. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service's target is to deliver a first-class letter overnight in the 
same city, in two days within a "contiguous area," and in three days from coast 
to coast, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Internal studies have found that the Postal Service hits that first standard 
about 95% of the time but does worse with the other two. "It's in the (80% 
range), and I don't think that's good enough," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The test will begin this spring and preliminary results will be released either 
late this year or early in 1991, Frank said.

1991 MAY SEE 30-CENT 1ST-CLASS STAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service will file March 6 for an approximately 20% increase in 
postal rates, which will translate into a 30-cent first-class stamp in early 
1991, Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said last year that first-class postage would rise in 1991 to at least 28 
cents and perhaps as high as 32 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service is expected to suffer its worst deficit ever this year, more 
than $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The soon-to-be proposed increase will affect all postal rates, a Postal Service 
spokeswoman said Monday. The independent Postal Rate Commission will review the 
request and can modify it, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The increase is needed because of higher expenses, particularly labor and fuel 
costs, Frank said at a news conference Monday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The last rate hike came in April, 1988, when the price of a first-class stamp 
jumped to 25 cents from 22 cents. Frank acknowledged that the increase will be 
higher than the rate of inflation over the three-year period.

BUDGET: THE DEFENSE SECRETARY WARNS A SENATE PANEL OF SOVIET INSTABILITY. HE 
AND GOP MEMBERS USE THAT THEME TO DEFEND WEAPONS INCREASES.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney asserted Monday that the mounting uncertainty 
about the fate of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev underscores the need to 
step up spending on long-range nuclear weapons and the "Star Wars" anti-missile 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying on Capitol Hill as Gorbachev confronted hard-line communists 
following a massive demonstration in Moscow, Cheney said that nobody can 
predict whether Gorbachev might be replaced by a more belligerent leader "next 
week, next month or next year." 
</P>
<P>
It would be "very risky business for us to build a national security strategy 
at this point that is radically different from the past, based upon the 
assumption that fate will treat kindly with the current Soviet leadership," the 
defense secretary told the Senate Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and committee Republicans repeatedly used the instability theme to 
counter Democratic attacks on President Bush's proposed $4-billion increase in 
the B-2 Stealth bomber, MX missile, "Star Wars" and other strategic programs in 
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet Union appears ready to pull its troops out of Eastern 
Europe within five years, greatly diminishing the threat of an invasion of 
Western Europe, Cheney said, the threat of an intercontinental strike remains 
as missiles and other strategic weapons are vigorously upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to deal not only with the political instability that is reported 
there," he said, "we still have to deal with the reality of the Soviet military 
capability and the fact that it may be wielded at some point in the future by 
someone who does not have the same set of attitudes and policies that Mr. 
Gorbachev has displayed toward the West in recent months." 
</P>
<P>
Led by Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), several Democrats contended 
that in light of the dramatic fall of Communist governments in Eastern Europe 
and the simultaneous easing of U.S.-Soviet tensions, the United States should 
restrain strategic spending as well as reduce troop levels in Europe much more 
than Bush proposes. 
</P>
<P>
The President has requested $295.1 billion in Pentagon spending authority, a 
2.6%-cut in purchasing power from this year's level after adjusting for 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Sasser told Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, that the President's request was "at a minimum about $10 billion" too 
high. Sasser, suggesting that he would seek deep cuts in proposed strategic 
spending, disdainfully cited a series of "trade-offs" in the Bush budget: 
</P>
<P>
 -- $1.2 billion more for the B-2, $860 million less for child nutrition and 
fuel subsidies for the poor; 
</P>
<P>
 -- $900 million more for the Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars," $1 
billion less for highways; 
</P>
<P>
 -- $1.1 billion more for the MX, $313 million less for public housing. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.) led a chorus of Republicans who rose to Bush's 
defense on strategic spending, citing Soviet instability. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that he had just attended an annual meeting in Munich of officials from 
Western Europe, the United States, Canada and Japan, Rudman said he picked up 
the strong feeling that "with the raised level of instability in the Soviet 
Union, strategic force becomes even more important." 
</P>
<P>
Rudman added that the likely unification of West and East Germany, together 
with the Baltic republics' move toward independence, would make the Soviet 
"even more paranoid about what people will do to it. And one thing they will do 
is continue to modernize strategic forces." 
</P>
<P>
The committee hearing was marked by several awkward moments when Sen. Charles 
E. Grassley (R-Iowa), pressing Cheney to implement a $39-billion package of 
management reforms, declared: "You've had three heart bypass operations, and 
I'd like to see it done while you're around." 
</P>
<P>
As embarrassed murmurs filled the hearing room, Cheney said lightly, "I have 
not had three. I have had one. But I guess I'm going to need some kind of fix 
after I finish this session today."

TAX REPORT SAYS RICH GAINED, POOR LOST DURING '80S

<P>
In a finding that could undermine President Bush's plan to cut capital gains 
taxes, a House committee report said Monday that during the 1980s, the rich 
paid lower taxes on more income, while the poor felt a sharper tax bite. 
</P>
<P>
The report, based on Congressional Budget Office and other agency studies, is 
to be released today by the House Ways and Means Committee at a hearing where 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Budget Director Richard G. Darman are 
scheduled to testify. 
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the effective tax rate for the poorest 20% of American 
families rose 16.1% during the 1980s while real income rose 3.2%. 
</P>
<P>
During the same period, it says, the effective tax rate for the richest 20% of 
families dropped by 5.5% while their real income rose 31.7%. 
</P>
<P>
That statistic and others in the report could add fuel to Democratic claims 
that wealthier Americans, who would benefit most from a capital gains tax cut, 
do not need or deserve another tax break. 
</P>
<P>
Some Democrats opposed to capital gains tax cuts have proposed tax breaks they 
say would benefit more middle-income families instead, such as a reduction in 
the Social Security payroll tax. 
</P>
<P>
For those Americans in the top 5% of earners, the report says their income rose 
from more than 15 times the poverty level in 1980 to an estimated 22.5 times 
the poverty level in 1990 -- a 46.1% increase. 
</P>
<P>
"The story of the '80s is that the rich did well and that the poor lost 
ground," said one Ways and Means Committee staff member who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in a bitter partisan battle that stalled vital budget-related 
legislation for months, Senate Democrats defeated Bush's plan to lower the tax 
rate on capital gains, which had passed the tax-writing Ways and Means 
Committee and the full House.

S. AFRICA WHITES VOW 'FREEDOM STRUGGLE'; 
</P>
<P>
REFORM: DE KLERK OFFERS ASSURANCES ON MINORITY INTERESTS, COMMITMENT AGAINST 
ANARCHY.

<P>
Only three days after lifting a ban on the African National Congress and other 
black guerrilla groups, the government sought Monday to reassure whites that it 
remains committed to fighting anarchy and will never sell out the white 
minority's interests. 
</P>
<P>
But the Conservative Party, the government's strongest opposition in 
Parliament, warned that "the Afrikaner nation is not prepared to live under an 
overwhelmingly ANC government," and it announced plans to undertake a white 
"freedom struggle." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the hour of truth," Andries Treurnicht, an ordained minister and 
leader of the Conservatives, told Parliament in a speech castigating President 
Frederik W. de Klerk for his "revolutionary, left-wing announcements." 
</P>
<P>
The clashes between the ruling National Party and the Conservative Party, the 
two strongest forces in white politics, reflected the difficulty De Klerk faces 
in selling his reform plans to a wary white electorate. Complicating matters is 
the threat of a violent backlash from heavily armed white supremacist groups 
who have become increasingly militant in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
In a nationally broadcast interview on state-run television Sunday night, De 
Klerk told South Africans that his decision to remove key provisions of the 
state of emergency and lift bans on about 60 anti-apartheid groups and 375 
radical leaders was "justified from the security point of view." 
</P>
<P>
He reminded whites that only a new constitution "with majority support can make 
South Africa free from the risks that are staring us in the eyes." But he 
promised that any changes in the constitution would first be put to white 
voters for their approval. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever new system you introduce must have the broad support of (white) 
voters," Stoffel van der Merwe, a Cabinet minister and member of De Klerk's 
reform team, told reporters Monday. "Before there are any constitutional 
changes, we would go back to the voters and ask them." 
</P>
<P>
The government's internal propaganda offensive came after an attack Sunday on 
the British Embassy in Pretoria by right-wing extremists. The assailants shot 
out windows in the building and then ran the flag of a right-wing organization 
up the embassy flagpole. On Saturday, the embassy's gates had been 
spray-painted with the slogan, "The right-wing struggle has begun." 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesmen and political analysts sought to minimize the significance 
of what they called isolated instances of violence from the far right. But they 
admitted to being worried about mainstream conservative whites who feel 
threatened by De Klerk's decision to lift the 30-year ban on the ANC, the 
Pan-Africanist Congress and the South African Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Many whites in the country, including some in the ranks of De Klerk's National 
Party, were horrified by De Klerk's moves, not least because the government has 
for three decades painted those organizations as terrorist groups that could 
not be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
"Many South Africans are concerned about the attitude of the ANC, the PAC and 
the SACP, and they are concerned that this sudden freedom could lead to 
violence in the streets," said Carl Noffke, a professor of political science at 
Rand Afrikaans University in Johannesburg. "Hopefully that won't occur. But 
that could slow down his whole process of renewal." 
</P>
<P>
Since De Klerk's announcement, the police have broken up several black 
demonstrations across the country. Four people died in unrest Saturday, and a 
police station in Lamontville was attacked by people carrying ANC flags and 
demanding that the police withdraw from the township because the "ANC was in 
charge," police said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, policemen used tear gas and buckshot to disperse throngs of black 
protesters in Tembisa and Tokhoza, two townships near Johannesburg. Several 
people reportedly were injured in the confrontations, and youths erected street 
barricades in both places. 
</P>
<P>
To stave off white fears, De Klerk took the unusual step Friday of meeting with 
his party caucus after his speech, party sources said. The source described the 
meeting as "a frank exchange of views" and said the party leaders supported De 
Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
"But as far as the rank and file of Nats (National Party supporters) is 
concerned, one can expect that a number would be displeased" with De Klerk's 
actions, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, senior Cabinet ministers tried to ease the shock among whites by 
repeating promises that the government intends to maintain residential and 
school segregation, among other vestiges of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Herman Kriel, minister of planning and provincial affairs, said the government 
might place the Group Areas Act, which segregates residential areas, on the 
agenda in negotiations with black leaders. But he added that the right of 
whites to live in segregated neighborhoods is an "indispensable principle" of 
the governing National Party. 
</P>
<P>
The country's 5 million whites, about 60% of whom are Afrikaners whose 
forebears settled in South Africa from Europe three centuries ago, control 
Parliament and maintain the system of racial segregation. The 27 million blacks 
have no vote in national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-apartheid Conservative Party, which won 31% of the vote in September's 
general elections, said Monday it plans a rally Feb. 15 in Pretoria, the 
capital, to protest De Klerk's latest actions. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has said he wants a political system in which black and white South 
Africans have full voting rights. But he also wants special protection for the 
white minority. He has taken a number of steps in recent months to remove 
restrictions on black activists, particularly those aligned with the ANC, in 
the hopes of luring them to the negotiating table.

INDIA BORDER GUARDS OPEN FIRE ON PAKISTANI DEMONSTRATORS; 10 HURT

Indian border guards opened fire on Pakistani protesters who swarmed into 
Indian territory in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir on Monday, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people were reported injured in the shooting, India's chief 
spokesman said. Pakistani officials said that one protester was killed and 13 
others were shot in the legs. 
</P>
<P>
The episode occurred near Ranbirsinghpura in Jammu region, 310 miles north of 
New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, who shouted anti-India slogans, were protesting a recent 
Indian government crackdown on Muslim separatists in the Kashmir region of 
Jammu and Kashmir, said a Pakistani police official in Sialkot, about three 
miles from the border. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian spokesman said that about 4,000 demonstrators gathered on the 
Pakistani side and tried to cross the border. "Despite efforts by the Pakistani 
rangers, some people crossed over and the Indian security forces had to fire to 
control the situation," he said without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Rashid Babar, Pakistan's top diplomat in 
India, was summoned to the Foreign Office and told of India's "concern and deep 
regret" at the "unprovoked incident." 
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan government did not immediately react to the incident. 
</P>
<P>
In Jammu, a senior official of the Indian Border Security Force, which guards 
the area, said the trouble started around noon when about 500 people gathered 
near the border and shouted "provocative slogans." 
</P>
<P>
He said the commander of the Border Security Force outpost then called 
Pakistani officers into the Indian territory to discuss the situation, after 
which the Pakistani forces dispersed the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
But the crowd regrouped, and despite the Pakistani guards, many swarmed across 
the border, he said. Pakistan's official TV said there were about 30,000 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The intrusion was an apparent fallout of a strike Monday in major Pakistani 
cities in support of Kashmiri secession. At least 76 people have been killed in 
Kashmir since Jan. 20 in clashes between curfew-breaking protesters and 
security forces.

THE WINDS OF CHANGE SWEEPING THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are some questions and answers about the changes occurring in South Africa 
in recent days: 
</P>
<P>
Question: What is the most important action President Frederik W. de Klerk has 
taken? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: His most significant move has been to lift a 30-year-old government ban 
on the African National Congress, the primary guerrilla group fighting white 
minority-led rule in South Africa. He also legalized the South African 
Communist Party, a close ally of the ANC, and the Pan-Africanist Congress, a 
smaller guerrilla group. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What immediate effect will the unbanning of these groups have on South 
Africa? 
</P>
<P>
A: About 80 activists now in prison on charges of having been members of those 
organizations or supporting the aims of those organizations will be freed 
within a week, the government says, as soon as the paper work can be completed. 
Any activists currently being held to face those charges will be freed and 
their trials halted. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will other political prisoners be freed as well? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. The government says people convicted on charges of violence, such as 
terrorism, arson and murder, even if their aims were primarily political, will 
not be freed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Then are all members of the ANC living in exile free to return home? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Exiled members of those formerly banned organizations could still face 
prosecution in South Africa if the authorities think they have been involved in 
illegal activities. Most exiles will probably wait until that issue is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What other action did De Klerk take? 
</P>
<P>
A: De Klerk removed portions of the state of emergency, imposed in 1986, that 
prohibit news coverage of unrest and political activity in schools. He lifted 
travel and public speaking restrictions imposed under the emergency against 374 
activists and did away with regulations that made them possible. He set a limit 
of six months on the amount of time an activist may be detained without trial 
and added provisions that allow detainees the right to legal representation and 
a doctor of their own choosing. He also rescinded restrictions on 33 political 
organizations that had been prevented from engaging in political activities 
under emergency regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why did De Klerk act now? 
</P>
<P>
A: The president says he wants to move quickly to remove the obstacles to 
negotiations and create a "new South Africa." He also has been under pressure 
from foreign governments, including the United States, who want to see concrete 
moves toward ending apartheid before they will agree to lift sanctions and 
resume normal trading with South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What has to be done now to get negotiations under way? 
</P>
<P>
A: The ANC says Nelson R. Mandela and other political prisoners must be freed 
and the state of emergency must be lifted before it will consider negotiating 
with the government. Once Mandela is freed, however, the ANC will come under 
increasing pressure from foreign governments to at least open "talks about 
talks" with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What will happen to "listed" people? 
</P>
<P>
A: The president has removed 150 names from the list of people who may not be 
quoted or whose writings may not be published in South Africa. Among them are 
leaders of the ANC, such as Oliver Tambo, Thabo Mbeki and Joe Slovo, as well as 
longtime activists still in South Africa, such as Helen Joseph. More than 300 
people remain "listed," however. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do any provisions of the emergency decree remain intact? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The police will still be able to detain, without charge or trial, 
anyone they consider a threat to the security of the state. Similarly, any 
organization deemed a threat can be ordered to refrain from political activity. 
Also, television pictures and still photographs of political unrest, or police 
action to quell that unrest, remain illegal. That rule, however, has not been 
fully enforced in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does this mean the United States will end its sanctions against South 
Africa? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not yet. South Africa has met some of the conditions required by U.S. law to 
suspend or modify its sanctions against Pretoria. But several conditions 
remain, including the release of Mandela and an end to the state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What does the ANC say now? 
</P>
<P>
A: The ANC is still trying to decide how to respond to De Klerk's moves. Its 
initial statements have indicated it welcomes the reforms but thinks they do 
not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are the remaining ANC conditions for negotiations? 
</P>
<P>
A: The ANC is still demanding that the government release all political 
prisoners, including those -- such as Mandela -- convicted of violent crimes; 
lift the state of emergency and get rid of other laws designed to curtail 
political activity, and remove all army troops from the black townships. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Will the ANC give up its armed struggle against the white minority-led 
government? 
</P>
<P>
A: The ANC says it will not end its guerrilla war until the South African 
government ends its armed actions against ANC operatives. The ANC says a mutual 
cease-fire is something that can be negotiated with the government eventually. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How strong is the right-wing movement, and what does it plan to do? 
</P>
<P>
A: The right-wing Conservative Party, which supports apartheid, won 31% of the 
white votes in the last general election and remains the government's official 
opposition in Parliament. While the Conservatives do not have enough votes to 
stop De Klerk's liberalizing moves in Parliament, they plan to begin staging 
public protest marches and rallies to put pressure on the government to stop 
its process of reform. Other white extremist groups who are not represented in 
Parliament are small, but some fear they will become increasingly militant in 
the face of South Africa's changes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does apartheid remain in force? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The pillars of apartheid are not affected by De Klerk's announcement. 
They include the Group Areas Act, which segregates neighborhoods; the Land Act, 
which prohibits blacks from owning property in most areas of the country, and 
the Population Registration Act, which classifies all South Africans by race. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When will those apartheid laws be repealed? 
</P>
<P>
A: The government says it plans to repeal soon the Separate Amenities Act, 
which allows communities to segregate public facilities such as swimming pools, 
recreation halls, parks and restrooms. Public facilities in larger cities in 
South Africa have been integrated in recent years, but segregated facilities 
remain in many rural towns. The government has given no indication that it 
plans to remove the other laws any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Q: If negotiations begin, how far apart will the ANC and the government be in 
their visions of a new constitution? 
</P>
<P>
A: The government says it is willing to share power with blacks as long as the 
interests of the white minority, outnumbered 5 to 1, are protected. The ANC, on 
the other hand, wants a one-man, one-vote system leading to majority rule, 
which would almost certainly mean a government led primarily by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When will Mandela be released? 
</P>
<P>
A: President De Klerk says he has decided to release Mandela soon but that no 
date has been set.

AIDS KILLING ROMANIA'S CHILDREN

This country is in the throes of the first known epidemic of childhood AIDS 
caused by contaminated blood and the constant reuse of needles, a humanitarian 
organization says. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jacques Lebas, president of the Paris-based Doctors of the World, Monday 
urged the international health community to provide Romania with disposable 
needles and blood-screening equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We know AIDS from people who take drugs, homosexuals, and heterosexuals in 
Africa, but for the first time in the history of AIDS, we are confronted with 
childhood AIDS," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an epidemic," he said. "It's on the level of famine. It's an 
international emergency." 
</P>
<P>
The Romanian outbreak is unusual because it does not involve the transmission 
of the virus from mother to fetus -- the manner in which most children around 
the world are infected -- but from contaminated blood transfusions and needles, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the adult population, the incidence of AIDS is very low," Lebas said. 
</P>
<P>
The contaminated blood is believed to come from Romanians, not from foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Blood transfusions are routinely used in Romania as a treatment for premature 
babies, sick children and the thousands of youngsters suffering from 
malnutrition, he said. But needles are in short supply and are routinely used 
hundreds of times, encouraging the spread of the virus.

RCA FINED $2.5 MILLION FOR DEFENSE DOCUMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
PENTAGON: THE PROSECUTOR SAYS MORE FIRMS WILL BE CHARGED FOR TRYING TO GAIN AN 
EDGE OVER THEIR COMPETITORS BY TRAFFICKING IN CONFIDENTIAL BUDGET PAPERS.

<P>
RCA Corp. on Monday pleaded guilty in federal court to trafficking in 
classified defense budget documents and agreed to pay a $2.5-million fine in 
the latest conviction in an ongoing probe into illegal trade in Pentagon 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
One current and one former RCA employee also pleaded guilty to felony charges 
arising from their part in obtaining the confidential Pentagon documents. 
</P>
<P>
The case is part of a six-year investigation dubbed Operation Uncover into how 
defense contractors trade secret Defense Department documents to gain advantage 
over competitors. "This is a continuing investigation," said Henry E. Hudson, 
U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, predicting that "other 
individuals and corporations" are likely to be charged soon. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing Co. in November admitted similar crimes and paid more than $5 million in 
fines. A former Boeing executive, Richard Lee Fowler, was found guilty in 
December of 39 counts of conspiring to use classified military data to help his 
firm win Pentagon business. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric Co., which acquired RCA in 1986 as a subsidiary, said in a 
statement, "This unfortunate chapter in RCA history is now closed." GE said 
that all the activities covered in the case took place before it acquired RCA 
and said that it had "cooperated fully" in the government investigation. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric, based in Fairfield, Conn., is the nation's third-largest 
defense contractor, with contracts with the Pentagon worth $5.7 billion in the 
fiscal year ending in September, 1988, the last full year for which final 
figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
While similar in nature, Operation Uncover is not related to the Ill Wind probe 
into corruption in Pentagon weapons-buying. More than 30 companies and 
individuals have been convicted or pleaded guilty to crimes in the Ill Wind 
probe, which focuses on bribery of Pentagon officials for inside information on 
military weapons procurement. 
</P>
<P>
RCA and Boeing were convicted of trafficking in planning papers laying out in 
broad terms U.S. defense strategy and procurement policy, rather than 
individuals weapons contracts. 
</P>
<P>
In court documents accompanying RCA's plea agreement, the government said that 
from 1978 through 1985 RCA obtained copies of numerous internal Defense 
Department planning documents, including the Defense Guidance, the Five-Year 
Defense Plan and the Program Objective Memoranda of the military services. 
</P>
<P>
Such reports generally are classified secret and closely held within the 
Pentagon. Some volumes of the Defense Guidance, which spells out American 
military strategy and future force structure plans, bear the warning "Not 
releasable to contractors/consultants." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors were vague as to exactly how RCA obtained the documents, saying 
only that three company officials had obtained them from representatives of 
other defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the RCA officials, Leonard C. Kampf and Ronald B. Stevens, pleaded 
guilty to "conveyance without authority" of government property worth more than 
$100. Both men face a maximum of 10 years in prison and fines of up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kampf, 69, was a manager of marketing information at RCA's Government Systems 
Division in Cherry Hill, N.J., until his retirement in August, 1984. Stevens, 
49, was a marketing manager at the firm's Aerospace and Defense Division, also 
in Cherry Hill. 
</P>
<P>
GE spokesman George Jamison said that Stevens has been suspended pending 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Costello, a senior official of the Defense Criminal Investigative 
Service, which has been assisting in the government probe, said the RCA 
executives were involved in a "tightly knit group" of contractor officials who 
swapped bootleg Pentagon documents among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
He said there may have been no more than a dozen individuals and companies 
involved in the conspiracy. While scores of valuable government planning 
documents were acquired from Pentagon sources and exchanged among the 
contractors, investigators have found no evidence that any money changed hands, 
Costello said.

The state Supreme Court was asked Monday to allow a parole officer to be sued 
for allegedly assuring a woman she was in no danger just before she was killed 
by a paroled murderer who had threatened her life. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer for survivors of a San Jose woman told the justices that the parole 
agent's "grossly negligent" assurances had lulled the victim into a false sense 
of security. 
</P>
<P>
The parolee, released after serving 12 years for the slaying of his wife, had 
told the agent he intended to kill the woman, with whom he had been 
romantically involved, argued attorney Cliff Weingus of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Weingus said, the parole agent subsequently told the woman: "I 
don't think you have anything to worry about. He's not going to come looking 
for you." 
</P>
<P>
"It was foreseeable the woman would rely on (the parole officer's) assurances," 
Weingus said. "His remarks carried the imprimatur of the authority of the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Atty. Gen. Wayman M. Robertson argued that the parole agent could 
not be held legally responsible for the woman's death. The officer had no legal 
duty to warn the woman and could not have reasonably envisioned her murder, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Robertson noted, the victim previously had been threatened and 
assaulted by the parolee. "She already was aware of the risk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments were heard in a pivotal case that could make it easier for 
victims of violent threats to sue persons who fail to warn them of the 
potential for danger. A decision is due within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
In past rulings, the justices have permitted such suits only in limited 
circumstances -- for example, when a psychiatrist failed to alert the target of 
threats by a patient. Generally, law enforcement officials have been protected 
from being sued over crimes committed by parolees. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief filed with the court, the 18,000-member California Correctional 
Peace Officers Assn. warned that a ruling allowing a suit against the agent 
would interfere with the broad discretion that authorities need to perform 
their duties. 
</P>
<P>
Parole officers, the association said, would never know when a good-faith 
action involving a parolee might later subject them to personal liability if it 
resulted in death or injury. Because virtually any parolee may commit violence, 
officials would be encouraged to revoke paroles as the only means of guarding 
against liability, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
In the case before the court, Grace Morales was kidnaped and shot to death in 
April, 1986, by Napoleon Johnson, a parolee with whom she had been romantically 
involved before ending their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Morales' surviving children charged in a subsequent wrongful-death suit that 
Johnson told his parole officer, Michael Ybarra, that he was angry over being 
abandoned by Morales and would kill her if he found her. Ybarra had Johnson 
temporarily committed to a mental health facility. 
</P>
<P>
But later, after Johnson's release from the facility, Ybarra telephoned Morales 
in an attempt to reconcile her with Johnson, telling her that Johnson was still 
in love with her and asking her whether she really wanted to break up with 
Johnson, the suit said. As a result of the agent's assurances, Morales failed 
to take steps to protect herself, the survivors charged. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Clara Superior Court judge dismissed the claim, and in July, 1988, a 
state Court of Appeal in San Jose agreed that Ybarra could not be held liable, 
finding that there was no "demonstrably close connection" between Ybarra's 
ill-advised assurances and Morales' death.

JUDGE RULES AGAINST TAX TO PAY FOR JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delivering a devastating blow to Orange County's plan to build a new jail, a 
Sacramento judge ruled Monday that a half-cent sales tax measure planned to 
help finance new criminal justice facilities is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County supervisors planned to put the measure on the June ballot in 
hopes of using much of the estimated $126 million generated to pay for a new 
jail in Gypsum Canyon east of Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
But Sacramento County Presiding Superior Court Judge James T. Ford ruled that 
state legislation enabling Orange County to put the tax proposal to a simple 
majority vote violated Proposition 13's requirement that a two-thirds majority 
approve new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely disappointing to me and I'm sure every supervisor in this 
county," Sheriff Brad Gates said of the decision. "Now we're left with very few 
avenues, if any, to resolve jail overcrowding. And they (jails) are so sorely 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
The decision also affects five other counties named in the enabling legislation 
-- Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura and Humboldt -- and now 
they, along with Orange County, will be forced to rethink their jail plans. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling reinforced a court decision last year that found San Diego's 
similar half-cent sales tax measure also unconstitutional. State Sen. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who sponsored the new legislation, and county 
attorneys had believed that the measure was sufficiently different from San 
Diego's to pass muster in court. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Orange County and the other counties proposed creating jail 
facilities commissions, made up of private individuals as well as public 
officials, to collect and spend new tax revenues. State courts have held that 
local agencies not authorized to levy property taxes are exempt from 
Proposition 13's two-thirds requirement. 
</P>
<P>
But the boards of supervisors were unwilling to cede their own authority to 
determine what new facilities were needed and where they should go, in effect 
leaving the commissions largely powerless. 
</P>
<P>
Ford called the proposed commissions "sham" agencies aimed at circumventing 
Proposition 13, said Pierce O'Donnell, the lead attorney for the Howard Jarvis 
Taxpayers' Assn., which filed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I believed that the statute was patently unconstitutional from the moment I 
saw it," O'Donnell said. "The judge said . . . that the commissions were 
puppets on the strings of their county masters." 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell said that it was not every day that an attorney could save taxpayers 
$580 million a year in taxes, the estimated amount that would have been 
collected by the counties had the measures passed. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 13 is alive and well tonight," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth, who favors building a regional 
jail in the desert, said he was not surprised by Ford's ruling in light of the 
San Diego decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say I told you so, but . . . it's the same thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said getting a two-thirds majority for a sales tax increase would be 
virtually impossible. But he said two-thirds of the voters might approve 
general obligation bonds to finance a truly remote jail. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel Adrian Kuyper said he and his staff will study the court 
decision before determining the merit of an appeal.

PERSONAL HEALTH: OPERA: SINGERS BATTLE BUGS IN HOPES OF PROTECTING THEIR

OPERA STARS SCALE THE HEIGHTS TO BATTLE BUGS

Marilyn Horne travels with a complete medicine chest. Simon Estes gulps 
vitamins daily -- at least 3,000 units of Vitamin C. Sherrill Milnes wears a 
scarf and rarely talks in the cold outdoors. Leigh Munro washes her hands 
often. Benjamin Luxon doesn't worry about his health and even spends time 
cutting wood on his farm. 
</P>
<P>
Opera singers sometimes take extraordinary precautions to avoid catching a cold 
or the flu. After all, that first sneeze can lead to a temporary loss of 
livelihood. Worse, there could be harmful long-term effects on the voice. 
</P>
<P>
"For most of us in the industry, a cold can mean loss of money," Milnes says. 
"You learn with time what your voice can take and how bad a cold you can have 
and still sing." 
</P>
<P>
Because theirs is such a public vocation, and because opera singers so often 
greet fans and friends with kisses and hugs, the performers are very vulnerable 
to cold and flu bugs, says Dr. Hans von Leden, a Los Angeles throat specialist 
who confines his practice to voice problems. 
</P>
<P>
He adds: "Trouble is, when opera singers get the flu, they feel the show must 
go on and they must honor their contracts and show up at rehearsal and 
performance. Of course, then they infect the rest of the company." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Dornemann, vocal coach at the Metropolitan Opera, says her students try 
all sorts of ways to stay well: She knows two who pray a lot; another consumes 
tons of garlic (he's rarely sick). Others steam with vaporizers, menthol or hot 
showers. Then there's the Italian chorister who swears the cure lies in a glass 
of cognac, hot milk, honey and two aspirins. 
</P>
<P>
Milnes says it's vital for performers visiting strange cities to know and have 
ready access to a member of the elite medical fraternity of American voice 
specialists, numbering about 10. "It's so important to know who these 
laryngologists are," he said. "It's hard to convince doctors not familiar with 
singers that you are famous and need to be seen right away." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wilbur Gould, ear, nose and throat-voice doctor to the stars -- there have 
been reported sightings of Horne, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Martina Arroyo, Kiri 
Te Kanawa and others in his Manhattan waiting rooms -- recommends that his 
patients rest, take moderate amounts of Vitamin C, lots of fluids and stay away 
from alcohol, cigarette smoke and sick people. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, he urges singers not to perform if "there is the slightest hint of 
hoarseness." Nose congestion is fine, but if a performer has laryngitis, "it's 
essential they not try to sing out." 
</P>
<P>
Frederica von Stade, who has the flu this week and has cancelled all 
engagements, says she's reached the point where she will not perform if her 
voice doesn't feel right: "If I am sick, I am sick. Sure, you can make it 
through one performance, but then be out four to five days after. It's too 
dangerous. Nothing is worth hurting your instrument. It is such a fragile 
instrument and is so much a part of the psyche. What you feel about yourself 
comes out in your voice." 
</P>
<P>
Here are some noteworthy ways von Stade and other opera personalities battle 
the bug: 
</P>
<P>
* Von Stade, mezzo: "Aspirins are about all I will take for a cold. I stay away 
from cortisone, it's too dangerous. I believe very strongly in steam; moisture 
is good for the vocal cords. In hotels where the air is usually so dry, I try 
to get them to open the window, and on flights, I carry my Evian bottle with 
me. I usually have about eight glasses of water a day, anyway. . . . Positive 
thinking (also) is so important. I . . . write notes to myself saying, 'I'm 
terrific, I'm terrific.' It's amazing what miracles happen if you teach 
yourself to expect triumph and success." 
</P>
<P>
* Milnes, baritone: "I keep in good physical shape, not with body building but 
cardiovascular exercise. I take between 500 (and) 1,000 units of Vitamin C. If 
you have a heavy workload, then watch that you don't do too much partying where 
you have to talk over smoke and noise. It's a terrible strain on the voice. Try 
to keep your hotel room or apartment humid, because sore throats come from 
dryness. If you feel something coming on, cut your social calendar. In the 
early stages, staying away from others can often level off some respiratory 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
* Dornemann, Metropolitan Opera coach: "In my studio, I use Listerine on the 
phones, give water only in plastic cups and scrub with surgical soap. I never 
go into the theater if I am ill. I would just as soon give a singer leprosy 
than a cold." 
</P>
<P>
* Luxon, baritone portraying Falstaff in the Music Center Opera production 
opening Feb. 16: "I go out of my way to lead a normal and active life. We live 
on 56 acres in Kent, England, and I spend a lot of time outdoors. If I worried 
about my health, I would quickly become neurotic and and would not be able to 
exist -- let alone perform." 
</P>
<P>
* Horne, mezzo: "I have a humidifier going 24 hours in my New York apartment. I 
avoid drafts and will move six times in a restaurant to avoid the 
air-conditioner. I stay out of public transportation and go sparingly to the 
theater or movies. When I travel I have a complete medicine chest, and in a 
plane ask to be moved from someone who has a blooming cold. I believe strongly 
in vitamins and take about 3,000 (units) of C. About 18 months ago I started a 
physical fitness program and have a personal trainer. This has made such a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
* Estes, bass-baritone: "I believe in preventive rather than prescriptive 
medicine. In hotels, I fill up the tub or leave the shower on and open the door 
so steam can come into the room. But I go out when the forced-air heating is on 
because that spews so much bacteria into the room. But above all, I am a deeply 
religious person. There have been lots of complications in my career brought on 
by discrimination because of my skin color, and praying every day keeps me very 
peaceful. Religion plays a vital part in my career and my health." 
</P>
<P>
* Dr. Robert Feder, laryngologist, consultant to the Music Center Opera since 
1986 and a center board member: "No throat clearing, gargling or whispering. If 
you must fly, no talking. Suck candy and don't chew gum; it hurts the jaw. 
Drink 10 glasses of water every day but no ice -- too cold for the throat. 
Steam five minutes, four times a day. Only steam with hot water, not cold. Take 
hot showers. No mint or menthol drops, they hurt the throat. . . . And stop 
blowing your nose: It's bad for you." 
</P>
<P>
* Samuel Ramey, bass-baritone: "I make sure I am well-rested and don't get run 
down. Often I give my finest performance when I'm sick. My best performance at 
La Scala was in 'Marriage of Figaro' when I had a terrible cold. It makes you 
concentrate and work harder." 
</P>
<P>
* Leigh Munro, formerly of the New York City Opera, now in "Phantom of the 
Opera" at the Ahmanson: "I exercise with weights and a Lifecycle, and drink two 
quarts of water and five cups of herb tea each night. I take a lot of vitamins. 
I have a lot resting on my health. It's important for artists to learn how to 
handle the bombardment of stress."

YOUR BODY: PHYSIQUE MAY RELATE TO BREAST CANCER

Women with pear-shaped figures, who carry more weight in their thighs and 
buttocks than in their abdomen, may agonize over their appearance. But a new 
study finds they're at lower risk for developing breast cancer than their 
"apple-shaped" sisters, who carry more weight in their abdomen than in their 
thighs and buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, an overweight, pear-shaped woman can be at lower risk of breast cancer 
than a leaner, apple-shaped woman, according to Florida researchers, who 
published their study in the current Annals of Internal Medicine. They compared 
216 breast-cancer patients with 432 control patients, classifying them as 
apple-shaped or pear-shaped by computing their waist-to-hip ratio. 
</P>
<P>
(Waist-hip ratios are computed by dividing waist measurement by hip 
measurement. Waist-hip ratios of .77 to .80 are classified as mildly 
apple-shaped; ratios higher than .80 are termed very apple-shaped. Ratios from 
.73 to .76 are termed mildly pear-shaped; those below .73 are very 
pear-shaped.) 
</P>
<P>
Women with mildly apple-shaped figures are three times as likely to develop 
breast cancer, said Dr. David V. Schapira, a University of South Florida 
associate professor of medicine and the study's principal investigator. The 
risk is about equal to having a sister or mother with breast cancer, he said. 
Women described as "very apple-shaped" have a six-fold greater risk. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, women who are mildly pear-shaped or very pear-shaped have a low 
risk of getting breast cancer, Schapira said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody believes diet and (being) fat has something to do with breast 
cancer," said Dr. Gary H. Lyman, professor of internal medicine at the 
University of South Florida and another researcher on the study. "This research 
takes the study of risks a step further. It's not just excess weight or total 
body fat that increases breast cancer risk. It's where that body fat is 
distributed," said Lyman, who noted that the data needs to be confirmed by 
other studies. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida study isn't the first to consider the impact of body fat 
distribution on health. Recently, other researchers reported that people with 
beer bellies have lower levels of the so-called "good" cholesterol (HDL) than 
those with trimmer tummies. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida scientists don't know for sure why apple-shaped women seem to be at 
greater risk of breast cancer, but suspect a hormonal link. "Apple-shaped women 
have higher levels of circulating estrogens. We don't know exactly why," 
Schapira said. "But those higher estrogen levels are believed to increase 
breast cancer risk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The good news? Apple-shaped women who lose weight seem to redistribute the 
weight in a more desirable way, said Lyman, who is studying that possibility 
further. When an apple-shaped woman loses weight and becomes more pear-shaped, 
the abdominal fat cells -- which are bigger and more metabolically active than 
fat cells in the buttocks and thighs -- shrink proportionately more than those 
on the thighs or buttocks, Schapira said, thus perhaps reducing the circulating 
estrogen levels. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations based on the study? "Mildly apple-shaped women should pay 
more attention to guidelines about breast cancer prevention, such as 
mammography," Schapira said. "Physicians should pay more attention to these 
women in terms of counseling and encouraging them to follow prevention 
guidelines and a sound diet." 
</P>
<P>
But a local cancer prevention expert disagrees. Dr. William Hindle, director of 
the Breast Diagnostic Center at Los Angeles County/USC Women's Hospital, said 
the study should not alter patient management a whit. Every woman -- and 
especially those over 40 -- needs to be concerned about breast cancer risk, he 
said. "There's a long list of risks associated with breast cancer," said 
Hindle. "They're interesting and statistically valid. But the important point 
is this: Every woman should be concerned about breast cancer. Over 75% of women 
with breast cancer have no risk factors except being a woman and growing 
older."

BUSH LINKS ECONOMICS, GLOBAL WARMING ACTION

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a speech that was controversial before it was even delivered, President Bush 
told an international conference on global warming Monday that the United 
States is committed to "aggressive and thoughtful action" on world 
environmental issues, but he repeatedly stressed his belief that policies have 
to be "consistent with economic growth and free market principles." 
</P>
<P>
Delegates from about 50 countries, here for the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change to continue work on a massive report assessing the threat and 
consequences of global warming and recommending responses, gave the President's 
opening speech a strikingly modest response. Representatives of environmental 
groups followed with a chorus of criticism that Bush had thrown away an 
opportunity for the United States to take effective leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"It just shows that the Administration is still more concerned about polluters' 
profits than protecting the Earth from global warming," said Daniel Becker of 
the Sierra Club. "There is no reason that we can't act." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have for months urged that the United States set firm goals 
for reducing gases, particularly carbon dioxide, contributing to an 
acceleration of the Earth's greenhouse effect. Faced with sharp differences 
within its ranks, the Administration continues to maintain that scientific 
evidence needs to be clearer before major long-term commitments are made. 
</P>
<P>
Some European governments, meanwhile, have already set firm targets for 
freezing carbon dioxide emission levels. 
</P>
<P>
After its predecessor had set the year 2000 as a target for stabilizing 
emissions, the new Dutch government is considering a proposal to move the 
deadline to the middle of this decade. 
</P>
<P>
After the President's speech Monday, Dutch environmentalist Jan Henselman 
expressed concern that other countries will be reluctant to follow the lead of 
the Netherlands unless the United States, by far the world's largest 
contributor of carbon dioxide, moves to control its emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Renewing an offer he tabled at the Malta summit with Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev last December, Bush again proposed that Washington host the first 
negotiations toward an international global warming convention, once the report 
of the United Nations-sanctioned Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
The President also told the delegates the White House will invite scientists to 
a spring conference on environmental and economic issues, and that he intends 
to participate personally. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, he said, will convene "top officials from a representative group 
of nations to bring together three essential disciplines, science, economics 
and ecology. And they will share their knowledge, assumptions, and state of the 
art research models to outline our understanding and help focus our efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Although, he announced no date, Administration sources said plans are to hold 
the meeting in April, just before the 20th anniversary commemoration of Earth 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's opening speech to the third plenary meeting of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change had become a subject of sharp controversy in recent 
days after it was reported that White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, a 
skeptic of global warming evidence, had insisted on toning down the planned 
address after it had been endorsed by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, 
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, Environmental Protection Agency 
Administrator William K. Reilly, and White House Science Adviser D. Allen 
Bromley. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu denied he had toned down the speech, and in a television interview 
Sunday, criticized "faceless bureaucrats on the environmental side" who tended 
toward a policy "that cuts off our use of coal, oil and natural gas." 
</P>
<P>
After the address was delivered Monday, Administration sources said Sununu had 
removed nothing of concrete substance from the speech, but had sharply 
moderated its tone by changes such as eliminating a reminder that the United 
States last year committed itself to a stabilization of carbon dioxide 
emissions "as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting here this week is designed to move the working groups a step 
further along the way to draft reports due to be submitted for approval in 
Stockholm next August.

Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein formally kicked off her campaign 
for governor Monday by advocating a costly package of educational, health, 
housing and public assistance programs she said would be financed by user fees 
and by adjusting spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not proposing an increase in the state income tax. . . . I have no plans 
to raise the sales tax for any of these programs," she told reporters at a 
series of news conferences announcing her candidacy for the Democratic 
nomination for governor in the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
She said she would also ask the Legislature for "a complete re-evaluation of 
the mandates" that currently control most state spending. But when asked about 
welfare cost-of-living increases, one of the biggest and most frequently 
challenged mandates, Feinstein said only that they "are a difficult issue." 
</P>
<P>
She also said that as governor she would seek a constitutional amendment to 
allow local schools to pass bonds by a simple majority, rather than the current 
two-thirds vote, to help finance what is potentially the most expensive of her 
priorities: the reduction of classroom sizes in California schools. 
</P>
<P>
Her platform also includes new programs to curb domestic violence, train 
welfare mothers and reduce infant mortality, and the creation of a new state 
growth management commission, a new department of ocean resources, a state 
office of children and family and a new post of drug czar. 
</P>
<P>
On environmental issues, Feinstein said, "I will just say no to offshore oil 
drilling." 
</P>
<P>
She also repeated her proposal to create a new "California jump start program 
to provide early childhood education for every 4-year-old who wants it," which 
she said would cost $750 million to $800 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Feinstein outlined new programs totaling several billion dollars 
annually in new spending, but she declined to list specific revenue sources 
except to "take a good look at the lottery and how that money is distributed" 
to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
"You all want me to say, 'Yes, I'm going to raise taxes.' What I'm saying is, I 
am going to try to prioritize a government to be able to get the most bang for 
the buck within my priorities. That means some things that exist may have to 
go," she said, declining further questions on how she would pay for her 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
She added that she supports Gov. George Deukmejian's proposal on the June 5 
ballot to double the state's gasoline tax from 9 cents to 18 cents a gallon 
"because it's a user fee and those are the best" way to finance government 
because voters can see the link between their money and the programs they 
support. 
</P>
<P>
As the first woman to be a major candidate for governor of California, 
Feinstein put special emphasis on the support of women voters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big moment for me, and a historic one for women," she said. "Much 
thought and deliberation preceded this decision. I am a non-incumbent in a race 
against two entrenched statewide figures -- a woman in a field of men." 
</P>
<P>
She also made a strong pitch for support from women voters on the abortion 
issue. Although her two rivals for governor, Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson 
and Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp are both pro-choice, she said 
that as a woman she is best qualified to protect the right to choice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true men can protect women's rights. But it's also true the experiences 
of men and women are different experiences. I very strongly believe . . . with 
a woman who is governor, I know if she believes in choice, she's not going to 
have anything to do with any erosion of that basic optional right," Feinstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing Van de Kamp's qualifications, Feinstein said "there are judgmental 
questions that enter into it -- judgmental questions involving (his failure to 
prosecute) the Hillside Strangler, judgmental questions involving the savings 
and loans, judgmental questions involving the crime victims initiative" that 
Van de Kamp contends could undermine abortion rights.

At Victor Babes Hospital, rows of cribs hold small, shriveled babies slowly 
dying of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Manea Gabriel, 11 months old, could scarcely breathe. 
</P>
<P>
Her frightened eyes scanned the room as she failed to find the strength to 
raise a tiny hand. 
</P>
<P>
The cries of Mihai Van, 7 months old, were reduced to a mere rattle by the 
deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
The ward was filled with 68 other babies who had been born to die. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jacques LeBas, president of Medicins du Monde, an international 
organization that provides humanitarian aid to needy countries, said Monday 
that AIDS-infected children constitute the most serious health problem facing 
Romania today. 
</P>
<P>
Investigations during the past few days have revealed a startlingly high 
proportion of babies with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, LeBas said. Of 
1,025 babies tested at hospitals and orphanages, 367, more than one-third, were 
carrying the disease, and 60% of those had symptoms of fully developed AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Urgent help is needed from the European Community, "otherwise more babies will 
die in this most awful way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need everything -- medical equipment, specialists, money and information," 
LeBas said. "This morning I saw a pediatrician using the same syringe several 
times. When I asked why, she replied that it was the only one she had." 
</P>
<P>
AIDS is commonly transmitted by contaminated needles.

VOTER REGISTRATION PLAN FACES GOP OPPOSITION; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: BILL TO LINK PROCESS WITH APPLICATIONS FOR DRIVER'S LICENSES COMES 
BEFORE HOUSE TODAY. SOME CRITICS FEAR PROGRAM COULD ADD TO DEMOCRATIC ROLLS. 
</P>

<P>
An unexpectedly tough battle is looming over a plan that would allow adults to 
register to vote while renewing their driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The Voter Registration Act, or so-called "motor voter" legislation, started as 
a bipartisan effort. But the Democrat-Republican coalition threatens to unravel 
over GOP fears of costs, possible voter fraud and the potential of the plan to 
recruit an electorate that would vote Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
The act's backers herald the legislation as an expedient way to boost voter 
participation by registering 80% to 90% of the nation's eligible voters. The 
bill includes guidelines for mail-in registration, which is already in practice 
in 26 states, California among them. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which would go into effect after the 1992 elections, comes 
before the House today with the backing of both the Democratic chairman of the 
Rules Committee's elections subcommittee, Rep. Al Swift of Washington, and its 
presiding Republican, Rep. Bill Thomas of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
However, many Republicans, including House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel 
(R-Ill.), have already delayed voting on the measure and plan to present 
alternative legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Although details are not yet clear, the Republican alternative will likely 
attempt to address the concerns outlined last week in an eight-point White 
House memo that called for slapping a spate of amendments onto the bill, among 
them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To allow states to ignore the bill's guidelines if Congress does not 
appropriate "full" funding. As written, the bill would provide $50 million to 
support states' record-keeping, printing and redesign of forms. That is more 
than double the cost of the "motor voter" program as estimated by the General 
Accounting Office. However, some Republicans contend that their states would 
need to install prohibitively expensive computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "To prevent the buildup of deadwood" on voter rolls. Congress is split on 
how best to ensure that the list of voters is accurate and up-to-date. Some 
favor purging voters when they file change-of-address forms with the Postal 
Service. Other Republicans want stricter measures, including the right to purge 
registered voters if they do not vote. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional aides in both parties diagnose the real source of Republican 
opposition as their private fear that the "motor voter" plan would mobilize a 
previously untapped body of Americans -- women, minorities and the poor -- who 
tend to vote Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, the bill's Republican sponsor, calls such fears "mythical." He, like 
House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), says the plan would bring more 
Republicans than Democrats into the fold by tapping middle-class young adults. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill has the opportunity for creating an advantage for Republicans," 
Thomas said. He cited a New York Times survey that indicated that if every 
eligible voter cast a ballot in 1988, President Bush would have beaten 
Democratic rival Michael S. Dukakis by an even larger margin. "A larger turnout 
is a resource for Republicans, not Democrats. This runs so counter to 
traditional thinking, but the world has changed," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The League of Women Voters, a major advocate of the "motor voter" plan, points 
out that many of the states with the highest traditional turnout also have the 
easiest registration process. North Dakota, which does not require any 
registration, enjoyed the highest turnout in the 1988 election -- 73.2% of its 
eligible voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Voters say the main reason they didn't vote (in 1988) is because they weren't 
registered -- and then they can list 49 reasons why they didn't register," said 
Beverly McFarland, a spokeswoman for the League of Women Voters. 
</P>
<P>
"In many states, you have to go down (to the registration site) during business 
hours, in person. A single mother with kids might not be able to make that 
trip. Or a person really busy at work just keeps putting it off. Either way, 
registration represents a barrier," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The national average for voting activity in 1988 was 57.4% of eligible voters, 
according to a Census Bureau survey. Of the four states that already offered 
"motor voter"-style registration in 1988, three enjoyed better-than-average 
turnout. But the fourth state, Nevada, was dead last in the nation, with a 
46.9% voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa, Louisiana and the District of Columbia approved versions of "motor voter" 
registration last year, and several other states are considering adopting 
easier registration guidelines, according to the League of Women Voters. 
</P>
<P>
In California, only 51.7% of the eligible voters cast a ballot in 1988, 45th in 
the nation, even though the state offers registration by mail and widespread 
voter-registration areas.

The National Transportation Safety Board, reporting on a study of drinking and 
drug use by truck drivers who died in accidents, said that 33% of the drivers 
killed within 12 months in eight states were impaired by alcohol or other 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The board indicated that it will recommend stepped-up testing and a reduced 
legal limit on blood-alcohol content -- perhaps 0.01% -- for commercial 
haulers. The current limit is 0.04%, and a driver can be ordered off the road 
for 24 hours for any alcohol use. The board emphasized that its findings do not 
mean that every third truck driver on the road is impaired, since the study 
used only data from post-mortem tests.

NOTRE DAME JUMPS SHIP, SIGNS WITH NBC

<P>
NBC and Notre Dame announced Monday that the network will carry live, national 
coverage of all home Irish football games for five years, beginning in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame thus becomes the first school in the 64-member College Football 
Assn. to make a national television deal of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal said that the school plans to remain a member 
of the CFA but will not be a part of the organization's television deals with 
ABC and ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
Father E. William Beauchamp, Notre Dame executive vice president and 
secretary-treasurer of the CFA, said: "The involvement with the television 
package is separate from being involved with the CFA." 
</P>
<P>
Terms of NBC's deal with Notre Dame were not announced, but television 
executives speculated that it is worth between $40 million and $75 million, or 
roughly $10 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
ABC announced Jan. 17 that it had purchased rights to the CFA for $210 million 
over five years. ESPN announced in October its purchase of the group's cable 
rights for $110 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
Under ABC's deal, the three USC-Notre Dame games at South Bend, Ind., during 
the term of the contract would more than likely have been shown nationally. But 
most of the other Notre Dame home games would have been shown regionally. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said he had problems with ABC's plan to show Notre Dame games only 
regionally. 
</P>
<P>
"It would almost be better for us not to be on than to be on in only part of 
the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
ABC said in a statement: "ABC and the CFA have an agreement to televise the 
home games of all 64 member institutions beginning in the 1991 season. The 
agreement was reached on Jan. 16 and ratified unanimously the following day by 
the CFA television committee. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, ABC Sports intends to pursue all remedies available to protect 
its agreement with the CFA from interference by third parties, including NBC 
Sports, and to ensure participation of all CFA-member institutions." 
</P>
<P>
ESPN declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
David Ogrean, the CFA's assistant executive director for television, said: "It 
would be premature to speculate on how the CFA membership may be affected. 
</P>
<P>
"The CFA television committee will review the situation and consult with the 
membership. Both ABC and ESPN, with whom the CFA has agreements commencing in 
1991, have expressed interest in continuing their relationship with the CFA." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame said it had not given the CFA any guarantees that it would be part 
of the new television package. 
</P>
<P>
"In the process of negotiating new contracts, Notre Dame's position was (that) 
we would not indicate our position until we had a chance to review that 
contract," Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
NBC said it was legally free to conclude a deal with Notre Dame, since the 
school had not committed to the CFA's package. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not interfere with an existing relationship," said Dick Ebersol, the 
president of NBC Sports. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol said that, for now, NBC would not attempt to sign contracts with other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention or any basis to seek out other schools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that NBC "would stand by and see what the developments are in the 
other schools." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Jankovich, athletic director at the University of Miami (Fla.), said he 
would not rule out a similar plan for the Hurricanes, the 1989 national 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
"Miami did approve the latest TV agreement that was proposed by the CFA with 
ABC, but we have not signed off officially on this proposal," Jankovich said. 
"At this point, we're going to have to take a step back and assess (Monday's) 
developments. We will have to look at how the CFA's plan might be accepted and 
then determine what impact it would have on the University of Miami." 
</P>
<P>
The Notre Dame package will begin Sept. 7, 1991, with a game against Indiana. 
Other teams on Notre Dame's 1991 home schedule are Michigan State, Pittsburgh, 
USC, Navy and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will not prohibit Notre Dame's road games from being televised by 
other networks or cable outlets. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel America, the cable network that is 50% owned by NBC, also showed 
games against Rice and SMU live, and the rest of the Notre Dame schedule on 
tape-delay. It is highly unlikely SportsChannel will televise any games live, 
but its delayed telecasts are expected to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Today, one day after ABC apparently lost Notre Dame football, the network is 
expected to announce a two-year deal to televise games involving the NFL's new 
spring football international venture. 
</P>
<P>
The league, now dubbed the World League of American Football after two name 
changes, will start play in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which is expected to pay the league $12-$15 million a year, will 
start off with 12 franchises -- six in the United States, four in Europe and 
one each in Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
New York is the only U.S. city set, with the international sites expected to be 
London, Frankfurt, Milan, Barcelona, Montreal and Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC contract is only the first step in the television arrangements for the 
league, which is headed by Tex Schramm, former president of the Dallas Cowboys, 
and overseen by the NFL.

HAVANA SITE POSES POTENTIAL PROBLEMS FOR PAN AM GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE BRENNAN, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In November 1986, Havana was given an opportunity that Cuban President Fidel 
Castro had wanted for years: It was selected as the host city for the 1991 Pan 
American Games. There were no other candidates, so there could have been no 
other choice. 
</P>
<P>
But at that moment Havana became more than just another host of the 
oft-troubled quadrennial games. For the now-shrinking Communist world, the 
Games became a symbol. For Castro and his people, the Games became a cause. And 
for the U.S. government, they became a problem. 
</P>
<P>
In a year and a half, on Aug. 3, 1991, the Pan Am Games will begin. But as 
things stand now -- due to the long-standing U.S. trade embargo of Cuba -- the 
Games will go on without the sport of bowling, without U.S. spectators, U.S. 
cash and, most important, possibly without live U.S. television. There also are 
concerns about how drug-testing equipment will get to Cuba and how technicians 
will be trained. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, there may be long-term negative repercussions involving the United 
States in international Olympic circles if some of these problems don't get 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
"Some nations in Latin America that have been opposed to the United States or 
U.S. policy will use this unfairly to argue that the U.S. government is against 
sport," said U.S. Olympic Committee President Robert Helmick. "The problem is a 
lot of sports leaders around the world will buy it. So if indeed there are a 
series of problems that are not resolved, there could be repercussions and they 
could reflect upon the Olympic bids of our cities." 
</P>
<P>
One of those cities is Atlanta, which is locked in a multi-million dollar 
battle with five other cities for the 1996 Summer Olympics. The International 
Olympic Committee will choose the winner this September. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, this is not helpful," said Doug Gatlin, executive director of the 
Atlanta Organizing Committee. "We would like the embargo to be lifted for 
international sport. The bad news is (the Pan Am Games situation) might reflect 
badly on us even though we are opposed to the embargo." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, sports and politics have collided in the international arena, this 
time the competition among the 38 nations of North, South and Central America 
in the year preceding the Olympics. With Cuba hosting its first major 
international sporting event since Castro took over in 1959, policies that have 
been in place for decades for U.S. business are coming into play for U.S. 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official who wished to remain anonymous said, "We support 
U.S. participation in a sporting event, but we are not going to turn our 
foreign policy upside down for it." 
</P>
<P>
The problems are multiple; potential solutions confounding. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies are not allowed by law to trade with Cambodia, Vietnam, North 
Korea or Cuba without a license. The Treasury Department is responsible for 
enforcing the embargo and granting those licenses. The embargo was designed to 
keep U.S. currency and-or goods that can be traded for U.S. currency out of 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Now, these goods include bowling alleys and drug-testing equipment. And it's 
ABC Sports that wants to pay Cuba a reported $9 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Bowling is trying to gain any recognition it can in the Olympic arena, so when 
it became a Pan Am Games medal sport in 1986 and the Cubans said they didn't 
have bowling facilities, officials thought they could help Cuba learn about the 
game and construct bowling lanes at the same time. The Brunswick Corporation 
offered to donate several used lanes and related equipment to a bowling 
facility to be built for the Games, according to Jerry Koenig, executive 
director of the U.S. Tenpin Bowling Federation. 
</P>
<P>
But the Treasury Department turned down Brunswick's request for a license. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't send the stuff to Cuba unless we brought it back, and it wasn't 
worth it to the company to do that," Koenig said. "Plus, if we took it out the 
Cubans would be left with an empty building. Those weren't the conditions that 
the Cubans agreed on going in." 
</P>
<P>
So bowling officials are scrambling to find a third country willing to provide 
the equipment and send it to Cuba. Bowling officials in Japan and Canada have 
declined, and Koenig said the latest hope is Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say our sport is in a state of limbo now, and it's unfortunate, because 
this would have been a great opportunity for us," Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard has provided the drug-testing equipment for almost every 
international sporting event in the last decade: the Olympics, the Pan Am 
Games, the World Cup of soccer. It usually sells the equipment to the 
organizing committee of the event, and the lab stays in operation after the 
event is over. 
</P>
<P>
Not this time, though. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit of a road block right now, although I do think we'll get a 
temporary export license to get the equipment in there for the Games and then 
take it out again," said Bud Bromley, major accounts manager for the analytical 
products group of Hewlett-Packard. "It's a political problem, and we understand 
it. The U.S. government is justified in dealing with Fidel Castro this way." 
</P>
<P>
It's possible the company will lease the equipment, valued at more than 
$500,000, to the Pan American Sports Organization, based in Mexico, Bromley 
said. There are other options as well. 
</P>
<P>
While he believes the lab will be in place in Havana in time for the Games, he 
is not as certain who will be administering and analyzing the tests. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually train local people to run the lab," Bromley said. "But this delay 
may mean we won't have time to do that and someone from the International 
Olympic Committee will have to run the lab." 
</P>
<P>
The most lucrative venture currently in jeopardy is ABC's contract to provide 
live TV coverage of the Games. In December, Capital Cities-ABC Inc. filed suit 
in the Southern District of New York against the Treasury Department seeking a 
reversal of a decision banning the network from paying about $9 million for the 
rights to the Games. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department said it would not allow the payment because it "would 
transfer very substantial sums to Cuba," wrote R. Richard Newcomb, director of 
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. He said the department considers 
the live telecast "an activity related to entertainment," not news reporting or 
news gathering. The stationing of production personnel in Cuba also concerns 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Solomon, senior vice president for ABC Sports, said the network doesn't 
understand the "inconsistency inherent in the ... decision to allow the U.S. 
team to compete in Cuba but to deny U.S. citizens their First Amendment right 
to view U.S. athletes in competition." Solomon also said ABC objected to being 
allowed to pay for videotaping the Games, but not for a live broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"This artificial distinction just does not make sense to us," Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon said a hearing on the suit is tentatively set for March 9. He said he 
hopes for a decision on the matter a week or so after that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not too late, but it will be a struggle (to put on a telecast) starting 
in mid-March," Solomon said. "We could probably even do it in early to 
mid-June, but that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
The USOC wants to see the Games on TV. "It's very important to the American 
public and to the loved ones of the athletes to see the events on TV, 
particularly since they can't go and watch," Helmick said. "We just hope it can 
be worked out between ABC and the Treasury Department." 
</P>
<P>
There will be restrictions on U.S. Olympic officials and athletes in Havana. 
They will have to report how much money they take into Cuba -- and how much 
they take out two or three weeks later. No credit cards will be allowed. And, 
unless restrictions ease, only the official U.S. delegation -- no families, no 
friends -- will be allowed in, Helmick said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the USOC, fearful of problems with communications and equipment, is 
considering anchoring a ship off the coast of Havana to house some of its 
personnel (non-athletes) and avoid irritations. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is emotional. Elliot Abrams, former State Department assistant 
secretary for Inter-American affairs and now a Washington attorney, said the 
Games should never have been granted to Havana. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very striking, in this moment of mass democratization in Latin America 
and around the world, that the Games will be held in one of the very few 
dictatorships in the hemisphere," Abrams said. "It's disgraceful to hold the 
Games in Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
Castro has angered the Olympic community by boycotting the last two Olympic 
Games. Cuba joined the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and 
skipped the 1988 Games for political reasons. Some thought Cuba might lose the 
Pan Am Games for being a no-show in Seoul, but no movement to take away the 
event materialized.

ABANDONED BOAT GOES WITH FLOW; 
</P>
<P>
SAILING: SIX MONTHS AFTER CAPSIZING, THE PANDEMONIUM IS SPOTTED ON ITS WAY TO 
HAWAII. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pandemonium -- upside down, six months abandoned and all but forgotten -- has 
been found. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-foot sailboat was sighted by a freighter last week halfway between Los 
Angeles and Hawaii, bobbing toward the islands. It was about 700 miles from 
where it flipped on Aug. 4, 300 miles off San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year-old boat competed in the Transpacific Yacht Race from Pt. Fermin 
to Honolulu last July. A crew of five was ferrying it back to its home port of 
San Francisco when, without warning, its keel fell off and it slowly rolled 
over, with the 70-foot mast intact and sails attached. 
</P>
<P>
The crew scrambled first onto the hull and then into two inflated rafts. They 
were rescued late that night by a freighter after a Singapore Airlines flight 
picked up their distress signal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of fascinating that the thing's still afloat," said Desmond 
McCallum, the Los Altos doctor who leased the boat to another sailor for the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
But McCallum wasn't sure whether its sighting was good news or bad news. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure whose boat it is anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He might prefer that it belong to somebody else. Commercial Union, the San 
Francisco firm that insured the boat, paid a claim of $280,000 about a month 
after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's still his boat," said Stan Gibson, an attorney representing the firm. 
"When the underwriters paid him, they don't automatically own it. If somebody 
goes out there and brings it in, they would be entitled to a portion of the 
value of what they saved. It's not a fixed value." 
</P>
<P>
McCallum said: "The amazing thing is that nobody could find it before now. 
Right after it (capsized), two flights went out to look for it, although at the 
time the cloud cover was low -- about 500 feet -- and it was windy with a lot 
of whitecaps." 
</P>
<P>
With its white hull, the upside-down boat would be difficult to find in a sea 
of whitecaps. But the sea was calm and solid blue last Wednesday when the 
Matson Navigation Co.'s Maui, skippered by Capt. Scott Abrams, spotted it only 
four miles south of the Great Circle route shipping lane followed by vessels 
between Los Angeles and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams noted that the rudder was intact and the bare keel bolts still 
protruding, as the crew had described, and radioed Capt. Robert Buell, aboard 
the Matson ship Lurline two days behind. Buell, however, was unable to find the 
Pandemonium. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams and Buell took special interest in the boat because they are veteran 
Transpac sailors. Abrams' grandfather was a founder of the biennial event. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the route we take every week." Buell said. "We'll be looking for it on 
the way back." 
</P>
<P>
After the boat was abandoned, general speculation was that it would drift onto 
a beach in Mexico, if it stayed afloat long enough. 
</P>
<P>
But Buell said Monday from Honolulu: "The currents are more westerly than we 
thought. The pilot chart shows these currents pushing it directly for the 
Hawaiian Islands." 
</P>
<P>
At its current pace of three to four miles a day, it would reach or pass the 
islands in 250 to 300 days. 
</P>
<P>
"I would imagine once the insurance company gets wind of this, they may start 
looking for it," Buell said. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said: "I'd just assumed it was a goner. Now I'm very interested in 
looking at those keel bolts." 
</P>
<P>
He would like to determine why the keel fell off. The boat was built in Newport 
Beach, but the keel was made in Mexico and installed in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum said: "I don't know if anybody's going to go and try to drag a boat 
1,200 miles (to port). We had a salvage group already to go and recover it if 
we could sight it again. Six months later, I don't know. Anything that's 
metallic is probably gone. And it's hard to know what the deck is like. Maybe 
the whole thing is OK." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Duffield Jr. of Duffield Marine, which supervised the construction in 
Newport Beach, said: "I never heard of any boat surviving six months at sea 
upside down with the mast up and the sails up. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a one-inch-thick balsa-core hull. I took a one-foot-square section of 
the hull and threw it in a tub of water, and it floats . . . floats great. Most 
of the hull has enough core in it that it's probably contributing to the 
flotation. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) I have visions of the (700-pound) motor hanging upside down for six 
months and falling out of the mounts and crashing through the deck. It's 
probably an eerie-looking thing." 
</P>
<P>
It seems unlikely that the boat could be salvaged at its present location. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably so full of water that if you tried to tow it, it would rip it 
apart," McCallum said. "The divers we had organized were going to try to put 
air bags inside of it and try to saw off the mast and get the thing to right 
itself so they could tow it like a canoe. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose in another six months it might make it to Hawaii, and as it gets 
close it probably makes sense to try and salvage it."

QUINTIN DAILEY GETS ANOTHER CHANCE TO SILENCE CRITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quintin Dailey, 24 hours removed from the Continental Basketball Assn., stood 
at the free-throw line last Friday night at Indianapolis with seven seconds to 
play and a chance to give the Seattle SuperSonics a victory. 
</P>
<P>
His presence there indicated two things: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The shortage of shooting guards in the NBA. The Clippers, Atlanta Hawks and 
SuperSonics, among others, have been searching for help, and the SuperSonics 
took a flyer on someone with a bad history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quintin Dailey is a survivor. 
</P>
<P>
He made the free throw against the Pacers, helping Seattle end a 12-game road 
losing streak. And the next night, he made six of 12 shots and scored 14 points 
in the SuperSonics' two-point victory at Washington. In the early stages of a 
10-day contract, Dailey again proved that he could play. 
</P>
<P>
As if there was much doubt about that. He averaged 16.1 points last season with 
the Clippers, but got more attention after being suspended for excess weight, 
the result of having gained 30 pounds during the season. People laughed at him, 
but the Lakers were impressed enough with Dailey's ability that they signed him 
to a one-year guaranteed contract last summer to back up Byron Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, people were laughing again. Dailey, at least looking trim again, missed a 
flight to Hawaii. He fainted during one practice. He missed the team bus to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
He never made it to the regular season, squandering what he and everyone 
involved agreed had been a great opportunity. He went to Sioux Falls, S.D., and 
the CBA to earn his way back. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I had to prove I could play," said Dailey, who turned 29 on Jan. 
22. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knew I could play. But I had to get by what people were saying -- 
that stuff about always being either overweight or unmanageable. That made 
people leery. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knew I had the talent to play in the NBA, but everybody wanted to 
make sure I was, you know, together." 
</P>
<P>
Dailey has always been open about his past drug problems, and frequently agreed 
at a moment's notice to do community relations work while with the Clippers. 
But he declines to discuss his experience with the Lakers, except to 
acknowledge that perhaps he wasn't ready for the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lakers are a professional team and they're only going to stand for certain 
things, especially from someone with my past," Dailey said. "In my case, they 
probably thought it was going to continue through the season. I have nothing to 
stand on except my previous three years." 
</P>
<P>
He says he holds no grudges against the Lakers or the Clippers, with whom he 
started more games last season than any other guard, only to have his option 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at this like every opportunity, like I'm going to make the best of it 
whether I stick with the team or not," Dailey said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in my life, it's a nice situation, because (the SuperSonics) are 
also looking at my passing and my defense, not just whether I can still shoot. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm looking at other things off the court, too, like my family. I'm not 
going to make basketball my entire life. I'm looking to survive for more than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the success of his San Antonio Spurs, Coach Larry Brown says there are 
times when he longs for the college ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who guided Kansas to the NCAA championship, said he can get more 
involved with the teaching aspects of the game as a college coach. 
</P>
<P>
"But I've got a college situation here in a lot of ways with all the young 
players," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs have become one of the top teams in the league, battling for the lead 
in the Midwest Division after finishing 21-61 last season. But their fans booed 
during a recent game. 
</P>
<P>
That had to do with a certain prominent fast-food chain's promotion, in which 
every fan in attendance gets a coupon for a free burger whenever the Spurs 
score at least 125 points. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 22, San Antonio tied a club record by beating Washington for its 16th 
consecutive victory at HemisFair Arena. But with 124 points, the Spurs dribbled 
out the clock rather than put up a meaningless shot in a nine-point game. The 
crowd booed the Spurs off the court. 
</P>
<P>
"They expected a shot to go up at the end of the game and they didn't 
understand why one didn't go up," said Red McCombs, the team's majority owner. 
"I'm not sure I understand why nobody put up a shot." 
</P>
<P>
Preparing to run for secretary of state in Massachusetts, Dave Cowens, 41, 
former Boston Celtic star, switched parties, from Republican to Democrat. 
Problem was, he changed registration Dec. 8, about six months after the 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"He got caught traveling," said Paul McCarthy, the Republican candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Cowens apparently was unaware of a law that says a candidate for a statewide 
office in one party cannot have been registered as a member of another party 
during the year before the filing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cowens: "I'm a novice at being a politician." 
</P>
<P>
That ought to impress the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Add Celtic alumni: Bob Cousy, a Hall of Fame guard, also spent five seasons as 
an NBA coach in Cincinnati and Kansas City-Omaha. It felt like 20. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have nightmares running all around the bed," he said, recalling his 
coaching days. "I started to have physical pain that was so bad I was having 
EKGs once a month. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had any health problems. My heart was strong, my blood pressure so low 
you couldn't find it. But while I was coaching, I literally couldn't eat a full 
meal without getting terrible cramps that would leave me crawling on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute I stopped coaching, all the problems went away. The best thing I 
ever did was to finally say, 'I quit.' " 
</P>
<P>
Al Bianchi, general manager of the New York Knicks, didn't try to hide his 
disgust when Knick forward Charles Oakley failed to make the Eastern Conference 
All-Star team while Dennis Rodman of Detroit was selected by coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"You could lock him in a gym for an hour by himself and he couldn't score 20 
points," Bianchi said of Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
What Bianchi failed to mention is that Rodman, one of the game's best 
defenders, would also hold himself to 18. 
</P>
<P>
Few franchises in sports are more image-conscious than the Charlotte Hornets, 
whose owner, George Shinn, is so concerned with having a clean team that he 
does not allow his players to wear beards and mustaches. That makes what 
transpired last week all the more surprising. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Dick Harter was fired as coach, with his players complaining about a 
lack of communication. It was the way it happened -- allowing Harter to 
accompany the Hornets to San Antonio for a game and then handing him his 
walking papers hours before the game. And on the same day Harter's brother died 
of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The organization had to cringe at the fallout. Beyond the appearance of 
insensitivity, there were reports of Harter ripping the players, and vice 
versa; Shinn ripping Harter, and vice versa. Nobody let the moment pass with 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a strained relationship with Dick," Shinn said. "Everyone did. 
Unfortunately, he had very much an us-against-them attitude. He even made me 
uncomfortable going into the dressing room after games."

76ERS EXTEND STREAK TO 12 WITH WIN OVER JAZZ

<P>
The Philadelphia 76ers won their 12th consecutive game, the longest winning 
streak in the NBA this season, by defeating the Utah Jazz, 114-89, Monday night 
at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers maintain their share of first place in the Atlantic Division with the 
New York Knicks, who beat Miami Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Hersey Hawkins scored 20 points to lead six players in double figures, and 
Charles Barkley scored 16 in 27 minutes despite a strained leg muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone had 29 points for Utah, which lost for only the third time in 14 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the game developed early. Barkley had two steals and four points to 
spark the 76ers as they scored the last 14 points of the first quarter to lead 
35-21. 
</P>
<P>
"We're clicking on all cylinders right now," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
New York 116, Miami 107 -- The Knicks, taking 19 fewer shots than the Heat and 
getting 16 fewer offensive rebounds, still won at New York to improve to 20-2 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was Patrick Ewing, who blocked a career-high nine shots and 
scored 18 of his 24 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Oakley scored 24 points and Mark Jackson had 21 points and 12 assists 
for the Knicks, who shot 58.1% to 43.8% for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
But the Heat stayed close for most of the game with tenacious rebounding and 
defense. Miami took 105 shots to 86 for New York, beat the Knicks 24-8 on 
offensive rebounds and forced 23 turnovers to 14. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 101, Charlotte 100 -- Olden Polynice had a free throw and tip-in in the 
final 31 seconds at Charlotte, N.C., as the SuperSonics handed the Hornets 
their eighth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle won its third consecutive road game after losing 12 in a row. The 
Hornets lost their seventh consecutive home game, and their 14th in the last 15 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 135, Golden State 129 -- Bernard King scored 30 points, Ledell 
Eackles 29 and Jeff Malone 28 at Landover, Md., as the Bullets ended the 
Warriors' four-game winning streak.

Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers said Monday he will bow to league 
pressure and play in the NBA All-Star game on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley announced Sunday he would skip the game to rest, saying a strained leg 
muscle had nagged him for several days. 
</P>
<P>
He heard from the NBA Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to play," he said. "They gave me a play-or-else deal. They said I 
would be suspended next week if I play this week and miss the the game. I don't 
agree with them, but I've got to go." 
</P>
<P>
The injury, originally diagnosed as a groin pull, hobbled Barkley on Sunday. In 
a 114-89 victory over the Jazz on Monday, he played only 27 minutes but scored 
16 points and had eight rebounds.

Five hours up through the brown, dormant winter of the San Joaquin Valley, then 
west through the Coastal Range to the Monterey Peninsula, 180 professional 
golfers were teeing it up last weekend with Clint Eastwood, his show biz pals 
and assorted lions of industry on some of golf's lushest layouts. 
</P>
<P>
There was $1 million in prize money available, along with business contacts 
that help solidify the golfers' financial futures. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dalpos knows the difference between his game and those that were played at 
Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"One shot," he said. "I averaged 72 (strokes per round) last year on the (PGA) 
tour, and I had to go back to qualifying school. One shot a day. Four shots a 
round. Make a putt, anything." 
</P>
<P>
The putt goes in the hole, and he's taking home six-figure payoffs, and writing 
magazine articles about getting up and down from a greenside bunker, with 
golfers reading and emulating his technique because they've seen it on 
television on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The putt misses, and he makes $28,821, 182nd on the money list; and he was in 
Bakersfield last week, playing in the inaugural tournament of the Ben Hogan 
Tour, which advertises itself as producing the "champions of tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
It's a 30-tournament cross-country traverse, with stops ranging from 
Bakersfield to Falmouth, Me.; from Ft. Myers, Fla., to Boise, Ida. The 
tournament sites are close enough to be driven between to save money, and also 
are placed well out of the drawing range of PGA, Senior and LPGA tour events. 
</P>
<P>
At each tournament, golfers pay a $250 entry fee -- compared to $100 on the 
regular tour -- to play for $100,000 total, $20,000 to the winner. The money 
has been posted by the Ben Hogan Co. on a five-year contract, and the PGA Tour 
underwrites the expenses of administration along with local sponsoring 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA Tour also provides the bait that brings most of the 132 entrants. The 
top five money winners on the Hogan tour will advance to next year's PGA Tour 
without having to endure the 108-hole qualifying tournament and regional 
qualifying steps over which so many trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to the Player Advisory Council and asked them what it would take for 
players of the Hogan tour to earn their way to the regular tour," said Jay 
Edgar, executive director of the Hogan tour. "They said, 'We feel like after a 
player plays in 30 events and he's risen to the top of the money list, he's 
proven that he can play this tour.' " 
</P>
<P>
The exemption easily outweighs the Hogan tour's prize money. 
</P>
<P>
"I can play maybe 12 to 15 of the regular tour events," Greg Ladehoff said. 
"But if I'm in the top five on this tour or close to it near the end of the 
season, I may skip regular tour events and play the Hogan." 
</P>
<P>
Being able to bypass the qualifying tournament would seem to be in Ladehoff's 
best vocational interests. He made about $62,270 on the regular tour a year ago 
-- including $2,000 at Pebble Beach -- but that wasn't enough to put him on the 
list of 125 players who keep regular tour status. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed well on target toward renewing his tour card in the qualifying 
tournament at Woodland Hills in Houston, but a final-round 79 -- "I had three 
water balls and one out of bounds," he said -- brought him back to earth. The 
top 50 and ties in the qualifying tournament earned PGA Tour cards. 
</P>
<P>
Ladehoff missed by one shot. 
</P>
<P>
The Hogan tour is a brainchild of PGA Tour Commissioner Deane Beman, who sold 
his players on the idea of a financial commitment that Edgar said will be about 
$1.3 million for the five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted a system for younger players to play and experience the 
game," Beman said. "We decided to take a regular PGA event and scale it down a 
little. Selling it to the players was the easiest part." 
</P>
<P>
For all of the questions that preceded the Hogan tour, one never involved 
players. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be an endless supply of people who can shoot an occasional 68 
and would like to make money doing it. 
</P>
<P>
For many of those golfers, California's Golden State Tour or Florida's Space 
Coast Tour, or foreign tournaments presented the only opportunities to hone 
their games. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tremendous amount of golf talent," Edgar said. "We asked ourselves, 
'What can we do to keep those players from having to go overseas?' " 
</P>
<P>
When 264 players showed up to pay $100 to play in a Monday qualifying round for 
eight spots in the 132-player Bakersfield tournament, Edgar and other Hogan 
tour officials smiled. So did the Southern California PGA, beneficiary of the 
$26,400 qualifying money. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure is a throwback to the days of the golf rabbit, a player who went 
18 holes on Monday, hoping to get into a tournament, then, if he missed, hopped 
away to the next site to try again. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar sees the Hogan tour in nostalgic terms, from the Monday qualifying to the 
sites chosen -- many of them had tournaments until the tour became so expensive 
that it moved to larger venues -- to many players staying in sponsors' homes 
and sharing cars for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, the Bakersfield Open paid in both cash and local currency to 
golfers passing through. Jack Fleck won the tournament in a one-hole playoff 
against Bob Rosburg and collected $3,500 and a year's worth of oil well 
royalties. Rosburg got $2,300 and a steer. Jim Ferree won $1,800 and a bale of 
cotton for finishing third, and Gay Brewer $1,200 and two sheep for fourth. 
</P>
<P>
It was a sign of the times, and so was last week's effort. The inaugural Hogan 
event raised more than $100,000, with money going to a scholarship fund and the 
Special Olympics. Other charities will benefit at the tour's other sites. 
</P>
<P>
For all of the emphasis on youth, there is a remedial aspect to the idea of the 
Hogan tour. The Bakersfield tournament included golfers from several 
categories, from the PGA Tour qualifying school to a separate Hogan tour 
qualifying tournament to older PGA Tour players down on their luck. 
</P>
<P>
The field included Mike McCullough, who collected $17,500 for finishing in a 
tie for 15th at Pebble Beach a year ago, and who has 18 years on the regular 
tour, as well as Bob Lunn, who won the 1971 L. A. Open at Rancho Park, and 
there were better-known veterans such as Peter Oosterhuis. 
</P>
<P>
There is a separate category for golfers 40-49 who want to get their games 
prepared for the Senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
For many, it's a comedown after playing on the PGA Tour. For others it's an 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm getting better at this game," said Dalpos, "I want to keep up with 
the game. It's something I like to do. I think every player has said, 'That's 
it. I'm done,' and I have to (eventually). But I don't want to quit." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he was playing Bakersfield last week, searching for that one stroke 
that he says kept him from playing Pebble Beach.

L.A. CUTS OFF FUNDS FOR POVERTY PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: CITY SAYS IT HAS BEGUN A CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST INQUIRY INTO DUAL 
ROLE PLAYED BY BISHOP H. H. BROOKINS IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES ORGANIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing conflict-of-interest concerns, city officials said Monday that they have 
cut off funding to a poverty program formerly headed by Bishop H. H. Brookins 
and housed in an office complex he secretly owned and renovated with city 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The action was taken following inquiries from The Times about the 10-year-old 
South Los Angeles Development Corp., which has received more than $500,000 in 
federal funds through the city. 
</P>
<P>
The program has a long history of problems, ranging from poor bookkeeping and 
failure to pay taxes to theft of public funds, according to a state audit and 
city investigative reports. 
</P>
<P>
Two former employees of the agency were convicted of operating a payroll 
kickback scheme in 1986. One of the employees earlier was operating his own tax 
preparation business out of the same office as the city-funded program, city 
records show. Brookins was not implicated in any illegality. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Monday they have launched a conflict-of-interest 
investigation involving Brookins' dual role as an officer of the poverty 
program and as its landlord. Tens of thousands of dollars in rent since 1983 
may have gone to the bishop, according to Susan Cleere Flores, who oversees the 
program. Such interlocking arrangements are strictly prohibited by city 
contracts, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins said he was unaware that he had a possible conflict. "If that is the 
case, I will find a way to pay the city back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During questioning by members of a City Council committee, Community 
Development Department officials also announced Monday that they are conducting 
a full review of the controversial, $336,000 city-funded renovation of 
Brookins' office complex on Crenshaw Boulevard in Southwest Los Angeles. The 
Community and Economic Development Committee set a Feb. 28 meeting to receive 
more information. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of areas we need to further investigate," said Parker 
Anderson, general manager of the department. Among those, Anderson said, is 
when -- and if -- Brookins returned nearly $30,000 in city construction loan 
funds that district attorney's investigators say he used for "personal 
obligations." 
</P>
<P>
Brookins said in an interview that he does not recall using the $30,000 for 
personal matters and said he has not "taken a dime" from the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last week that Brookins, a respected leader of the African 
Episcopal Methodist Church and longtime political mentor of Mayor Tom Bradley, 
obtained the $336,000 loan of federal funds through the city to improve the 
Crenshaw facility. 
</P>
<P>
The loan documents signed by Brookins indicated that the property was owned by 
an AME church corporation, but, according to the secretary of state's office, 
the corporation never existed. The refurbished building was later transferred 
to Brookins and leased out for $10,000 per month, while the struggling city 
program was shifted to a dilapidated office next door. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins now holds title to the complex, which loan records show is worth about 
$1 million. City administrators say they never would have financed the 
renovation had they known Brookins owned the building; they said they would not 
use public funds to benefit a private property holder. 
</P>
<P>
City administrators told The Times that Bradley special assistant William 
Elkins intervened on Brookins' behalf. Elkins denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has denied any role in the Brookins matter. On Monday, the mayor 
indicated that he did not intend to look further into Elkins' involvement. "I'm 
not going to be trying to play God," he said, referring to the conflicting 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The loans were investigated by the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office, but the case was dropped last year because the statute of limitations 
for fraud and embezzlement had expired, prosecutors said. Officials at the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development now are reviewing the loans. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins launched the nonprofit South Los Angeles Development Corp. (SLADC) in 
1979 with $225,000 in state seed money provided by then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr., a political ally. The corporation later received about $2 million in 
federal, state and city funds. 
</P>
<P>
The goal was to create a model urban center for job training, small business 
development and for education and housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins was prominently featured in early promotional materials for the 
program and served as president or chairman until several months ago. But 
Brookins insisted in a telephone interview with The Times that he had "nothing 
to do with the running of SLADC." 
</P>
<P>
"It caused all kinds of headaches," he said. "It was so frustrating I don't 
want to get into it. . . . I was trying to do good things for the community. . 
. . I thought people were getting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Now comes out that it is a sordid program," Brookins said. "People abused me 
and misused me." 
</P>
<P>
From the start, SLADC was plagued by allegations of poor management. A state 
audit in 1980 found record-keeping deficiencies and financial irregularities 
that "clearly indicates mismanagement," according to an internal Brown 
Administration memo obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
But the memo, from officials in the Department of Economic and Business 
Development to the Brown-appointed head of the department, Melinda Luedtke, 
said corrective measures must "fly politically" and noted, "We are aware that 
the governor wanted the bishop's help for various reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Through a spokesman, Brown said that the program was funded because the bishop 
was "doing some good things" and it was properly monitored. 
</P>
<P>
Percy Pinkney, a former special assistant to Brown who served as an adviser to 
Brookins' program, said the governor's office did not give any special 
treatment to Brookins' project and that problems with it were no worse than 
those of many community-based programs. 
</P>
<P>
However, three early directors of Brookins' program -- Ernie Sprinkles, Philip 
Fleming and Carol Best -- all told The Times they were concerned about poor 
financial controls. "There were . . . no procedures (or) guidelines that I knew 
of for any of their fiscal management," Best said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most serious problems involved a $300,000 city job training grant 
in 1983. Four people, including two former SLADC employees, were convicted in 
1986 in a payroll kickback scheme. More than $50,000 had been paid to phantom 
workers, friends and relatives who had been "placed" in jobs at non-existent 
companies, city investigators concluded. Investigators said they found no 
evidence that Brookins was involved. 
</P>
<P>
Walter E. Wells, a former SLADC employee who served five months in jail for his 
part in the payroll scheme, also was involved in another controversy a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, city monitors discovered that Wells was running his private tax 
preparation service out of Brookins' office complex while working for a 
city-funded program intended to help poor high school students get into 
college, records show. Wells acknowledged to city monitors that some of his tax 
clients were being charged, and he was ordered to move his tax preparation 
business. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Wells denied receiving kickbacks or doing anything 
improper and said that he offered his tax service free to poor clients of the 
city program. 
</P>
<P>
The SLADC program was scaled back sharply in the mid-1980s, after the criminal 
investigation and poverty program cutbacks. In recent years, only the city's 
current $83,000-a-year student assistance program has remained. 
</P>
<P>
That program was put on probation in 1987 and 1988 for serious management 
problems. Among other things, monitors found that files for 222 clients were 
missing. Those problems eventually were resolved, but funding has been 
temporarily cut off in recent years, city records show, for failure to pay 
federal payroll taxes and discovery that the program failed to maintain its 
nonprofit corporate status with the state. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the program say that, despite problems, it has provided a variety 
of needed services. Program brochures claim that hundreds of clients received 
jobs, and records submitted to the city indicate that since 1983 several 
thousand needy students have received assistance in applying for college. City 
monitors said Monday that they will attempt to verify the services were 
provided.

posting in Europe, local recruiters say, is the Army's college fund, which can 
yield $25,000 in tax-free tuition for four years of service. Dana Parsons and

Delivering a devastating blow to Orange County's plan to build a new jail, a 
Sacramento County judge ruled Monday that a half-cent sales tax measure planned 
to help finance new criminal justice facilities is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors had planned to put the measure on the 
June ballot in hopes of using much of the estimated $126 million that it would 
generate to pay for a new jail in Gypsum Canyon east of Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
But Presiding Sacramento County Superior Court Judge James T. Ford ruled that 
state legislation enabling Orange County to put the tax proposal to a majority 
vote violated Proposition 13's requirement that a two-thirds majority approve 
new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely disappointing to me and I'm sure every supervisor in this 
county," said Sheriff Brad Gates of the decision. "Now we're left with very few 
avenues, if any, to resolve jail overcrowding. And they are so sorely needed." 
</P>
<P>
The decision also affects five other counties named in the enabling legislation 
-- Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura and Humboldt -- and now 
they, along with Orange County, will be forced to re-think their jail plans. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling comes as especially bad news to those counties because it 
reinforces a court decision last year that found San Diego's similarly 
constructed half-cent sales tax measure also unconstitutional. State Sen. 
Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who sponsored the enabling legislation, and 
county attorneys had thought that their measure was sufficiently different from 
San Diego's to pass muster in court. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Orange County and the other counties proposed creating 
jail-facilities commissions -- composed of private individuals as well as 
public officials -- to collect and spend new tax revenues. State courts have 
held that local agencies not authorized to levy property taxes are exempt from 
Proposition 13's two-thirds requirement. 
</P>
<P>
But the boards of supervisors were unwilling to cede their own authority to 
determine what new facilities were needed and where they should go, in effect 
leaving the commissions largely powerless. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ford called the proposed commissions "sham" agencies aimed at 
circumventing Proposition 13, according to Pierce O'Donnell, lead attorney for 
the plaintiff, Howard Jarvis Taxpayers' Assn., which filed suit last October. 
</P>
<P>
"I believed that the statute was patently unconstitutional from the moment I 
saw it," O'Donnell said. "The judge said . . . that the commissions were 
puppets on the strings of their county masters." 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell said that it was not every day that an attorney could save taxpayers 
$580 million a year in taxes, the estimated amount that would have been 
collected by the six counties had their sales tax measures passed. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 13 is alive and well tonight," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth, who favors building a 
regional jail in the desert rather than the one in Gypsum Canyon, said he was 
not surprised by Ford's ruling in light of the San Diego decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say I told you so, but . . . it's the same thing," Roth said. "The 
displeasure I have about (the decision) is that it affects not only Gypsum 
Canyon but also the financing possibility for the desert jail." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said that getting a two-thirds majority for a sales tax increase would be 
virtually impossible. But he said that two-thirds of the voters might approve 
general-obligation bonds to finance a truly remote jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that when you can tell people it won't affect your sales tax, that 
it's long-run, then they'll go for it," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel Adrian Kuyper said that he and his staff would study the 
decision before determining the merit of an appeal.

STATE PLANS HEALTH REVIEW OF MALATHION SPRAY SITES 
</P>

<P>
Countering charges that they have run roughshod over local concerns in their 
campaign against the Mediterranean fruit fly, state officials said Monday that 
they will set up a Southern California health advisory panel on the issue and 
conduct air and water quality reviews in spray areas this month. 
</P>
<P>
State health and agriculture officials disclosed the plans in morning-long 
meetings with a delegation of Orange County politicians. The local group had 
traveled to Sacramento to voice their anxieties about the anti-Medfly assault 
and present a platform for changing the eradication process. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the state's handling of the Medfly battle praised the new plans as a 
positive step in helping assuage public fears over the aerial spraying of 
malathion, but said it may be too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who led the delegation, said of 
the health panel, "that would have been great if it were done before the fact," 
rather than after malathion had been sprayed over the homes of hundreds of 
thousands of North County residents. State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who 
last week introduced two bills that would halt all aerial pesticide 
applications pending a review of the spray's health effects, said the state's 
new plan was a step in the right direction but does not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We need not only to monitor the water, but to stop the spraying and monitor 
the health effects of malathion," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion opponents who have questioned the state's assurances about the 
pesticide's safety have attacked the composition of its current scientific 
advisory panel in Sacramento, made up entirely of insect specialists, with no 
one from the public health or medical fields. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said that they are confident that both the health advisory 
panel and the air and water studies will confirm that the malathion policy 
poses no health risks and, in the process, may win over critics of the effort 
to eradicate the crop-attacking fly. 
</P>
<P>
While the state met little resistance in its first sprayings in the Brea area 
last year, the eradication's expansion into a 36-square-mile area around Garden 
Grove and Westminster has sparked widespread protests and ongoing legal 
challenges by some of the cities affected. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have stood by the spraying policy, calling it a safe and 
necessary means of protecting the state's $16-billion agriculture industry from 
the current Medfly infestation. 
</P>
<P>
But Rex Magee, associate director of the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture, said after a sometimes-tense meeting with Orange County 
politicians: "We've got to try and calm down the fears." 
</P>
<P>
The new panel -- to be formed as early as this week -- would be made up of 
county health officials from Los Angeles and Orange counties, as well as 
academicians and medical professionals from around Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The panel would have the dual mission of advising the state on the health 
implications of malathion spraying and of educating the public on its findings, 
said James W. Stratton, medical epidemiologist with the state Department of 
Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
However, some at the state level were reluctant to pursue the idea, despite its 
possible public relations benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people here just don't think there's a need for it," Rex R. Magee, 
associate director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture, said in an 
interview. "When this panel gets finished with its work, the conclusions about 
malathion safety are the same and you still might not do anything to ease the 
public's anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
In another tactic aimed at quelling public opposition, state officials said 
they planned to duplicate a study of malathion's effects on air and water 
quality that was done in 1981 during Northern California's Medfly infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald J. Oshima, branch chief of the state's environmental monitoring and pest 
management unit, said the state staff will place perhaps a dozen air quality 
monitoring devices during a two-week period this month in the Southern 
California spray zones. The units would be placed near hospitals, nursing 
homes, schools and other areas where there might be people especially sensitive 
to declines in air quality. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Orange County delegation, meeting with local Assembly members 
and senators, put forth an 11-point plan for legislative reform that included 
proposals for toughening the state's environmental review of the spraying 
policy, and speeding and improving notification of the public about the 
process. The plan got generally favorable response from more than a half-dozen 
Orange County Assembly members and senators who met with the delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Later Monday, attorneys for the cities of Huntington Beach and Garden Grove 
took sworn depositions from state Medfly specialists. The depositions, to 
continue today in Orange County, are part of the first legal challenge in 
Southern California to the state's authority to spray malathion. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge in Sacramento refused last month to halt the first 
spraying in the Garden Grove area. But local attorneys, armed with new 
testimony from this week's depositions, plan to return to court Feb. 15 -- the 
date of the next spraying in the Garden Grove area -- to try again. 
</P>
<P>
In four hours of questioning, the lawyers tried to show inconsistencies in the 
state's method for determining spray areas and its review of the health effects 
of malathion. Officials held firm in their testimony that the spraying poses no 
adverse health effects. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, meanwhile, a new organization called Orange County Citizens 
Against Malathion Spraying announced that it will try to persuade the Orange 
County Board of Supervisors not to extend the State of Emergency declaration 
handed down by Gov. George Deukmejian. The month-old organization represents 
several groups from 10 cities of Orange County that are concerned with the 
effects of malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"This (spraying) situation is unjustified, intolerable and dangerous to our 
health and property," said Bob Taylor, spokesman for the organization. "No 
government official should have the right to blanket us and our families with 
poisonous pesticides." 
</P>
<P>
He said that if the governor refuses to stop the spraying, the organization 
will consider actions that could include consumer boycotts of California 
produce and mass demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city councils of Huntington Beach, Santa Ana and Garden Grove 
took up the malathion issue in their meetings Monday night. A dozen local 
residents attended the Santa Ana council meeting, some wielding signs that 
read: "Stop Medfly Spraying." Councilman John Acosta had asked the city to 
place an emergency item on the agenda to examine the Medfly issue. 
</P>
<P>
"For all these years of spraying, nothing has been accomplished," Acosta said 
in the meeting. "It seems that the only ones who benefit are the chemical 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors is scheduled to decide today whether to renew 
the declaration of emergency. And tonight, a group of local residents are to 
appear before the Fullerton City Council to push for passage of a resolution 
asking the state to seek alternatives to aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Board of Supervisors on Monday expressed a wait-and-see attitude 
on the state's new plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I will listen to the presentations by the state officials, weigh them and make 
a decision," said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, noting that he has listened to 
arguments from both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-square-mile area of North County that includes parts of Brea, La Habra 
and Fullerton is scheduled for its fifth dose of malathion next Monday night. 
Parts of nine cities near the areas where two Medflies were discovered in 
Garden Grove and Westminster are scheduled for their second spraying Feb. 15.

30 HOLD SIT-IN TO DEMAND UCI HOUSING FOR GAYS 
</P>

<P>
About 30 students held a peaceful sit-in Monday at the office of UC Irvine 
Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, demanding that the university alter its housing 
policies so gay and lesbian couples can qualify for student family housing. 
</P>
<P>
The sit-in at the chancellor's office, which came after about 100 protesters 
staged a noontime demonstration in the administration building, was the first 
on campus since the Vietnam War era, university police officials said. There 
were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Peltason held two separate meetings with the demonstrators, who at various 
times chanted slogans, wielded placards and ate several pepperoni-and-cheese 
pizzas rushed in about two hours after the group moved into the building. 
</P>
<P>
While the chancellor acknowledged under questioning from the students that he 
does not consider homosexuality immoral and would not retaliate against 
students or faculty involved in the protests, he offered little else to assuage 
their frustration and anger. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Peltason said that the protesters should pursue the issue "through the 
civil process" to change California's legal definition of marriage, which does 
not apply to homosexual couples. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that this demonstration is more than a political demonstration," 
Peltason said in a written statement Monday. "It is a genuine and courageous 
expression of a need to be recognized -- a need for acknowledgement that gay 
and lesbian partnerships are as meaningful to them as marriages are to those 
persons who have the option of getting married." 
</P>
<P>
He also said the university has never had a policy exception that allowed 
homosexual or other unmarried couples to room at the university's family 
housing quarters, even though at least three lesbian couples are now living at 
the 860-unit Verano Place apartments. None of the couples is being asked to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Other university officials said sympathetic campus housing authorities had 
allowed several homosexual couples to rent low-cost family units, citing a 
policy exception that permits "non-traditional families." Under that exception, 
students can claim that their ability to attend the university might be 
jeopardized if they are not allowed to live with adults not related to them by 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the demonstrators, whose numbers included both homosexual and 
heterosexual students, came away from the day ready for a drawn-out fight. 
</P>
<P>
The rally and sit-in were the start of a week of protests to spotlight the 
university's reluctance to make family housing available to homosexual and 
other "non-traditional" couples. 
</P>
<P>
Students are planning to set up a "shanty town" outside the administration 
building Wednesday and hold a noon rally on Thursday. Organizers also said they 
have been in contact with peers at UC campuses throughout the state in hopes of 
sparking similar protests. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Peltason) gets enough pressure on him, he'll buckle," Nicolas Martinez, a 
co-chairman of the Gay and Lesbian Student Union, said during the noon rally, 
which drew dozens of students armed with placards carrying slogans such as 
"Destroy Homophobia, Not Homes." 
</P>
<P>
While unmarried heterosexual couples can become eligible for resources such as 
student family housing simply by being married, Martinez noted that homosexual 
couples "don't have that option." 
</P>
<P>
The sit-in occurred after a 90-minute demonstration in the administration 
building's lofty inner atrium broke up. As the crowd dispersed, more than two 
dozen students, many of them undergraduates, huffed up several flights of 
stairs to Peltason's fifth-floor office, chanting the entire way. 
</P>
<P>
Peltason said the issue surfaced in December when he read a news account of a 
demonstration in Berkeley that quoted protesters who suggested that UC Irvine 
was already allowing "non-traditional couples" to room together in family 
housing quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Surprised by the story, he asked administrators to clarify the matter. Only 
then, campus officials said, was it discovered that homosexual couples were 
inappropriately being allowed into family housing under the hardship exception, 
which was designed for situations involving handicapped students or other 
extreme cases. 
</P>
<P>
Student leaders, however, have contended that Peltason buckled under pressure 
from administrators of other UC campuses. Peltason denies that charge. 
</P>
<P>
When gay and lesbian student leaders learned of the shift, they began mustering 
their forces and held several protests in late January. The demonstrations are 
happening just three months after Irvine voters narrowly approved a ballot 
measure that stripped gay rights protections from city anti-discrimination 
laws.

'WHITE HOLE AREA' ZONE RULING DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday delayed a decision on whether to modify the zoning 
of a vast area of former wetlands, a controversy which has brewed for more than 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, now set for a vote on Feb. 20, would impose new restrictions on 
225 acres. 
</P>
<P>
City planners say it would protect critical wetlands while still allowing 
owners of the property to propose some development. 
</P>
<P>
The zone change formally designates as wetlands nearly all of the "white hole 
area" -- so called because years of controversy over its use has left it a 
white spot on city zoning maps. The area is a wide swath of largely privately 
owned properties along the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway, extending from 
Beach Boulevard to the mouth of the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
The change sets new restrictions on the use of the land, most of which 
environmentalists hope to restore to an active natural refuge for birds and 
other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
The area has emerged as a hotly debated battleground between environmentalists 
and developers, much like the fight over the Bolsa Chica Wetlands Reserve 
before a compromise on that area was reached last year. Although the state 
Coastal Commission has designated the white hole area as an environmentally 
sensitive region, the property owners have contended that they have a right to 
develop it and that most of the wetlands are in too bad a state to be revived. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of environmentalists, property owners and government officials was 
recently formed to work out an agreement that they hope, like the Bolsa Chica 
settlement, will be mutually amicable. The group, the Pacific Coast Highway 
Coalition, held its first meeting last month. JOHN PENNER

MAYOR FAR OUTPACES FOE IN CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Larry Agran, who is seeking reelection, has raised more than twice as 
much money as his main rival for the post, according to campaign disclosure 
forms filed with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Agran's forms show that he raised $36,654, almost all from small contributions 
by local residents, in the last half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Those donations brought Agran's war chest to more than $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
His only announced opponent to date, Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, who also 
was actively fund-raising, has raised only $16,658. All but $1,370 came from 
contributions of $100 or less. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan is a longtime rival of Agran, who was elected mayor in 1988.. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan concedes that ousting Agran is an uphill battle, and said she expects 
to be outspent in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry's an extremely astute politician," Sheridan said recently. "I don't 
underestimate him." 
</P>
<P>
Agran was unavailable for comment Monday, but a recent mailer indicates that 
he, too, is taking the race seriously. In it, he states: "The upcoming campaign 
is sure to be a difficult one." 
</P>
<P>
In the past seven months, Agran has spent more than $13,000 on the campaign, 
most of it on fund-raisers and the mailing. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Agran nor Sheridan has received any direct contributions from the 
Irvine Co. Agran has accused the company of working to support Sheridan and a 
"slate of candidates," but both she and the company deny the allegation. JIM

WILSON OPENS DRIVE FOR CRIME MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flanked by more than 100 crime victims and their relatives, U.S. Sen. Pete 
Wilson kicked off a statewide campaign Monday in Anaheim for a ballot 
initiative that mandates sweeping changes in California's criminal justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who is seeking the Republician gubernatorial nomination, is a key 
backer of the Crime Victims Justice Reform Initiative, Proposition 115 on the 
June ballot. He said the measure would ease the suffering of crime victims who 
often endure lengthy delays in court and must testify repeatedly before their 
assailants are brought to justice. 
</P>
<P>
Standing before a semicircle of people who have been victims of violent crime 
or who have lost loved ones to murderers, Wilson said California's criminal 
justice system is "needlessly lenient" on alleged criminals. 
</P>
<P>
At another news conference a few blocks away, Mark Siegel, a spokesman for 
Californians for Privacy, a coalition of groups opposing the measure, said the 
proposal would "whittle away" at women's right to abortion by scaling back the 
right-to-privacy clause in California's Constitution so that it does not exceed 
federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the possibility that the U.S. Supreme Court might reverse the 1973 
Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion, Proposition 115 is "dangerous 
enough that women should be alarmed," Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the profound changes in the criminal justice system proposed by 
Proposition 115, the debate over its impact on women's right to abortion has 
taken center stage since it qualified in December for the ballot with more than 
665,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents include the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood of Los 
Angeles, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology of California and 
Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, a Democratic contender for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the backers of Proposition 115 led the successful charge for the 
Victims' Bill of Rights in 1982, which mandated stiffer sentences for repeat 
offenders and broadened rules for the kinds of evidence admissible in criminal 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 115 would go further. In addition to sections designed to 
accelerate trials, it would increase the number of crimes subject to the death 
penalty and eliminate preliminary hearings for defendants who have been 
indicted by a grand jury. It also would impose stiffer punishments on those 
convicted of crimes involving torture and expand the definition of evidence 
that can be used against defendants at trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The criminal made us the victim and the justice system keeps us there," said 
victims' rights activist Collene Campbell, whose son was murdered in 1982 and 
whose brother, auto racing entrepreneur Mickey Thompson, was slain in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a living hell," said Ginny Petersen, who survived an August, 1985, 
shooting attack in Northridge by Night Stalker Richard Ramirez. "We don't want 
to take away anyone's rights. We just want to have as many rights as the 
defendant has." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Proposition 115 could not be used to restrict a woman's right to 
abortion. Even if the Supreme Court reversed Roe vs. Wade, it would take a 
successful initiative drive to change that right-to-privacy clause and outlaw 
abortion in California, an event that "ain't about to happen," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Siegel said the measure has other dangers. Through the elimination of 
preliminary hearings, defendants would lose their best chance to see the 
evidence, which might prompt guilty pleas, Siegel said. He said putting trials 
on accelerated schedules might also increase the immediate workload that the 
system has to handle, and increase taxes to pay for more courtrooms, judges and 
lawyers. CATHERINE GEWERTZ

TEACHERS PROTEST STALLED NEGOTIATIONS

<P>
About 60 teachers picketed in front of Dana Hills High School on Monday to 
protest stalled contract negotiations with the Capistrano Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers protested for almost an hour in front of the school before ending 
the demonstration in time to begin 8 a.m. classes. 
</P>
<P>
The school district and the teachers union are at an impasse concerning 
salaries and health care benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers, who have worked without a contract since last July, are seeking 
an 8.5% pay increase, said Ric Stephenson, president of the Capistrano Unified 
Educators Assn. The district has offered a 6% increase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The union also objects to district proposals for cuts in health care benefits, 
Stephenson said. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides are scheduled for a mediation hearing Feb. 13 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a mediator helped the district's classified employee union reach a 
contract agreement with the administration last week. 
</P>
<P>
The classified union, which includes secretaries, bus drivers and maintenance 
workers, will receive a 7.5% cost-of-living raise retroactive to the expiration 
of its contract in July. 
</P>
<P>
Stephenson said he hopes that mediation will help. "We would love for that to 
happen," he said. FRANK MESSINA

RIZZITELLO'S CASE MAY GO TO JURY TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: BOTH SIDES HAMMER AWAY IN CLOSING ARGUMENTS, WITH THE DEFENSE CONTENDING 
THAT A MURDERED MUSTANG BAR BOUNCER, GEORGE YUDZEVICH, SHOT WILLIAM CARROLL.

<P>
William Carroll, the major investor in the now-defunct Mustang topless bar, had 
no reason to lie when he accused Michael Anthony Rizzitello of shooting him 
three times in the head, leaving him permanently blind, a prosecutor told 
jurors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments at Rizzitello's trial on attempted murder charges, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans contended that Carroll kept quiet for 18 
months after the shooting "because he was scared." 
</P>
<P>
"He's afraid from the get-go," Evans said. "You gotta presume that they are 
going to come finish you off." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 57, was found in a pool of blood shortly after midnight on May 1, 
1987, in an empty parking garage near the Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
He refused to tell investigators who shot him until Oct. 6, 1988, when 
bank-fraud charges against him were reduced to a misdemeanor with no jail time, 
fine or probation. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said that the gunman had been Rizzitello, a reputed Los Angeles 
racketeer with a long record of arrests and convictions, and that Joey Grosso 
had held him down while the shots were fired. Grosso was convicted last year in 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll told investigators that he had initially kept silent because he feared 
that if he had been incarcerated in the bank-fraud case, Rizzitello would have 
had him killed in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
But in his arguments to the jury, Rizzitello's attorney contended that Carroll 
kept quiet about the shooting until he could make a deal with prosecutors -- 
naming Rizzitello in return for leniency in the fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
"Was there a deal made?" defense attorney Anthony P. Brooklier asked the 
jurors. He said the proximity between the time Carroll's case was decided and 
his meeting with investigators suggests that there was a deal. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors are unaware that Rizzitello, 62, is a reputed underboss in the 
Milano crime family in Los Angeles and has been arrested eight times in the 
last 13 years. Though he has been acquitted in his last three trials, 
Rizzitello was one of five Milano members to be convicted in a major 
racketeering case in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors are scheduled to begin deliberations today after receiving 
instructions from Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Rizzitello wanted to eliminate Carroll so that he 
could pressure bar manager Gene Lesher for a share of the bar's profits. To 
support that, Lesher testified that after Carroll was shot, Rizzitello used 
threats of violence to muscle in on Mustang profits. Lesher said he paid $5,000 
a week in cash to George Yudzevich, a bouncer at the club, who would pass the 
money to Rizzitello. 
</P>
<P>
The defense contends, however, that it was Yudzevich -- who has since been 
murdered -- who shot Carroll, and that it was Lesher and Yudzevich who cooked 
up the scheme to skim money from the club. 
</P>
<P>
Lesher testified that after the Carroll shooting, he was called to Las Vegas by 
Grosso and Yudzevich. He said they told him that Rizzitello was behind it. A 
few days later, Lesher said, Rizzitello ordered him to a meeting at the Balboa 
Bay Club, where he announced that he was going to cut in on the profits. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklier argued that it's fair to look at who had fled after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't Mr. Rizzitello who flew to Las Vegas immediately afterwards," 
Brooklier said. "It was Grosso, Lesher and Yudzevich." 
</P>
<P>
The defense's key witness was a dancer at the topless bar, who said Yudzevich 
told her that he had shot Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Evans brought in receipts to show that Yudzevich was still in 
Las Vegas at the time that the dancer, Marie McAfee, said she had talked with 
him at John Wayne Airport about the shooting.

DANA POINT MEDIAN PROJECT TO PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS TO CENTER

<TEXT>
<P>
Drivers seeking better access to the Pavilion shopping center near Dana Point 
Harbor may have an easier time soon. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Traffic Improvement Commission last week approved two concessions 
sought by the shopping center's merchants: a left-turn break through the median 
from northbound Street of the Golden Lantern and legal U-turns on Dana Point 
Harbor Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the median project will most likely be shared by the city and the 
merchants, according to Bob Sergeant, city engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants from the center, at the intersection of Street of the Golden Lantern 
and Dana Point Harbor Drive, had complained to the city for several months that 
access to their shops had been limited because no turn breaks existed in the 
street median except for the entrance to residential areas near the center.

GOP TREASURER CANDIDATE HITS RIVALS' ETHICS

Republican state treasurer candidate Angela (Bay) Buchanan criticized 
Democratic rival Kathleen Brown on Monday for a "clear ethics violation" in 
soliciting contributions from the investment banking community. 
</P>
<P>
Since the bankers manage the state's investment portfolio, Buchanan said, it is 
"blatantly unethical" for candidates running for treasurer to accept 
contributions from Wall Street officials. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan, a former U.S. treasurer from Irvine, said Brown is scheduled to hold 
a fund-raiser tonight that will include some investment banking officials. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's campaign office said the candidate was planning a fund-raiser in New 
York City, but they could not confirm whether it included investment bankers. 
Brown was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan has also complained about her Republican opponent, incumbent Treasurer 
Thomas Hayes, for raising money from Wall Street companies in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In officially declaring her candidacy at a press conference here Monday, 
Buchanan again vowed that she will not accept any contributions from the 
investment banking community. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the only candidate that can assure all Californians that, as treasurer, I 
will have no other agenda than to obtain the best possible deal for 
Californians," Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the day of political scandals, investigations, indictments and 
convictions," she said. "Californians should not be asked to tolerate any more 
special interest influence in positions of public trust."

NEWPORT HARBOR'S JOSH KLEIN GETS HIS KICKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE LINE;

HIGH SCHOOLS: GOALIE, ALSO A KICKER ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM, HAS LED THE SAILORS 
TO A THIRD CONSECUTIVE TRIP TO SOUTHERN SECTION SOCCER PLAYOFFS.

<P>
Josh Klein of Newport Harbor High School has all sorts of goals. 
</P>
<P>
But whether he attacks a goal or defends one depends on if it's football or 
soccer season. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, Klein is the kicker on Newport Harbor's football team. Each 
winter, he plays goalie for the Sailors' soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, a 6-foot junior, said scoring points in football is more fun than 
stopping shots in soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"In football, it's awesome just to look and see the points go up on the 
scoreboard," Klein said. "I never see that in soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Klein doesn't get a chance to score goals in soccer, but he doesn't give up 
many either. He had 13 shutouts in 18 games this season, breaking the school 
record of 12 set three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mark Payne, in his first year at Newport Harbor, said Klein is one of the 
main reasons the Sailors (16-3-5, 4-0-4) have clinched a third consecutive trip 
to the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Sailors, ranked ninth in Orange County, could clinch their first Sea View 
League title with victories over Saddleback today and University Thursday. The 
top three teams in the league qualify for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Most teams play with four defenders but we play with only three," Payne said. 
"We put a lot of pressure on our defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Josh took over the starting goalie position full time in our seventh game and 
he's been at the peak of his game ever since. He has a tremendous amount of 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
Kristian Ostberg, an exchange student from Norway, was the starting goalie in 
the Sailors' first six games. Klein replaced him when the Southern Section 
declared Ostberg ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
"It was because of some of his graduation requirements in Norway," Payne said. 
"We fought it and got Kristian reinstated. Then Josh came in from football and 
took over the slot. Now Josh is twice as good as Kristian." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor is averaging 2.1 goals while giving up less than one per match. 
Halfbacks Alex Opoulos (10 goals, 13 assists) and David Pattison (five goals, 
12 assists) have given Klein early leads all season. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the leads, Klein said playing goalie is still a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It requires a lot of thought," he said. "You have to know where the ball is 
all the time, even when it's not at your end of the field. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be quick, too. It's all about how fast you get off the (goal) 
line." 
</P>
<P>
Klein said the transition from football to soccer is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"In football, I don't run a lot in practice, I just kick," he said. "I'm not in 
best of shape. So when soccer starts, I have to start from scratch as far as 
conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
Klein said he's a better goalie than a kicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a better defensive player," he said. "I've been playing soccer so long, I 
guess the defensive things are embedded in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
But when asked about his future, Klein talks football. Recruiting letters from 
several colleges, including USC and Penn State, already have found their way to 
his mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
"Kicking in college seems to be the best thing right now," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
Payne said Klein has the talent to play either sport in college. 
</P>
<P>
"His opportunity is with football," Payne said. "There's more money in the pro 
ranks in football, if he does well in college." 
</P>
<P>
Klein already has shown that he has a decent kicking range. He made 13 of 21 
field goals last season, including kicks of 47 and 45 yards, for the Sailors 
(8-2). He also earned a spot on the all-state underclassman team. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like I did really well in football right off the bat," Klein said. "I 
didn't kick competitively until high school. I just kicked it around for fun 
when I was a little kid." 
</P>
<P>
Klein played freshman football and junior varsity soccer as a ninth-grader. He 
made the varsity in both sports his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
"Football looked like a lot of fun in high school," Klein said. "I thought I 
could be a kicker." 
</P>
<P>
Klein's roots in soccer go further back. He started playing the sport at age 5, 
after tagging along with his father, Larry, and brothers Jeff and John to local 
youth games. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff was a goalie," Klein said. "I watched him his first couple of years and 
it looked like a fun position."

The net-cutting ceremony was abruptly halted but Coach Rhett Heckel's 
water-soaked head told the story Monday night as Pacifica High School clinched 
its first Southern Section playoff berth in 17 years with a 60-54 victory over 
host Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved third-place Pacifica (11-9, 9-3) three games ahead of 
fourth-place Garden Grove (9-12, 7-5) with two games remaining. The top three 
teams in each league are guaranteed playoff berths.

Pacifica broke the game open in the second quarter by outscoring Garden Grove, 
10-4. The teams were tied, 12-12, late in the first quarter when Pacifica 
scored 17 consecutive points for a 29-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove failed to score until forward Mark Perry made a 14-foot jump shot 
with 1 minute 48 seconds left in the second quarter. Garden Grove never 
recovered, but managed to narrow the deficit to six points at the buzzer when 
Perry scored his 16th point. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time our school has qualified for the playoffs since 1973," 
Heckel said while being doused with water by center Mike Maher. But the 
celebration ended when Garden Grove administrators stopped Pacifica guard 
Gerald Hernandez in the midst of cutting down a net. 
</P>
<P>
And Pacifica's stay in postseason play may be short-lived if it continues its 
sloppy ballhandling. Pacifica committed 29 turnovers Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
When Pacifica successfully executed its passes, it usually got a 
high-percentage shot from Maher or teammate Randy Schulze. Schulze led all 
scorers with 22 points and missed only three shots. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Coach Dewey Van Cleave calculated that his team would have to win 
one of its two remaining games to qualify for the 4-A division playoffs, where 
40 teams are vying for 32 berths. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos 87, Los Amigos 76 -- David Green scored 26 points and Paul 
Preuss had 19 as Rancho Alamitos (17-4, 11-1) held off Los Amigos (1-18, 1-11). 
Los Amigos got within one point with about five minutes remaining, but Preuss 
made six of seven free throws and Eric Moore had seven of his 16 rebounds in 
the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 68, Santiago 55 -- Jim Barker had 20 points and seven rebounds and 
Jermaine Galloway had 11 points, nine rebounds and five blocked shots for 
Kennedy (14-6, 11-1). Mike Camasco had 15 points and 11 rebounds for Santiago 
(7-13, 3-9).

GRADCO REPORTS $1.4-MILLION LOSS IN THIRD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Gradco Systems Inc., a maker of paper-handling devices for copying machines and 
printers, said Monday it lost $1.4 million during the third quarter ended Dec. 
31, compared to a profit of $1.4 million in 1988. It was the company's first 
quarterly loss in years. 
</P>
<P>
For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, Gradco earned $550,000, 
compared to $3.9 million in the same 1988 period. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed the loss on what it called the "premature" termination of a 
major contract to supply a big customer. That contributed to a drop in sales of 
$10 million during the third quarter, to $20.5 million, from $30.4 million in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of $71 million during the latest nine months were also down from 1988's 
$86.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco said the downturn was temporary. The problems that caused the losses 
"might extend into the fourth quarter," the company said, adding that they 
"will not have a lasting effect into next year." 
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to the loss, the company said, was the decline of the 
Japanese yen against the dollar, which makes U.S. products more expensive in 
Japan, and delays by other big customers in bringing out new copying machines. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco is the world's largest supplier of paper-handling devices such as 
sorters and feeders for office automation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The company didn't say whether the loss contributed to the failure of a 
leveraged buyout by management in December. At the time, management blamed the 
growing unpopularity of leveraged buyouts for its inability to find a lender to 
finance the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Management is still pondering a buyout, Chairman Keith B. Stewart said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company said it is expecting a major restructuring of its 
manufacturing operations that would benefit it in the long run but which could 
result in a writedown next quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it has also been contacted recently by several interested 
buyers, but "no serious negotiations" are going on at this time.

PERKIN-ELMER SALE OF APPLIED OPTICS UNIT AGREED UPON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Perkin-Elmer Corp. said Monday that it has agreed to sell its Applied Optics 
unit to a Massachusetts firm for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
Applied Optics, which has 250 employees and yearly revenue of about $25 
million, is part of Perkin Elmer's government systems division, one of three 
units that the company decided to sell last year as part of a broad 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Another piece of the government systems group was sold to Hughes Aircraft Co. 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
George Olmsted, vice president of privately held, Westport, Mass.-based Optical 
Corp. of America, or OCA, said Applied Optics will operate as a separate 
subsidiary with current management. OCA, with about 70 employees, is actually 
much smaller than Applied Optics, which will be renamed OCA Applied Optics. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Devlin, currently general manager of Applied Optics, will become 
president of the OCA Applied Optics subsidiary. He said no layoffs or other 
consolidations are expected. 
</P>
<P>
OCA manufactures electro-optical components that are used in imaging systems 
for the medical, defense and telecommunications industries. Applied Optics 
primarily supplies optical sub-systems to defense contractors for use in 
weapons and space systems. 
</P>
<P>
Devlin said OCA's focus on the commercial market will complement Applied 
Optics' strength in the military market. He added that despite cuts in the 
defense budget, he is "very bullish" about the company's prospects for at least 
the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
OCA, which has a large corporate partner that Olmsted declined to identify, 
will pay for Applied Optics with a combination of cash and stock.

SENTENCING DELAYED IN RAMONA S&amp;L FRAUD CASE; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE JUDGE SAYS HE NEEDS TIME TO READ THE HUNDREDS OF REQUESTS FOR 
LENIENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The sentencing of two Orange County businessmen convicted of diverting millions 
of dollars from a Santa Ana thrift was delayed Monday after the court was 
inundated with hundreds of letters from friends, associates and supporters 
requesting leniency. 
</P>
<P>
John L. Molinaro and Donald P. Mangano Sr. -- former owners of Ramona Savings 
&amp; Loan -- were scheduled to be sentenced in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles following a conviction in October on more than 30 charges each of bank 
fraud and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
But federal Judge David V. Kenyon told a packed courtroom that he was 
postponing the sentencing until Feb. 13 to give himself enough time to read the 
letters and supporting materials. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 342 years I've been a judge," Kenyon said half jokingly, "I have never 
been deluged with so much material. I do not feel comfortable I can do justice 
here" without additional time. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano, 53, of Huntington Beach, expressed some disappointment with the delay. 
</P>
<P>
"I think delays are incredibly harmful. It takes a certain attitude to gear up 
for an ordeal like this," Mangano said Monday. "It's kind of like going into 
the Super Bowl with all the emotional pressure, and then they say the game is 
delayed because of rain." 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro, 49, of San Jose, wasn't at Monday's proceeding. He is being held at 
Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The trial of the two men has drawn attention because it is the first criminal 
prosecution of owners of a failed savings and loan in Southern California. And 
the sentencing of Mangano and Molinaro has generated an outpouring of diverse 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven E. Zipperstein has recommended that the two men 
receive 55 years in prison between them and be forced to pay restitution and 
fines totaling $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials -- including Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman William 
L. Seidman and Office of Thrift Supervision Director M. Danny Wall -- recently 
submitted letters supporting Zipperstein's request. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely egregious example of insider abuse in the savings and 
loan industry," said Mark Gabrellian, senior counsel for the FDIC. "It's almost 
a textbook case of insider fraud." 
</P>
<P>
Gabrellian was just one of several FDIC attorneys in attendance Monday. The 
FDIC has filed a separate $30-million civil suit against Mangano and Molinaro 
that is scheduled to go to trial in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Both men's attorneys claim that the government is using Molinaro and Mangano as 
scapegoats for the nation's thrift debacle, which is expected to cost taxpayers 
more than $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Those appealing for lighter sentences include Jerry Tarkanian, basketball coach 
at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and Susan Feliciano, wife of singer 
Jose Feliciano. Mangano once worked for Feliciano and has done volunteer work 
with Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
"The government's requests have been totally void of any compassion," said 
Gerald V. Scotti, Molinaro's attorney. He has asked Kenyon to sentence his 
client to between three and five years incarceration plus community service; 
Zipperstein's recommendation was 25 years in jail and $7.8 million in fines and 
restitution. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has recommended that Mangano receive 30 years in jail and pay 
$8.3 million in restitution and fines. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano is a quadriplegic, and his attorney has requested probation because of 
his client's health. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope Judge Kenyon would show some compassion to my physical condition, 
but more importantly, I would hope the judge would not be swept up with the 
sensational political hype that is surrounding the case and applies a sentence 
that is equitable with the conviction," Mangano said. "Naturally, I'm going to 
appeal the conviction." 
</P>
<P>
Ramona collapsed in 1986 and subsequently required a $65.5-million bailout.

B. LEE KARNS OFFICIALLY STEPS DOWN AS CHAIRMAN OF AILING COMP CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comprehensive Care Corp., the financially ailing alcohol and drug treatment 
company that recently moved its headquarters from Irvine to St. Louis, said 
Monday that B. Lee Karns has stepped down as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation accomplishes Karns' previously announced plans to withdraw from 
company affairs. Karns, 60, resigned in October as Comp Care's chief executive 
officer. Karns had been chairman since 1972 and will remain on the company 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Karns decided it is time for him to take a less active role in the 
business," said William James Nicol, Comp Care's president and new chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Several industry observers said they believe Karns' resignations will advance 
efforts to reverse the failing fortunes of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"It is part of the management reorganization plan: taking control away from the 
entrepreneurial founders of the company and giving it to people who can deal 
with the operational decisions facing the company today," said Richard Carpe, 
health care partner in the Costa Mesa office of Laventhol and Horwath. 
</P>
<P>
While Karns was not a founder of the company (he joined it in 1972 when it was 
three years old), he is credited with the creation of the CareUnit system for 
the treatment of chemical dependency under contract management programs offered 
in hospitals. That was a key to the company's success. Replacing him as 
chairman is Stanley R. Nelson, who has been a Comp Care director since March, 
1988. Nelson also has served on the board of a Comp Care subsidiary, RehabCare 
Corp. since 1987 and on the company's advisory board since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson retired from the Henry Ford Health Corp. in 1988 after a 17-year stint 
as chief executive officer. He is past chairman of the American Hospital Assn. 
and was the founding president of Voluntary Hospitals of America. 
</P>
<P>
David Langness, vice president of communications for the Hospital Council of 
Southern California and spokesman for Comp Care from 1980 to 1986, said 
Nelson's appointment as chairman will lend greater prestige to the company. But 
he said he isn't certain Nelson's expertise will solve Comp Care's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the salvation of Comp Care is definitely desirable. But I don't know 
at this point anybody can do it. It will be a very difficult task," Langness 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care, formed in 1969, gained early publicity for the treatment of alcohol 
and drug dependency problems of celebrities and experienced rapid growth. In 
recent years, however, the company has struggled because of greater competition 
and changes in insurance-reimbursement programs. The company reported a third 
quarter loss of $4.7 million and is in the process of selling its California 
facilities to pay off its debt. 
</P>
<P>
Last October the company announced that a crucial plan to merge with First 
Hospital Corp. of Norfolk, Va., had fallen through after one of First 
Hospital's bankers refused to provide financing for the deal because of Comp 
Care's deteriorating condition. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in November several CompCare shareholders said they were banding together 
to elect a new board of directors willing to consider a variety of options to 
solve the company's financial problems, including a large sale of assets. 
</P>
<P>
Les Livingston, spokesman for the group, refused to comment Monday on Karns' 
resignation.

LESLIE WEST TAKES HIS MUSIC, NOT HIMSELF, SERIOUSLY; 
</P>
<P>
ROCK: GUITARIST, WHO APPEARS TONIGHT AT THE COACH HOUSE, HAS LOST 85 POUNDS AND 
GAINED A NEW MONIKER: 'ALLIGATOR MAN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leslie West, the Alligator Man? The guitarist has an accent that suggests the 
closest he's ever been to the bayou is Queens, N.Y., yet he's the "Alligator 
Man" in a current record label bio, one which also proudly qualifies West as 
one of loudest guitarists in the history of rock. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all just Miles fooling around," West maintains, Miles being I.R.S. 
label head Miles Copeland. Although frivolity is a characteristic rarely 
attributed to Copeland -- not while terms like blunt and unrelenting are still 
in the dictionary -- he does seem to have his fun with West. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked with Miles about being obsessed with these alligators in Florida a 
few years ago, how they were almost extinct and now there's so many they snatch 
babies off porches," West said by phone from his New York home. "Then on this 
European tour I bought this pair of $600 alligator loafers, and they were all 
goofing on me. Miles said, 'Why don't you call the album "Alligator"? You can 
make more money on the merchandising than you will on the album. We'll get 
alligator this, alligator that.' " 
</P>
<P>
If his label boss wants to inject some whimsy into his career, that's fine with 
West. "I'm trying to have fun, too. I don't take myself seriously. I take the 
music seriously. So any which way I can have fun around it, I'll try. If I do a 
video for the album, I'll wrestle an alligator." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when West had albums named for his size; "Leslie West -- 
Mountain," the title of his debut in 1969, was a reference to his 
then-300-pound weight. He had been lead guitarist with the legendary New York 
club band the Vagrants, from which he was marked for a solo career by 
bassist-producer Felix Pappalardi, who had produced Cream. Pappalardi soon 
joined West to form the group Mountain, described by one critic as being "more 
like Cream than Cream." The band's third gig was in front of half-a-million or 
so people at Woodstock in August of 1969. 
</P>
<P>
West recalled, "It was real nervous playing in front of that many people so 
soon. I thought there were better festivals, really. I remember it as one big 
hassle, with so many things going wrong. We were lucky. The only time I 
remember things going right was Saturday night and that's when we got to go on. 
Friday and Sunday were disasters. I felt terrible for Jimi Hendrix; when he 
went on Sunday there was nobody left there to see him." 
</P>
<P>
Mountain hit the charts in 1970 with the crunching riff-rocker "Mississippi 
Queen." In the following years, West worked with Mountain, in a group with 
ex-Cream bassist Jack Bruce, and as a solo-billed artist (one 1975 LP was 
entitled "The Great Fatsby") with varying degrees of success. Then West 
disappeared from music for a time. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get my health sorted out, away from drugs and away from New York. 
I went to Milwaukee for about two years. There was a special doctor there I 
went to see. It's been over 10 years now since I stopped fooling with 
narcotics. (The treatment) saved my life. Some of these kids think the one goes 
hand in hand with the other, playing music and drugs. I just hope that they get 
the message." 
</P>
<P>
West said he doesn't link drug use to the playing of music so much as he does 
to the doldrums between gigs. "It seems when you're not on stage playing, or in 
the studio recording, that's when you get into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to always envy Phil Collins, always jumping from one project to the 
next -- everyone in Genesis does. Then my wife said, 'If you want to do these 
things, just get off your ass and do them.' And sure enough, I really found 
that out. People sit around and whine, 'Man, why does this guy get to do this 
and that?' It's because they get up and do it." 
</P>
<P>
West seems to be heeding his own advice. In addition to the "Alligator" album, 
he participated in Guitar Speak, an all-instrumental tour, devised by Copeland, 
which has provided a creative outlet to several of West's contemporaries. West 
has been on the road incessantly, including four tours in Europe in the last 18 
months. Two of those were Guitar Speak "Night of the Guitars" tours. 
</P>
<P>
"Those went really well," he said. "We were sitting on the bus -- Steve Howe, 
Robbie Krieger, Alvin Lee, myself, Phil Manzanera, Randy California and all -- 
and we realized there was over 130 million in album sales between us. You 
couldn't really throw your ego around, in company like that." 
</P>
<P>
West also served as musical director on Sam Kinison's hit remake of "Wild 
Thing" and on a Kinison version of West's own "Mississippi Queen," due out in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really proud of that. It's hard to reapproach something you had a hit 
record with, but we got a 20-girl black choir in there, and bagpipes instead of 
lead guitar. And Sam really came up with a great theme, about the whole rise 
and fall of the PTL thing." 
</P>
<P>
West's own album originally was going to be all-instrumental, until Copeland 
suggested that West include vocals. It was also Copeland who brought bassist 
Stanley Clarke and Concrete Blonde singer Johnette Napolitano into the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Miles is really great at coming up with that last little bit of icing on the 
cake, even when you think it's done," West said. "Some record executives you 
only see twice, when they sign you and then when they throw you off the label. 
Miles is there every step of the way." West said Copeland won't accept any 
nonsense "because I think the Police's first album cost him about six grand. So 
you can't go to him with 'Yeah, I need a quarter of a million to finish this 
album.' " 
</P>
<P>
Copeland has suggested that West host another Guitar Speak tour, this time 
showcasing younger guitarists. West isn't sure yet, however, which young 
players would belong in such a project. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think of Edward Van Halen as a younger guitar player, but he's 
getting on up there. And after Steve Vai and Edward it drops off drastically. . 
. . I read something the other day that was saying Van Halen's style in the 
hands of some of these young kids is turned into just a cliche. They all sound 
the same, all trying to do the hammering and the speed. There's no identity. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that most impressed me when I started was how, with Clapton, you 
could identify his sound like a signature. I wanted to have a sound you could 
identify like that, and that's what I work for. I never was a speed player. I 
only use my first and third fingers; I never learned to use all four like most 
normal guitar players do. So I tried to capitalize on my vibrato, and I have a 
great knack for getting unusual tones out of the guitar. I hope I'm regarded as 
a melodic guitar player, not just someone up there going 'weinie, weinie' all 
night long." 
</P>
<P>
While he said he's always searching for new tones and ways of expression, he 
isn't worried about losing his musical personality. "I've noticed a lot of guys 
from the '70s, when Mountain was active, are now trying to play stuff that they 
never played in the first place, and their credibility goes out the window. I'm 
not doing anything different than I did before, so in that respect it's been 
easy. I'm not having to force anything or pretend. I just do what comes 
naturally." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that may be less recognizable than West's sound at concerts is his 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I recently lost 85 pounds. I found out I had type-2 diabetes, so I started to 
watch my sugar. Once you decide to do it, it's easy. I ain't thin -- I still 
weigh 200 -- but I look like I lost a person."

The Orange County Chamber Orchestra demonstrated an ongoing commitment to 
enriching audience experience Sunday afternoon by programming one new work and 
one infrequently offered. And though the concert -- played in a chilly St. 
Joseph Center in Orange -- may not have been entirely familiar, it was not at 
all inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
As featured soloist, oboist Allan Vogel offered enticing entrance into Robert 
Cummings' Concerto for Oboe. The tonal work, receiving its first performance 
locally, is a celebration of melodic invention cloaked in traditional forms. 
Vogel brought an inviting tone, impeccable intonation and a masterly command of 
phrasing to its service. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence and energy permeated Vogel's approach. While in the foreground, he 
assumed sure control, speaking his line with sensitive attention to detail. But 
he also fit his part into the overall fabric of the piece with rapt attention 
to his orchestral partners. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber orchestra accompanied skillfully. Under the personable command of 
conductor Micah Levy, the ensemble rose to the playful challenge uttered by 
Vogel's unaccompanied opening notes, maintained vitality through an 
overabundant use of tremolo, and engaged in vigorous dialogue with the soloist. 
Throughout this, and through the entire program, Levy could rely on the 
expertise of solid chamber players to weave transparent textures. 
</P>
<P>
Orchestral members attended to clarity and detail with similar earnestness 
during the two 18th-Century works that flanked the concerto. In the less 
complicated Overture to William Boyce's "See, White Robed Peace," sectionally 
executed ornaments, in particular, attested to remarkable control. Thus 
nurtured, this early classical, English court music emerged graceful and 
intellectually untaxing. 
</P>
<P>
Haydn's Symphony No. 82, nicknamed "The Bear" for its whimsical fourth-movement 
dance over a drone bass, stood alone on the second half of the program. Here, 
too, players etched lines with sharp distinction, achieving momentum through 
energetic use of accents. The results were playful, polished and compelling.

VALLEY RESIDENTS TO VOTE IN JUNE ON PREFERRED TYPE OF RAIL LINE 
</P>

<P>
San Fernando Valley voters will be asked in June what kind of rail line, if 
any, they want built through the area, Los Angeles County supervisors decided 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The June 5 referendum, which will be advisory only, will ask voters to choose 
one of four alternatives: an elevated monorail along the Ventura Freeway from 
Universal City to Canoga Park, an underground extension to the Sepulveda Basin 
of the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail subway, a light-rail line in a 
shallow trench from North Hollywood to Canoga Park or no rail line at all. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 4 to 1, with Supervisor Ed Edelman, who represents part of the 
east Valley, dissenting. Edelman warned that delaying a decision until June 
could leave the Valley without any rail line. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which is building a 
countywide network of rail lines, is scheduled to make a decision as early as 
next month on the next line to build. Two other areas of the county are in 
competition with the Valley for the next line.

President Bush told Army troops at a desert training exercise today that 
"uncertainties and dangers" in the world justify increased military spending 
despite congressional criticism that his plans ignore the dismantling of the 
Communist empire. 
</P>
<P>
He praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's "proposals to expand steps 
toward political pluralism in the Soviet Union," and he added, "It is 
especially encouraging to see anything which might bring the day of true 
democracy a bit closer for the Soviet people." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bush said that even with the upheaval in the Soviet Bloc, "it is 
important not to let these encouraging changes -- political or military -- lull 
us into complacency. Nor can we let down our guard against a worldwide threat. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union still maintains formidable forces. Military challenges to 
democracy persist in every hemisphere. America must always be prepared to fight 
for freedom and security." 
</P>
<P>
As he began a three-day trip combining visits to defense installations with 
Republican fund-raising, the President defended his plan to make cuts in select 
areas -- such as military bases -- but to spend more on strategic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made his case as he praised the U.S. Army as "the premier land force in 
the world today." 
</P>
<P>
In remarks at the war games, he said, "The realistic battles you wage here 
forge tactical expertise, leadership and a fighting spirit. And that's what we 
need." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's talk was carried by radio to troops on both sides of the mock battle at 
Ft. Irwin's National Training Center in the remote Mojave desert. 
</P>
<P>
The President said his defense strategy is one of active forces that are 
"smaller but more agile and flexible," such as the contingent sent to Panama in 
the raid against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The President was expected to continue trumpeting his 1991 defense budget at a 
$1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner in Los Angeles tonight for Sen. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks at the war games, Bush declared, "As we enter the 1990s, the 
United States is shaping its military to meet a changing international 
environment, one that may be potentially safer but one that will almost surely 
have its share of uncertainties and dangers." 
</P>
<P>
He praised the Dec. 20, 1989, invasion of Panama that toppled Noriega as an 
example of the kind of role he envisions for the modern military. 
</P>
<P>
"When I decide we must use military forces to protect American lives and 
interests, I need to know -- as I did in Panama -- that you are ready and you 
are ready now." 
</P>
<P>
"Your work has never been more important," he told the troops, praising them 
for making a "lasting contribution to the preservation of peace." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Bush will visit Northern California's Lawrence Livermore 
Laboratory, the nerve center of Strategic Defense Initiative research. 
</P>
<P>
He also plans to give a foreign policy speech at the Commonwealth Club in San 
Francisco on Wednesday.

A fire broke out today in a train tunnel underneath the block-long 
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in mid-town Manhattan, sending smoke into the lobby of 
the hotel and halting trains on a major commuter line just hours before the 
evening rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
Police said 14 employees on the Metro North commuter line, which operates out 
of Grand Central Station, suffered smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
Rail officials feared the fire could have halted train service for several 
hours and play havoc with commuters trying to get home during the evening rush 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel spokesmen said there was no damage to the hotel and that the smoke was 
quickly cleared from the lobby. The fire was quickly extinguished.

A San Fernando Superior Court judge has ruled that a Canyon Country rancher 
charged with cruelty to animals for shooting a neighbor's dog had a right to 
kill the animal because it was trespassing on his property and threatening his 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John P. Farrell on Monday dismissed the charges against Ernest Lynn 
Reubens, 59, who shot Freckles, a brown and white springer spaniel belonging to 
4-year-old Erica Owen. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell said he based his decision on a section of the Food and Agriculture 
Code that allows livestock owners to shoot any dog trespassing on their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell dismissed the charges after the closing arguments in Reubens' second 
trial. The first trial ended in a mistrial in December. In that trial, Judge 
Ronald S. Coen ruled that the agriculture code section did not apply.

ASPIN HITS BUSH'S 'OLD THINKING' ON PENTAGON BUDGET

<P>
The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee accused the Bush 
Administration today of "old thinking" to justify building two new long-range 
nuclear missile systems that may no longer be required. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.) said the pro-democracy movements in Eastern Europe and 
Moscow are changing U.S. defense requirements, but the Administration is 
proposing a 1991 defense budget that does not reflect a reduced Soviet military 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
"There are new realities in the world, but no new thinking at home to match 
them," Aspin told Defense Secretary Dick Cheney at the outset of a hearing on 
the Administration's proposed $292-billion defense budget for the fiscal year 
starting Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, 
defended the budget proposal and argued that no major cuts in spending or 
changes in defense strategy should be considered until new U.S.-Soviet arms 
control agreements are concluded.

Florida's chief tax collector resigned her $85,292-a-year job today amid 
allegations she singled out a political opponent of her husband's for an audit. 
</P>
<P>
In stepping down, Revenue Director Katie Tucker told Gov. Bob Martinez and the 
Cabinet, "I emphatically and unequivocally deny that I have ever abused the 
powers of my office for any purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, 46, has headed the Department of Revenue since June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez and the Cabinet had suspended her with pay two weeks ago to allow her 
time to respond to a Florida Department of Law Enforcement report on a 1988 tax 
investigation of businesses owned by Donald G. Resha. 
</P>
<P>
The FDLE found that Tucker committed no crime but that she personally ordered 
the probe of Resha, who lost a 1985 election for the state AFL-CIO presidency 
to her husband, Daniel Miller.

A young woman threw a T-shirt at Queen Elizabeth II today and radicals 
campaigning for Maori rights heckled the British monarch during anniversary 
celebrations for the founding of modern New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The queen, who was accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, appeared shaken, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, a member of New Zealand's Maori minority, threw a black T-shirt 
after the queen disembarked from the royal barge that carried her to Waitangi, 
a village in the country's far north. 
</P>
<P>
Angry spectators seized the woman, aged about 17, dragged her from the crowd 
and handed her over to police. 
</P>
<P>
As the queen gave a speech marking the 150th anniversary of the Treaty of 
Waitangi, a pact between Maoris and British colonial authorities, a small group 
of radicals shouted "You already have everything! What more do you want, 
Elizabeth?" and "150 years of oppression!"

MANDELA EXPECTS NO TALKS FOR GUERRILLAS, DE KLERK

Nelson R. Mandela called President Frederik W. de Klerk's concessions to the 
anti-apartheid movement "courageous" but does not believe that they will lead 
to talks between guerrillas and the government, a Mandela associate said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, 
spoke after meeting with Mandela today. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Boesak said the jailed African National Congress leader described De 
Klerk's speech on Friday -- during which he legalized the ANC and lifted many 
emergency restrictions -- as "bold, courageous and hopeful." 
</P>
<P>
But Mandela does not believe that the speech cleared the way for negotiations, 
Boesak said. He "has not given up on any of his principles," Boesak added. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that although Mandela has presented demands to the government, he 
will accept freedom whether they are met or not. 
</P>
<P>
"His release is not in his own hands," Boesak said. "It is the responsibility 
of the South African government to release him." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mandela's wife, Winnie, had indicated that Mandela had demanded a 
complete lifting of the state of emergency as a condition of his release. 
</P>
<P>
Boesak said Mandela wants the government to end the 3 1/2-year-old state of 
emergency and release all political prisoners, including guerrillas convicted 
of acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
If these conditions are not met, Mandela would still agree to leave prison, 
"but he will state his unhappiness with the government," Boesak said. 
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers said today that Mandela will be released "very soon" but that 
the date hasn't been decided yet. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today Walter Sisulu, an ANC leader who was freed in October after 26 
years in prison, said the ANC has no intention of starting negotiations with 
the government and called on De Klerk to make further reforms. 
</P>
<P>
He said the ANC will pursue its guerrilla campaign despite De Klerk's decision 
to legalize the group, which had been banned since 1960.

Israeli soldiers sealed rooms in two Palestinian homes today in a new army 
policy that lets authorities close all or part of houses where residents are 
suspected of hurling rocks at troops. 
</P>
<P>
Another Palestinian was reported killed today when a civilian opened fire on 
rock throwers who attacked his truck in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy on sealing homes, which could affect hundreds of families in the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip, drew immediate criticism from civil rights groups 
and liberal politicians, who said the measure amounted to collective 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
In the nearly 26-month-old uprising, the army has razed or sealed hundreds of 
homes to punish Arabs suspected of fire bombings or serious attacks. But the 
penalty was not used for stone throwing, the most common tactic of teen-agers 
at the forefront of the uprising against Israeli occupation.

Salgovic, a former member of Slovakia's Communist Party Politburo who had close

crushed reform after 1968 known to have committed suicide after last fall's 
peaceful revolution.

At least two police officers have killed themselves since November, and former 
Prague Communist Party boss Antonin Kapek was hospitalized with severe injuries 
after trying to shoot himself last month.

Eastman Kodak Co. today announced a loss of $60 million in 1989's fourth 
quarter, only the third time in the photographic giant's history that it has 
reported red ink. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the loss, which totaled 19 cents a share, mainly to the 
costs of a restructuring program begun earlier in the year. It had earnings of 
$312 million, or 96 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sales for the fourth quarter totaled $4.89 billion, up 8% from $4.54 billion in 
the 1988 period.

West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called today for immediate talks with East 
Germany on combining their currencies in an effort to stop people from fleeing 
the economically crippled Communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl made the announcement during a meeting with leading politicians of his 
Christian Democratic Union and the allied Christian Social Union. 
</P>
<P>
He said details will be worked out when East German Premier Hans Modrow visits 
Bonn next week. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions on using West Germany's robust currency to revive, replace or 
reinforce the comparatively puny East German mark have grown more intense as 
the Communist country's economy nears collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the influential president of West Germany's central bank said it 
was too early for a monetary union that would make the West German mark East 
Germany's currency. 
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl also said he is opposed to the 
idea of introducing the West German mark as a parallel official currency in 
East Germany. He spoke to reporters after talks in East Berlin with Horst 
Kaminski, president of the East German central bank.

BUSH'S 1ST ECONOMIC MESSAGE SEES EVEN MORE GOOD TIMES 
</P>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, proclaiming the United States in "excellent economic health," 
sent his first economic report to Congress today. He promised to restrain 
government spending and push for tax cuts to foster even more prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he will continue his fight to get Congress to reduce the capital 
gains tax and pledged anew to fight protectionist trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
His message did not dwell on what many see as the biggest failures of the 
Reagan years -- the record federal budget deficits and the huge trade 
imbalances that transformed America from the largest creditor nation to the 
largest debtor country. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did pledge to deal with "inherited problems," but his formula for dealing 
with the budget deficit tracked Reagan's approach, promising to oppose new 
taxes while relying on economic growth and restraints in government spending to 
erase the deficit by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Many private economists say the Administration's economic outlook for the next 
five years is too optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration foresees no recession, with the gross national product 
expanding at annual rates of 3% or higher from 1991 through 1995. "Economic 
expansions . . . do not die of old age. A recession is not likely in the near 
term," the economic report states. 
</P>
<P>
While stressing traditional Republican free-market themes, the 419-page, annual 
"Economic Report of the President" avoided some of the more doctrinaire 
positions on monetary policy and supply-side economics sounded during the 
Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bush used the message, the first presented by his Administration, to 
lay out generally mainstream economic goals such as the need for 
growth-oriented policies and renewed efforts to bring the federal deficit under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
On taxes, Bush said: "One of my highest legislative priorities this year is to 
reduce the capital gains tax rate. This tax reform would promote risk-taking 
and entrepreneurship by lowering the cost of capital. . . . A capital gains tax 
cut would stimulate saving and investment throughout the economy." 
</P>
<P>
"The primary economic goal of my Administration is to achieve the highest 
possible rate of sustainable economic growth," Bush said in the report. "Growth 
is the key to raising living standards, to leaving a legacy of prosperity for 
our children, to uplifting those most in need and to maintaining America's 
leadership in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Bush reviewed the period since the end of the 1981-82 recession, a peacetime 
record of seven years of expansion. In that time, more than 20 million jobs 
have been created, driving the unemployment rate down to a level not seen since 
the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Our excellent economic health will allow us to build on the successes of the 
1980s as we prepare for the next century," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush declared that his top trade priority is successful completion of the 
current 96-nation round of trade talks. The President is seeking to eliminate 
farm subsidies and expand trading opportunities in banking, insurance and other 
service industries in which American firms excel. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot remain competitive by avoiding competition. My Administration will 
therefore continue to resist calls for protection and managed trade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also rejected proposals for the federal government to promote an 
"industrial policy" of picking winners and losers among emerging technologies, 
declaring that "second-guessing the market is the way to raise government 
spending and taxes, not living standards." 
</P>
<P>
While sometimes critical of the Federal Reserve Board's interest rate policies 
in his first year in office, the President praised the central bank for a "high 
degree of policy credibility." 
</P>
<P>
In a departure from the monetarist leanings of the Reagan Administration, 
Bush's economic outlook warned against a reliance on "rigid monetary 
targeting," the process promoted by certain economists in which the central 
bank focuses solely on controlling the growth of the nation's money supply as 
the way to keep inflation at bay.

ABSENCE OF NORTHWEST DEAL SETS PAN AM STOCK FALLING

Pan Am Corp. dashed speculation of an impending deal with Northwest Airlines 
today when its board of directors ended a regularly scheduled meeting without 
making any announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"The board meeting concluded shortly after noon," Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela 
Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
"The company will have no announcement as a result of the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
That announcement burst the bubble of a two-day rally that saw Pan Am's stock 
rise 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation of some type of deal between the two airlines had driven Pan Am 
stock up to a peak of $4 a share this morning, compared with $3 a share at the 
close of trading Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But after Pan Am announced the board meeting had ended without any statement, 
the stock fell. In afternoon trading, Pan Am was off 37.5 cents at $3.375 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
Hanlon declined comment on speculation that the board discussed a deal, 
possibly a merger, between Pan Am and Northwest at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The company, in line with longstanding policy, will not comment on speculation 
of that sort," Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest also said it had a policy against commenting on speculation about a 
potential deal. A spokesman for the Minnesota-based airline, however, said no 
announcement of any kind was planned. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation was sparked Monday by Pan Am's Teamsters Union, which said the 
airline's board would consider a deal under which Northwest would buy the New 
York-based carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Pan Am tried to buy NWA Inc., parent company of Northwest Airlines, 
but the airline instead agreed to a buyout offer led by Los Angeles investor 
Alfred Checchi. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, troubled by thorny labor relations and growing competition on 
transatlantic routes, has been searching for a buyer or partner for years.

Stock prices finished broadly lower today, although a late-afternoon rally 
trimmed the losses for the session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 19.82 points on Monday, 
fell 16.21 to 2,606.31. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 579 up, 895 down and 497 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 134.07 million shares, against 130.95 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 1.02 to 182.33. 
</P>
<P>
Trading activity was moderate, picking up the pace from Monday which was the 
slowest trading day of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices had risen in three of the past four sessions after sinking for 
most of the month of January. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said today's decline was an indication that the market's broader 
trend is still lower. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of rising interest rates has inhibited recent price gains, making 
yields on short-term Treasury securities more competitive with those available 
on stocks and dimming chances for corporate earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
Those worries grew more pronounced as the Treasury's auction of $30 billion in 
new securities approached this week. 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets today, rates edged up on six-month Treasury bills while 
yields on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to the 8.56% level from 8.53% late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell in early trading today. The benchmark 30-year bond was down 
3/8 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 face amount, around midday. Its yield rose to 
8.57% from 8.53% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Money market economists said traders were slightly skittish because of 
uncertainty over the prospects for the Treasury Department auction of 10-year 
and 30-year bonds Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8 3/16%, down from 8 1/4% late Monday.

The former wife of convicted spy John A. Walker Jr. says her peace has been 
shattered by a television series about his spy ring, one of the most damaging 
espionage cases in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
The series, based loosely on two books about John A. Walker Jr.'s career as a 
spy for the Soviet Union, has reopened old wounds, Barbara Joy Crowley Walker 
said in a telephone interview with The Cape Cod Times. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Walker, 51, lives on Cape Cod but asked that the location of the house she 
shares with a daughter and grandson not be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
CBS broadcast the first of two parts of "Family of Spies: The Walker Spy Ring," 
on Sunday. The second part is scheduled tonight. Mrs. Walker said she saw 
excerpts but did not plan to watch the series. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is upset that she is being portrayed as weak and ineffectual, and 
as an alcoholic. She is hurt that her children will relive a time in their 
lives that was "an absolute nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Walker and her husband were divorced in 1976, and she turned in her 
husband to authorities in 1984, unaware that her son was involved in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, a retired Navy communications specialist, had recruited his son, 
brother and a friend as members of the spy ring. He pleaded guilty in 1985 and 
was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Walker worries that the public will not understand that her son, Michael 
Lance Walker, 27, now serving a 25-year sentence in federal prison, "did all he 
did because he so desperately loved his father." 
</P>
<P>
"I know what happened was news and now it is one for the history books," she 
said. "But now my life, or at least some screenwriter's version of it, is being 
shown on the television, not as news, not as history, but as entertainment for 
millions of people. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you, what my children suffered and what they continue to suffer 
has nothing to do with entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night's program carried the following disclaimer: "Certain events and 
characters portrayed herein have been fictionalized." 
</P>
<P>
Disclaimer or not, Mrs. Walker believes people will see the show and believe 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Abrams, the co-executive producer of the miniseries, said those 
affiliated with the project had been in touch with Mrs. Walker for the past 
four years. He said she had been paid a fee for the rights to her story, but 
would not give the amount. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Walker said the past five years have been spent "trying to heal the 
wounds." She has sought to help her three daughters, all in their 30s, deal 
with the conflicts caused by loving their father while hating what he did. 
</P>
<P>
"John Walker is not a horrible person. He is just a very sad man who took the 
path of least resistance," she said.

Debra Murphree, the former prostitute whose liaison with preacher Jimmy 
Swaggart rocked an evangelical empire, has signed away three-quarters of the 
$210,000 that Penthouse paid for her story. 
</P>
<P>
Murphree will receive about $54,000 for the article published in July, 1988, 
said Louis H. Schultz, her attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Agents, attorneys and the Internal Revenue Service will get the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"She's happy. I talked with her on the telephone," Schultz said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Agents and the IRS had claimed they were owed $428,000 by Murphree, who claimed 
that the Baton Rouge-based TV evangelist was a regular customer in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
However, Schultz said their figures were based on inflated estimates of the 
amount Penthouse owed for the article and a promotional tour and -- in the IRS' 
$217,000 claim -- for income from prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Murphree told Penthouse that Swaggart paid her $20 a visit to strike prurient 
poses and perform sexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
Swaggart tearfully confessed to an unspecified "moral failure" and was 
subsequently defrocked by the Assemblies of God.

Veteran catcher Bob Boone will earn $1.9 million in 1990, thanks to the

</P>
<P>
The non-guaranteed pact also includes up to $325,000 more in contract 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
Boone, 42, and the Royals had been scheduled for arbitration because Boone 
wanted $2.05 million and the Royals offered $1.5 million. 
</P>

Boone made $883,001 last year after signing with the team as a free agent in 
November, 1988. He spent seven years with the Angels and nine years with the 
Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, he won his seventh Gold Glove and was voted the league's best 
defensive catcher by American League managers. He hit .274 in 131 games and had

Subpoenas have been issued to developer Gregg Lukenbill and others to appear

San Francisco Dist. Atty.

Arlo Smith said "four or five" subpoenas were issued Monday at the request of 
the grand jury. The investigation grew out of charges by Mayor Art Agnos

trying to steal the baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Lukenbill, apparently surprised by the news of the subpoenas, said he had no 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged Friday that he helped raise funds that paid for last-minute 
mail brochures that urged San Franciscans to vote against Measure P, which 
would have paved the way for a replacement for Candlestick Park. The measure 
was defeated by fewer than 2,000 votes, and the Giants have begun negotiations 
with Santa Clara.

Teams in Rome and Milan were dropped from the inaugural season of the 
International League of American Football today because of a conflict with 
soccer's World Cup, which will be played in Italy this summer. 
</P>
<P>
There are six clubs left in the league for the opening of play in April. 
</P>
<P>
They are in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Helsinki, Munich, London and Birmingham, 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Rome and Milan will join the league in 1991, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Flaminio Stadium, which was to have been the home field for Rome, will be used 
in the World Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the two teams for 1990 is a setback to the ILAF in its efforts to 
gain a foothold before the World League of American Football, an NFL-sponsored 
spring league in Europe and North America, begins play in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the six remaining teams will play a 12-game season from April 14 to 
June 30, followed by playoffs. Each team will include 12 Americans and 24 local 
players.

PHOENIX HIRES REDSKIN ASST. COACH JOE BUGEL

<P>
After a search of almost three months, the Phoenix Cardinals have finally found 
a coach -- Washington Redskins assistant Joe Bugel. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL team scheduled a news conference today to introduce him officially as 
coach and would not comment on the selection ahead of time, but Bugel told 
Mizlou's News Sports Network that he is "looking forward to working with Mr. 
(Bill) Bidwill and Larry Wilson," the Cardinals' owner and general manager 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the job I really wanted," Bugel told Mizlou network interviewer Bill 
Pidto at Dulles International Airport in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
WTTG-TV in Washington and KTAR Radio in Phoenix both reported Monday night that 
Bugel would become the 30th coach in the Cardinals' 70-year history and the 
franchise's sixth since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Bugel was among seven finalists for the Cardinals job, which opened when Gene 
Stallings was fired Nov. 20 in the middle of his fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
Bugel, 49, has been a Redskins assistant for nine seasons and has 15 years of 
NFL experience. He started as offensive line coach for the Detroit Lions in 
1975-76 and coached the Houston Oilers offensive line from 1977 to '80. 
</P>
<P>
He coached at four colleges, including his alma mater, Western Kentucky, from 
1964 to '68. He was also at Navy (1969-72), Iowa State (1973) and Ohio State 
(1974) before going to the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
"If you keep your nose clean and you do the hard work, then an opportunity like 
this comes up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other finalists were San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Mike Holmgren, 
Rams defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur, Cal State Fresno Coach Jim Sweeney, 
Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet (named today to coach the 
New York Jets), New York Giants defensive coordinator Bill Belichick and 
Cardinals interim Coach Hank Kuhlmann. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings, 54, had a 23-34-1 record when fired after announcing that he would 
not seek renewal of his contract at the end of the season. He subsequently 
returned to college coaching when he signed Jan. 11 with Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhlmann, in his fourth year as running backs coach, was 0-5 after replacing 
Stallings. The Cardinals lost their last six games to finish 5-11, the club's 
fifth consecutive losing season.

IT LOOKS LIKE THE BOYS OF SUMMER ARE IN FOR A SILENT SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD JUSTICE, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man in the street may not understand. Not this time. Not with baseball in 
this era of incredible prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
The man in the street wonders how they could shut down his spring training at a 
time when players are making record salaries and owners are raking in record 
profits. For once, won't their loss be worse than his? 
</P>
<P>
What could possibly be wrong with a game that has established attendance 
records six years in a row, has just doubled its national television revenues 
and never has seen so many teams with realistic chances of challenging for 
postseason play? 
</P>
<P>
The man in the street knows the '80s were good to his game. The average annual 
player salary went from $143,756 to $490,000. Attendance almost doubled, and 
virtually every team is aking money. Total industry revenues run around $1.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The value of franchises increased again and again and again. The Baltimore 
Orioles sold for $12 million in 1979 and for $70 million in 1988. Today, their 
value probably has soared past $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is in such terrific shape that last spring then-Commissioner Peter V. 
Ueberroth asked owners to roll back ticket prices by 75 cents across the board, 
saying it would send fans a message that ownership was willing to share its 
prosperity. He left office two weeks later and no action ever was taken. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, eight different clubs won the World Series during the '80s, and 
22 of the game's 26 teams got into postseason play. Oddly, the Yankees -- a 
team that was supposed to send the competition into oblivion when free agency 
began in 1976 -- failed to win a World Series for the first decade in their 
history. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the game is robust, and not even the owners, who say the current 
salary system must be changed, will argue that. In fact, they say whatever 
problems they face won't come until 1994 or later, years that aren't being 
negotiated in this current labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the game is headed for a shutdown. The owners are expected to announce on 
Friday that they won't unlock spring training gates until a new collective 
bargaining agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
It's believed that 18 of the 26 owners strongly favor the lockout and don't 
want the game restarted until the players agree to some form of revenue 
sharing. The players, who say that salaries could decrease and free agency 
would be restricted by any form of revenue sharing, are in no mood to give up 
what they have won in court. 
</P>
<P>
Although baseball had work stoppages in 1976, 1981 and 1985, this one is 
different. For once, it's the owners who are ready to shut down the game. For 
once, the players have asked for nothing and likely would accept a roll-over of 
the current agreement. 
</P>
<P>
This, too, is the most complex disagreement because the owners can't articulate 
their problems, especially because almost all agree the current system has 
worked beautifully. When free agency began, dozens of owners warned the game 
would be destroyed by spiraling salaries and that all the good players would 
end up on one team. 
</P>
<P>
That did not happen, and yet, in a sense, that's what the owners are arguing 
again. They are asking the players to come to the bargaining table and agree to 
solve problems that may not exist for several more years, if ever. They are 
saying that if the current salary escalation continues, the competitive balance 
of the game is in jeopardy because teams in smaller television markets won't be 
able to afford the top players. 
</P>
<P>
Teams now devote about 34% of their revenues to salaries. What the owners have 
proposed is that they put 48% of selected revenues -- about 38% of total 
revenues -- into a salary pot. Players with six years of service would still be 
eligible for free agency, but players with less than six years would be paid by 
plugging statistics into a computer, ranking the players and paying them 
according to rank. Leftover dollars would be spent on free agents. 
</P>
<P>
Using statistics to determine salaries always has been tricky business and no 
less than the guru of the 20th Century baseball statistic, Bill James, has said 
that no formula can be devised to determine fair salaries. 
</P>
<P>
But the owners feel they've been burned again and again by arbitration, the 
system by which players in Years 3 through 6 can have their salaries set by an 
independent arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
General managers have a laundry list of horrors about arbitrators who don't 
know what a batting average is or who decide that if George Steinbrenner paid 
Player X $800 million, then Player Y ought to get that money too. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of owners agree with Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig, who said, "I 
don't mind paying for my own stupidity, but why should I have to pay for 
someone else's?" 
</P>
<P>
The owners went into these negotiations wanting two changes in the system. 
First, they want an end to salary arbitration. Second, they want to implement a 
form of revenue sharing, a system that appears designed to punish some of the 
free-spending owners more than the players. 
</P>
<P>
Several owners are furious that a few of their colleagues -- George 
Steinbrenner of the Yankees, Gene Autry of the Angels, Joan Kroc of the Padres 
and Avron Fogelman of the Royals -- have almost single-handedly driven up 
salaries for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Ask a dozen people what the eventual solution will be and you'll get a dozen 
different answers. At this point, it appears clear spring training camps won't 
open. The owners' Player Relations Committee has also instructed clubs not to 
let players use their facilities to stay in shape, which means players will be 
shuffled off to haphazard drills at high school fields. 
</P>
<P>
When the lockout begins, the players' union probably will file a grievance with 
the National Labor Relations Board claiming the owners haven't negotiated in 
good faith. They'll say lockout language has been added to contracts for almost 
a year and that the strategy all along was to shut down spring training. 
</P>
<P>
If the owners are ordered to open the camps, the players will have scored a 
significant victory. 
</P>
<P>
A more likely scenario involves what labor disputes almost always come down to: 
a test of wills. How long are the owners prepared to shut down the game? How 
long are the players prepared to wait? Both sides have huge strike funds -- 
$170 million for the owners, $70 million for the players -- and both can afford 
to wait a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, they will end up back at the bargaining table, and eventually, 
there will be an agreement. A lot of general managers and agents believe that 
agreement will resemble the current one, and that some form of revenue sharing 
could begin with product licensing money (the two sides are now competitors in 
the marketing of T-shirts and other souvenirs). 
</P>
<P>
"Public opinion is going to play a big role," the agent said. "In the past, the 
players have been the greedy jerks. This time, it's the owners who are shutting 
down the game. It'll be interesting to see how it's played out."

SANTA ANITA;

<P>
3RD STRAIGHT VICTORY ON LINE FOR TSU'S DAWNING IN STAKES RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tsu's Dawning will be after his third straight victory when he faces six other 
sophomores in the $75,000-added Santa Catalina Stakes on Wednesday at Santa 
Anita Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 1/16th-mile Santa Catalina is an early preparation race for the $500,000 
Santa Anita Derby on April 7. 
</P>
<P>
Tsu's Dawning made an inauspicious debut in November, finishing fifth. He broke 
his maiden by 5 1/2 lengths at a mile in his second start, then triumphed by 
two lengths in allowance company to close out 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Tsu's Dawning campaigns under the silks of Royal Lines for trainer Eddie 
Gregson, the same connection that raced his sire Tsunami Slew in 1983-85 when 
he captured eight stakes, including the Grade I Carleton F. Burke Handicap at 
Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
With a field of seven runners, the Santa Catalina Stakes will offer an $81,450 
purse and the winner will receive $47,700. 
</P>
<P>
In post position order, the field includes Music Prospector, Frank Olivares, 
114; Tsu's Dawning, Chris McCarron, 120; Flying Reb, Eddie Delahoussaye, 114; 
Senegalaise, Gary Stevens, 114; Short Timer, 114; Shapiro's Hero, Alex Solis, 
114; El Toreo, Sandy Hawley, 114. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro's Hero comes off a fast-closing third-place finish in the California 
Breeders' Champion Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Short Timer took five tries to break his maiden against claimers but came right 
back to score an allowance victory in his last race. 
</P>
<P>
Flying Reb broke his maiden last time, upsetting Sir Beaufort, a top 3-year-old 
in trainer Charlie Whittingham's shed row.
