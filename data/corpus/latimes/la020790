Eastman Kodak Co.: The Rochester, N.Y., firm's 1989 profit amounted to $529 
million, down 62% from 1988, due primarily to restructuring costs. 
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled a record $18.4 billion, up 8%. For the fourth quarter, the 
company reported a $60-million loss, contrasted with earnings of $312 million 
in the year-earlier period. Sales totaled $4.9 billion, an increase of 8% and 
another record. The photographic, chemicals and pharmaceutical concern said 
despite strong sales, earnings were also restrained by inflation, higher 
interest expenses and the unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations.

"The music-making immortalized on record is inevitably a mere echo of that

PAIR OF SPECIALS BREAK INTO THE TOP 20

The top of the A. C. Nielsen ratings list for last week looked the same as 
usual, but a couple of specials did manage to crack the Top 20. David 
Letterman's eighth anniversary special on NBC last Thursday finished 17th among 
the week's 81 prime-time programs, attracting viewers in about 15.5 million 
homes, while the tribute to Sammy Davis Jr. on ABC Sunday night ranked 19th, 
with an audience of about 15 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Nielsen numbers, released Tuesday, gave NBC its 16th consecutive weekly 
win. ABC was second and CBS was third. The full list of ratings is on page 11. 
</P>
<P>
* In its first outing last week, Valerie Harper's new show narrowly beat her 
old show. "City," on CBS, drew a 13.9 rating while NBC's "The Hogan Family," in 
which Harper used to star when it was called "Valerie," garnered a 13.8. But 
this week, "The Hogan Family" got the same rating and "City" fell to a 12.1 -- 
and they both lost to the second half hour of "MacGyver" on ABC, which had a 
14.3. (Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.)

Eastern Europe's First Private Broadcast: Eastern Europe's first private TV 
station began broadcasting Tuesday from home-assembled transmitters on top of a 
student hostel in the city of Wroclaw in western Poland. TV Echo, founded and 
operated by eight local enthusiasts, beamed its first six-hour broadcast, which 
included programs on the Solidarity movement, street interviews with locals and 
reports on price rises, to a potential audience of up to 1 million people. It 
also relayed two hours of foreign satellite programs. SHAUNA SNOW

Rumor Mill?There is no truth to the rumor that producer Fred Roos was fired off 
the set of "Godfather III" in Rome Monday, the film's publicist, Don Levy, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fox television news reported Monday night that director Francis Ford Coppola 
fired his longtime friend and colleague Roos from the set, and demanded that he 
leave Rome, and the New York Post announced the same thing on Tuesday. But Levy 
said that he spoke to Roos in Rome after the reports and Roos confirmed that 
there is "absolutely, unequivocally" no truth to them. "It was just a little 
rumor bubble taking off," Levy said. SHAUNA SNOW

JAZZ NOTES: 'JAZZ IS ART' AT CRENSHAW PLAZA; THE BLUES AT AFRO-AMERICAN MUSEUM;

Trumpeter Miles Davis, ex-bassist John Heard and pianist Les McCann are but 
three of the jazz musicians who double as artists, and/or artists who depict 
jazz images, whose works are part of "Jazz Is Art/Art Is Jazz," a sparkling 
exhibition showing at Museum of African American Art at the Crenshaw Plaza 
through April 8. Also included in the enterprising showing are remarkable 
photographs from Bob Douglas, who documented the Los Angeles jazz scene in the 
'40s and '50s; bassist Milt Hinton, whose pictures go back to the late '30s; 
and noted jazz shooter Charles Stewart. A series of free Sunday concerts, held 
in conjunction with the exhibit, begin Sunday, 3 p.m., on the mall level of the 
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, 4005 Crenshaw Blvd. McCann kicks off the series, 
followed by sorely underrated saxman Wilbur Brown's quartet, Feb. 18, and Billy 
Childs' trio, Feb. 25. Information: (213) 294-7071. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Ernie Andrews and violinist Papa John Creach join forces with pianist 
Floyd Dixon, guitarist Lowell Fulson and others in "Bring the Blues Back Home," 
two free concerts to be held at the California Afro-American Museum (600 State 
Drive, Exposition Park), Saturday, 4 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets are required for the 
evening performance and are available at the museum. The concerts, sponsored by 
the Ford Dealers of Southern California, help celebrate the exhibit, "Blues 
Aesthetic: Black Culture and Modernism," which continues at the museum through 
March 4. Information: (213) 744-7432.

Saxophonist Ernie Watts, who teams up with bassist Charlie Haden and 
keyboardist Peter Manning Robinson to debut their trio at LeCafe in Sherman 
Oaks Friday and Saturday, says the three will offer a distinctive musical take 
on things, particularly since there is no drummer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing all original material in a style that I call 'contemporary 
improvisation.' The music's sort of compositionally oriented, giving the trio a 
chamber group aspect," says Watts, a regular on the "Tonight Show" orchestra 
and a member of Haden's Quartet West. "And I thought the lack of drums would 
keep the group clear, take it into another area." 
</P>
<P>
Watts, who is currently rehearsing with the Meeting -- a band that includes 
bassist Alphonso Johnson, drummer Ndugu Chancler and keyboardist Patrice Rushen 
-- for an upcoming MCA LP session in April, has been active of late, traveling 
to Japan as a soloist, teaching clinics at colleges and working on a project 
with long-time collaborator, guitarist Lee Ritenour. Still, Watts says, he'd 
like to spend more time leading his own band. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to keep doing that," he says, adding that a new GRP project for his 
group, which plays "acoustic contemporary music," is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
High school and full-time college music students between the ages of 15 and 25 
are eligible to apply for the 1990 Jazz Scholarships, offered by the Charles 
(Dolo) Coker Scholarship Foundation. The awards -- named in honor of the late 
pianist, one of the finest of Los Angeles-based jazzmen -- assist students 
whose field of study is jazz. The application deadline is March 7. Applicants 
must be prepared to play an audition performance at the Musicians' Union, 817 
Vine St., Hollywood, on March 24. The top three applicants, in addition to a 
scholarship award, will perform on the foundation's seventh scholarship benefit 
concert at the union April 29. Information: (213) 666-3700, 666-5109.

Applications are now being accepted from both professional and amateur jazz 
musicians for the sixth annual Hennessy Cognac Jazz Search, a competition where 
the grand-prize winner collects $2,000 and earns a spot as opening act at the 
Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl, June 17. Musicians who play any 
style of jazz may apply by sending audio cassette tapes, no more than 20 
minutes in length and postmarked by March 1, to Hennessy Jazz Search, 3435 
Ocean Park Blvd., Suite JAZZ, Santa Monica 90405. A panel of experts, including 
trumpeter Doc Severinsen, will judge the tapes on the basis of originality, 
technique and creative style. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Allan Holdsworth -- joined by drummer Chad Wackerman and bassist 
Jimmy Johnson -- offers his innovative jazz/fusion style in a concert in the 
Performance Arts Center of Los Alamitos High School, 3591 E. Cerritos Ave., Los 
Alamitos, Sunday, 7 and 9 p.m. The concert also features the Los Alamitos High 
School and McAuliffe Middle School jazz bands, and proceeds benefit both 
schools' jazz band programs. Tickets ($10) and information: (213) 480-3232, 
596-4115. 
</P>
<P>
In another benefit, a gaggle of Swing Era jazz stars -- clarinetist Kenny 
Davern, pianist Ralph Sutton, bassist Bob Haggart and drummer Jake Hanna, among 
them -- play "Jazz Night in Redlands," to be held at the University of Redlands 
Memorial chapel, 1200 E. Colton Ave., Redlands on Thursday, 8 p.m. Tickets for 
the concert, which benefits the organization Redlands Against Drugs, are $5, 
$15, $50. Information: (714) 798-2513, 793-2121.

BARNETT LEADS SANTA MONICA SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the four men who have been engaged to conduct the Santa Monica Symphony this 
season -- ergo, the four contenders for the post of music director -- John 
Barnett, who led the orchestra Sunday evening at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, 
has the longest resume, having conducted in too many cities to list here. 
</P>
<P>
At 72, Barnett is also the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
That may or may not affect his chances to succeed Yehuda Gilad as the 
orchestra's sixth conductor; although Gilad was the youngest of five candidates 
in 1981-82, Victor Bay, Gilad's predecessor, began his 16-year tenure at the 
age of 69. 
</P>
<P>
As his calling card, Barnett chose an all-orchestral program of music by 
Beethoven, Elgar and Strauss. Following a serviceable reading of the "Leonore" 
Overture No. 1, he presided over a generally respectable, utterly conventional 
account of Beethoven's First Symphony. Barnett's Beethoven proved pleasant 
enough, but not especially exciting. He infused too little brio into the score, 
de-emphasizing, for instance, the syncopated accents in the Scherzo, and doing 
little to instill the music with a sense of momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Though the strings found themselves scrambling more than a few times, the winds 
remained in good form, even if the woodwind solos were difficult to hear in the 
barn-like hall. 
</P>
<P>
Balance problems proved even more bothersome in the Suite from Richard Strauss' 
"Der Rosenkavalier," where individual lines, during the tutti sections, 
dissolved into a kind of murky fog of sound. Surely, Civic Auditorium was not 
entirely to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Still, one found much to admire in this "Rosenkavalier" Suite: Barnett 
generated exciting contrasts and paced the 20-minute work intelligently; 
moreover, the solos were executed brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
Before the suite, Barnett conducted the orchestra's strings in an imperfect but 
elegantly phrased reading of Elgar's Serenade in E minor.TERRY McQUILKIN

For several months, Father Maurice Chase has been dispensing a dollar bill and 
kind words to each of the hundreds of poor people who line up near the Union 
Rescue Mission on Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
But on the Skid Row priest's last visit, it was the street people who helped 
him out. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just gotten some money out of my car when a man with a knife rushed 
toward me," said Chase, 59. "The people yelled for me to go into the mission. 
And a couple hundred of them surrounded the man and subdued him." 
</P>

Two years ago, Sylvia Cunliffe agreed to retire as boss of L.A.'s General 
Services Department after Mayor Tom Bradley leveled a series of charges against 
her, including nepotism. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, she is making use of her expertise as an executive consultant on the 
TV show, "City," which features Valerie Harper as City Manager Liz Gianni. 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing. In an episode the other night, Gianni was accused of nepotism 
after she put her daughter on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Gianni didn't resign. Fortunately, for a TV officeholder, the only 
unforgiveable offense is a low Nielsen rating. 
</P>
<P>
To L.A. City Councilwoman Joy Picus, it would be "as American as apple pie" to 
expand the county Board of Supervisors from five members to nine in order to 
provide better representation for 8.7 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate the point, Picus and other community leaders delivered apple 
pies, each gerrymandered into nine pieces, to the board members Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the supervisors had their pie and ate it, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The pie was good but the plan was too tart," said Supervisor Deane Dana. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman, however, was spotted rushing out of his office carrying 
the pie in a box under his arm. A staff member lamented, "We didn't get a 
piece." 
</P>
<P>
When someone posted a for-sale notice for a fur coat (complete with photo) on 
the bulletin board of a Manhattan Beach health club, it started a small 
graffiti war. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dead," someone scrawled across the notice. 
</P>
<P>
Then, someone else wrote beneath that: "So are your shoes and dinner." 
</P>
<P>
It's a jungle in those health clubs.

CRANSTON'S BILL FOR BONDHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial represents the typical reaction of those untouched by this 
affair. It drags out the old caveat emptor defense in the name of saving the 
taxpayers for state and federal official errors and misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
At the time (while these bonds were being sold) almost everyone was fooled by 
the fast-buck artistry of Keating and his cronies. Except for two or three 
underling regulators, all the principals were fooled -- Alan Greenspan, our Fed 
chairman, five or more senators and countless government agency heads. They 
rushed to help Keating target a select group of savings and loan customers for 
a neat sales scheme. This target of mostly naive elderly were fleeced of their 
life savings by as clever a bait-and-switch operation as I have ever seen. And 
it all happened inside the doors of a supposedly rock-solid, well-regulated 
savings and loan office. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial puts you in bed with the principals in this case, who looked 
around after it was disclosed and piously said "it wasn't my fault" or "they 
were greedy." Let's face it, we were all fooled and you do a great disservice 
by equating these bondholders with those who buy and sell bonds on the open 
market. Only the small print buried inside the prospectus hints that these 
bonds could never reach the open market and were forever locked inside Lincoln 
Savings. There are too many dirty hands here for a caveat emptor defense. 
Cranston is rightly trying to settle now, instead of later, a case that may 
make the legal profession more wealthy at taxpayers' expense.

MALATHION GETS THE MICROSCOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps not a moment too soon, state health officials are set to begin what 
should be a timely and thorough examination of just what science knows and does 
not know about the effects of malathion spraying on Southern California 
residents. A panel of medical experts is being convened, and air and water 
monitoring is set to start this month. The goal of the panel as well as of the 
monitoring should be to determine, as quickly as possible, whether the spraying 
is safe, as a number of experts claim. 
</P>
<P>
Many Los Angeles and Orange county residents are alarmed and angry over the way 
some officials previously brushed aside health concerns. Those who were already 
agitated about the aerial pesticide campaign to eradicate the Medfly had 
further cause for apprehension this week: An author of a 1980 state study that 
is repeatedly cited as a cornerstone in the argument that malathion spraying 
poses no health risk now says that state officials altered some of the report's 
conclusions. This distressing charge comes from Marc A. Lappe, who worked as 
part of a state risk-assessment team in Santa Clara County. In reply, state 
officials admit that changes were made, but say they were scientifically 
trivial. 
</P>
<P>
This is why the decision to form a health panel and begin monitoring was 
unavoidable and necessary. A perception of risk was bound to grow as long as 
the state shut its eyes to questions about malathion spraying. Now, within the 
next two weeks, the state will conduct water and air monitoring, the latter 
with the use of vacuum-type devices placed near hospitals, schools and other 
buildings in spray areas. And a panel of local, expert physicians and 
scientists is due to meet as soon as this week. 
</P>
<P>
The state has what may be its last and best chance to restore full faith in the 
system. The first step in boosting credibility is in making sure that the panel 
represents independent and dissenting points of view. One other action would 
help: the governor's explicit endorsement of both the monitoring program and 
the expert examination. It is true that Gov. George Deukmejian's own appointees 
in the Department of Food and Agriculture and in the Department of Health 
Services -- after some prodding -- set the wheels in motion for monitoring. A 
spokesman said the governor "has always been willing to listen to and take into 
account" new technical evidence. But there would be no better way now to show 
that willingness than an enthusiastic Deukmejian public endorsement of the 
panel, the monitoring and special testing as needed. The worst thing would be 
to let this situation drift out of control.

In it you praised the generosity of Giusto and Evelyn DeMaiti for setting up a

CRANSTON'S BILL FOR BONDHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial, "Who Is Alan Trying to Bail Out?" (Jan. 24), damning the 
Bondholders Protection Bill which I introduced Jan. 23, all too obviously was 
written by someone who not only never read the bill, but didn't even make an 
honest effort to find out what it is all about. 
</P>
<P>
Your editorial is guilty of outrageous inaccuracies and gratuitous aspersions 
about my motives. Even a casual reading of my bill (please see Page S 132, 
Congressional Record, Jan. 23) shows that it would not "make the U.S. Treasury 
vulnerable to claims for losses in any regulated industry," that it would not 
protect people who "made unwise investments" and that it is not a "bailout of 
bondholders." 
</P>
<P>
* It is a one-time only proposal that deals exclusively with some 23,000 
Californians, many of them widows and the elderly, who may have lost their life 
savings in apparently worthless bonds sold at Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
* It does not bail out bondholders. It would enable them to obtain damages only 
if they are able to prove in court that government negligence contributed to 
their loss. (In the last Congress, no fewer than 17 bills were enacted waiving 
sovereign immunity and permitting citizens who had been wronged by the 
government to obtain redress by the government.) 
</P>
<P>
* And my bill stipulates that the government's liability would be reduced by 
the amount these people may collect from private sources -- specifically, 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, its parent company American Continental Corp., and 
owner Charles Keating, all of whom are already being sued. 
</P>
<P>
(To help assure that reimbursement comes primarily from these private parties 
rather than the government, I have urged Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh to make 
asset forfeitures that may result from criminal proceedings available to the 
bondholders, and I have asked him to help them track down assets that may be 
held abroad.) 
</P>
<P>
I introduced my legislation for three reasons: 
</P>
<P>
1. Because the Federal Home Loan Bank Board had responsibility for approval and 
supervision of the bond sale. 
</P>
<P>
2. Because many of the bondholders had good reason to believe they were buying 
federally insured bonds since they were being sold at Lincoln S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
3. And because information provided me by the Office of Thrift Supervision 
shows that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board failed to follow federal 
regulations for inspecting the bond sales and approved the sales despite doubts 
raised by their own regulators about the companies' solvency. 
</P>
<P>
These bondholders were let down by the negligence of federal regulators, and I 
feel strongly that the government is legally- and honor-bound to protect its 
citizens.

MAHONY SUED BY UNION AFTER HE QUITS BARGAINING ON GRAVEDIGGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two top Los Angeles labor officials accused Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger M. 
Mahony on Tuesday of dishonesty and hypocrisy in the wake of his recent 
decision to stop bargaining with a union that won a hard-fought victory to 
represent workers at the archdiocese's 10 Los Angeles-area cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union filed suit in Los Angeles 
Superior Court on Tuesday, seeking an injunction to force Mahony to resume 
negotiations on a new labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was announced at a press conference that featured the strongest 
invective yet in a bitter two-year fight between Mahony, long a staunch 
supporter of organized labor, and local labor leaders over whether 140 cemetery 
workers should be organized. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle appeared to end last November when a three-member arbitration 
panel, selected by the archdiocese and the union, ruled 2 to 1 that the union 
should be the bargaining representative of the gravediggers. Mahony had 
contested a close representation election won by the union last February. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the two sides on a labor contract did not begin until the 
middle of last month. Then last week the archdiocese said it would no longer 
negotiate with the union because of mounting complaints by cemetery workers 
that they do not want union representation. Instead, Mahony announced, the 
archdiocese would hold another election among workers. 
</P>
<P>
Under a written agreement governing last year's election, the archdiocese has a 
legal obligation to negotiate with the union on a contract for a period of one 
year after the election. Had the election been supervised by the National Labor 
Relations Board, that year would have started only when the appeals ended and 
the election results were certified. However, the NLRB declined to supervise 
last year's election, saying it does not have jurisdiction over religious 
organizations. Instead, the election was conducted under the auspices of the 
state Mediation and Conciliation Service, which allows parties to draft their 
own rules. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony now contends that the union's year of bargaining representation ends 
Thursday -- on the anniversary of the vote, which the union narrowly won, 
66-62. The archdiocese will hold a new election Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials on Tuesday called the second vote a stacked deck and said they 
will refuse to participate. Instead, they hope to obtain an injunction 
requiring Mahony to negotiate with them through November. 
</P>
<P>
The archdiocese said its decision to hold a new election a year and a day after 
the first one was made in response to anti-union petitions from 97 of 114 
workers at six of the 10 cemeteries. Union officials accused cemetery 
supervisors of misrepresenting the nature of the petitions to their workers, 
saying that many workers were told they were simply signing a petition thanking 
Mahony for raising wages, an action the archdiocese took last year. 
</P>
<P>
William Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation of 
Labor, said at the press conference Tuesday that Mahony is guilty of 
"hypocritical attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
David Sickler, an AFL-CIO regional director and one of the three members of the 
panel that reviewed the election results, said he was "absolutely outraged" by 
Mahony's actions and accused the archbishop of dishonesty for initially saying 
last year's election should follow NLRB procedures "but then when he loses, 
saying the hell with that." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin E. Goldman, a lawyer representing the archdiocese in the labor 
dispute, said Mahony was simply interpreting the agreement between the two 
sides literally. The agreement said the union would have bargaining rights one 
year from the election, he noted. If the union is angry, it should be angry at 
itself for not demanding more specific wording, Goldman said.

COALITION SEES HIGH COSTS, LOST JOBS IN AQMD CLEAN AIR PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of builders, manufacturers and labor unions charged Tuesday that a 
plan to clean Southern California skies will burden industry with costly and 
cumbersome regulations that could force at least 350,000 people out of work. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District should crack down on 
smog-producing vehicles, the main source of the region's air pollution, rather 
than place unreasonable demands on industry, which accounts for one-third of 
the problem, said William T. Huston, a builder and spokesman for the Community 
Air Quality Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to have jobs and clean air," Huston said. "They have to go hand in 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition created the task force about a year ago, shortly after the AQMD 
adopted a 20-year air quality management plan designed to bring the counties of 
Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino into compliance with federal 
clean air standards. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, a study by the Southern California Assn. of Governments suggested 
that there would be a net gain of more than 80,000 jobs and an industry study 
predicted the region would lose only 55,700 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, in its first attempt to create widespread opposition to the 
plan, the task force released an 86-page study predicting that the loss would 
be much higher -- 350,000 positions immediately and the potential for a ripple 
effect that could displace 1.4 million in all. 
</P>
<P>
The report said unnecessary regulation will drive businesses out of Southern 
California and into regions where government regulations are less stringent. 
</P>
<P>
But Claudia Keith, an AQMD spokeswoman, said a district analysis done when the 
plan was approved showed that any loss of industry would be offset by overall 
economic growth. The AQMD analysis predicted an additional 3 million jobs in 
the region over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the assumptions (the task force) made we wouldn't agree with," Keith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the task force at a press conference were representatives of the 
California Manufacturers Assn.; the AFL-CIO Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers 
International Union; the Construction Industry Air Quality Coalition; the Los 
Angeles County Federation of Labor, and a few owners of small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The air quality plan includes 120 rules which, among other things, restrict the 
use of certain chemicals or mandate extra pollution controls on manufacturing. 
Some rules already are in effect, such as car-pooling incentives and new 
controls on industrial emissions. Other rules still must be approved after 
public hearings, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
If all 120 rules are adopted, the aerospace industry would be hardest hit, 
losing at least 82,000 jobs, said Joseph E. Haring, an economist with the 
Pasadena Research Institute, which analyzed the potential impact of the plan on 
eight industries for the task force. 
</P>
<P>
The task force report said the electric and electronics industry would lose 
77,000 jobs; the fabricated metal products industry 62,000; the chemical, 
rubber and plastics industry 45,000; furniture makers 45,000, and the 
construction industry 24,000. The plan would displace 13,000 workers in the 
motion picture industry but have a negligible effect on restaurants, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The figures were based on census data and surveys of the companies themselves, 
Haring said. 
</P>
<P>
Huston said the task force is trying to find supporters in the state 
Legislature to introduce legislation that would require an independent analysis 
of the air-quality plan and its potential impact on jobs. 
</P>
<P>
David Finegood, owner of a furniture company, said AQMD rules are forcing him 
to move a manufacturing plant from Compton to Tijuana, where he can still 
produce furniture at competitive prices. He said he laid off 200 workers at the 
Compton plant two weeks ago and expects to lay off 100 others. "We really 
cannot stay here," he said.

PARENTS GET ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about the Los Angeles 
school board's decision to put schools on a year-round calendar: 
</P>
<P>
Q: 
</P>
<P>
How will my child's school be affected by the board vote? 
</P>
<P>
A: 
</P>
<P>
If your school currently operates on a traditional September-to-June calendar, 
it will have to find a way to accommodate up to 23% more students by choosing 
one or any combination of three options: adopt one of two forms of a year-round 
calendar, increase class size or add portable classrooms. The board has chosen 
109 schools that must comply by July. All other traditional schools will have 
to use these methods to increase capacity over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
If your school already operates year-round, the main change will be that it may 
have to adopt a new type of year-round calendar, called "90/30." Some 
year-round schools already operate on this schedule, which provides rotating 
periods of 90 days in school and 30 days on vacation. All schools will be 
required to be on this schedule by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Q: 
</P>
<P>
Why are year-round schools necessary in the Los Angeles district? 
</P>
<P>
A: 
</P>
<P>
District officials say enrollment growth is outpacing the ability to build new 
schools. While new schools are under construction, other relief measures are 
necessary to ensure that the 60,000 additional pupils expected over the next 
several years have classroom seats. A year-round calendar can create more 
classroom seats by using facilities through the summer months. It does not 
lengthen the school year. Students will still attend class 180 days a year, the 
same as on a traditional calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Q: 
</P>
<P>
I keep hearing the phrases "multi-track" and "single-track" in reference to 
year-round school. What's the difference, and how do I know which version my 
school will adopt? 
</P>
<P>
A: 
</P>
<P>
A multi-track calendar will enable a school to increase its enrollment by 
dividing students into four groups, or tracks. Only three groups are on campus 
at a time, while one group goes on vacation. All students attend school for at 
least part of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Any of the 109 schools could opt to switch to multi-track operation by July and 
would receive priority for air-conditioning, as well as qualify for special 
state incentive money. If a school chooses another means of increasing the 
capacity of its campus, it can wait until July, 1991, to implement year-round 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
All schools must go year-round by July, 1991, but the majority are expected to 
choose the single-track version of the year-round calendar. (See accompanying 
graph.) Under this version, all students attend school and break for vacation 
at the same time, and no additional seats would be created. But it would allow 
those schools to be in sync with students in the rest of the district. 
</P>
<P>
Q: 
</P>
<P>
If a school chooses to increase class size, is there a limit on how much larger 
classes could be? 
</P>
<P>
A: 
</P>
<P>
Yes, each class could be enlarged by a maximum of two pupils. Additional 
teachers would also be available. For instance, if a school with 14 classrooms 
increases each class by two students, it would receive one additional teacher. 
But that teacher might have to share a classroom with another instructor. 
</P>
<P>
Q: 
</P>
<P>
How will schools decide which options to adopt? 
</P>
<P>
A: 
</P>
<P>
Parents, staff (including clerical and support workers as well as teachers) and 
community representatives who serve on approved school councils will vote on 
each option. The option receiving the most votes will be chosen. But the Board 
of Education will have final approval. 
</P>
<P>
Q: 
</P>
<P>
Will my elementary school child be on the same schedule as my children in 
junior and senior high school? 
</P>
<P>
A: 
</P>
<P>
District officials say every effort will be made to keep all children in a 
family on the same schedule but they cannot guarantee that every request can be 
satisfied. Officials note, however, that placing the entire district on the 
90/30 calendar by 1991 will make it easier to keep families together. 
</P>
<P>
Q: 
</P>
<P>
What happens now? What is the timetable? 
</P>
<P>
A: 
</P>
<P>
The 109 elementary schools must submit a plan by April. All other elementary 
campuses have until February, 1991, to submit their plans. The deadlines for 
junior and senior high schools will be determined by next February. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, informational meetings will be held at schools over the next two 
months to explain the options and solicit input from parents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
YEAR-ROUND '90 / 30' SCHOOL CALENDAR 
</P>
<P>
This is how the "multi-track 90/30" year-round calendar, adopted by the Los 
Angeles Board of Education Monday, might work. 
</P>
<P>
District officials will be refining the calendar this spring. The calendar is 
called 90/30 because it provides two roughly 90-day academic terms and two 
roughly 30-day vacation breaks. 
</P>
<P>
If a school chooses the "multi-track" version (A through D), enrollment would 
be divided into four groups, or tracks. Students on three of those tracks would 
be in school at any one time. Vacations would be rotated. This option would 
allow a school to operate through the summer months and thereby accommodate up 
to a third more students than it could under a traditional September to June 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
If a school chose single track (A only), no additional classroom seats would 
result. But this option would allow students to maintain the same schedule as 
students in the rest of the district.

A TRUE COMPROMISE: 'NOBODY LIKES IT'; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: THE DECISION ON A YEAR-ROUND SCHEDULE WAS A WRENCHING ONE FOR THE L.A. 
BOARD, BUT THE DISTRICT HAD TO DEAL WITH EXPLOSIVE ENROLLMENT GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles school board member Roberta Weintraub called it the board's most 
difficult meeting in the last decade. At times, it deteriorated into 
name-calling and was punctuated by yelling and tears. 
</P>
<P>
But eight hours after they began the debate, board members voted early Tuesday 
to put the entire 610,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District on a 
year-round schedule, beginning in July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The final plan was a compromise that ordered a common calendar for virtually 
all schools, and allowed 109 schools originally slated to go year-round this 
summer to remain on traditional calendars until the remainder of the district 
converts in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a true compromise in the sense that nobody likes it," board President 
Jackie Goldberg said Tuesday. "But it does the things that had to happen. We 
had to have more space, and we had to have a common calendar, and this does 
both." 
</P>
<P>
The plan satisfied many parents, who had feared that the board would force some 
schools to go year-round this year, without enough time to plan for the switch. 
But it left others uneasy that the result will be a district full of schools 
crammed beyond capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that this solves the problems," said Laura Ziskin, parent of a 
Canyon Elementary School student and one of the organizers of a rally last 
weekend that drew hundreds of parents protesting year-round schools. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going to happen in 1993 when everybody's on multi-track and we still 
don't have room? I think our concerns are still the same -- the focus (in the 
district) is not on education." 
</P>
<P>
But board member Leticia Quezada expressed hope Tuesday that approval of the 
plan -- after years of vacillation -- will spell the end of the era of 
scrambling to find seats for students and allow the board to refocus on 
instructional issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts to rest the housing questions and allows us to deal with the 
educational issues," she said. "My hope is there's enough people out there who 
will say, 'This is a modest, sensible approach that mandates change, but does 
not order it tomorrow.' 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can all get through the process by trying to make it work. The other 
choice -- to do nothing -- is not a real choice." 
</P>
<P>
The move to a year-round calendar and the requirement that all schools in the 
district increase their capacities by 23% by 1993 is expected to generate about 
60,000 seats in a district that is growing by about 15,000 students each year. 
</P>
<P>
The switch to year-round will also help the district compete for more 
construction and air-conditioning money from the state -- which offers 
year-round districts priority in tapping the limited funds. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig characterized the 
year-round plan as inevitable in a district experiencing such explosive growth. 
"If they didn't do something, they were in trouble," he said. "They postponed 
it two years ago, and now 24,000 (students) are being bused" because they can't 
be accommodated in their overcrowded neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Year-round may not be the best solution, but it's better than what the 
alternatives would have been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved 5 to 2 after split votes on many of its 19 separate 
measures, requires 109 elementary schools to increase their capacities this 
year, by either increasing class sizes, using a multi-track year-round schedule 
or adding portable classrooms. The remainder of the district's 400 schools not 
already on multi-track, year-round schedules must increase their capacities by 
the 1992-93 school year. 
</P>
<P>
Voting against the plan were West San Fernando Valley representative Julie 
Korenstein, who said she does not support the concept of a common calendar for 
all schools, and South-Central Los Angeles representative Rita Walters, a 
perennial proponent of year-round schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I still support year-round for the entire district, but I voted (against it) 
as a protest to the actions (other board members) were taking," Walters said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Walters accused several of her colleagues of trying to manipulate the 
year-round calendar to provide the longest possible summer vacation for 
students at single-track schools, while shortening the summer vacation of some 
multi-track students. 
</P>
<P>
"What is best for the 15% (the percentage of Anglo students in the district) is 
driving the decision-making on what is best for 85% of the children," she said. 
"My constituents are sick of being on the short end of the stick." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's acrimonious hearing reflected the highly charged nature of the 
debate over year-round -- an issue perceived very differently by board members 
representing overcrowded areas that desperately need the seats year-round 
provides, and suburban areas that see year-round as a threat to neighborhood 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
While every board member acknowledged the need to increase space in the 
district, it appeared at several points during the protracted debate that the 
board would not be able to muster the four-vote majority necessary to approve 
any plan to generate the seats. 
</P>
<P>
In the board's first vote of the evening, the specific measure to adopt a 
year-round schedule was rejected when board members could not agree on a common 
calendar. Then, board members reconsidered the measure and approved it 4 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get into emotional issues like this that are extremely political, 
with such an enormous amount of public interest, things are pulling at you from 
every area," said Roberta Weintraub, who represents the East San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way you're going to make an unemotional, totally logical decision. 
You're going to try and sit there and balance on the teeter-totter until you 
can find a place to rest without falling off." 
</P>
<P>
During the marathon discussion that began at 5 p.m. Monday and ended at 1 a.m. 
Tuesday, the original plan was transformed by a myriad of amendments and 
compromises to provide wider latitude to schools in choosing single or 
multi-track calendars -- a victory for parents who had complained that they had 
too little time to adapt to a year-round calendar and worried about fragmenting 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
"My thinking was if we could delay the plan a year to give people as much lead 
time as possible, then . . . give them more flexibility for schools to work 
together to come up with a plan . . . that was the core of a package that I 
could support," said Mark Slavkin, who proposed an amendment giving schools 
more flexibility in determining options to reach the 23% capacity increase. 
</P>
<P>
District officials estimate that about 130 of the district's 600 schools will 
be on multi-track schedules by September because there is no other way for them 
to increase space. 
</P>
<P>
Others will probably convert to multi-track during the next few years, if 
enrollment growth projected at more than 15,000 per year materializes. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin Avenue Elementary School in South-Central Los Angeles is one of the 
schools that will probably go multi-track year-round this year. About 685 
students attend the school, and another 300 are bused as far away as San Pedro 
and Granada Hills because they cannot be accommodated at Nevin. 
</P>
<P>
About 125 of those students could return to the school if it went year-round. 
Principal Louis Owens said parents are not entirely happy with the year-round 
proposal, but "they will adjust." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is we have run out of options," Owens said. "Even if we could 
build schools at a record pace, we couldn't keep up. And who would pay? Nobody 
would pay for the bond issues that will build new schools. We have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
Parents at the nearby USC Performing Arts Magnet School worried that the change 
to a year-round calendar would be incompatible with the school's mission. 
</P>
<P>
"As a parent, I realize that the school district is between a rock and a hard 
place," said Stanley Yon, father of two children at the school. "But 
potentially, it is very disrupting." 
</P>
<P>
His 9-year-old daughter may not be able to attend a special summer session of 
the Joffrey Ballet school in New York next year because it could conflict with 
the new year-round schedule, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And teachers worried that scheduling music, dance or drama performances will be 
difficult under a multi-track schedule that rotates students in and out of 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the year-round provisions, the plan approved by the board also: 
</P>
<P>
* Provides air-conditioning first to those schools that volunteer to go 
multi-track year round. 
</P>
<P>
* Orders Burton Street Elementary School in Panorama City reopened to serve as 
a receiving school for children from nearby overcrowded neighborhoods. The 
school was one of several closed because of declining enrollment in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
* Reconfigures campuses in the Verdugo Hills High School area to shift ninth 
graders to high school and sixth graders to junior high, opening up seats for 
younger students in the elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
* Loosens requirements on how many portable classrooms a school can 
accommodate, while restricting any school from using portables to push their 
enrollment above 1,000.

Six black inmates who claimed they were brutalized by sheriff's deputies in 
racially motivated attacks at the Hall of Justice jail accepted an offer by the 
county Tuesday to settle a civil rights suit. 
</P>
<P>
At the county's request, attorneys would not disclose the amount of the 
settlement, reached just before trial was to begin in a case triggered by 
fracases in the Los Angeles Hall of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
One of the plaintiffs, Sammy E. Carlyle, was left wheelchair-bound as a result 
of injuries he sustained in one incident. Richard Eiden, an attorney for the 
plaintiffs, said only that the offer was adequate.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHUCK NORRIS TO HELP PAY FOR YOUTH'S FUNERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martial arts film star Chuck Norris said this week he will help pay for the 
funeral of a Sylmar teen-ager -- the son of international kick-boxing champions 
-- who was killed Saturday in a gang-related drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The victims' parents, William (Blinky) and Lilly Rodriguez, are well known in 
kick boxing, an Oriental sport that allows use of the feet as well as fists. 
</P>
<P>
Norris, a family friend, knew the slain boy. 
</P>
<P>
Norris said he will contribute to a trust fund to cover the funeral costs. 
There also will be a benefit kick-boxing event today at the Hollywood 
Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
Sonny Rodriguez, 16, was fatally shot Saturday in Sylmar by youths shouting 
gang slogans. Police said Sonny was also believed to be a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
Two men arrested in the case -- Mario Hernandez, 20, and Lorenzo Martinez, 19, 
both of Pacoima -- have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and attempted 
murder.

<P>
After hearing testimony from dozens of speakers condemning the aerial spraying 
of malathion, the Glendale City Council adopted a resolution Tuesday calling 
for a moratorium on use of the pesticide in the area. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Glendale joined half a dozen cities in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties that have asked for an end to spraying of the pesticide until more 
research is done into its effects on humans and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers, some holding babies, told the council they fled the city or 
sent their children away Monday night to avoid contact with malathion, which 
was sprayed to help eradicate the Medfly.

COMPROMISE ETHICS REFORM PLAN PREPARED FOR COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: THE PROPOSAL REVIVES THE IDEA OF PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FINANCING. A PAY 
RAISE IS ALSO LINKED TO THE BALLOT MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A revived proposal to establish public financing of political campaigns emerged 
in Los Angeles on Tuesday as part of a new ethics-in-government compromise that 
will be brought before the City Council next week. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the compromise still were being worked out, but sources said it 
includes a proposal to put ethics reforms and a pay raise for council members 
together on the same ballot measure. Linking the ethics and pay raise proposals 
is meant to be an incentive to win the votes of some council members who oppose 
public financing, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Public financing would be placed as a second ballot proposal, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise is a late attempt by Councilman Michael Woo to revive public 
campaign financing in time to place it on the June ballot as part of an ethics 
reform package approved by the council last month. 
</P>
<P>
The council killed a proposal on Jan. 19 to establish public financing of 
political campaigns, upsetting an agreement worked out between Woo and Geoffrey 
Cowan, the head of an ethics-in-government commission appointed last spring by 
Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan's commission had drafted a broad ethics package that called for public 
financing, a ban on outside income for public officials and a prohibition on 
lobbying by public officials for a year after they leave office. Cowan said he 
would call for a citizen's initiative if the council failed to pass an ethics 
package that included the commission' major proposals. 
</P>
<P>
With a flurry of amendments two weeks ago, the council "tore the guts out of 
the proposal," according to Woo, who has since been trying to win support for 
restoring many of the provisions thrown out by the council. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said Tuesday he is close to having the eight votes needed to recall the 
measure and amend it next Tuesday, when matter comes before the council for a 
final vote. 
</P>
<P>
In a 10-5 vote, the council decided Tuesday to give Woo an extra week to gather 
support for his effort. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said he has given up on trying to win the support of Councilmen Zev 
Yaroslavsky and Ernani Bernardi -- both staunch opponents of public financing 
-- but added that "everyone else is fair game." 
</P>
<P>
Several sources said Tuesday that council members want Cowan to push publicly 
for the pay raise in order to take the political heat off them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that is an appropriate role for the commission," Cowan said, 
adding, however, that he would not oppose the pay raise if it included a ban on 
outside income and honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
"If the pay raise were also included, I'm confident that it would be a measure 
that we could still back with enthusiasm," Cowan said.

SILENT STATEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
PROSECUTOR USES DRAMATICS TO SUM UP IN MANSLAUGHTER TRIAL 
</P>

<P>
After eight days of testimony, it took Deputy Dist. Atty. James Rogan only 
minutes to give his closing argument in the trial of a Glendale man accused of 
killing two mothers and two daughters while driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
He said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the lanky prosecutor silently lined up 10 plastic cups on the jury's 
banister and filled them with beer. That was the number of beers prosecution 
experts contend that William Conway must have drunk on July 13, 1988, when he 
drove over a traffic island and hit five pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
Rogan held up four fingers -- one for each of the victims -- then angrily 
snapped his fingers. Gone, just like that, Rogan's stern face told the six-man, 
six-woman jury. The expression lingered for a moment. Then he took his seat. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic performance on Monday brought to a close the Pasadena Superior 
Court trial of Conway, a 28-year-old former Glendale parks and recreation 
worker. It preceded a lengthy argument by Public Defender Michael Allensworth 
that Conway was not drunk, but simply driving too fast through a dangerous 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
The trial carried heavy emotional undertones, evident in the grimaces of jurors 
as they watched a graphic police videotape of the accident scene, in the 
courtroom demeanor of Conway's elderly mother, Virginia Conway, and in the 
tearful testimony of a 13-year-old boy who survived that day as he watched his 
mother and sister die. 
</P>
<P>
The trial had been anxiously awaited by the Glendale community, which had seen 
in this case its worst and most tragic traffic accident ever. Jurors reached a 
verdict Tuesday afternoon and will announce it this morning. 
</P>
<P>
William Kilpatrick Conway is charged with four counts of gross vehicular 
manslaughter and two counts of causing an accident with injuries while driving 
under the influence of alcohol. If convicted, he could face up to 18 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses for both the prosecution and defense agreed on a general account of 
the accident: On July 13, Conway had driven his mother's 1974 Chevrolet Nova to 
Verdugo Road in Glendale to help his sister, Louise, change a flat tire. 
Afterward, she left -- and he entered nearby Mike's Verdugo Room bar. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Patricia Carr, 36; her daughter, Caren, 6; Valerie Cramer, 32; her 
daughter, Brianna, 9, and her son, Billy, 11, were returning home from an 
evening stroll. They were waiting on a dirt-and-gravel traffic island to cross 
Verdugo Road. 
</P>
<P>
About 8:30 p.m., three hours after he had entered the bar, Conway came speeding 
toward that intersection. As he rounded the curve of Verdugo, he lost control 
of the car. The mothers and daughters were struck and killed; Billy survived 
with a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses and experts for the prosecution testified that Conway was traveling 
at nearly 80 m.p.h. in the 35-m.p.h. zone. Tests within two hours of the 
accident found his blood-alcohol level as high as 0.15%, they testified; at the 
time, it was illegal to drive with a 0.10% level, which has since been reduced 
to 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's experts also told jurors that the Nova was old and worn but 
had no defects. And the intersection, they said, although it offered no guard 
rails or concrete curbs , was not inherently unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
Defense experts testified that Conway was going slower than 65 m.p.h., and was 
not above the legal limit for intoxication until after the accident. They 
argued that it takes a certain amount of time for alcohol to be absorbed into 
the bloodstream, and he had left the bar just before the accident. Other 
defense witnesses described the intersection as dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument Monday, Allensworth asked jurors to consider a verdict 
of simple negligence -- a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of one year in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the trial, Billy Cramer offered a tearful recounting of the 
incident. At one point, Judge Carol Fieldhouse recessed the trial for five 
minutes during the boy's testimony to allow him to recover. After the break, 
Allensworth pressed Billy Cramer about a discrepancy in his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Billy had told Rogan that he had less than two seconds to dive from the path of 
the speeding car. But on the night of the accident, Allensworth said, Billy 
told police he had five to 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't warn them, did you?" the attorney asked the boy, referring to the 
four others on the traffic island. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Billy said. 
</P>
<P>
"But you had time to warn them, didn't you?" Allensworth asked. 
</P>
<P>
Billy's head fell. "I guess I did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Conway, the defendant's mother, broke into tears. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange set the stage for an emotional trial. During the first two days, 
the victims' families and friends winced as witnesses to the accident recounted 
it. William Cramer, Billy's father, and Patrick Carr, who also lost his wife 
and daughter, got up and left the courtroom a week later when jurors watched a 
graphic police videotape of the scene. 
</P>
<P>
During a recess after the film, Patrick Carr stood nervously outside the 
courtroom. "Was it bad? Did they show their faces?" asked the 38-year-old 
electrical contractor. "Was it best that I didn't see it?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it was best, a friend answered. 
</P>
<P>
As he often did during the trial, Fieldhouse on Monday leaned back in his 
chair, his tie and collar loosened, as jurors listened to closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"This accident happened because Mr. Conway drove too fast, and as a result, he 
missed the curve. That's all he did," Allensworth said. "Anybody could speed, 
and in speeding lose control of the car. That is not gross negligence." 
</P>
<P>
For rebuttal, Rogan chose to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Conway appears to be a special kind of defendant. In my heart I believe 
he's a man of remorse," the prosecutor said. "But when this case is over and 
the jury's gone home, there is one final act that needs to be played out. That 
is the act of responsibility."

CASTING SEARCH PAYOFF: TWO FRESH FACES; 
</P>
<P>
FILMS: CASTING DIRECTOR DAVID RUBIN SCOURED THE COUNTRY TO FIND TWO YOUNG 
ACTORS 'JUST RIGHT' FOR 'MEN DON'T LEAVE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Claims of "nationwide talent searches" are often the stuff of publicity press 
kits. But for the Geffen Co.'s "Men Don't Leave," released here Friday by 
Warner Bros., casting director David Rubin insists he "truly scoured the 
country" to find two fresh performers for the crucial roles of star Jessica 
Lange's young sons. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin ticks off the open casting sessions he held in nearly a dozen cities from 
coast to coast a year-and-a-half ago -- Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Boston, 
San Diego, Houston-Dallas, Toronto-Vancouver, Minneapolis, among them -- 
working with schools, local talent agencies and theater groups. "I not only 
attended drama classes, but made my way through lunchrooms, playgrounds and 
talked to teachers about open and emotionally expressive kids." 
</P>
<P>
The result: He found and eventually cast two Midwesterners who had never worked 
in a feature film or television episode, but who had appeared previously in a 
handful of regional commercials. Both were found through their local talent 
agencies, flown to New York to meet and read with Lange, then to do screen 
tests here, before they were signed. 
</P>
<P>
"They won the roles against literally hundreds and hundreds of competitors," 
says Rubin, whose current casting projects include Paramount's "Days of 
Thunder," starring Tom Cruise, and MGM/UA's "Delirious," with John Candy. 
</P>
<P>
Chris O'Donnell, then 17, and Charlie Korsmo, then 9, landed the plum parts in 
"Men Don't Leave" despite their lack of experience -- or perhaps because of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a real and documentary feel, so we were exhaustive in our search," 
Rubin says. "We didn't want typical, slick child actors. Unfortunately, (in the 
entertainment business), many young actors learn to create a false reality, 
which we wanted to avoid." 
</P>
<P>
The film focuses on a mother (Lange) trying to keep her family together and get 
on with life in a downscale section of Baltimore after the sudden death of her 
husband in the cushier suburbs. At turns dramatic and amusing, it requires 
performances of the two boys that are "emotionally charged but also laced with 
the comedy of everyday life," as Rubin puts it. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin credits director Paul Brickman (who shares screenplay credit with Barbara 
Benedek) and producer John Avnet for their willingness to work with 
inexperienced young actors. "We always suspected that if the Gods were smiling 
on us, we'd find kids that had just the right feel." 
</P>
<P>
A number of critics have hailed the naturalistic performances of Korsmo and -- 
in particular -- O'Donnell, even though they're billed behind Joan Cusack 
(playing an oddball neighbor who seduces O'Donnell) and Arliss Howard (Lange's 
supportive new boyfriend). 
</P>
<P>
Neither, though, has yet felt the impact of celebrity -- the film won't open in 
their hometowns until it goes into wider release Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell, now 19 and a sophomore finance major at Boston College, thought it 
was "unbelievable" that he'd been asked to audition for such a demanding part, 
which at one point calls for him to plead poignantly -- and tearfully -- with 
Howard to help his troubled mother. "I never thought I was going to get it," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell was so nonchalant, adds Rubin, that he skipped his first three 
casting appointments to attend high school crew practice (his family lives in 
Chicago). When he met Brickman, who wrote and directed the hit, "Risky 
Business" (1983), O'Donnell confesses: "I had no idea who he was, or who 
Jessica Lange was. I mean, I'd heard of her, but that was it. I really wasn't 
with it, as far as movies go." 
</P>
<P>
It was just that easygoing attitude that first caught Rubin's eye. "There was 
something so offhand about Chris that made him very real as a teen-age boy . . 
. We were adamant to find an actual 17-year-old who had the complex feelings of 
a teen-ager intact, so they wouldn't have to be falsified. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris had to be both a child and an adult simultaneously." 
</P>
<P>
Once he started shooting scenes, O'Donnell recalls, "I kept thinking, what am I 
getting myself into? (But) they prepared me a lot before filming. I had a ton 
of support behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Despite picking up some spending money by making regional commercials as a 
teen-ager, O'Donnell is clearly blase about Hollywood -- he was busy looking 
for a new apartment with his college roommates when a reporter called. The 
youngest of seven children, he says he's been reading scripts sent by his new 
Hollywood agent (The Bauer-Benedek Agency, one of whose main partners is 
married to screenwriter Benedek), but has no current acting plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot to give up school. I missed a semester during filming. So I 
don't want to just take the next thing that comes up. I'm just kind of checking 
it out right now." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Korsmo, however, is going places, and not just to the classes for the 
gifted that the 11-year-old attends, studying such subjects as "functional 
statistics and trigonometry." 
</P>
<P>
After wrapping "Men Don't Leave" in late 1988, he was cast by star-director 
Warren Beatty in "Dick Tracy," after casting director Jackie Burch heard 
through the grapevine about the young actor's work in "Men." Korsmo, who lives 
with his two brothers and divorced mother in Minneapolis, has the sizable role 
of The Kid, an orphan taken in by detective Dick Tracy in the big-budget Disney 
film, due for release June 15. 
</P>
<P>
The precocious Korsmo had a headache the first time he read for "Men Don't 
Leave," and didn't feel he'd be called back. But when Rubin asked him to sum up 
the role he was up for, Korsmo recalls telling him: " 'My dad's dead, my mom's 
sick, my life's a mess.' I think that got his attention." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin says younger performers tend to be more expressive than teen-agers. "Up 
to about 8 or 9, kids are natural actors. Playing pretend is part of their 
daily recreation." 
</P>
<P>
For "Men Don't Leave," however, he needed a small boy who was also "in touch 
with his darker side," to express feelings related to the loss of a father. "It 
takes a special child who can recall special events in his life or create it. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie had to trust us emotionally. He was fairly fearless in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
While "Men Don't Leave" and "Dick Tracy" will undoubtedly give impetus to 
Korsmo's career, his mother, doctoral student Debbie Korsmo, has ruled out the 
year-round grind of TV series work for her 6th-grade son. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't moving," she says firmly. "(And) I won't let him audition for 
something the whole family can't go see." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie calls his part in "Dick Tracy" "a pretty big role" in a movie with "no 
blood but lots of shooting." He enjoyed working with Beatty and the gang, he 
says, except for one running gag in the script. 
</P>
<P>
"They make a joke about how I'm always eating. I hate eating (at 4-4, he weighs 
56 pounds). In one scene, I had to eat a big club sandwich, three sundaes, 
chicken and mashed potatoes -- all in half an hour! 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, I just stood up and said, 'I'm done!' " 
</P>
<P>
The potential high point during the five month shoot came when Beatty invited 
Korsmo and his hired chaperon to have dinner at Beatty's house with co-stars 
Madonna and Al Pacino. But it was pretty ho-hum for the worldly 11-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly," he says, "I just talked with Al all night."

S.D. CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO BUILD A HAVEN FROM THE STREETS; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: CONSTRUCTION OF CENTER IS CONTINGENT ON REACHING AGREEMENT WITH 
CALTRANS ON USE OF THE STATE-OWNED SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council approved Tuesday construction of a $732,000 day 
center for the homeless that will provide showers, counseling, lounging areas 
and other services to as many as 200 people at one time. 
</P>
<P>
But ground-breaking on the 5,000-square-foot building at 17th and K streets 
will not occur until the Centre City Development Corp. and Caltrans complete 
negotiations on a lease for the Caltrans-owned property adjacent to the 
Imperial Ave. on- and off-ramps to southbound Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
Financed with a combination of CCDC, city, county, Port District and private 
funds, the day center is envisioned as a way of getting homeless people -- 
primarily men -- off the streets of downtown. The facility will provide 
showers, haircuts, mail and message pick-up and counseling from early morning 
until early evening. 
</P>
<P>
It also will offer respite from life on the street. One hundred people will be 
accommodated inside the building, and another 100 will be able to lounge on the 
facility's fenced-in lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Men who are clearly under the influence of alcohol or drugs will be allowed 
into the outdoor lawn area, but will not be allowed inside the building, said 
Frank Landerville, executive director of the Regional Task Force on the 
Homeless. Only a security guard will live in the building, which tentatively 
has been named the Neil Good Day Center for Homeless Men. 
</P>
<P>
Episcopal Community Services, a social service agency, has been chosen to run 
the facility, but the contract has not yet been approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing will happen until the lease is signed. Landerville, executive 
director of the Regional Task Force for the Homeless, said that talks on the $1 
per month lease with Caltrans have be going on for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's been one of their priorities," Landerville said. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Kirwan, deputy district director for Caltrans, said that he could not 
predict when the lease would be signed. He said the two-year time-frame 
includes all conceptual discussions of the center, and that discussion of the 
actual lease has gone on for an unspecified, shorter period.

CARLSBAD COUNCILMAN UNDER STATE REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission said Tuesday it is reviewing an 
allegation of conflict of interest involving Carlsbad City Councilman John 
Mamaux's efforts to secure nearly $500,000 for a road improvement project. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Thomas W. Smith complained to the commission that Mamaux urged the 
council to spend the money to upgrade Palomar Airport Road, a project Smith 
claims would benefit Mamaux's employer. 
</P>
<P>
Mamaux is president of Centre Mortgage Co., which has offices near the road. 
Centre Mortgage is owned by Dean Greenberg, who also owns Centre Development, 
which has land around the airport. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 2, before Mamaux disclosed that he had gone to work for Centre Mortgage 
the previous November, the city staff asked for the council's direction on how 
to spend $488,000 from the assessment district formed around the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Mamaux acknowledged Tuesday he pushed the council to earmark the funds for 
landscaped medians on Palomar Airport Road. The staff then was ordered to 
research the matter and return to the council for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
However, Smith says that Mamaux's push to upgrade the road constitutes improper 
lobbying that would benefit the councilman's employer and, therefore, himself. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a classic conflict of interest," Smith said. "He didn't even disclose 
who he was working for." 
</P>
<P>
Smith maintains that improving the road would increase the value of Centre 
Mortgage offices and lands held by Centre Development, which he said "owns all 
the land around the airport." 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the Fair Political Practices Commission, 
confirmed Tuesday that the agency is reviewing Smith's complaint. She said it 
could take from two weeks to several months for the commission to decide 
whether or not to launch an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
State law, she said, prohibits an elected official from making a governmental 
decision that would affect a personal financial interest, "including any source 
of income" such as a salary. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mamaux said Smith's action "is just political harassment." Both men 
acknowledge clashing over the Carlsbad growth control issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I go way back with Mr. Mamaux," Smith said. "We've battled for years and years 
over development." 
</P>
<P>
The councilman, who served for a time as Carlsbad's city manager in the 1960s, 
said there was no conflict of interest in trying to sway the council into 
allocating the money for Palomar Airport Road. 
</P>
<P>
"Centre Mortgage doesn't own any property. We rent office space in a building" 
and thus wouldn't monetarily benefit from upgrading the road, Mamaux said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, although Greenberg owns both Centre Mortgage and Centre Development, 
Mamaux denied Smith's claim that the mortgage firm is a subsidiary. Instead, 
"we're a separate profit center within the holdings of Dean Greenberg," Mamaux 
said. 
</P>
<P>
City Attorney Vincent Biondo Jr. said Tuesday that the council will receive 
advice concerning any conflict of interest before a vote is taken on how to 
spend the funds. 
</P>
<P>
Since there has been no vote, Biondo doesn't believes Mamaux has done anything 
wrong. "I have no concerns about the discussion of the item when it was with 
the council before," Biondo said, calling Smith's complaint "premature." 
</P>
<P>
Smith also asked the San Diego County district attorney's office to look into 
Mamaux's purported conflict. But Deputy District Atty. Rodger Overholser told 
Smith last week that his office wouldn't get involved because a potential 
witness, Carlsbad City Councilman Mark Pettine, is a deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Smith is preparing to ask state Atty. Gen. John Van De Kamp's 
office to explore the alleged conflict of interest.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: SAN MARCOS GRAD GIVES NEW MEANING TO RADICAL CHIC: 'SQUAT 
OR ROT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's nice to know some things never change. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Berkeley are protesting. The Barrington 40 have semi-barricaded 
themselves inside a cooperative dormitory just off the University of California 
campus, a few blocks from People's Park. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the storm is an honors graduate from San Marcos High School: 
Rebekah Ekberg, a sophomore majoring in dance, music and physiology. 
</P>
<P>
She has emerged as the spokeswoman for the group that refuses to leave 
Barrington Hall despite an eviction order from the student-run cooperative 
association. 
</P>
<P>
She's credited with coin- 
</P>
<P>
ing the rallying cry that now appears on tie-dyed T-shirts: Squat or Rot. She 
was quoted: "This is my home. This is an environment I choose to be in." 
</P>
<P>
The student association says Barrington Hall is a hotbed of rowdy parties, 
acidheads and freeloaders. Somebody threw a washer and dryer from the roof. 
</P>
<P>
The Barrington protesters say that's all hooey. They say the eviction move is a 
ploy in the never-ending factionalism of student politics. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters are allowed to go to classes, but once back at Barrington, they get 
no visitors and no phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Rebekah is radical but not radical destructive like the old days," says a 
Daily Cal reporter. "She's radical new wave, sensible, goal-directed. She 
developed her own major." 
</P>
<P>
Randy Wilson, head counselor at San Marcos High, remembers Ekberg having "great 
passion" for anything she tackled, from honors English to cheerleading. 
</P>
<P>
"What I remember best about Becky was her willingness to be different," Wilson 
said. "She didn't fit into any mold, which is hard to do on a high school 
campus where there is so much peer pressure to conform. Becky was always 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
Marv Glusac, the principal, also recalls Ekberg fondly. And he has some 
paternal advice, straight from the 1960s.

MOTORIST OK AFTER TRUCK TOPPLES BEAM

<P>
A La Jolla man suffered only a broken hand and bruises Tuesday when a steel 
beam was dislodged from a freeway bridge under construction and crushed his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
The girder fell on the eastbound lanes of Interstate 8 at the California 163 
interchange after a Navy trailer riding high on the back of a flatbed truck 
tried to squeeze under the new overpass and scraped several girders, knocking 
one down. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Murry, 46, was listed in good condition at UC San Diego Medical Center, 
hospital spokeswoman Nancy Stringer said. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officers at the scene marveled that Murry escaped 
with relatively minor injuries. The 1989 Acura he was driving was crumpled like 
a tin can and declared a total loss. The 60-foot steel beam bounced off the car 
and fell on the pavement with such force that it bent. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Murry is very lucky, and I mean very lucky," CHP Officer Jim Anderson 
said. "There were 30 feet of skid marks. He must have hit his brakes at just 
the right moment. If he had hit them one foot later, his side of the car would 
have been directly under the beam." 
</P>
<P>
The 10:14 a.m. accident shut down eastbound traffic on I-8 for about 40 
minutes, Anderson said. CHP officers routed traffic to southbound 163. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Cadave, 57, who was driving the Navy truck from a naval base in Point 
Loma, was cited at the scene for operating an over-height vehicle and violating 
the permit issued by the California Department of Transportation to transport 
the communications trailer, Anderson said. Cadave was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
According to Caltrans, the Navy truck was issued a permit Monday with a height 
restriction of 14 feet, 8 inches. Anderson said that measurements showed that 
the vehicle and trailer combined measured between 15 feet 1 3/4 inches and 15 
feet 5 1/2 inches. Caltrans officials said the bridge, which will connect 
westbound I-8 to southbound 163, has a clearance of 14 feet 11 inches. 
</P>
<P>
"The trailer riding on the truck wouldn't fit under the bridge. He hit about 
five or six beams, and the last one came down on the highway," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the beam fell at an angle and "took out the passenger side" of 
Murry's car, including the windshield and dashboard, and crushed the left front 
tire. 
</P>
<P>
"The roof came down on him, so he got a knot on his head and a few abrasions. 
But for all practical purposes, he is in remarkably good shape. It's amazing 
that that outcome wasn't more tragic," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Murry was driving in the No. 2 lane and Cadave was in the No. 3, he added. The 
trailer had minor damage, most of it limited to the roof, where some metal was 
peeled back. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the trailer was being transported to North Island Naval Air 
Station and that the Caltrans permit required Cadave to take a route east from 
Point Loma on I-8 and south on I-805 before returning to the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials said the accident will not delay work on the $13-million 
project, which began in April and is expected to be completed in the summer of 
1991.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 7TH CANDIDATE JOINS SAN FERNANDO RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A seventh candidate entered the San Fernando City Council race Tuesday, just 
before the filing period for the April 10 election ended. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Villafana, a social worker who chairs the city's Parks and Recreation 
Commission, returned his nomination papers Tuesday, assistant city clerk Wilma 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the city's five council seats will be filled in the election. The 
filing period was extended until Tuesday because incumbent Councilman Evelio 
Franco chose not to run. 
</P>
<P>
Two other incumbents -- Mayor Daniel Acuna and Councilman Doude Wysbeek -- 
filed last week. Acuna is a real estate consultant, and Wysbeek owns a local 
electric motor business. 
</P>
<P>
Four challengers also filed papers last week: Jose Hernandez, a planning 
commissioner and urban studies professor at Cal State Northridge; Linda Jauron, 
a businesswoman and volunteer at the San Fernando YWCA; Gabe Rodriguez, a 
retired manufacturing plant supervisor and long-time San Fernando resident; and 
Mary Jane Tuomy, a planning commissioner who previously served as a parks and 
recreation commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The council governs the 2.4-square-mile city of 20,000, located in the 
northeastern San Fernando Valley.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDER OFFERS TO DELAY CONTROVERSIAL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developer of a proposed affordable housing development in Hidden Hills has 
offered to hold the property for a year to give city officials time to resolve 
a controversy over the project. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Howard made the offer Monday night at a meeting of the Hidden Hills City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he would consider selling the 2 1/2-acre parcel to the city for 
$1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Howard's entire project would encompass 25 acres, with nine luxury houses built 
on 20 acres inside the town's gates. The remaining five acres would be outside 
the gates and would be split between a commercial building and the City 
Council's proposed 46-unit affordable apartment or condominium building for 
senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The affordable housing portion of the project has generated controversy among 
some Hidden Hills residents. City officials have said the housing would settle 
a lawsuit by Los Angeles County and an attorney over Hidden Hills' use of a 
redevelopment agency. But in a poll conducted last month by the council, about 
two-thirds of the respondents opposed the council's plan. Hidden Hills is a 
community made up almost exclusively of single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
Under the offer Howard made Monday, the council would continue to hold public 
hearings on the luxury houses and the commercial building, but Howard would 
agree not to oppose a 12-month delay in the council's decision on what to do 
with the low-cost housing parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The council took Howard's proposal under advisement, along with suggestions by 
Councilman H. Brian Herdeg that the city consider buying the parcel for a new 
city hall site.

JUDGE HEARS DEBATE ON USE OF 'ROVING WIRETAP'; 
</P>
<P>
INDICTMENT: LAWYERS FOR SILBERMAN, AND FOUR OTHERS CHARGED WITH MONEY 
LAUNDERING, CHALLENGE SCOPE OF LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge sat quietly and offered no clues to his views as lawyers argued 
Tuesday over whether the nation's first use of a "roving wiretap," a tap on 
multiple phones that led to the indictment of San Diego businessman Richard T. 
Silberman, was legal. 
</P>
<P>
All U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving -- the first judge in the country to 
consider the legality of the new law under which FBI agents carried out the 
taps -- offered at a daylong hearing Tuesday was that it was a "key issue" and 
he hoped to decide it soon. 
</P>
<P>
Irving heard argument on various issues raised by lawyers for Silberman, 
reputed mobster Chris Petti and three other men, all indicted on federal 
money-laundering charges, but made no rulings Tuesday on any of them. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those seven issues were defense requests to dismiss charges for 
perceived technical defects in the way they were detailed in the indictment. 
Eleven issues remain to be argued when the hearing resumes today, including 
whether prosecutors may use an FBI report of Silberman's behavior immediately 
after his arrest last April 7. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, the husband of county Supervisor Susan Golding, is accused with 
Petti and the three others of laundering $300,000 in cash that an undercover 
agent allegedly characterized as proceeds from Colombian drug dealers. Their 
trial is scheduled to begin in April. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's session, the beginning of the major pretrial hearing scheduled in 
the case, much of the lawyers' attention focused on the "roving wiretap" issue, 
both because it was a first and because of the opportunity defense lawyers saw 
to knock out key evidence. 
</P>
<P>
One of Silberman's lawyers, George Harris of San Francisco, told Irving that 
the taps, carried out under a 1986 law, violated the constitutional bar against 
"unreasonable searches and seizures." 
</P>
<P>
The law allows authorities to bug the conversations of a criminal suspect 
regardless of what telephone or location a suspect might use. The roving taps, 
through which agents heard Silberman, were aimed initially at Petti, and were 
carried out from July, 1987, through early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A traditional wiretap requires police to satisfy the Constitution by obtaining 
a warrant that "particularly describes" the phone to be tapped, Harris said. 
Since that was impossible with a "roving" tap, because it contemplates the use 
of many phones, the new law is fatally flawed, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
If the law is illegal, any evidence gathered from the taps is tainted and must 
be barred from use at the trial, Harris contended. 
</P>
<P>
Petti's lawyer, Oscar Goodman of Las Vegas, told Irving that the use of the 
taps was not only illegal but unnecessary. The surveillance that eventually led 
to Silberman began with information on Petti that a confidential informant, 
Robert Benjamin, had provided since September, 1986, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
By July, 1987, Goodman said, when U.S. District Judge Gordon Thompson, the 
chief federal judge in San Diego, first authorized a roving tap, Benjamin had 
given prosecutors so much information about Petti -- and an alleged scheme by 
the Chicago mob to take over the gaming operations of the Rincon Indians in San 
Diego County -- that there was no need for any taps. 
</P>
<P>
The money-laundering operation that prosecutors have alleged was linked to the 
Indian gambling investigation through Petti, the original target of the FBI 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said the taps were necessary, because Benjamin was not -- 
nor could he have been -- at every important conversation. Further, Benjamin's 
credibility as a trial witness was suspect because he has been convicted of 
eight felonies, Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder asked Irving to "resoundingly affirm" the constitutionality of the 
roving wiretap law, saying it allows authorities to keep pace with 
sophisticated criminal suspects who use various phones to try to avoid 
detection. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a flexibility inherent in (the Constitution) to adapt to changing 
conditions and changing times," Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's lead defense lawyer, James Brosnahan, said at the beginning of the 
day that defense attorneys saw Tuesday's hearing as "the first time to talk 
about this case in a meaningful way." 
</P>
<P>
"We have not come with little technicalities," Brosnahan told Irving. "We have 
come with substance, as Your Honor will see." 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers spent all morning, however, urging Irving to dismiss most of 
the seven counts in the indictment for various technical flaws. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the heart of the case, the money-laundering charges detailed in 
counts two and three, were brought under a law that makes it a crime to launder 
cash "represented" by a federal agent to be drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
The use of that word meant FBI agents had to say explicitly that the money 
prosecutors claim the five men laundered came from 
</P>
<P>
drug trafficking, Brosnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents hinted and suggested that was the case, but never did they say so 
directly to Silberman, Brosnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew if they said so directly, Mr. Silberman would get up and leave," 
Brosnahan said. "They never did it." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Carol Lam said defense lawyers were being far too picky. 
The issue, she said, is what Silberman and the others believed at the time of 
any discussions with FBI agents, and that will be for the jury to decide, not 
the judge two months before trial. 
</P>
<P>
The defense is expected to ask today that prosecutors confirm that Benjamin, as 
Brosnahan claimed late Tuesday, was "prone to violence." 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan would not comment after the hearing on "the implications of any 
violence." He said, "There's a whole part of this case that's never been told. 
We know about it. The question is now put squarely to the government."

YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL VOTE PROMPTS RENEWED EFFORT TO BREAK UP DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando Valley parents angry over the school board's decision to operate 
schools year-round said Tuesday they will support efforts by state 
Assemblywoman Marian La Follette (R-Northridge) to break up the Los Angeles 
school district, and others said they will try to overturn the year-round 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at it so the community can have more local control over their 
children's education," said Judy Diamond, a parent at Dearborn Avenue School in 
Northridge. "I'm planning on volunteering to help." 
</P>
<P>
La Follette aide Rob Wilcox said the assemblywoman in the past two weeks has 
collected the names and phone numbers of hundreds of Valley and Westside 
parents who have expressed an interest in the idea of breaking up the 
700-square-mile, 610,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District into eight 
or more smaller districts. 
</P>
<P>
"Year-round might be the straw that broke the camel's back," Wilcox said. 
"Parents and educators we've talked to are outraged about it." 
</P>
<P>
The school board Monday voted to convert all schools in the district to some 
form of year-round schedule by summer, 1991. On a motion offered by West Valley 
board member Julie Korenstein, the board stopped short of requiring 109 
elementary schools -- including 45 in the Valley -- to change their schedules 
starting this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The board required those 109 schools, however, to increase their capacity 23% 
beginning this summer by scheduling classes year-round, adding portable 
classrooms or increasing class size. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar Elementary School Principal Yvonne Chan said Korenstein's motion to 
delay mandatory implementation of year-round schedules will only help the 
least-crowded Valley schools. At Valley schools already filled to capacity, 
such as Sylmar, there is no more playground space to put portable classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Those schools will have to pick between year-round scheduling and larger class 
sizes, "which nobody wants, so you are back to year-round," Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Romey, twice a candidate for the board and a longtime opponent of 
year-round schools, said the year's delay "gives people time to go shopping for 
private schools" and "to break up the school district." 
</P>
<P>
Romey predicted that anger over the year-round issue will breathe new life into 
efforts by La Follette, who has failed in several attempts to interest the 
Legislature in dividing the Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
This time, instead of trying to force the issue through the Legislature, La 
Follette is hoping that the state Board of Education and the Los Angeles County 
Committee on School District Organization will draft a plan to put before the 
1.5 million registered voters who live within the boundaries of the Los Angeles 
school district. The committee has seven members, elected by the county's 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette last fall sponsored a series of public hearings before a commission 
she created to look into breaking up the district. The commission's 
recommendations, expected next month, will go to the state Board of Education, 
which can recommend that the county committee come up with a redistricting 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate effort, Noel W. Weiss, a Northridge parent and attorney, said 
Tuesday he will begin a signature drive to collect the approximately 375,000 
signatures needed to put the school board's year-round decision before voters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weiss said he and other parents will begin a drive this week to collect the 
signatures of 25% of the registered voters living in the Los Angeles school 
district, the percentage required for a vote on the issue. The state Education 
Code allows for voters living in a school district to overturn a board decision 
to operate schools year-round. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we in the Valley and the Westside are not going to 
allow" year-round schools, Weiss said. A vote overturning the board decision 
will force decision makers to find other ways of accommodating students in the 
burgeoning district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was angry over some of the other changes -- all aimed at coping 
with overcrowding -- that will go along with the year-round plan. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Turner, principal of Verdugo Hills High School in Tujunga, said he and 
parents in the area are delighted at the school board's decision to allow 
neighborhood ninth-grade students to attend the school, beginning this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The change will relieve crowding at Tujunga Elementary Schools because it will 
also allow for sixth-graders to be moved to Mt. Gleason Junior High School, 
which will in turn transfer its ninth-grade classes to Verdugo Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"The PTA, Booster Club -- everybody has been pushing for this for five years," 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
The change will increase enrollment at the school from about 1,800 to close to 
its capacity of 2,500, Turner said. The 500 to 700 local ninth-grade students 
expected to attend Verdugo Hills next year will join approximately 300 
ninth-graders who are now bused to the high school from other parts of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue to pick up the bused-in kids and mix them in with our own 
kids," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo Hills High School will become the seventh high school in the Valley to 
enroll ninth- through 12th-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
Parent Jeanette Fawcett, a parent and member of the high school's school 
council, said she was happy about the decision, even though the board included 
it along with measures to eventually convert the school to a year-round 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me, I have to work here year-round anyway," said Fawcett, 
who works as a school clerk.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LANCASTER WILL PAY FOR FIREPLACE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lancaster city officials, responding to pleas from angry homeowners, have 
agreed to spend up to $160,000 to pay for repairs to as many as 32 homes with 
unsafe and potentially flammable fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
A December fire at a modular home in the Panorama Village tract in east 
Lancaster was caused by a faulty fireplace and led city officials to order 
homeowners to demolish or rebuild them to make them safe. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with that order, homeowners appealed to the city for financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting as directors of the city's redevelopment agency, members of the 
Lancaster City Council voted 3 to 0 Monday to hire a contractor to make the 
repairs. Homeowners with low-to-moderate incomes will be eligible for the 
city-funded repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the tract, north of Avenue K and west of 25th Street East, had 
blamed the developer for building the faulty fireplaces partially on wooden 
supports, and the city for not catching the problem when the homes were built 
about 1984. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, in turn, suggested that developer Jerry McGuire or Willdan 
Associates, the private company that did the city's building inspections at the 
time, should bear the blame. But McGuire no longer is an active developer in 
the area, and the city no longer contracts with Willdan.

HIGH, STORM-DRIVEN WAVES MAY BATTER THE SHORELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High waves propelled by a storm in the Gulf of Alaska and high tides are 
expected to pound San Diego beaches today and Thursday, and may cause flooding 
in low-lying areas. 
</P>
<P>
Light rains are also expected today but will dissipate by Thursday morning, 
leaving San Diegans with a nice, dry weekend, said Wilbur Shigehara, a 
forecaster for the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
Waves rising as high as 10 feet today and Thursday will make swimming and 
surfing dangerous, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"Only the foolhardy would want to attempt" going into the water, he said. 
People fishing or watching waves from buildings near the ocean should be alert 
for unusually large waves which can suddenly sweep across dry areas, Shigehara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of high waves driven by the storm and tides increasing through 
Saturday could also cause flooding in low lying coastal areas such as the 
boardwalk in Mission Beach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
High tide is at 7:19 a.m. today and 8:01 a.m. Thursday.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RANCHER HAD RIGHT TO KILL DOG, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Fernando Superior Court judge has ruled that a Canyon Country rancher 
charged with cruelty to animals for shooting a neighbor's dog had a right to 
kill the animal because it was trespassing on his property and threatening his 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John P. Farrell on Monday dismissed the charges against Ernest Lynn 
Reubens, 59, who shot Freckles, a brown and white springer spaniel belonging to 
4-year-old Erica Owen. Farrell said he based his decision on a section of the 
Food and Agriculture code that allows livestock owners to shoot any dog 
trespassing on their property. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell dismissed the charges after the closing arguments in Reubens' second 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
A first trial ended in a mistrial in December.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno was dropped Tuesday from a lawsuit in which 
a former Carlsbad police officer claims she was sexually harassed by fellow 
officers and that Jimno -- Carlsbad's police chief at the time -- failed to 
take appropriate action. 
</P>
<P>
Vista Superior Court Judge David B. Moon ruled that Jimno could not be charged 
in the civil suit by Elizabeth Rodriguez because she failed to exhaust her 
administrative remedies and because, while she made charges against "managers" 
in her legal complaints, she failed to specifically name Jimno. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, 42, alleged she was sexually harassed by several Carlsbad officers 
from 1980 to 1982. Jimno, as police chief, ordered an investigation into the 
allegations, and some disciplinary action was taken against several officers. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Moon also dropped four other defendants -- current or former 
Carlsbad police officers -- from the suit: William Ready, William Huntington, 
Michael Kelly and Robert Eyer. Still to face trial later this month are Robert 
Vales, the city's current police chief; Michael Van Hoosser, a former officer, 
and the city of Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Jimno, who is on leave as Escondido's police chief to campaign for election as 
San Diego County sheriff, could not be reached for comment.

MONTE VISTA MAKES THINGS PERFECTLY AWFUL FOR MT. MIGUEL

<P>
Mt. Miguel needed the perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
It would take nothing less for the Matadors to defeat a Monte Vista team in the 
midst of playing its best basketball of the season. Mt. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel was already without point guard Domingo Rivera, who suffered a deep 
bruise to his right thigh to end his season, and now the Matadors were facing a 
team that featured one of the top big men in the county. 
</P>
<P>
And the game was perfect for Mt. Miguel (12-8, 2-4). Perfectly awful. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista outscored Mt. Miguel, 20-4, to start the game and rolled to an 
81-60 Grossmont 3-A League victory at Mt. Miguel. The victory assured Monte 
Vista (14-6, 6-0) of at least a tie for its second consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista center Joe McNaull, who has already signed a letter of intent to 
play at San Diego State next year, scored the Monarchs' first two baskets. 
Shannon LeFever, who finished with 31 points, answered with a scoring drive 
inside to make the score 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
But Monte Vista went on a 16-2 run and led, 20-4, with just five minutes gone 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
McNaull got two fouls in the first half and played just 10 1/2 minutes. But the 
6-foot-10 center still scored nine points, had seven rebounds and three blocked 
shots during that span. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista led, 41-29, at halftime behind 21 points from Jeff Polinsky. The 
league's leading scorer finished with 34 points. McNaull had 20, points, 20 
rebounds and three blocks. RICK HAZELTINE

<TEXT>
<P>
The University of San Diego baseball team survived a late rally by Cal Baptist 
in winning its season opener, 7-6, Tuesday at Cunningham Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Cheek, a former Mt. Carmel High pitcher, allowed one run in the ninth but 
retired Cal Baptist with the tying run on third to record the save. Lou 
Skertich, who pitched three innings relieving starter Pat Fitzsimons in the 
third, was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Herde, a freshman from San Pasqual High, hit a two-run home run to center 
field in his first collegiate at-bat. USD led, 7-2, after four innings but 
allowed Cal Baptist back in it with three errors. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Martinez was three for five with two doubles and two runs batted in and 
Kyle Sebach earned his first college save as U.S. International defeated UC 
Irvine, 4-1, in a nonconference game in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Sebach, a former pitcher for Santana High, came on in the seventh with two on 
and no outs. He got out of the jam unscathed and finished up for the save. Mike 
Whisonant (1-0) pitched six innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was USIU's first victory in four games. The Anteaters fell to 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Judson and John Meyers went two-for-four with an RBI as UC San Diego won 
its season opener and first game played on its new field, 9-3 over Christ 
College Irvine. Rick Rupkey pitched five innings and scattered four hits in 
picking up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State defeated Spain, 12-1, in an exhibition game at Smith Field. 
Steve Murphy had three hits and two RBI. Six SDSU pitchers combined for a 
two-hitter.

MEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Marty Dow, center for the San Diego State basketball team, missed practice with 
a sore right foot. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg said Dow's injured tendon is in a soft cast and that 
he is "50-50" for Saturday's game against U.S. International University in the 
San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been bugging him for some time," Brandenburg said. "We'll just keep him 
off it for a couple of days and then check it. If it's sore, we'll put it back 
in (the cast), and if not, he'll go." 
</P>
<P>
Dow is one of just two Aztecs to start all 23 games this season. He is 
averaging 12.3 points and 6.1 rebounds a game. SCOTT MILLER

About 10,000 Indian students demonstrated along the India-Pakistan border in 
Jammu and Kashmir State as tension increased after a border clash between 
Indian troops and Pakistani Muslims. The demonstration was prompted by a Monday 
incident in which Pakistani supporters of Kashmir separatists crossed the 
border and were fired on by the troops.

Radicals campaigning for Maori rights heckled Queen Elizabeth II in New Zealand 
during celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of a treaty between Maori 
chiefs and British colonial authorities. 
</P>
<P>
One young woman was arrested for throwing a T-shirt at the British monarch. The 
queen, accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, appeared shaken by the 
incident in Waitangi. Maoris are descendants of Polynesians who arrived in what 
is now New Zealand more than 1,000 years ago. Radicals say New Zealand 
governments have not honored the treaty, which guaranteed them possession of 
their lands.

A Newbury Park High School teacher arrested last week for allegedly being under 
the influence of cocaine while teaching has been arrested again on suspicion of 
possessing cocaine found during a search of his house, authorities said. Larry 
Jerome Johnson, 48, was arrested when he arrived at the local Ventura County 
sheriff's station to pick up belongings he left after his first arrest, Lt. 
Bill Montijo said. 
</P>
<P>
A search of his house uncovered one gram or less of cocaine, Montijo said. 
Johnson was jailed in lieu of $5,000 bail, the lieutenant said. Johnson was 
first arrested Jan. 31 after his principal told deputies the teacher was 
behaving strangely. Johnson, a business and math teacher, said in an interview 
after that arrest that he had not taken cocaine at school, but admitted using 
the drug off-campus.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DAMEWORTH SETS PACE FOR THE NATION'S BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Winning. The word has become synonymous with Agoura High distance runner Bryan 
Dameworth. In fact, the last time Dameworth lost a race was in the state track 
and field championships last June when he finished second to David Welsh of 
Sacramento Jesuit in the 3,200-meter final. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two months after conquering the nation's finest high school 
cross-country runners in the Kinney national championships, Dameworth, a 
senior, took his enviable record to the Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden 
in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The surroundings might have been unfamiliar but not the result. Overcoming a 
case of nerves and a shaky start, Dameworth won the high school mile Friday in 
4 minutes 14.52 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, when the gun went off, it was like 'Whoa,' " said the 6-foot-3, 
163-pound Dameworth, who surged into the lead with 640 yards remaining. "It 
took a while to get into the groove." 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth defeated a field that included runner-up Martin Keino (4:16.63), a 
senior at Fork Union (Va.) Military Academy and the son of former Olympic 
champion Kip Keino of Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
It was also win No. 2 indoors for Dameworth, who captured the same event 
(4:17.77) in the prestigious Sunkist Invitational on Jan. 19 at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
There he outdistanced Keino (who finished third in 4:18.78) and Somalian Jama 
Bile (fifth, 4:19.37), younger brother of Abdi, the 1987 world champion at 
1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
But the competition on the track took a back seat for Dameworth, who had other 
concerns about visiting the Big Apple on his first trip to the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"I was making sure I didn't get killed or anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Dameworth was watching his back, Agoura Coach Bill Duley was at home in 
Calabasas thinking about being with his stepson. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed home and wondered and waited for the phone call (providing the 
results of Dameworth's race)," Duley said. "I was fine until about an hour 
before his race, then I really wanted to be there."

SOME AREA OFFICIALS FAVOR OPEN RECRUITING; 
</P>
<P>
JUNIOR COLLEGES: COURT CASE INVOLVING WSC SCHOOL FOCUSES ATTENTION ON 
INEQUITIES OF CURRENT DISTRICT-BASED SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some Valley-area junior college athletic administrators believe that open 
recruiting would be a reasonable alternative to the district-based system, 
although a court decision this week supported the current arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Previously able to recruit in 12 high schools outside its two-school district, 
Santa Monica Community College had sought a preliminary injunction that would 
have returned the boundaries to the original borders. However, Federal District 
Judge Harry Hupp denied the school's request. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica was restricted to its own district by the state Commission on 
Athletics in October. 
</P>
<P>
The Western State Conference, of which Santa Monica and several Valley-area 
schools are members, had been among those requesting the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Although they don't necessarily agree with Santa Monica's methods (the ban 
reportedly was partly instigated by Santa Monica's alleged recruiting abuses), 
representatives of local schools nonetheless believe that the current 
recruiting system needs to be remedied. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'd just like to see it opened up and let anybody recruit where they 
wanted," said Marian McWilliams, Pierce athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Had Santa Monica been granted the injunction, Valley-area junior colleges 
likely would have sought the same freedom to recruit outside their districts. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been more realistic in some respects," Antelope Valley College 
Athletic Director Brent Carder said. 
</P>
<P>
"What it would have done is brought (recruiting) to the surface and taken the 
hypocrisy out of some of the things people are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica had been the only junior college in California permitted to 
recruit in-state athletes outside its district. 
</P>
<P>
Some schools, such as Antelope Valley, are allowed to recruit out-of-state 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
However, schools in the Los Angeles Community College District, such as Pierce 
and Valley, are allowed to recruit at every high school in the county. Others 
have much smaller districts; Glendale College, for example, is limited to three 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"If Santa Monica would have won their court case, then it would have been a 
great advantage for a school like Glendale College," Glendale football Coach 
John Cicuto said. 
</P>
<P>
Schools can recruit athletes within their district by initiating contact but 
must wait for out-of-district athletes to make the first contact before 
beginning their recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
Hupp gave Santa Monica's attorney, Urrea Jones, 21 days to amend his case and 
again request a preliminary injunction.

CITY TEAMS TO REGAIN PLAYERS LOST TO GRADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is unknown whether they give their teams a lift or simply take up space on 
the bench, but several players -- albeit rusty -- are expected to return to 
their playoff-bound City Section boys' basketball teams in time for today's 
games. After today, teams will have one game left in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
This week marks the beginning of the second semester at City schools, and 
players who were academically ineligible in the fall can rejoin their teams if 
their grade-point averages meet the minimum 2.0 standard. 
</P>
<P>
For many teams, that could mean the return of impact players. How effective 
those players will be is uncertain because City rules prohibit ineligible 
players from practicing with their teams. In most cases, the final word on 
eligibility is expected today. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A Division, Granada Hills is anticipating the return of forward Ryan 
Cravens, a 6-foot-1 junior who was a projected starter before becoming 
ineligible last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"He could really help us," said Coach Bob Johnson, whose team is tied with 
Cleveland for first place in the North Valley League. "He's one of those 
hard-nosed, blue-collar inside guys." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, another member of the North Valley, is hopeful that center Athesis 
Harris will return. Harris (6-4) started last season as a sophomore. "He tells 
me he's in good shape (academically)," Coach Yutaka Shimizu said. "We'll see 
when the grades get here." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland is expected to regain senior forward Brandon Battle, who has spent as 
much time on the sidelines as he has in uniform since transferring to the 
school two years ago. Battle (6-6), the leading scorer at Canoga Park as a 
sophomore, feuded last season with former Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell and 
played sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real, tied for first with San Fernando in the 3-A West Valley League, 
lost starting center Bert Mitchell, who moved to Long Beach last week. That 
point became moot when Mitchell (6-2) was ruled ineligible Tuesday, Coach Mike 
McNulty said. The team also failed to regain the services of 5-9 senior Lamont 
Johnson, a scheduled starter. Johnson's GPA remains under 2.0, McNulty said. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda, tied with North Hollywood in the 3-A Mid-Valley, lost reserve swingman 
Jamar Sanders (5-11) to ineligibility. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood, Grant, San Fernando, Sylmar and Birmingham, all of which have 
clinched or could secure berths in the 3-A playoffs, are not expected to be 
impacted by eligibility problems.

BIOLA BOXES UP DELAVEAGA, CLU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a senior at California High in San Ramon, he saw it all the time. But Jeff 
deLaveaga of Cal Lutheran was caught off guard when Biola threw the box-and-one 
defense at him Tuesday night with 12 minutes left in an NAIA District 3 game at 
Chase Gym in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen held a five-point lead when Biola pulled its defensive switch, but 
when the game ended, they were on the short end of a 78-72 score. 
</P>
<P>
"We played well for about 30 minutes," deLaveaga said. "But then they started 
to dominate the boards and we started to get a little frustrated. . . . I know 
I did. I got a little impatient and started to force some shots when they went 
to the box-and-one. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen a whole lot of that in college but they used to play that way 
against me in high school." 
</P>
<P>
In the box-and-one, one man -- in this case Biola guard Kellie McKinney -- is 
assigned to play man-to-man defense against the designated player (deLaveaga) 
while the rest of the team plays a zone. 
</P>
<P>
And the Eagles worked the defense to near perfection. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga scored 26 points in the first 28 minutes of the game, but Biola 
(8-17, 5-7 in District 3 play) held him to three points in the final 12 minutes 
to snap a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to do something," Biola Coach Howard Lyon said. "The guy was just 
killing us." 
</P>
<P>
Leading by four points at halftime, Cal Lutheran (5-17, 3-4) started the second 
half with a 9-2 run to take a 43-32 lead with 16 minutes 38 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Biola, however, retaliated with a 21-10 run in the next 7:10 to tie the score, 
53-53, with 9:28 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Baker, the Eagles' 6-foot-9 sophomore center, scored 10 of his team-high 
27 points (11 rebounds) during the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran briefly regained the lead on a pair of Mike Demeter free throws, 
but a three-point basket by Jimmy Hill (24 points) with 8:03 remaining gave 
Biola a 56-55 lead, and the Eagles never again trailed. 
</P>
<P>
"They sent three guys hard to the boards in the second half," deLaveaga said. 
"And that was the difference. They had some key rebound baskets after missed 
shots that really hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
With deLaveaga bottled up by Biola's defense, Demeter took over for the Cal 
Lutheran offense and scored 12 of his 20 points in the final six minutes, but 
they weren't enough.

JACK SMITH: TINY COMMUNITIES TREASURE ALL THE NEWS THAT'S FIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing gives a traveler the flavor and tempo of a strange land like the local 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
When we were in Brawley overnight, I picked up copies of the Imperial Valley 
Weekly and the Holtville Tribune. Imperial and Holtville are cities of 4,000 to 
5,000 in the valley south of Brawley. 
</P>
<P>
The legend under the Imperial Valley Weekly logo reads: "The power of the 
freedom of the press is a flaming sword . . . hold it high, use it wisely and 
guard it well." 
</P>
<P>
I was glad to see that freedom of the press was treasured even in those tiny 
farm centers. 
</P>
<P>
Even more reassuring were the headlines on Page 1 of the Holtville Tribune: The 
banner, in red ink, was "It's Carrot Festival Time." This annual event had 
preempted any news of a more sordid nature. 
</P>
<P>
Under it, three separate stories were headlined: "Dip Lunch on Saturday"; 
"Livestock Show Sunday"; "Recipe Contest Monday." 
</P>
<P>
On Page 4, though, the paper reported the nitty-gritty underside of life in 
Holtville. Under "Police Briefs," calls to the Police Department on various 
days were listed as follows: 
</P>
<P>
12:57 a.m. -- Mike Molina reported that he heard his dog barking, went outside 
and discovered his bike was gone. 
</P>
<P>
12:58 a.m. -- Caller reported that a suspicious vehicle just parked in front of 
her residence. 
</P>
<P>
10:40 a.m. -- Connie Hoyt requested that someone come pick up a sick cat that 
is in her front yard. 
</P>
<P>
5:30 p.m. -- Mike Angelo reported that he lost his golden retriever. It was 
wearing a red collar. 
</P>
<P>
7:39 p.m. -- Anonymous caller reported that a fellow is playing his stereo so 
loud that he can hear it from 100 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
There were also reports of violence from the police blotter: 
</P>
<P>
10:44 a.m. -- Finley school employee reported that there was a fight between 
two first-graders and one stabbed the other one with a pencil. 
</P>
<P>
And wife abuse: 
</P>
<P>
7 a.m. -- Domestic disturbance was reported in which a man allegedly hit his 
wife, who is three months pregnant. The woman was taken to the hospital. The 
man, 24, was arrested on battery charges. 
</P>
<P>
And sexual harassment: 
</P>
<P>
1:41 p.m. -- Caller reported that there are two fellows harassing a woman on 
5th Street by Valley Auto. 
</P>
<P>
And one crime of a sinister nature: 
</P>
<P>
1:30 a.m. -- CHP reported that they got a call reporting a kidnaping at Ninah's 
Truck Scales. Mr. Wheeler reported that his wife Linda D. Wheeler was kidnaped 
by two subjects in a white newer model semi-truck with black lettering on the 
side. Linda Wheeler is 25 years old, 5'1", with brown curly hair and a scar 
under her eye. 
</P>
<P>
There was also a section called Snowbird Gazette, with social notes about the 
Snowbirds, those semi-residents from colder climes who come south in the fall 
to park their trailers on the outskirts of various Imperial Valley towns for 
the winter. 
</P>
<P>
The Snowbird report began: "Well Hi Snowbirds and Holtville, Calif. We have had 
a fast week at the Springs (the BLM Hot Springs Campground) -- Snowbirds going 
to the Big Pancake Breakfast in El Centro, and now some folks are off to the 
Quartzite Pow-Wow. Meanwhile, we're looking forward to the opening of the 
Carrot Festival at the weekend. Now some news about our friends." 
</P>
<P>
A real estate ad pictured a three-bedroom, two-bath home with family room and 
pool for $85,000; a "spacious" three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath home for $55,000, and 
a two-bedroom home on a large corner lot for $39,000. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a job? A help-wanted ad said a weighmaster is needed at Ninah's 
Truck Stop (where Mrs. Wheeler allegedly was kidnaped.) 
</P>
<P>
A reassuring headline topped Page 11: "Holtville Girl Scouts Start Annual 
Cookie Sale." 
</P>
<P>
In the Imperial Valley Weekly the headline over Helen Murphy's "On the Local 
Scene" column was: "Three New Babies to Welcome This Week." 
</P>
<P>
And even that kidnaping had a happy ending. A story in the next day's paper 
explained: "A woman who was reportedly kidnaped in Holtville last week by a 
couple of truck drivers actually went with them of her own free will, according 
to the Police Department." (She was going east to visit relatives.) 
</P>
<P>
I don't think they're even worried down there about the ozone layer.

LEASING AN AUTO CAN MEAN LOWER MONTHLY PAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Still drooling over that $30,000 shiny red convertible with the soft leather 
seats you saw at a dealer recently? Figure you'd have to win the Lotto to buy 
it? Maybe not, if you have a good credit rating and want to consider leasing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
As new-car prices keep escalating and write-offs of consumer loan interest 
decline dramatically -- 10% this year; 0% beginning in 1991 -- more and more 
consumers will face a complicated choice: to buy or lease an automobile. 
</P>
<P>
That $30,000 convertible, for example, could cost 10% down, or $3,000, and 
roughly $450 a month to buy. But it could be leased for about $350 -- $100 a 
month less. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, car leasing was confined largely to fleets for companies and to the 
self-employed, who could write off leasing costs as a business expense. 
</P>
<P>
But IRS rules on that have changed, too. Now there may be no real tax advantage 
on those car-related business expenses. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the federal government has changed the auto depreciation 
deductions it allows. And it no longer lets business people take big, deep 
automatic deductions for their cars; instead, they must prove that they used 
the vehicle for a business purpose before they can deduct that expense. 
</P>
<P>
Still, car leasing nationwide is on the rise; an estimated 1.2 million more 
vehicles were leased last year than in 1988, and many industry experts expect 
leasing to keep gaining annually. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect it to grow one-half of a percentage point of the entire marketplace 
in passenger cars and light-duty trucks," said Bill Nerenberg, executive 
director of the National Vehicle Leasing Assn., based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the increased activity is due, Nerenberg said, to high car prices and 
the fact that many people simply can't ante up the hefty down payments 
required. But by leasing, they can drive away with little or no down and a 
lower monthly payment. 
</P>
<P>
But the cheapest way to buy a car is still paying cash for it, observed Mickey 
Garrett of the Greater Los Angeles Motorcar Assn. "A lot of people, (however), 
can't come up with that much cash or want to invest it elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
That's true for Harry Meyers of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I put nothing down, my monthly payment is low and it doesn't tie up my 
capital," he said, noting he has leased cars for his personal use and vans for 
his business, Ships Laundry of North America, from Executive Car Leasing for 17 
years. "To buy a Cadillac, I would put $15,000 down, at least. I can use that 
money to make money and not have it tied up in a car." 
</P>
<P>
At General Motors Acceptance Corp. (GMAC), leasing volume -- under a program 
called SmartLease instituted in October, 1988 -- increased in 1989 by more than 
60%. About 10% of GMAC's business now is leasing, a spokesman said. But a 
company officer "recently commented that he believes by the end of the century, 
at GMAC, we'll be looking at leasing as 25% of our business." 
</P>
<P>
Motorists who do lease also probably will be finding themselves beneficiaries 
of some deals affecting parts and service. 
</P>
<P>
Observed Mike Michaels, of Toyota: "All the companies have recently extended 
(manufacturers') warranties, so there's not much of a problem whether you lease 
or buy. Now the length of the warranty is equal to or exceeds the typical lease 
terms. (But) with most leases, the person is still responsible for routine 
maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers shopping for luxury models, however, will find many sweeping 
manufacturer guarantees on maintenance, whether they buy or lease. Audi, for 
example, offers a three-year, 50,000-mile warranty on scheduled maintenance. 
There are no deductibles, and Audi will replace wiper blades, bulbs and fuses 
and have the wheels balanced and aligned at no charge to the customer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to give rules of thumb" on who buys and who leases, said Greg 
Ehlers, of Lou Ehlers Cadillac-Sterling in Los Angeles, which estimates its 
business to be 75% sales, 25% leasing. "Generally, the older, more conservative 
people always want to own. Other people don't care whether they own or not." 
</P>
<P>
Although leasing generally costs less than owning, motorists probably would be 
better off buying a car if they intend to keep it more than six or seven years, 
said Mort Herbert, vice president of Executive Car Leasing, the largest leasing 
firm in California. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular opinion, says Bud Barish, of Barish Chrysler, consumers 
don't throw money away by leasing -- not if the sums they spend over a normal 
4- to 5-year lease can be applied toward buying the car when the agreement runs 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Barish said his leases are written with purchase options and predetermined 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
"If the value of the car at the end of the lease is $10,000, but it is actually 
worth only $8,000, then turn in the car and you owe nothing. The residual value 
(the auto's worth at term's end) was miscalculated and you benefitted with a 
low lease rate." 
</P>
<P>
But if that same car was valued at $10,000 and it's worth that figure at the 
end of the lease period, motorists can buy it or walk away, under Barish's 
lease. And if that $10,000 car is worth more, say, $12,000, "you can buy the 
car worth $12,000 for only $10,000 or we will refund you $2,000 when you return 
the car." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers should use care and follow a few basic rules when leasing: 
</P>
<P>
* Be sure to price-shop for financing. Prices can very from several hundred to 
several thousand dollars. Find the car you want, then check the terms offered 
by dealers, leasing firms and lenders. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't sign a lease contract until you know a car's set price and its final 
estimated value. You can and should negotiate prices. 
</P>
<P>
* Look for closed-end leases with end-of-term purchase options. They assure you 
that the car's residual value will be the same on return as when leased. 
Open-ended leases often are cheaper but you can end up paying the difference 
between the estimated residual value and the car's actual market value at lease 
end. 
</P>
<P>
* Check out the annual mileage limits; try to stay under them. Most contracts 
call for 15,000 miles a year maximum; if you exceed that, you can be charged 
eight to 12 cents for every extra mile. 
</P>
<P>
* Try to lease a car that will not depreciate rapidly. A Honda Accord, for 
example, holds value better than a Pontiac 6000, a Cadillac more than a 
Lincoln. Consider with care, too, the car's color. Herbert, of Executive Car 
Leasing, said "even the color of the car can enter into the value. For sports 
cars, for example, white or red have the best value. With the same miles and 
the same care, green would bring $200 less, brown $100 less." 
</P>
<P>
* Don't be fooled by advertisements offering ridiculously cheap leased cars, 
say $99-a-month deals. Most require hefty down payments, and "a large down 
payment is not a good deal for consumers," said Nerenberg, of the vehicle 
leasing group. 
</P>
<P>
* Watch out for contracts that require you to pay 1% to 2% in extra fees if you 
turn in your car before the lease expires or contracts that charge you extra 
each month if you move out of state. 
</P>
<P>
* Remember, California sales taxes are paid over the life of the lease, rather 
than in a lump sum up front (as in a purchase).

* Home Again: Kitty Dukakis, wife of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, has completed 
medical treatment and returned to their Brookline, Mass., home. Dukakis was 
hospitalized in November after drinking a small amount of rubbing alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's spokeswoman, Mindy Lubber, said Monday night that Dukakis 
probably would write a book on her husband's presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
* Taxing Work: Debra Murphree, the former prostitute who reportedly had a 
liaison with preacher Jimmy Swaggart, will not get to spend most of the 
$210,000 that Penthouse reportedly paid for her story. Murphree will receive 
about $54,000, and her agents, attorneys and the IRS will get the rest, said 
her attorney, Louis H. Schultz. "She's happy. I talked with her on the 
telephone," Schultz said Monday in New Orleans. Murphree claimed in the 
magazine in 1988 that the TV evangelist paid her $20 a visit in 1987 to strike 
prurient poses and perform sexual acts. Swaggart had tearfully confessed in 
February, 1988, to an unspecified "moral failure" and was subsequently 
defrocked by his church.

* A Loss They Can Afford: Philadelphia Eagles football coach Buddy Ryan fired 
the first volley in a friendly weight-loss competition among six of pro 
football's heavier coaches. "Art Shell can afford to lose about three people," 
Ryan said Monday in New York of the Los Angeles Raiders' head coach. The 
coaches -- Shell (338 pounds), Bill Parcells, New York Giants (265); Ryan 
(258); Joe Gibbs, Washington Redskins (240); Chuck Knox, Seattle Seahawks 
(236), and Dan Henning, San Diego Chargers (222) -- are in a diet program to 
raise money for research to combat paralysis. The program is sponsored by a 
diet plan that will contribute $500 for every pound lost.

SCREEN STYLE: THE QUICK CHANGE

The Movie: "Flashback" 
</P>
<P>
The Set Up: Kiefer Sutherland plays a straight-laced FBI man saddled with the 
job of escorting a '60s fugitive prankster (played -- dare we say from life -- 
by Dennis Hopper), back to justice. 
</P>
<P>
The Look: Clothes play a major role since both Sutherland and Hopper (pictured) 
wear their ideals on their sleeves -- literally. Sutherland sports a no-name 
suit and a pair of mirrored shades. Hopper avoids any overtly hippie trappings, 
wearing a canvas jacket, jeans and lots of hair. As the plot thickens, Hopper 
pulls a quick change on Sutherland by getting him drunk, switching outfits and 
-- after a shave and shower -- effortlessly taking on the Fed's identity. The 
two eventually find themselves at a once-thriving commune where the sole 
inhabitant, Carol Kane, is a vision of vintage counter-culture fashion complete 
with poncho and flowing dress. 
</P>
<P>
The Labels: According to costumer Eileen Kennedy, Sutherland's suit was "the 
kind you find at any American department store, like Sears." Movies being 
movies, the suit wasn't actually purchased there. It was specially made for the 
film by a big name designer who wishes to remain anonymous. (Who could blame 
him?) Kennedy avoided stereotypical clothes for Hopper. "He wasn't made to look 
like a hippie in tie-dye," she says. Instead, she keyed into the character as 
"working-class hero," and had a working-class jacket made, based on a classic 
dating back to the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
The Stores: Kennedy spent a lot of time searching for the most believable duds 
for Carol Kane. "In the '60s, hippie girls used to wear vintage thrift-store 
clothing a la the Victorian era," she says. "You used to be able to find that 
type of dress at any inexpensive second-hand store, but those days are long 
gone." Finding dresses both realistic and eye-catching led her to boutiques -- 
especially Repeat Performance in Los Angeles and the Elizabeth Lucas Collection 
in Santa Monica. On location in Glenwood Springs, Colo., she hit the local 
thrift stores to round out her stock of '60s regalia. 
</P>
<P>
The Switch: In order for Hopper's character to pull off the switch from hipster 
rebel to conformist, Kennedy enlisted the actor's help. "I put Dennis in a 
circle of clothing and asked him to pick something out that both he and Kiefer 
would wear," she recalls, explaining that most of the movie was shot in chilly 
Colorado. "Dennis picked lightweight clothing to make Kiefer as uncomfortable 
as possible." This was based on Hopper's personal belief that any real Fed 
would be crawling out of his skin in a radical's clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The Wrap: "The '90s are gonna make the '60s look like the '50s." Or so Hopper's 
character predicts at the end of the movie. Clothes-wise, that could get 
complicated. Hopper, the '60s rebel, is dressed for the new decade in a 
high-toned, cream-colored, Gianni Versace suit. Sutherland, the one-time yuppie 
materialist, heads into the '90s on a motorcycle, dressed in ratty jeans and a 
T-shirt. DARIO SCARDAPANE

STATE THEATER STAGES A COMEBACK WITH CLASSIC FILMS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: IT HAS BURNED DOWN, BEEN REBUILT AND FEATURED X-RATED FILMS. NOW THE 
THEATER IS SHOWING OLDIES BUT GOODIES EXCLUSIVELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Louie Federici was a schoolboy when the State Theater was born in Pasadena in 
1918. And like Federici, who is now nearing 80, the Colorado Boulevard theater 
has been a witness to changing times. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days, it was a proud Fox West Coast moving-picture theater. Then 
it burned down, was rebuilt, changed hands. When it finally closed its doors a 
couple of years ago, it had a garish sign headlining X-rated films. 
</P>
<P>
But last spring, Federici cranked up the dormant projector and restored the 
neon marquee, and the 700-seat auditorium once again flickered with movies such 
as "Robin Hood," "Top Hat" and "Suspicion." It is the only theater in the San 
Gabriel Valley that exclusively shows old movies. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be a lover of the old classics to be in this business," said 
Federici, who has spent his life working in theaters like the State -- taking 
tickets, popping popcorn, and watching glamorous stars cavort on screen. 
</P>
<P>
Federici, of Hollywood, and his partner, Bob Stein, 55, of Studio City, hope 
they can revive the revival house. But they know they're bucking a trend. 
</P>
<P>
Both men have owned and operated theaters for a living. Over the last 20 years, 
they say, too many have drawn their curtains for good. 
</P>
<P>
"Louie and I want to make it so successful that it stays a theater and doesn't 
turn into another strip shopping center," Stein said. But they admit that 
making a one-screen, individually owned movie theater successful is not an easy 
proposition these days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dated concept," Stein said. "You simply cannot run this type of theater 
unless you have a special policy to draw people." 
</P>
<P>
With four-, eight- and now 16-plexes luring crowds of moviegoers, and with 
videotape rentals a popular and cheap alternative, old theaters are fast 
disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The old, single-screen theater is a thing of the past," said Tim C. Warner, 
president of the California branch of the National Assn. of Theater Owners, a 
trade organization representing 2,700 screens in the state. "There's a trend to 
try to save and to restore those theaters, but they are getting rarer and 
rarer." 
</P>
<P>
Stein and Federici have operated the State theater since last April, scheduling 
an eclectic collection of classic romances, mysteries, comedies and musicals on 
its 20-by-40-foot screen. 
</P>
<P>
One weekend they might show "Father of the Bride" and the next, "The Divorce of 
Lady X." While the Laemmle theater at the other end of Colorado Boulevard is 
showing the new version of Shakespeare's "Henry V," the State counters with the 
Laurence Olivier classic. 
</P>
<P>
Stein said that he and Federici draw on more than half a century of 
movie-watching to help them pick their cinematic lineup. "You start to have a 
feel for films, an intuition. I can't really put my finger on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the picks are not right, and the draw is slow. But gradually the 
State is building an audience from all over Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Banks, an 18-year-old journalism student at UC Santa Barbara, said he 
does not mind the two-hour drive to Pasadena when the State is showing a movie 
he wants to see. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom and my grandparents have told me about these movies like 'Gone With The 
Wind' and 'Citizen Kane' when they first came out," Banks said. "I enjoy seeing 
them like they were then. You lose a lot when you see them on television." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Reese, 40, a commercial lending officer who lives in Pasadena, agreed. 
"This is a new thing for me," said Reese, who has seen "Camille," "Bridge on 
the River Kwai" and "Phantom of the Opera" at the State. 
</P>
<P>
Some customers come to relive childhoods spent in Saturday afternoon matinees. 
Others hate watching the classics chopped up and distorted on television 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a lot of these movies on television, having grown up with 
television," Reese said. "But it's fun to see the uncropped, wide-screen 
version. These are movies that will never die. 
</P>
<P>
"I took my kids to see 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Singing in the Rain' and they 
liked 'Singing in the Rain' better than 'The Wizard of Oz,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
The revival house is not for everyone. A mailing list for the State has built 
slowly to about 200 names. "We're still not really making any money," Stein 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
But he and Federici are betting that the State will survive. And they are 
willing to do some unorthodox things to keep it alive. At $3 for adults and $2 
for senior citizens and students, ticket prices for the evening's double bill 
are actually cheaper than most video rentals. 
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Eve, the two partners kept the theater's doors open all night. 
Federici made popcorn while Stein's wife and children brewed coffee and sold 
candy to people lined up to watch the Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
The theater's cavernous auditorium has played host to a children's theater 
group. Stein, who also works as a concert promoter, lined up a folk singer to 
play there and is contemplating more live performances. Last week, the Festival 
of Animation was on the marquee. 
</P>
<P>
If enough customers do not pack the theater to ensure its salvation, it is 
unlikely that the State would be preserved as a historic landmark like its 
South Pasadena neighbor, the Rialto Theater, which shows first-run art films 
and cult offerings such as "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." There is nothing 
ornate or unique about the State's architecture. Its walls are bare, its 
lighting subdued. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not a classy theater," even in its heyday, Stein said. When the two 
men took over, they did little more than tear down the red-flocked wallpaper 
left over from when the place was called the Pussycat Theater. Inside the 
auditorium, the ceiling vents are scarred with soot, and the only ornaments are 
lighted wall sconces reminiscent of the moderne look popular when the State was 
rebuilt after the fire in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
A narrow staircase winds up to a cluttered projection booth overflowing with 
heavy film canisters. A part-time employee sometimes spends the night on a 
mattress in a cubbyhole off the booth. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll never get rich with an operation like this," Federici said. 
</P>
<P>
But patrons such as Dick McCann, 48, of South Pasadena hope they will keep the 
State open anyway. McCann, an architect, said he appreciates seeing timeworn 
buildings occupied again. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are with all the modern kinds of buildings, and all of the shopping 
centers, and it's really a credit to the people that own and operate (old 
buildings) to try to do something different. There's getting to be less and 
less examples of these theaters that were once a part of our country," McCann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Warner said many theatergoers appreciate old movie houses like the State 
because they can see the films in the environment for which they were created. 
As he put it: "It recreates the excitement and the glamour of Hollywood."

BEADLE'S CAFETERIA ADDS SOME SPICE TO TASTY TRADITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDYE HODER, Hoder is a free-lance writer who lives in Studio City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ernest Vavra says he has spent $170,243.83 at Beadle's Cafeteria in the past 33 
years -- and he has the receipts to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for Beadle's, I wouldn't know where to go," says Vavra, a large, 
grizzled man of 83, as he picked over the last crumbs of his lemon meringue 
pie. "Other restaurants don't appeal to me. This is where I like to eat." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Vavra has been eating at least one meal a day, seven days a week, at 
Beadle's since it opened on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena in 1956. He used to 
come with his wife when they both worked at the Sears store nearby. Since her 
death, he has come alone. "We'd send the troops out after him if he didn't show 
up," says general manager Jane Arvizu. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Sunday, he loaded his green plastic tray with a fried chicken 
dinner (one breast, one leg), mashed potatoes, canned corn, carrots, coleslaw, 
prunes, pie and a cup of coffee. Then, as is his routine, Vavra took his $7.85 
receipt and placed it carefully in his shirt pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"One nice thing about Beadle's is this," he says, holding up a white cloth 
napkin before tucking it, de rigueur, in his collar. "This place has a 
high-class clientele. Lawyers and Wall Street guys eat here." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. But Pasadena's young professionals seem more inclined to frequent the 
tonier eateries that have sprung up all around Beadle's during the past few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But those trendier establishments -- and thousands of others like them across 
Los Angeles County -- "come and go like gangbusters," says Stanley Kyker, vice 
president of the California Restaurant Assn. Indeed, he explains, the average 
life span of an eating place in the county is only two years. Half of them 
close within the first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
Beadle's Cafeteria, however, endures. But it is something of a rare breed. 
</P>
<P>
Although California has more restaurants than any other state in the country, 
only 2% are cafeteria-style, according to a 1987 U.S. Census Bureau survey. 
</P>
<P>
Cafeterias enjoyed their heyday in America between 1915 and the 1920s, lost 
some popularity with the advent of luncheonettes and soda fountains in the 
'30s, then plummeted further with the introduction of fast-food establishments 
in the '50s, Kyker says. 
</P>
<P>
Edmond Clinton, manager of the chain of five Los Angeles-area Clifton's 
cafeterias, estimates there are now about 15 cafeterias in the area, including 
two in Pasadena -- Beadle's and the Pasadena Cafeteria, both owned by Gordon 
Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
Jack and Marina Stewart know how difficult it is to find a cafeteria in Los 
Angeles these days. They travel to the San Gabriel Valley from Hollywood about 
three times a week to eat at either Beadle's or the Pasadena Cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go to another restaurant and order ham, you don't know what you're 
getting," Jack Stewart says. "Here you can see what you are getting. It's all 
right there in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
For Michael Trent, a 64-year-old handicapper who often plays the horses at 
nearby Santa Anita Park race track, Beadle's is more than a place to eat. 
Sometimes it's a credit agency. 
</P>
<P>
One time, the wiry chain-smoker recalls, he lost 50 bucks at the races and was 
flat broke. "I told the cashier, 'Put it on the cuff.' I knew they'd accept it; 
they have a credit box." 
</P>
<P>
(Arvizu confirms that the management occasionally extends credit to regulars.) 
</P>
<P>
Beadle's "gives me a chance to get out of the house and be social," Trent adds. 
"I meet a lot of people here. We sit around, drink coffee and talk about 
everything imaginable. The price is right, the food is good and nobody gives 
you the bum's rush." 
</P>
<P>
That's true, Trent says, even on Sundays, when families show up in droves. 
</P>
<P>
By 11 a.m. on a recent Sunday, the first of an eventual total of about 1,800 
customers began to arrive. By noon, the line stretched to the back parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside the door, the customers faced about 200 feet and 15 minutes before 
they reached the cashier, where tray carriers were standing ready to help older 
customers to their tables. "Things change as time goes on, but this place stays 
the same," says Frank Knaus, 85. 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost. Arvizu, who manages the cafeteria for Hammond, her father, says 
that in early March Beadle's will relocate about 100 feet to a new building on 
East Green Street. 
</P>
<P>
And despite promises to customers that there will be no "cactus or ferns" 
adorning the new cafeteria, Arvizu reluctantly concedes that Beadle's will make 
some concessions to modernity. 
</P>
<P>
Pea-green colored walls, brown Formica tables and chairs, and crystal 
chandeliers will no longer be part of the decor. In their place will come a new 
color scheme: peach and evergreen. In an attempt to lure younger working 
patrons from the nine-story office complex next to the new location, breakfast 
will be served for the first time. A salad bar, deli take-out counter and 
bakery also will be added. 
</P>
<P>
But the heart of Beadle's, Arvizu pledges, will stay the same: Steam tables 
filled with chicken pot pie, liver and onions, Swiss steak, macaroni and 
cheese, yams and mashed potatoes with pools of melted butter. 
</P>
<P>
There will still be a panoply of salads, perched on ice and passed to customers 
through an open-bottom glass partition: Waldorf and ambrosia, green cubes of 
Jell-O, cottage cheese. 
</P>
<P>
And women in brown uniforms and aprons will continue to pepper customers with 
questions as they walk down the line: "White meat or dark? Clear gravy or 
cream? Roll or biscuit? Cake or pie?" With the crowd behind, this is no place 
for the indecisive. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Hammond clan insists that the changes will be minimal, restaurant 
experts say that to appeal to a younger clientele, Beadle's will have to be 
more health-conscious. It's "still serving mashed potatoes, white rolls and 
Jell-O," says Kyker, of the restaurant association. "That type of food has no 
substance, and it's not what Californians want." 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, though, believes it is. On any given Sunday, he notes, he serves up 
250 pounds of real mashed potatoes, carves 320 pounds of roast turkey and sells 
250 chicken pot pies. 
</P>
<P>
"Fancy is not in our vocabulary," says Hammond, 77. "We're not trying 'to put 
on the dog' from the food or decoration standpoint. We're just trying to keep 
it plain, simple and nice." 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, who still works just about every day, left his family's Tennessee farm 
in 1931, headed west and got his start in the restaurant business by busing 
tables. "I was a country boy who milked cows," he says. "I was getting up in 
size and having disagreements with my stepfather, so I took off." 
</P>
<P>
Hammond began his career at Boos Brothers, one of California's first 
cafeterias. It was started by four siblings -- Horace, John, Cyrus and Henry 
Boos -- in 1906. By 1920, they had a chain of seven cafeterias that had become 
so widely known that Los Angeles was dubbed by some "the capital of Southern 
Cafeteria." 
</P>
<P>
When the Boos brothers sold two of their restaurants to Clifford E. Clinton, 
who launched the Clifton's chain, Hammond joined the new owner and worked for 
him until 1950. 
</P>
<P>
He then struck out on his own, buying the Pasadena Cafeteria at 325 E. Colorado 
Blvd. from Earle J. Beadle. In 1967, he bought Beadle's Cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
On the recent Sunday, many of the customers had come straight from church. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday is a family day," says Karen Fleming, who comes with her children, 
husband and father every weekend. "We were raised at church and on home cooking 
-- pot roast, mashed potatoes and peas. If you're not going to eat at home, 
then you might as well eat some place where you can get that kind of food." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming's 16-year-old daughter, Sharyl, rarely misses the trip to Beadle's with 
her family. 
</P>
<P>
"Most everyone who comes here is older," she says. "You hardly ever see anyone 
my age. But I've come here all my life, and I'll probably bring my kids here 
too." 
</P>

<P>
In an era of high-volume, high-gloss entertainment stores at every corner 
mini-mall, Pasadena's Starlight Roof Classic American Music &amp; Video store 
harks back to an earlier age. 
</P>
<P>
There are no neon lights, turnstiles or electronic scanners, and none of the 
current releases that fill most video and record store bins. 
</P>
<P>
Owner John Cooper is up front about what his store contains. A sign posted on 
his door warns would-be customers: 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry, but we do not sell rock and roll, Spanish, rap, soul, heavy metal, 
funk, disco, new wave, breakin, punk, Motown, reggae, new age, nor most current 
music and no X-rated movies, rock videos . . . truck-crashing movies nor most 
current movies." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Cooper dishes up an eclectic mix of traditional jazz, Big Band and 
Swing Era music mostly from the 1920s, '30s, '40s, complemented by an 
assortment of movies from Hollywood's Golden Era, when the likes of Greta 
Garbo, Bette Davis, Rita Hayworth, Clark Gable and Cary Grant dominated the big 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
"The sign delights more people than it disappoints," said Cooper, 38. "I'm not 
a fan of contemporary music, and I want people who enjoy older music to know 
that there is no contemporary music in here. I try to deal in what I like and 
what is really not commonly available in many places. 
</P>
<P>
"People come in on the strength of the sign." 
</P>
<P>
Starlight Roof is a throwback in more ways than one. Besides stocking 
hard-to-find movies and music, Cooper also offers personalized service. 
</P>
<P>
"I always try to greet everybody who comes into my store, just to break the 
ice. I try to get to know people individually and make them feel at home. I 
don't hard-pressure my customers. That makes me uncomfortable," said Cooper, 
the soft-spoken son of Greek immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's interest in swing music was sparked when, as a boy growing up in New 
York, he saw "The Glenn Miller Story," starring Jimmy Stewart, on television. 
As a teen-ager, his interest grew and he started collecting Big Band records 
when most youngsters his age were rocking to the sounds of the Beach Boys and 
the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
During high school in the late 1960s, a time when Cooper said he was on his own 
musical "planet," he took music theory and choral classes and played Big Band 
records for his friends whenever he got the chance. 
</P>
<P>
After high school, Cooper went to work for Sam Goody's record store in New 
York, and started selling old-time records on his own at swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, he moved to Los Angeles and took a job at a music distributing 
company. In 1987, Cooper opened his first store, called Swing Street, in Temple 
City. But he was under-financed and in a bad location. The venture lasted about 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper eventually scouted out a more suitable location on Colorado Boulevard in 
Pasadena. There, wedged between an old-fashioned diner and an optician's 
office, Starlight Roof opened for business in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After some prodding by friends and suppliers, Cooper soon made room for his 
other obsession: classic films. Thirteen months after opening shop, he has 
added about 2,000 film titles to his original inventory of more than 2,000 
musical recordings, and has built up a loyal clientele in the process. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent visit, Richard Banks, a Starlight Roof regular, picked up 17 
old-time videos -- six of them Andy Hardy movies -- for $380.40. Banks 
considers Cooper's store a real find. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an old-movie fan and this store has everything I want," said Banks, 68, a 
classics aficionado with a tousled shock of white hair and a wad of cash in his 
sweater pocket. "The closest one that comes to it is Music Plus, but they 
aren't as good as this one. At Music Plus, you hardly ever see any (employees). 
You get more personal attention here." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's customers consider the store a haven from offenses they attribute to 
the mass-market chains -- loud, blaring music, an absence of personalized 
attention, and a dearth of knowledge about films and musical performers who 
predate, say, E.T. or Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
"Service is lousy in a lot of places," Cooper said. "And the knowledge I've 
found in large video stores is about as extensive as if you walked into a 
grocery store and asked them which is a better brand of peas. They have no 
idea. They just sell products. They're becoming supermarkets." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he chose the store's name because of its "evocative and somewhat 
romantic-sounding" connotations. He said he later learned that there is a 
banquet room by the same name at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the store, Starlight Roof customers are greeted by a 1941 Crosley 
"combo" upright console radio/phonograph that, in its day, was 
state-of-the-art, Cooper said. The console still picks up AM frequencies and 
plays the old 78 rpm records. 
</P>
<P>
Old movie posters line the walls and an upbeat picture of Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt presides over the music section. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a friendly little store," said Edward Crater, 45, of Pasadena, another 
regular customer. "It has a great selection and wide variety of older films." 
</P>
<P>
Another Starlight Roof idiosyncrasy is that the store's videos are only sold, 
never rented. Most are priced from $10 to $30. Titles include "Hamlet," 
starring Laurence Olivier; "The Human Comedy," with Mickey Rooney; "San 
Francisco," with Clark Gable and Jeanette MacDonald, and other hits like 
"Splendor in the Grass" and the "Thin Man" series with William Powell and Myrna 
Loy. 
</P>
<P>
Besides older classic films, Cooper's tastes encompass selected later works, 
including "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Au Revoir Les Enfants," and Francis Ford 
Coppola's remake of Abel Gance's 1927 silent masterpiece, "Napoleon." 
</P>
<P>
On the music side of the aisle, Cooper carries jazz greats ranging from Louis 
Armstrong and Charlie Parker to Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday. Frank 
Sinatra and Fred Astaire are represented, as are Ray Charles and Nat King Cole. 
There is even some country music. 
</P>
<P>
"I have either what I like, what's good or what I approve of," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Starlight Roof's customers come for the swing music alone, which is 
offered on cassette tapes, compact discs and a few record albums, which Cooper 
says he is phasing out. 
</P>
<P>
Here, mixed in with such household names of the Swing Era as Glenn Miller, Duke 
Ellington, Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman, are lesser-known performers such as 
Bunny Berigan, Glen Gray and Paul Whiteman. 
</P>
<P>
"We come here all the time. We listen to KGRB (900-AM). It's the only music we 
like. You can't get it anyplace else," said Robert Wells, 65, of Glendale, 
visiting the store with his wife. "We rarely go into the Wherehouse and, if we 
do, it's only for a few seconds -- we can't stand the music (the store plays)." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper routinely advertises on KGRB, a Big Band station based in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
A number of other local stores, including Canterbury Records, right down the 
street from Starlight Roof, sell Big Band records and compact discs. Rare 
Records in Glendale is another popular outlet for the music. But Starlight Roof 
is the only store to specialize, said Tracey Gurr, a secretary at KGRB. 
</P>
<P>
As for the shop's approach to movies, "it's an extreme rarity to specialize 
just in classic products," said Herb Fischer, senior vice president of 
marketing and sales for MGM Home Video in Culver City. "I think it's wonderful. 
It excites us to know that the American consumer is a collector. Where else 
could you buy a $25-million film for $25?" 
</P>
<P>
Vince Adams, one of Cooper's chief video suppliers, who also sells to 150 shops 
in the Lancaster, San Gabriel Valley and San Fernando Valley areas, said: "I 
haven't come across another store like John's." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper is inclined to agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard of another one," he said, "and that's the God's honest 
truth." 
</P>

LAKERS SPIN EXTRA MAGIC IN OVERTIME; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: THEY HOLD OFF PORTLAND, 121-119, EVEN THOUGH JOHNSON FOULS OUT 
NEAR THE END OF REGULATION PLAY.

PORTLAND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes great success must be preceded by miserable failure. Byron Scott, the 
Lakers' shooting guard, saw one jump shot clang off the rim and his next miss 
altogether in the first minute of overtime against the Portland Trail Blazers 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
He had the failure part down cold. Success would have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, in such circumstances, Scott might defer to Magic Johnson. But 
Johnson had fouled out in regulation, so Scott had no choice but to keep 
shooting and hope for better results. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe only slightly daunted, Scott then made two jump shots, one a 
three-pointer, in overtime to lift the Lakers past the Trail Blazers, 121-119, 
in the battle for first place in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Scott and James Worthy, with free-throw support supplied by Mychal 
Thompson, the Lakers were able to beat the Trail Blazers and increase their 
Pacific Division lead to 1 1/2 games despite the absence of their leading 
scorer and floor leader. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who made a 14-foot jump shot with 2.2 seconds left that gave the 
Lakers a 113-112 lead, fouled out with a half-second to play when he collided 
with Trail Blazer guard Terry Porter after an inbounds pass. 
</P>
<P>
But Porter missed one of the two free throws, forcing overtime. The Lakers then 
turned to Scott and Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
"This was one from the heart," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "Without Buck 
(Johnson) in overtime, to get the job done, is great. We went from sure victory 
to impending doom three or four times, but Byron hit some big shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Byron showed great character. That air ball (in overtime) could have been very 
deflating to him. But he bounced back and lifted us up. He had to do it without 
Buck." 
</P>
<P>
If Scott felt the pressure, he did not show it. He hardly seemed fazed after 
the two missed shots in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"You miss a couple, you make a couple," Scott said. "When I miss, I want to 
make up for it and soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
After Scott's two misses and Trail Blazer baskets by Buck Williams and Kevin 
Duckworth, the Lakers trailed, 117-113, and called time out to regroup. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Scott) when he went out there (for overtime) that he had to be the 
guy," Johnson said. "They were not really playing him, even then. During the 
timeout (after Scott's two misses), I told him to pull up and make those shots. 
I'm glad he didn't say, 'Hey, I'm not making them' and pass off." 
</P>
<P>
Scott made an 18-foot jump shot after taking a pass from Worthy, cutting 
Portland's lead to two points. After Portland missed several scoring chances, 
the Lakers regained possession with 2:24 to play. With time dwindling on the 
shot clock, Scott pulled up behind the three-point line on the right perimeter 
and sank a shot for a 118-117 Laker lead with 2:06 to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers unraveled, giving the Lakers the ball with 1:09 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the Lakers looked for Scott. This time, his long jump shot was far 
short. But Worthy, who led the Lakers with 25 points, grabbed the air ball 
under the basket and laid it in. The Lakers had a 120-117 lead with 45 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Portland and the Lakers then proceeded to miss scoring chances, the Trail 
Blazers on missed shots and the Lakers because of another turnover. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Trail Blazers were forced to foul. They picked Thompson with 
7.4 seconds left. Thompson, who had a season-high 24 points, made the first 
shot for a four-point Laker lead. Although Thompson missed the second free 
throw, the Laker victory was secured even after Williams' basket at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers felt they should have won in regulation. After making the jump shot 
over Williams with 2.2 seconds left, Johnson began a celebration. His arms 
outstretched, Johnson backpedaled all the way to the Laker bench for a timeout. 
That celebration proved premature, however. 
</P>
<P>
Portland still had the ball and 2.2 seconds with which to work. Williams 
inbounded the ball to Porter, who took two quick dribbles forward and made 
contact with Johnson, who appeared to be trying to leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
But Porter took a tumble after the contact, and Johnson was called for the 
foul, his sixth, with 0.5 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
All Porter had to do to ensure a victory that would bump the Lakers out of 
first place was make both free throws. But he missed the first, coming up 
short. He made the second to force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of chances for both teams to win," Riley said. "We didn't see 
Portland at its best for the first three quarters. They played well in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Still, neither team could hold the lead in the final minute of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers took a 109-108 lead with 53 seconds left when Johnson sank a jump 
shot off a Vlade Divac screen. But the Trail Blazers countered with two free 
throws by Porter 12 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's two free throws with 34 seconds left gave the Lakers a 111-110 lead. 
Then, after a scramble for the ball following a missed shot by Clyde Drexler, 
the Trail Blazers had two more chances to take the lead. They finally did it, 
112-111, with 21.5 seconds left when Drexler was fouled by Johnson underneath. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Riley called a timeout to set up what he thought would be the 
last shot. But Johnson's jumper didn't end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had enough arch to make that first free throw," Porter said. "But 
we didn't play that well in the first half. We missed the shots that got us 
here tonight." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Lakers will break for the All-Star game after tonight's game 
against Chicago at the Forum in first place in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
"We started out the season in first place and I guess we'll be there at the 
All-Star break now," Riley said. "But this game, from our point of view, wasn't 
about making statements. I think Portland felt it had to make a statement." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy said he understands Philadelphia 76er forward Charles Barkley's 
desire to sit out Sunday's All-Star game to rest a groin injury. NBA officials 
have threatened Barkley with a week's suspension if he doesn't play, the same 
penalty with which they threatened Worthy in 1988 when he wanted to rest his 
injured left knee. "I can relate to that situation," Worthy said. "My reason 
(for not wanting to play) was just to get the three days of rest. We had a game 
right before the break, so they figured, 'If you can play in that game, you can 
play in the All-Star game.' Maybe if (Barkley) had waited until after his last 
game before the break, then told them that he couldn't play, it might have 
worked." 
</P>
<P>
Russ Granik, the NBA's executive vice president, explained the league's 
position: "Our view is that the All-Star game is a very important event. It's 
as important, though not necessarily more important, than any other game in the 
league. The NBA is going to be skeptical about any player injured only for the 
All-Star game."

WINNIPEG OFFICIAL SAYS HE HAS NO PLANS TO SELL TO ANAHEIM GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the Winnipeg Jets said he has no plans to sell his NHL team to 
an investors' group from Anaheim, in the wake of news reports Tuesday from 
Canada that an offer was made. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not accepted any offers," Jet President said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not moving and we're not selling the team. Let's drop it." 
</P>
<P>
Shenkarow conceded he has been approached by people who "said they want to buy 
the team." Among the offers was one from Anaheim, said Shenkarow, who declined 
to identify the individuals involved. 
</P>
<P>
"They saw who is the smallest franchise, in the smallest market," said 
Shenkarow, who wants a new arena with revenue from concessions and luxury 
suites. 
</P>
<P>
He said the chances of getting a new facility in Winnipeg are "50-50." If a new 
arena is not built, Shenkarow said, he would entertain other offers. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Jets' president said he is unfamiliar with Anaheim's proposed 
arena, which has been challenged in court by the Los Angeles Rams, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Monet, president of Ogden Financial Services, the firm selected to build 
and operate Anaheim's proposed 20,000-seat arena, said there is a group 
prepared to buy a basketball or hockey franchise for the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
But Monet and city officials have declined to identify the would-be owners 
other than to say "it's not the city, not Ogden." MARK LANDSBAUM

ANOTHER DAY, NO PROGRESS IN TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball's collective bargaining talks droned on Tuesday. There was no apparent 
progress, only more confusion, according to Don Fehr, executive director of the 
Major League Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said the union spent another futile negotiating session seeking answers to 
basic questions about the owners' revenue-sharing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
It has been the contention of the owners' Player Relations Committee that the 
proposal is aimed at correcting the revenue disparity between teams in big and 
small markets, a problem the committee has said will become critical at some 
unspecified date in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"But they don't know how to define large and small markets," Fehr said. "They 
can't tell you what the disparity will be, and now they're saying that the 
proposal isn't based on the market issue at all but on a desire to improve 
labor relations by the formation of a partnership. It's weird. It's silly. I'm 
astonished." 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said the whole thing is a charade designed to mask the real intent of 
revenue sharing, which is to lower salaries and eliminate free agency and 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
He said that since the owners can't justify it through negotiation, they'll 
close the spring training camps and attempt to "starve the players into 
accepting it. If they want a fight, there's nothing we can do about it. But 
it's likely to be a very long one." 
</P>
<P>
The PRC has said that the camps will not open on Feb. 15 unless the union 
agrees to the necessity of a change in the compensation system. The owners will 
meet Friday in Chicago to receive an update on the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Charles O'Connor, the committee's general counsel, said Tuesday that he still 
believes an eventual agreement on the concept of revenue sharing is possible. 
</P>
<P>
He added that a stabilization of the relationship with the union has always 
been the central issue of the negotiations, tied to a system that would produce 
better cost certainty for the owners and an equalization of the playing field 
for teams in the big and small markets.

RAVELING DENIES THAT HE WILL LEAVE USC FOR UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
George Raveling, USC's basketball coach, said Tuesday that he has no plans to 
become the coach at the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
A report by Miami's NBC affiliate, picked up by KNBC's Fred Roggin, said 
Raveling had talked with Sam Jankovick, athletic director at Miami, about 
replacing Miami Coach Bill Foster, who will retire at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling said the rumor started because Jankovich was his boss at Washington 
State, where Raveling coached for 11 seasons. Jankovich and Raveling are 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can tell you is that I'm not a candidate for the Miami job," 
Raveling said. "I never have been a candidate for the University of Miami job. 
It's my goal to be the coach at USC for the next seven years because that would 
take me to 60. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said in a hundred different ways that I love Los Angeles and that I love 
coaching at USC. And there hasn't been anything that has transpired so far to 
make me want to leave USC. Obviously, I've had a bad won-lost record, but it 
hasn't discouraged me to (the point that I) want to leave. I've never run from 
a fight in my life and I don't plan to start now." 
</P>
<P>
Has Raveling talked to Jankovich about the Miami job? 
</P>
<P>
"For a number of weeks," said Raveling, whose Trojans are 7-10 this season. 
"But all of my conversations with him have been about other candidates. . . . 
As for him ever saying, 'George, do you want to be a candidate?' it's never 
come up." 
</P>
<P>
Rich Dalrymple, Miami sports information director, said Jankovich is still in 
the preliminary stages of hiring a coach. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling has one year left on his contract at USC, where he is 33-72 since 
replacing Stan Morrison in 1986.

FLORIDA SNAPPER MIGHT BE RECORD

<TEXT>
<P>
A fisherman using 20-pound-test line without a leader landed an 82 1/2-pound 
snapper, a potential world record in that line class. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Mack was fishing Sunday night in 60 feet of water when he hooked the 
cubera snapper, usually a deep-water reef fish. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking the fish was a shark, Mack wanted to cut his line, but was talked out 
of it by Tiny Edwards, captain of the charter boat Mack was fishing from. When 
they pulled the snapper aboard, they found it was hooked in the corner of the 
mouth, barely beyond the reach of teeth that could easily have snapped the line 
or the hook. 
</P>
<P>
The catch exceeds the existing International Game Fish Assn. snapper record by 
11 pounds in the 20-pound-test class. Only three bigger snapper have been 
caught on any tackle, including the record 121 1/2-pounder hooked off Cameron, 
La., in 1982.

'BIRD MONTH' AT LAKE CACHUMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With intermittent strong winds and water levels fluctuating, freshwater fishing 
is hit and miss in some Southland waters, but there are alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Lape says February is "bird month" at Lake Cachuma, north of Santa 
Barbara, with tours scheduled Wednesday through Sunday to see bald eagles, 
Canada geese and osprey. Reservations: (805) 508-2460. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a low water level, there also are plenty of fish in the lake, without 
many anglers. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- With water low, launching ramp away from marina tackle shop, so 
top bass anglers not reporting. Heavy plant of 5,700 half-pound trout last 
week. Low pressure. Catfish slow. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE PIRU -- Trout fishing best bet, trolling red core line or monofilament 18 
to 20 feet deep, using anything in a rainbow lure pattern. Still-fishing in San 
Felicia Cove is good, using Velveeta. Bass slow. Catfish active by dam, fishing 
deep with mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
PUDDINGSTONE RESERVOIR -- Lures best for trout -- Super Dupers and crappie 
jigs, smoked silver flake. Most trout in sailboat-swim area. Roy Eves of San 
Dimas caught 20- and 32-pound carp on corn. Bass in deep water. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Still catching a few stripers on frozen anchovies in Gypsum Wash, 
otherwise slow. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE HAVASU -- Spotty. Most stripers 40 to 60 feet deep, but will go for frozen 
anchovies or live shad, vertical jigging with Hopkins spoon. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Some trout biting in the river on Power Bait, a few stripers 
on lake with Sassy Shad Rat-L-Trap. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Trolling on north shore with Thin Fin lures in afternoon good for 
corvina averaging seven pounds. Croaker picking up at Bombay Beach, also 
talapia on Johnson Creek, with nightcrawlers. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- Bass spotty, but Andy Wahrenbrock, La Crescenta, caught a 12 
1/2-pounder on a crawdad. Catfish steady and good, going for mackerel at 30 
feet. Leonard Gibson, Oak View, caught one 12 pounds, 3 ounces. Trollers 
getting nice trout at 10 feet, with Power Bait and Needlefish lures. A few 
crappie, including one of 3 1/4 pounds caught by Jim Hollis, Ojai, on a 
mini-jig. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASTAIC -- Gene L. George, Granada Hills, six-pound bass with plastic worm 
on upper lake from boat. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE LAKE -- Mark Valencia, Tustin, had five trout totaling 10 pounds, using 
Rooster Tail. Jaime Duenas, Santa Ana, took a 5 1/2-pound trout on Power Bait, 
on west shore. Samuel Liebmann, Corona, took two three-pound trout on old 
crocodile lure. Best spots are west shore, Sierra Cove and along buoy line. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE SKINNER -- Looking better as water level rises, allowing Ramp 2 to open. 
Water temperature cooling but northern largemouth bass still active. Onessis 
Timoteo, Glendale, caught a four-pounder with a nightcrawler at spillway. Jerry 
Allen, Huntington Beach, got a 7 3/4- and 3.2-pounders using a jig and pork 
rind in second cove from marina. Trout hitting salmon eggs and Power Bait. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE SILVERWOOD -- Lots of largemouths, and Ken East, San Bernardino, took a 
20-pound striper with homemade lures by dam. Crews building fish habitat 
structures on shore while water down, but new influx will bring level up. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID LAKE -- Bob Chertcoff, Los Angeles, caught a 17-pound striper, using a 
Big Mac. Alan Wensman, Long Beach, had stripers of 8 1/4 and 10 1/2, with 
nightcrawlers on two-pound test line in marina. Hugo Arana, Panorama City, had 
a 3 1/3-pound largemouth on nightcrawler. Lots of limits of trout. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE PERRIS -- Pressure light as lake refills. Bass are nearly 60 feet deep 
near inlet, feeding on nutrients coming in. Some bass to 15-inch minimum.

When Bill Poole built the Royal Polaris in 1976, it became the world's largest 
commercial sportfisher. He has since sold the boat to Frank LoPreste, who is 
about to become the owner of the second-largest sportfisher. 
</P>
<P>
John Grabowski, president of the Louisiana-based Qualifier Corporation, has 
built and is preparing to bring the Qualifier Excel from its Louisiana shipyard 
to San Diego's Fisherman's Landing. At 120 feet long and 31 feet wide, the 
steel-hulled, $2.3-million boat surpasses in length and width the 
113-by-30-foot Royal Polaris. 
</P>
<P>
"We went a little bit bigger just to get the capacity we wanted," Grabowski 
said. "Hopefully, in years to come, we're going to try to fish out of Costa 
Rica, and the ultimate goal is to fish the Galapagos Islands." 
</P>
<P>
Grabowski said the boat, scheduled to depart Louisiana Feb. 20 and arrive in 
San Diego -- barring a backup in the Panama Canal -- in the middle of March, 
holds 35,000 gallons of fuel and has an estimated range of about 6,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
It is equipped with electronics not yet seen on any other sportfisher -- 
including a telex system for the businessman and an onboard computer system for 
such tasks as bookings and inventory keeping. 
</P>
<P>
Its maiden voyage, an 18-day venture to the yellowfin tuna grounds of the 
Revillagigedo Islands, is scheduled for April 2. 
</P>
<P>
LoPreste is already planning to build another boat. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it will be bigger . . . at this point that's not my goal," he said. 
"Maybe just to be able to say that I'm bigger I might go a little bigger, but 
I'm not going to do it just on an ego trip." 
</P>

The U.S. Forest Service will start charging a $3 processing fee this year for

returned. The Whitney trail, which usually sells out in the peak months, is 
100% reserved, the others half-reserved and half-daily arrivals. For Whitney, 
write P.O. Box 8, Lone Pine CA. 93545. Details: (619) 876-5542. . . . The

The Bill Nott Benefit Fund Banquet at Balboa last week drew 420 people, 
including Gov. George Deukmejian and Pete Bontadelli, Dept. of Fish and Game 
director. The event raised $25,000 to offset medical costs for the former 
president of the Sportfishing Assn. of California. . . . The Royal Polaris, 
skippered by Phil Loomis returned to San Diego from an 18-day trip to Alijos 
Rocks, Clarion and Socorro with 19 passengers having landed 380 yellowfin tuna, 
126 wahoo, 21 yellowtail, 92 grouper, two marlin and six amberjack. Butch Green 
of Los Angeles had a 274-pound yellowfin. The anglers also released more than 
200 tuna weighing up to 170 pounds. Twenty-five anglers on a nine-day trip 
aboard Dan Sansome's American Angler out of Point Loma brought back 372 
yellowfin -- 25 over 100 pounds, the largest a 137-pounder caught by Kelley 
Paakkonen of La Mirada. . . . On his first trip to Cabo San Lucas, Bill 
Vavricka of Riverside caught a 198-pound striped marlin. Boats have been 
averaging 1 1/2 to 2 marlin each per day. Dorado are running from 10 to 30 
pounds, and a few wahoo to 58 pounds are showing up. . . . Lee Clark and Joe

The Clippers, filling the roster spot left vacant by the injury to Gary Grant, 
signed guard Jim Les to a 10-day contract Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Les, a 1986 graduate of Bradley, has played in the World Basketball League, the 
Continental Basketball Assn. and the NBA. He appeared in all 82 games for the 
Utah Jazz last season and played in the opener this season before being waived. 
Since then, he toured with the Marathon Oil AAU team before joining the CBA's 
Santa Barbara Islanders, for whom he averaged 14.6 points and 9.8 assists a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to be in uniform when the Clippers play the Washington Bullets 
Thursday night. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

POINT GUARDS: VIPS OF BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rewind the basketball VCR, back to a time when a kid named Earvin -- not yet 
Magic -- wore out the sidewalks of Lansing, Mich., with his incessant 
dribbling. 
</P>
<P>
The game revolved around centers. Wilt posted up, Wilt got the ball, Wilt 
dunked. Russell swatted away shot after shot. "Sky hook" entered the 
vernacular. 
</P>
<P>
Now fast-forward to 1990. Earvin has long since become Magic, joined by friends 
known as Isiah, K.J. and Stockton. They do not play center, but now the game 
revolves around them. 
</P>
<P>
With all necessary apologies to Patrick Ewing, Akeem Olajuwon and David 
Robinson, centers just aren't enough anymore. Basketball has grown, stretched, 
quickened. Point guards are hip. 
</P>
<P>
Got a great point guard? You're in the hunt. Got an ordinary one? Forget it. 
Just ask Akeem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder to find a great point guard than a player at any other position," 
Utah Jazz president Frank Layden says. "It requires more skills, and the 
biggest is to be a decision-maker." 
</P>
<P>
The importance of great point men intensifies the search. The Jazz dipped into 
Spokane, Wash., in 1984, plucking unheralded John Stockton from unheralded 
Gonzaga University. Projected as Rickey Green's backup, Stockton instead became 
a star. 
</P>
<P>
As Utah knows, that does not automatically mean a championship ring; it's 
simply a key piece to the puzzle. Each of the last two NBA Finals have matched 
Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas, good buddies and top-flight point guards. Glen 
Rice may have scored bushels of points, but Rumeal Robinson was equally 
important to Michigan's NCAA title team last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Newell, who coached Cal to the national championship in 1959 and now 
scouts for the Cleveland Cavaliers, sees this as no coincidence. "You'll have a 
hard time winning a championship without a great point guard," Newell says. 
</P>
<P>
And today, "great point guard" has wider meaning than in the past. Point guards 
once did not worry about scoring. Dribble, organize, pass. Keep teammates 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Cheeks, now with San Antonio, epitomizes that kind of point guard. As 
he climbed the basketball ladder, his job description seemed clear. Be a 
playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
"That's it," Cheeks says. "Just pass. Nothing else. It was never in my makeup 
to score 20-25 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Now these guys are more able to score. It's a time for younger guys who can 
score and penetrate. They're more versatile." 
</P>
<P>
They score, they penetrate, they pass, they lead. Stockton and Kevin Johnson, 
widely considered the leading point guards for the '90s, have firmly put an end 
to the old style. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson last season became only the fifth player in NBA history to average at 
least 20 points and 10 assists (joining Magic, Thomas, Nate Archibald and Oscar 
Robertson). Stockton averaged 17.1 points and a league-high 13.6 assists. 
</P>
<P>
They are the wave of the future for several reasons. As defenses expand -- more 
double-teaming, more traps and thinly veiled zones -- coaches want swift point 
guards who can rush the ball upcourt, create fast breaks or at least start the 
offense quickly. 
</P>
<P>
And since the point guard most often has the ball, he must be a threat to shoot 
the jump shot or drive to the basket. Forget about poor-shooting, 
10-points-per-game stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"That's out," Magic says, grimacing and shaking his head. "All these guys can 
score. You've got to be a 17-12 man, or 17-11. That (10 points) just doesn't 
get it. The defense will let you have the shot." 
</P>
<P>
Since this is a story about point guards, we'll let Johnson have the first 
shot. He has earned it. 
</P>
<P>
THE MAGIC MAN 
</P>
<P>
Most conventional concepts of the point guard took a beating in the late 1970s. 
A tall guy with a wide smile emerged from Everett High School in Lansing, then 
moved on to nearby Michigan State. They called him Magic. They said he played 
the point. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Reynolds, the Kings' director of player personnel, remembers his 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard about him in college as a 6-9 point guard, I said, 'Oh, 
B.S. You're saying he's a point guard, but he really isn't,' " Reynolds 
recalls. "Then I saw him, and he really was a point guard. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like seeing the pyramids for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Earvin Johnson handled the basketball as if he were 5-foot-9. He loved to push 
the ball upcourt, where he could creatively pass off to teammates. He had a 
funky, ugly set shot -- which he made just 46 percent of the time in college -- 
but then, point guards did not need a great shot. 
</P>
<P>
Neither did most 6-9 players. Johnson just never fit the traditional role of a 
big man, comfortable only within an arm's reach of the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tall, but I could always dribble," he says. "Everywhere I went as a kid 
-- to the store, wherever -- I dribbled. I became a point guard because I 
dribbled so much. 
</P>
<P>
"And passing always gave me just as much satisfaction (as shooting). To make a 
good pass was like a rush, a high, and it still is." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson grew up admiring Nate Archibald, taking ideas for passes from Kevin 
Porter and Pete Maravich. Porter played for Johnson's home state Detroit 
Pistons, and he still holds the NBA single-game record of 29 assists. 
</P>
<P>
That mark -- and not much else -- has eluded Johnson. His magical act, which 
took Michigan State to the '79 NCAA title, became an instant NBA hit. In 
Johnson's very first season, 1979-80, he and skyhook inventor Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar led the Los Angeles Lakers to the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
In Kareem's first four seasons in Los Angeles, the Lakers never won a title. 
When a great point guard arrived, they immediately did. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has since added four more rings to his collection. In becoming the 
player most synonymous with winning since Bill Russell, he sparked a 
fashionable trend in high schools and on playgrounds across America. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, tall kids wanted to handle the ball. Their coaches may not have 
trashed the idea as quickly as they once did -- "Well, if Magic can do it ..." 
-- but no replica showed up in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"We get carried away with Magics," says Lee Rose, formerly a successful college 
coach and now the Milwaukee Bucks' director of player personnel. "We think 
everybody's going to be a Magic. Hell, there's only one Magic. 
</P>
<P>
"His ability to find those open men isn't necessarily because he's 6-9. A lot 
of people that height cannot do what he does." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, point guards have shrunk since Johnson's entrance. His chief 
rivals in the league today -- Thomas, Stockton, Kevin Johnson -- all must 
stretch to exceed six feet. 
</P>
<P>
Many respected basketball people hesitate to drop Magic Johnson into this 
group. Jerry West, a decent player in his day, harkens back to earlier times 
when speaking of Johnson -- when guards were guards. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic's a guard, because he can do everything," says West, now the Lakers' 
general manager. "If you watch him, Magic is a pretty simple player. He just 
has charisma. 
</P>
<P>
"When Magic was born, they sprinkled a little extra gold dust on him." 
</P>
<P>
So how exactly do we measure Johnson's impact on the position? He clearly 
brought focus and attention to point men. He helped accelerate the game into 
the open court, where guards have more impact than centers. 
</P>
<P>
And passing became a bit more chic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say I've made people aware of being a passer," Magic says. "Players now 
are conscious of doing that. Since that's happened, I feel good about it." 
</P>
<P>
THE EVOLUTION 
</P>
<P>
For all his wondrous achievements, Johnson did not hang around the peach basket 
with James Naismith. It only seems as if Magic were there, offering suggestions 
about how to position players in this new game. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the key moments in the evolution of the point guard are easily 
distinguishable. The first sign of life occurred when big men stopped jumping 
so often. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the war, guards were great big plodding guys, because there was a 
center-jump after every basket," Newell says. "The fast break started back 
then, with the elimination of the center jump." 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1954, a major rule change forever changed the role of point guards. 
Dismayed by slowdown strategy and low-scoring games, Syracuse Nationals owner 
Danny Biasone introduced the 24-second clock. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, point guards such as Bob Cousy, Slater Martin and Dick McGuire spent 
less time dribbling around, protecting leads and shooting free throws. The 
clock made teams PLAY and made point guards do more than handle the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years later, another new rule completed the shape of today's game. 
When the league adopted the three-point shot in 1979, defenses had even more to 
worry about.

Colombia's soccer federation will decide after an investigation into death 
threats against national team members and their families whether to send the 
team to Los Angeles this month for the Marlboro Cup. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report Tuesday by the French Press Agency, Colombian President 
Virgilio Barco ordered the country's security chief, General Miguel Maza, to 
investigate the threats, which were made last Thursday by a group calling 
itself Purge Colombian Soccer. 
</P>
<P>
The group warned Coach Francisco Maturana not to use players from four 
professional soccer teams that are believed to have connections with drug 
cartels. The majority of players on the national team have contracts with those 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We must get to the heart of this so the team can prepare normally for the 
World Cup," Barco said. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia is scheduled to play at the Coliseum on Feb. 20 and 22 in a tournament 
with the Soviet Union, Costa Rica and a Mexican team, Chivas of Guadalajara.

LEMIEUX NEARS GRETZKY'S MARK

Mario Lemieux's back problems are getting worse. He is wearing a brace and will 
require surgery to fix a disk that is rubbing on nerves and his spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is having trouble sleeping and says that at times the pain is 
unbearable, he plans to wait until the NHL season is over before having the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing goaltenders have trouble believing the streaking star of the 
Pittsburgh Penguins is really hurting. They would just as soon he had the 
surgery now. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux assisted on a goal just 2:20 into the first period Tuesday night 
against the New York Islanders at Pittsburgh to extend his point-scoring streak 
to 43 games. Aching back and all, he has the second-best streak in league 
history, behind only Wayne Gretzky's 51 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't help either Lemieux's physical or mental condition that the Penguins 
continue to flirt with last place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lemieux scored two goals and had three assists, the Penguins lost an 
8-7 overtime thriller. Lemieux set up the tying goal with two minutes left in 
regulation, but veteran Don Maloney scored with just 36 seconds remaining in 
overtime for the sizzling Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
New York leads the division and is nine points ahead of the Penguins. The 
Islanders have charged from last place by posting a 13-3-1 record in the last 
17 games. The Penguins' team physician, Charles Burke, said a damaged disk 
between the fourth and fifth vertebrae in Lemieux's lower back has gotten 
increasingly worse. He also said the injury was not career-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
But Lemieux was unable to practice Monday. "Some days I feel great, sometimes I 
feel terrible," Lemieux said. "There seem to be more of the latter lately." 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 2, New Jersey 2 -- The Oilers, who have been without goaltender Grant 
Fuhr most of the season, lost his capable replacement in a game at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ranford, who kept the Oilers in the battle for first place, was knocked 
unconscious early in the game in a pileup in front of the net. Pokey Reddick 
came in to play in a league game for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
He just missed the victory. With three seconds left in regulation, Patrik 
Sundstrom scored on a power play to get the Devils a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 12, Quebec 2 -- Dino Ciccarelli, one of the most prolific scorers in 
the game, had not had a goal in eight games, but he scored four times to lead 
an easy victory in Landover, Md. He had a second-period hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 2, Detroit 0 -- The Bruins practically gave goaltender Andy Moog the 
night off at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings had only 14 shots on goal. Most of Moog's saves were easy, and 
Boston stretched its lead in the Adams Division to five points. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 6, Toronto 4 -- Brett Hull became a part of hockey history when he 
scored his 50th goal of the season in this game at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Hull and Brett became the only father-son combination to reach the 50 
plateau. 
</P>
<P>
Brett's father was on hand for the historic event. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 5, Winnipeg 3 -- Dan Quinn scored twice at Vancouver to lead the 
Canucks to the victory. DAN HAFNER

ON A FIRE DEPARTMENT ROSTER IN ALABAMA, THE DEBATE OVER REVERSE DISCRIMINATION 
IS FRAMED IN VERY PERSONAL TERMS THAT COULD CHANGE LEGAL HISTORY.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Listen to the two men even briefly, and the similarities between Robert (Kenny) 
Wilks and Jackie Barton are apparent: Both graduated from Birmingham high 
schools in 1967, Wilks the son of a steelworker, Barton of a railroad man. Both 
now are Birmingham firefighters, one 40, the other 41. Both work out of Fire 
Station 10 in Avondale, 20 blocks due east of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The differences between the two men, however, are even more apparent. Wilks is 
white, Barton black. Wilks joined the fire department the year after he 
completed high school, while Barton waited 10 years, the fire department not 
being an available option for blacks in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Wilks remembers the Birmingham of his youth as a "well-rounded community, the 
type of place you'd want to grow up in." Barton recalls it as a city he could 
barely enter, with one black movie theater and no good jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Wilks watched Police Commissioner Eugene (Bull) Connor and the violent 1963 
Birmingham demonstrations on television, thinking it all "a bunch of bull, a 
bunch of hell-raising." Barton watched the clashes from the streets, throwing 
rocks at the firetrucks and dodging the charging dogs. 
</P>
<P>
There is one other difference between the two men, a difference revealed by a 
look at the roster that hangs from a wall in the office at Fire Station 10. 
There, both of their names are listed at the top in red, for they each are 
officers, but Barton's has a star beside it. He is the station's captain. Wilks 
is his lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
Wilks will not even look at that roster, with its blunt star an ever-present 
taunt. Every year in which he's taken the civil service exam for promotion, 
Wilks has ranked high -- eighth one year, third another, then ninth. One of 
those years, Barton ranked 86th. Barton is Wilks' boss only because of a 
consent decree and an affirmative action plan the city embraced in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
One day in the uncertain future, Wilks hopes to alter this circumstance. Barton 
rode the results of a job discrimination lawsuit to his position, and Wilks 
means to do the same. He's part of the way there already. Last June, in the 
case titled Martin vs. Wilks, the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to a 
lawsuit filed by Wilks and other white firefighters. The justices said their 
charge -- that Birmingham has discriminated against whites by implementing its 
1981 consent decree -- should have its day in court. 
</P>
<P>
"The Civil Rights Act passed 25 years ago, and a whole generation has come up 
since then," Wilks said. "Where's affirmative action going to end? I say end it 
now. My kids shouldn't have to pay for it. There's got to be an end. Sooner or 
later you pay a car off. There's got to be a stopping point somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't invent it," Barton countered. "I just happen to be in this place at 
this point in time. Just as I was there throwing rocks in 1963. Now I'm a fire 
captain." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resentment Grows 
</P>
<P>
The situation in Birmingham's Fire Station 10 is anything but aberrant. Over 
the past 15 years, affirmative action plans have wrought considerable changes 
in the workplace, helping a good number of women and minorities gain a foothold 
in the middle class. But they also have bred an abiding and deepening 
resentment among the white males who have been displaced. 
</P>
<P>
That resentment, gaining shape and force throughout the 1980s, encouraged by 
the Ronald Reagan Administration's policies and judicial appointments, now 
represents a full-fledged countermarch. The Supreme Court's decision in the 
Birmingham case has already triggered a number of other such reverse 
discrimination lawsuits, for Martin vs. Wilks all but invited them. 
</P>
<P>
Boston, for example, presently faces three -- one each from firefighter 
applicants, police applicants and policemen seeking promotions. San Francisco 
faces four -- from firemen, policemen and two teacher organizations. UC 
Berkeley faces a federal investigation into charges of discrimination against 
whites in its admissions policies. 
</P>
<P>
In courtrooms across the country during the 1990s, juries and judges will find 
themselves wrestling with questions energetically addressed more than a decade 
ago but not -- it is becoming increasingly apparent -- fully resolved. Are 
affirmative action plans still appropriate a quarter of a century after passage 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? Should there, in the 1990s, be equality of 
access and opportunity, or of final status? How is minority preference not 
reverse discrimination? How are goals not quotas? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Court Watched 
</P>
<P>
Beyond such cases the experts see even more sweeping litigation on the horizon. 
A decade ago, when the Supreme Court in United Steelworkers vs. Weber ruled 
that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act does not prohibit voluntary affirmative 
action plans, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote the opinion for a narrow 
five-judge majority, and Justice William H. Rehnquist drafted the caustic 
dissent. Now Rehnquist is the chief justice and has a majority on his side. 
There are those who believe the Supreme Court in time will declare all 
affirmative action plans -- public or private, voluntary or court-ordered -- to 
be unconstitutional violations of Title VII's ban against job discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"I fear that the Supreme Court will narrow Weber, and if they narrow Weber, you 
can throw out affirmative action," said Charles Craver, a professor at George 
Washington University Law Center who teaches a course on the law of employment 
discrimination. "I think the pervasive feeling now among the populace and 
professional people is that the biggest discrimination is against white males. 
White students see scholarships all going to minorities. They see minorities 
being flown all over this country, being wooed by graduate schools and 
employers. You don't see any whites getting this treatment. Clearly there is 
some reverse discrimination now. It is very difficult to have legitimate, 
official discrimination and then not have some backlash." 
</P>
<P>
The momentum on the legal battlefield has certainly shifted. That much can be 
seen simply by watching and listening to those involved in the Birmingham 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer for the white firefighters, Raymond Fitzpatrick Jr., can barely 
suppress a gleam in his eyes as he reminisces about his case's genesis and 
watches his clients offer practiced political analysis to TV cameras. By 
contrast, one of the lawyers for the black firefighters, Susan Reeves -- who 15 
years ago filed the lawsuits that led to the now-disputed consent decree -- 
bites off her words bitterly, resentful at being put on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you feel sitting here in Birmingham investigating discrimination 
against whites?" she demanded of one visiting national television reporter 
after he had shut down his camera. 
</P>
<P>
It is Birmingham city officials, though, who are left in the greatest disarray 
by the present turn of events. They have been squeezed hard, caught between two 
swings of a pendulum. A decade ago, they were being sued for discriminating 
against blacks, so they agreed to an affirmative action plan pressed on them by 
the Justice Department. Now, for implementing that consent decree, they're 
being sued for discriminating against whites. And once again the Justice 
Department is against them. 
</P>
<P>
There is no better place to observe this turnabout than in the disheveled 
office of the lawyer who represents the city, James P. Alexander, a partner at 
the distinguished Birmingham law firm of Bradley, Arant, Rose &amp; White. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander is a prototypal management labor lawyer, and his firm is among the 
largest and most traditionally conservative in the state, so he is accustomed 
to representing companies charged with job discrimination against blacks. Now 
-- somewhat to his own wonder -- he defends those same clients against similar 
complaints lodged by whites. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules have changed," he observed one recent morning. "And they're going to 
change some more. There's a change in the sense of what's fair. There's a 
change in the sense of what's in the interest of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, a look at the Birmingham experience provides revealing 
glimpses at how and why this has happened. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham was not founded until 1872, and then it was by carpetbaggers, drawn 
to the region because its iron, limestone and coal provided a rare locale where 
all the ingredients were available to make steel. Segregation was sustained by 
outside owners to keep labor peace in what soon became a lucrative industrial 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The change -- and predicament -- for Birmingham began not long after Bull 
Connor stood in the street beside Kelly Ingram Park in May, 1963, directing 
fire hoses and dogs against young black demonstrators. Those images helped set 
the stage for the Civil Rights Act and its Title VII job discrimination ban, 
which in turn provided the basis for a barrage of lawsuits against 
Birmingham-area employers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to think of a major Birmingham industrial firm not on the 
receiving end of one of these cases," Alexander said. "The plaintiffs were 
winning. We distributed money to the plaintiffs. We had to -- this was a hotbed 
of employment discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the three lawsuits filed against public authorities in 1974 
and 1975 by a handful of blacks, the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People and the Department of Justice were regarded as just another 
brush fire to extinguish. A settlement seemed inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1958, after all, announcements for the city's public-service jobs limited 
applicants to "whites only." The Birmingham Fire Department did not hire its 
first black until 1968 and didn't hire its second until 1974. There were no 
black supervisors of any sort until 1982 -- not surprising because black 
applicants for promotion needed favorable evaluations from white supervisors 
and faced a seniority policy that added one point to the test scores for each 
year in the department. 
</P>
<P>
Those setting about to remedy these conditions soon faced a critical fork in 
the road: They could try to cure the root causes -- among them the fact that 
only 24% of the black applicants even passed the test, compared to 82% of the 
whites -- or they could simply change the final results. That they chose the 
latter course had something to do with who made the final decisions. Lawyers, 
not social planners or philosophers, fashioned Birmingham's affirmative action 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hiring Goals Set 
</P>
<P>
The black firefighters' lawsuits were their impetus. Liability for damages and 
back pay was looming. The Justice Department was urging the city to settle. The 
matter had to be resolved, and in a fashion that yielded measurable results in 
the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
So, in the spring of 1981, after a year and a half of negotiation, the lawyers 
forged two consent decrees that tied long-term hiring goals directly to the 
ratio of blacks in the Jefferson County civilian labor force -- 28% in 1980. To 
reach that level, the city temporarily would give blacks half of each year's 
available jobs and promotions, drawing from a supplemental list of black 
candidates provided by the Jefferson County personnel board. The personnel 
board would compile this list by certifying additional eligible candidates, on 
the basis of race, beyond the top three it usually provided for each job 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the backbone of the Birmingham consent decrees, quite simply 
and without disguise, was a race-conscious plan to favor blacks with lower 
scores over whites with higher scores. 
</P>
<P>
In this intent, and in their wording and numerical goals, Birmingham's consent 
decrees were not particularly unusual. Just two years before, in fact, the 
Supreme Court had endorsed a plan with similar provisions in the Weber case. 
</P>
<P>
"The decree was bread and butter, plain vanilla, consistent with what was going 
on then," Alexander said much later, sounding close to bewilderment. "We didn't 
think we were doing anything dramatic. The relief was within the parameters of 
existing case law." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Black Officers 
</P>
<P>
The consent decrees certainly had their intended effect. Between March, 1982 
and 1989, the number of black firefighters climbed from 47 to 118, the number 
of black lieutenants from zero to 28, the number of captains from zero to nine. 
The first black battalion chief was named. Black firefighters in 1982 made up 
10% of the department; they now form almost 24%. There were no black 
lieutenants and captains in 1982; they now make up 28% of the department. 
</P>
<P>
Such a swift change altered lives considerably, particularly for middle-aged 
black men such as Barton, Carl Cook and Tony Jackson. They had grown up in 
Birmingham never imagining they would be firemen, and now they were department 
supervisors, directing the efforts of hundreds of men. During the mid- and late 
1980s, Cook became a lieutenant, Barton a captain, Jackson the battalion chief. 
Such a turn of events was, for them, stunning. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was growing up," Cook recalled recently, "if you went to the store and 
tried to buy pork chops, the man would say, 'What you need that? Neck bones OK 
for you.' It was unreal but it was very real. . . . In 1963, I remember being 
washed down Fourth Avenue by Bull Connor's fire hoses. They told us to just 
fall down and protect ourselves, but my parents were scared that if you got 
caught, they'd bomb your house, so I'd run. You couldn't fight the hose, but it 
could wash you down the street only so far. I was fortunate to never get bitten 
by the dogs. I was fast then; I got up and flew." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson mainly heard of Connor's fire hoses at church. "That's how we knew 
everything," he said. "The church was the information center. We were always 
there, hearing what was going on. . . . Life then was frightening -- you had to 
guard against so much -- but I don't remember really being taunted or jeered by 
whites. That's because we were so separated. We were not part of that world." 
</P>
<P>
When Cook graduated from high school in 1964, he knew the fire department 
wasn't an available option, but he tried anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew no blacks had been accepted there, but I didn't know why," he said. 
"Had any even applied? I went over to the downtown employment office on Eighth 
Avenue. 'I'd like to be a firefighter if you have any openings,' I said. They 
looked at me real odd and said there were no openings. I thought maybe there 
wasn't an opening. Or maybe it wasn't the right time. In those days, we 
accepted our situation. I had a family after all. Your parents were always 
telling you your actions could bring down problems for the family." 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, when he graduated in 1967, Barton didn't even try to apply. 
Nor did Jackson in 1969. "I never imagined that," Jackson said. "What I 
expected was to become a steelworker or a miner . . . or move north." 
</P>
<P>
In time, Cook found work doing manual labor at a Birmingham industrial plant. 
Barton joined the Air Force and became a military firefighter, roaming through 
Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines. Jackson earned an associate of arts 
degree in management-supervision training at a local junior college, but he 
ended up working on the line at an assembly plant that made utility trucks. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1974 recession, Jackson's luck turned particularly bad. Just after 
he married and bought a house, he was laid off. He spent the next year taking 
odd jobs -- chauffeur, bartender, groundskeeper, custodian, parking valet -- 
"anything I could find, anything and everything to keep my house and car." 
</P>
<P>
Then, that same year, Birmingham was hit with the initial lawsuit charging 
racial discrimination, and suddenly the black men's fortunes improved. Cook 
again applied to the fire department and this time he was hired, one of five 
that first year. A year later, Jackson landed an assistant's job in the city's 
engineering department. In 1977, he became a fireman, as did Barton, who left 
the Air Force after eyeing the new opportunities back home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Different Ways of Life' 
</P>
<P>
Once hired, Cook, Barton and Jackson found themselves working alongside whites 
who had grown up in a Birmingham far different from the one they had inhabited 
as boys. For men like Wilks and Charles Brush, black colleagues were a new 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Brush -- who serves with Wilks in Fire Station 10 and is president of the local 
firefighters union -- had never even attended school with blacks. "It was all 
white then," he recalled. "That was just the way things were." 
</P>
<P>
Wilks' high school wasn't integrated until 1964, and when it finally happened, 
he didn't like it. "I felt it was forced upon us," he recalled later. "I knew 
blacks -- we swam at the same swimming hole, we'd run them out, or they'd run 
us out -- but we had different ways of life. They had their way of life, I had 
mine." 
</P>
<P>
Wilks had joined the fire department in February, 1968, Brush in 1972. Watching 
the first blacks arrive, Brush recalls some "irritation" among his colleagues 
but nothing stronger. He was already a lieutenant, after all, when Barton was 
hired in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the blacks wouldn't tell us their test scores," Brush said. "Some said 
they'd never took the test. But in the late '70s, there really was no big 
problem. The big rub was when they came out with the consent decree. We 
understood there'd be some hiring of minorities, but promotions were never 
discussed. . . . When you get into promotions, you're talking about leaders of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The matter of promotions was indeed a more incendiary issue than new hires. It 
was also more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Although the consent decrees required that half of the new lieutenants be 
black, there were only a few blacks from which to choose -- just the handful 
who had been hired since the first lawsuit in 1974, who by 1982 composed 10% of 
the department. Such disproportionate ratios made for considerable strain. 
</P>
<P>
When Jackson took the lieutenant's test in 1982, he ranked 60th on the combined 
score -- which included test results and seniority points -- but the city 
needed to pick the four highest-ranked blacks, so he became a lieutenant. 
Wilks, who ranked eighth overall, did not. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the city took the two whites who ranked first and second, then passed 
over 76 other whites to promote the blacks who had ranked 80th, 83rd and 85th. 
Cook, the black ranked 85th, became a lieutenant. Wilks, ranked third this 
time, still did not. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Barton, ranked 86th among all applicants, became a lieutenant. 
Wilks, ranked ninth, again did not. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promotions Criticized 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Wilks finally made lieutenant, but by then the blacks were climbing 
higher. Jackson became a captain in 1983, as did Barton in October, 1988. When 
Jackson made battalion chief in July, 1987, he ranked 15th out of sixteen 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
This sequence of events understandably has provoked objections. Those who are 
displeased above all criticize what they consider the city's exceptionally 
stark and rapid manner of implementing affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
"A better alternative would have been to do this, but not go as fast," Brush 
said. "You can't raise the education level of a class of people in a few short 
years." 
</P>
<P>
"Could we have been less intrusive?" countered Alexander, the city's attorney. 
"What you're really asking is, could we have done it over 30 years instead of 
six. Well, sure, yes we could have. . . . But then you wouldn't have dealt with 
the problem for two generations." 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, judgments about how Birmingham implemented its affirmative 
action plan depend on the importance assigned to the firefighters' scores on 
the written tests. Some people value the tests and frankly believe that the 
blacks aren't capable or disciplined enough to study for them. Others, however, 
suggest that the tests are a white man's game, skewed toward those who write 
and administer them. And more than a few argue that pencil-and-paper tests are 
not, in any event, the best way to evaluate firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
They ask: Why not measure ability to lead or act, not memorize? Why not put 
people in situations and see how they react? How about a test for bravery? For 
reaction time in moments of crisis? For ability to follow orders? For ability 
to lead? For quickness? 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, such a notion provides common ground for some blacks and whites 
otherwise pitted against each other. The white firefighters, after all, would 
rather have a new test than a system that ignores test results entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not wedded to the current paper test," Brush said. "It's up to the city 
to choose. But then apply the results evenly." 
</P>
<P>
That call for equity, however, is not so easy to provide. Pleas such as Brush's 
eventually focus attention on the irksome difficulty at the heart of 
affirmative action plans -- their unavoidable trade-offs. Results are never 
applied evenly -- whatever the juggling with tests and labor ratios, the 
minorities are supposed to prevail. In the pursuit of equity there is a loss of 
equity. Some gain, some lose. 
</P>
<P>
In Birmingham, as elsewhere, the losers in this equation simply are no longer 
inclined to accept their fate without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ironic' Grouping 
</P>
<P>
That Wilks and Brush presently toil in Fire Station 10, reporting to Barton, is 
a circumstance they find utterly galling. It does not help that Wilks was the 
station's ranking officer, an acting captain, until Barton's arrival a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although the three men rarely work side by side -- they rotate 24-hour shifts 
every third day -- Wilks thinks the trio's grouping "kind of ironic," and not 
at all accidental. Wilks, after all, is point man on a reverse discrimination 
lawsuit, Brush is the union president, and Barton heads the Birmingham Brothers 
Assn., a splinter group established by black firefighters when they realized 
their union dues were paying for the white firefighters' lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
One day recently, Wilks screwed his thumb into his palm by way of describing 
what he believed someone higher up is doing to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it," he said. "But I do my job." 
</P>
<P>
Then he leaned forward in his chair, reached for the cover page of the fire 
department's application form and stared at it. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowhere on this is there a line to indicate race," he said. "It's not a part 
of it. There's no box for race. Where is it?" 
</P>
<P>
Putting down the application form, he lifted first one, then another, of the 
textbooks he had studied for so many hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Used to be, you took the test and those who did best got picked," he 
continued. "That's the way it used to be. That's the way it should be. . .. The 
white middle class is suffering the burden of the consent decrees. They're 
carrying the load. When they passed the Civil Rights Act, that should have been 
it. The right to the same school, water fountain, whatever. . . . But to give 
them preferential treatment on basis of race. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Brush, arriving at the station soon after, added his thoughts: 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, it's not fair, not right to give jobs or promotions on the basis of skin 
color. We didn't discriminate against anyone. Don't hang it on us. We weren't 
the ones who put up the 'no blacks apply' signs. I want to shake these people 
and say, 'So you are going to do it to me, discriminate against me on the basis 
of race, and now it's all right?' It wasn't then and it isn't now. . . . I 
really believe the American people have had enough of the idea that everyone 
should have the same quality car and food. If there was a referendum in this 
country, you couldn't get approval for quotas. And you couldn't get it through 
Congress. No way. It would be suicide for a politician to propose a system like 
ours here in Birmingham. People have had enough. I know I have." 
</P>
<P>
The blacks do not, by and large, respond with equal fervor. Their more laconic 
comments provide a reminder of just who has prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
"In all wars there are casualties," Cook said, shrugging. "Not everyone comes 
out clear. Those people, they're casualties of war." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not totally fair, but was it fair that I couldn't be a fireman back in 
the '60s?" Jackson said. "If there had been black firemen in 1962, there 
wouldn't have been a consent decree in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
As the talk about fairness builds, Cook likes to invoke a story concerning the 
First Alabama Bank: 
</P>
<P>
"Your daddy goes there, robs that bank. Then he buys a house on a hill with the 
stolen money. Buys Mom a mink, you a Jaguar. The FBI arrives, wants to take 
Dad, his house, the mink, the Jaguar. You say, 'No sir, not fair. I didn't rob 
the bank. I want to keep the car.' Point is, all these things you have is a 
result of what happened before, something that wasn't right. When it's time to 
pay the piper, now it's unfair. Well, if you want, let's start out zero-zero. 
Not you 30 points ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Listening to the conflicting viewpoints, it is clear that somewhere in the past 
20 years, these blacks and whites have swapped visions of Birmingham. Where 
Wilks complains of rising crime and expresses nostalgia for a vanished city, 
Cook now talks warmly of his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
"Birmingham has changed greatly, for the better," Cook said. "It's a city to be 
proud to live in now. You can buy pork chops. You can be someone. It was 
important to blacks for Doug Williams to be in the Super Bowl. Blacks can be 
Doug Williams. Or Bo Jackson, who's from our neighborhood. And now they can be 
Lieutenant Cook. They can aspire to this. Back then, we had no one to aspire 
to. That's important. You can say to yourself now (that) if I work hard, I can 
be like this person. That's important." 
</P>
<P>
If this transformation is the triumph of affirmative action, however, it is 
also, to some, reason for its cessation. It's precisely because of improved 
conditions that even a few of those committed to the spirit of the consent 
decrees now express reservations about the need for them in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It is essential for the welfare of a city that all people have a chance to do 
well," said David Vann, the progressive Democratic mayor of Birmingham from 
1975 to 1979. "But there may be a time when affirmative action is no longer an 
appropriate remedy. . . . That time may be coming close." 
</P>
<P>
In coming months, the relative merits of all the various arguments will be 
tested both in Congress and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights organizations and their major congressional allies soon will 
introduce legislation that will try to reverse Martin vs. Wilks and two other 
recent Supreme Court decisions related to affirmative action. And in the 
Birmingham federal courthouse, lawyers one day this year again will rise to 
argue whether it is legal to favor minorities over whites. 
</P>
<P>
In these forums, more than a few of the experts expect the pendulum to continue 
swinging, however slowly, away from the notion of affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
"We will see a flood of reverse discrimination cases now, but they won't win," 
said Craver, the George Washington University law professor. "Only if they 
narrow Weber will they win. Three or four years from now that's possible. . . . 
I think the nation is growing increasingly divided. Positions are hardening." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly that is so in Birmingham, where matters promise to grow only more 
complicated. With 28% of the fire department's lieutenants now black, the city 
has met the consent decrees' short-term goals, so the special juggling of the 
promotion rankings will soon end, regardless of court action. That means the 
certification lists once again will probably be all white, because the black 
firefighters' scores on the written tests and limited seniority alone haven't 
qualified any of them for a promotion. And such all-white lists, in turn, will 
most likely trigger renewed legal action by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate seeing both reverse discrimination and traditional discrimination 
suits at the same time," a beleaguered Alexander predicted one recent morning. 
"We are on the horns of a dilemma. All we know is that whatever we do, the 
losing side is going to sue us. There is no reason to settle. Everybody's got a 
side. It's a sad affair. We're back at the same old stalemate. We're still 
bumping heads. This might never end."

BROOKINS GOT $300,000 FOR LOBBYING ON LAX CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major concessionaire at Los Angeles International Airport has paid Bishop H. 
H. Brookins about $300,000 in lobbying fees through a controversial city 
program intended to help disadvantaged minorities and women, Brookins said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins told The Times that Host International Inc. placed him in its minority 
business enterprise program to pay for lobbying during the firm's unsuccessful 
1986 bid to run airport gift shops. Although Host paid Brookins with profits 
from food and beverage concessions at the airport, the bishop said he had no 
involvement in the operations. 
</P>
<P>
"It had nothing to do with me going out there and frying hamburgers," said 
Brookins, a civil rights leader and longtime mentor to Mayor Tom Bradley. "They 
knew I was the bishop. . . . I was never expected to or asked to be a hands-on 
operator of concessions." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo called Brookins' statements "shocking" and said it 
appears to "substantiate the charge that there was no real minority 
involvement" in the airport concessions contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Department of Airports will investigate the contractual arrangement 
between Host and Brookins in an attempt to verify the bishop's assertions, said 
Executive Director Clifton A. Moore. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly doesn't fit into (the goals of the minority business program)," 
Moore said. The Host contract with Brookins and other minority partners was 
intended to involve "true minority participation where they were actually 
learning the business," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
The airport minority business program has come under fire since The Times 
reported last June that a group of 18 minorities and women with political 
connections were given multimillion-dollar gift shop and food service 
contracts. A city audit of the airport program in November found that the group 
-- which included the wife of Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) -- reaped 
$7.3 million in profits for little or no work. 
</P>
<P>
Host executives said that Brookins signed a contract that called for him to 
become an active joint-venture partner in the food service business. But they 
acknowledged that Brookins was rewarded for his prior lobbying efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"He did something for us and we remunerated him," said Thomas C. Underwood, 
vice president and general counsel for Host, a subsidiary of Marriott Corp. "He 
was given the opportunity to participate (in the minority business program). We 
expected him to participate. We didn't tell him he had to." 
</P>
<P>
But Brookins stated that he was not expected to participate in the food and 
beverage business. "Nobody ever asked me nothing about coming to do any work," 
the bishop said in the interview on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the other seven minority joint-venture partners reached an agreement 
with Brookins to acquire his share of the business, because he has been living 
out of the area for more than a year, said Host Vice President Arthur Spring. 
</P>
<P>
The food and beverage operation is one of three lucrative city contracts 
awarded to Brookins, who served as bishop of the Los Angeles region of African 
Methodist Episcopal Church between 1976 and 1984. Last week, The Times reported 
that Brookins obtained a $336,000 loan of federal funds to improve a 
Crenshaw-area office complex that he secretly owned. 
</P>
<P>
The complex housed a program, headed by Brookins, that offered job training and 
education for poor residents of Southwest Los Angeles. Brookins received the 
interest-free loan through a nonexistent church corporation. City 
administrators say they never would have financed the renovation if they had 
known that Brookins owned the complex. Today, the property is worth nearly $1 
million, according to loan documents signed by Brookins. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, city officials announced that they are conducting a full review of 
the loan, including whether Brookins returned nearly $30,000 in construction 
funds that district attorney's investigators say he used for "personal 
obligations." A City Council committee cut off funding to an $83,000-a-year 
poverty program, housed in Brookins' building, that had a long history of 
problems, including fraud and mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins also is among six prominent minority figures with close ties to 
Bradley whose lobbying and participation helped a team of developers win a 
$200-million contract last year to expand the Los Angeles Civic Center. For 
their efforts, Brookins and his associates were awarded an undisclosed share of 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Brookins was one of eight minorities selected by Host International to 
help operate food and beverage concessions at Los Angeles International 
Airport. Brookins has received at least $296,840 between 1985 and 1989, 
according to the city audit conducted last year. 
</P>
<P>
The bishop's share was five times that of the other Host partners, even though 
he was "not involved in any way with management or operations of the 
partnership or facilities" and did not attend a single management meeting, the 
audit report said. The partners included John Mack, president of the Los 
Angeles Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins said he supports the goals of minority business programs, but he had 
no intention of participating in the joint venture agreement with Host. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole position is for minorities to progress," Brookins said. "They ought 
to be placed in hands-on positions. That is how you learn. But that was not my 
deal. I was doing what I could do best in Los Angeles -- that was to lobby." 
</P>

As a politically influential black leader in Los Angeles, Brookins was sought 
by both Host International and Duty Free Shoppers Group Ltd. in 1985 to 
assemble a team of minority partners. The two firms were competing for the 
rights to sell duty-free merchandise at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Brookins had been reassigned to an AME church post in Little Rock, 
Ark., but continued to maintain a residence in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins said he had agreed to represent Duty Free Shoppers, which had the 
existing gift shop contract, but then joined Host. According to copies of 
contracts obtained by The Times, Host guaranteed Brookins at least $50,000 in 
annual profit if the firm won the duty-free shops contract. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me to lobby to win the contract," Brookins said. "(If they lost), 
they gave me assurances I could get a percentage of their existing food and 
beverage contract. . . . It had nothing to do with my doing any work at the 
airport." 
</P>
<P>
Host company officials said that Brookins did everything he was asked to do to 
land the gift shop contract. "He really delivered for us," Underwood said. "He 
came through when we needed somebody to put together a really excellent group 
(of minority partners)." 
</P>
<P>
But the Board of Airport Commissioners awarded the contract to Duty Free 
Shoppers in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Host paid Brookins $35,000 in advances plus $3,000 per month 
against his future profits as a joint-venture partner in Host's food and 
beverage contract, documents show. Host's food service contract was extended in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins described the payments as "consulting fees" for his earlier services. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, Brookins was reassigned as bishop of the 
Washington-Virginia-Maryland region for the AME church and moved out of 
Southern California. He failed to attend a single board meeting of the 
joint-venture partners. 
</P>
<P>
Had airport officials known that Brookins would not serve any role for Host, 
they would not have allowed the bishop to participate in the minority program, 
said Barbara Williams, the airport's minority business coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"Host represented that (Brookins and his partners) were going to be working as 
a group to operate all of the food and beverage for the department as a 
management team," Williams said. "That's how the participants were going to 
learn the necessary skills that it takes to operate as prime contractors." 
</P>
<P>
She said these skills included hiring personnel, ordering food items, making 
menus and buying uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
C. Edward Corser, chief administrative analyst who audited the airport program, 
said, "If it was known up front that Brookins was never going to participate, 
then obviously this whole thing would be considered a sham. But Host and the 
written agreement said otherwise. All we can do is assume that Brookins was 
expected to participate." 
</P>
<P>
Auditors noted that Brookins received five times the amount of profits his 
minority partners did, while the Host contract called for no greater 
participation on the bishop's part. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, (Host) was repaying him for prior services," Corser said.

BUSH TO PRESS FOR RAPID GROWTH, DOUBTS SLUMP; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: CONGRESS GETS PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL MESSAGE. ITS GOALS MAY SIGNAL 
CONTINUING CLASHES WITH THE FED. 
</P>

<P>
President Bush said Tuesday that his "primary economic goal" over the next 2 
1/2 years will be to keep the economy growing as rapidly as possible without 
rekindling inflation so the nation can grow out of its budget deficit and 
improve its living standard. 
</P>
<P>
In his annual economic message to Congress, Bush dismissed suggestions that 
America is due for a recession soon simply because economic expansion has 
continued for so long. He asserted that the economy's performance during 1989 
has "set the stage for healthy growth" in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"Growth is the key to raising living standards, to leaving a legacy of 
prosperity for our children, to uplifting those most in need and to maintaining 
America's leadership in the world," Bush said. He predicted that the economy, 
now sluggish, will pick up later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The President's commitment to more rapid growth appeared to signal a 
continuation of the conflict between the Administration and the independent 
Federal Reserve Board over how fast the economy should be growing. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed has indicated that it wants the economy to grow relatively slowly, both 
to ease inflation pressures and to dampen demand for imports. Some Fed 
governors have contended that living standards must grow more slowly for the 
United States to solve its economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
But the President's remarks -- backed by a 419-page report written by his 
three-member Council of Economic Advisers -- suggest that the Administration is 
more convinced than ever that the economy should be growing more rapidly than 
the Fed wants it to. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's report said that the Administration's economic goal should be "not 
simply to avoid recessions and extend the expansion" but to keep economic 
output growing rapidly enough so that incomes keep rising faster than 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's differences with the Fed have cropped up periodically 
during Bush's first year in office -- mostly in disputes over whether the 
central bank ought to actively push interest rates lower or keep them 
relatively high to help combat inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent clash occurred last month, when White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater criticized the Fed publicly for not nudging down interest 
rates. When asked about the Fed's reluctance, Fitzwater asserted that lower 
interest rates would be "justified." 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady conceded in testimony before Congress last 
week that there are "differences of point of view" between the central bank and 
the Administration, acknowledging that "the Administration probably has a bias 
toward (faster) growth." 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, sought to 
minimize any disagreement, telling a news conference Tuesday that "what 
differences there may be are rather minor" in context. "If you want to make a 
mountain out of less than a molehill, that's your decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee on Tuesday began a 
two-day policy review. Although the White House is hoping the panel will vote 
to nudge interest rates lower, the committee is expected to continue its 
current policies. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the presidents of four regional Federal Reserve Banks formally urged 
Congress Tuesday to adopt a resolution directing the Fed to make cutting the 
inflation rate to zero its primary goal over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The four are Gerald E. Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York, Robert T. Parry of San Francisco, W. Lee Hoskins of Cleveland and Robert 
P. Black of Richmond. All are on the 12-member Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bush nor the economic advisers' report attacked the Fed directly. The 
President said he "strongly" supports "the Fed's goal of non-inflationary 
growth and share(s) with them the conviction that inflation must be controlled 
and reduced in a predictable fashion." 
</P>
<P>
The council's report praised the Fed for its inflation-fighting efforts, saying 
the central bank "appears to have achieved a high degree of credibility" by 
"consistently following a forward-looking policy directed at this goal." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bush noted pointedly in his message to Congress that the economic 
pick-up he is forecasting for later this year depends at least partly on 
whether the Fed "maintains a credible policy program to support strong 
non-inflationary growth." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's contention that the United States can "grow its way out 
of" the budget and trade deficits -- by spurring more tax revenues while the 
government slows the growth of spending -- is sure to spark controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Several key Democrats in Congress already have expressed skepticism about the 
President's assertions that he can accomplish his aims without either raising 
taxes or cutting spending more drastically. But Bush insists that he is on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's report dismissed the conventional wisdom that the economic expansion, 
now in its eighth year, soon must begin to wane. It said historical evidence 
shows that recession "does not automatically become more likely" just because 
an expansion has continued several years. 
</P>
<P>
The document noted that, in contrast to previous lengthy economic expansions, 
inflation "has remained moderate and has not accelerated" during the current 
growth streak, and the economy's shift from manufacturing toward services makes 
it less susceptible to slumps. 
</P>
<P>
The council's report cited a standard list of U.S. economic shortcomings -- the 
United States must save and invest more of its resources, upgrade its 
educational system and provide more jobs and housing for the poor, it said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the central theme of the council document was that the government must 
hammer out a clear and systematic long-term plan for resolving these problems 
that will be "credible" to a majority of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"Without commitment to a clear plan," it said, "strong incentives exist to 
change policies in an attempt to achieve short-term gain." 
</P>
<P>
The report suggested some modest procedural improvements in the Gramm-Rudman 
budget law to make it more difficult for Congress and the Administration to 
circumvent deficit-reduction targets late in the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
And it reiterated the Administration's opposition to so-called industrial 
policies, which provide government subsidies to industries, and to allocating 
shares of the international trade market under the guise of "managed trade." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to previous years, when the council used its report to announce new 
concepts, Tuesday's document was bland -- amounting essentially to an economic 
textbook designed to provide the intellectual background to explain the 
Administration's economic philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
But there were some surprises: 
</P>
<P>
Departing from its earlier reluctance to discuss the issue, the Administration 
conceded that the four-year improvement in the nation's trade deficit is likely 
to be "smaller and more gradual over the near term" and could grind to a halt 
in several more months. 
</P>
<P>
Distancing itself further than before from the Ronald Reagan Administration, 
the Council of Economic Advisers conceded that Reagan economic policies 
"contributed to" the run-up in the value of the dollar -- and the dramatic 
widening of the U.S. trade deficit -- in the 1980s.

DAVIS CALLS FOR PUBLIC FINANCING OF CAMPAIGNS 
</P>

<P>
The felony conviction of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya makes it clearer than ever that 
state lawmakers should not be collecting outside income or speaking fees and 
that the taxpayers, not special interests, should be financing campaigns, state 
Controller Gray Davis said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There ought to be public financing for every campaign," Davis said in a 
breakfast interview with The Times' Sacramento bureau. "It works for the 
President. There is no reason it can't work for other offices." 
</P>
<P>
Any proposed reform that does not curtail private campaign financing would do 
no more than "tinker around the edges" of the problem, said Davis, who was 
chief of staff to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and served two terms in the 
Assembly before being elected controller in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a skilled fund-raiser who has collected millions of dollars from the 
private sector to support his own political career, noted that a recent survey 
by the Los Angeles Times Poll found that three-fourths of Californians support 
banning private contributions for legislators and replacing the present system 
with public financing. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Montoya, a Whittier Democrat who was convicted Friday of seven 
counts of extortion, racketeering and money laundering, shows that the public 
cannot have confidence in its elected officials as long as they depend on 
special interests to fill their campaign treasuries, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have got to free public officials from the taint and suspicion of private 
financing," he said. "Otherwise, every time someone casts a vote in favor of an 
interest that may have supported them at any point in their political career, a 
legitimate suspicion can be raised." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his statements, Davis said he opposes Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's 
government ethics initiative. That proposal would ban honorariums, strengthen 
conflict-of-interest codes and establish partial public financing for state 
campaigns. Davis said he opposes the November ballot measure because it would 
limit legislators to 12 years in one office. 
</P>
<P>
"I am against arbitrary limits," he said. "I think the legislative process 
needs some institutional memory. There is something to be said for experience." 
</P>
<P>
However, Davis said he would support term limits for statewide elected 
officials, such as the governor and controller. 
</P>
<P>
Davis also said he supports a sweeping environmental initiative proposed by Van 
de Kamp, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. The "Big Green" 
initiative, as the November ballot proposal has been called, would phase out 
cancer-causing agricultural pesticides, tighten safeguards against oil spills, 
restrict air polluting chemicals, control logging and strengthen health 
protection for farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe the people are way ahead of their elected officials on a 
couple of issues, and the environment is one of them," Davis said. "This 
initiative represents an accurate description of what most Californians want." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he is "absolutely confident" that the Legislature will never pass 
the items proposed in the initiative. "There is no constituency for the 
future," he said, quoting his former boss, Gov. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
On another matter, Davis said he supports repealing the constitutional limit on 
state spending, known as the Gann Limit. Repealing the limit would free an 
extra $1 billion a year for the general use of state government, money that 
otherwise would be spent on education or be returned to the taxpayers, he said.

VIETNAM MEMORIAL DEVELOPS THIN CRACKS; 
</P>

VETERANS: THE PROJECT'S MAIN FUND-RAISER STARTS A $1-MILLION CAMPAIGN TO PAY 
FOR UNANTICIPATED REPAIRS. WHO IS AT FAULT HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED.

The Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a pair of polished granite walls that has become 
the capital's most visited monument, has developed hairline cracks and will 
require extensive future repairs, the project's principal fund-raiser said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jan C. Scruggs, president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, said the 
organization has launched a direct-mail drive to raise about $1 million to 
finance the unanticipated repairs and other long-term maintenance needs. 
</P>
<P>
Scruggs said that some of the cracks in the 8-year-old granite walls, which 
bear the names of 58,258 fatalities in the Southeast Asian conflict, could be 
the result of faulty construction or flawed materials. 
</P>
<P>
He said the memorial fund is entering into legal arbitration proceedings to 
determine whether financial responsibility for the repairs should fall on the 
builder, the suppliers or the monument's sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
The Gilbane Building Co., a Rhode Island firm with offices in Washington, was 
the principal contractor on the memorial. A spokesman for the company could not 
be reached Tuesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Scruggs, who served as a combat infantryman in Vietnam, led the fund-raising 
effort that raised $9 million to build the memorial on a two-acre site allotted 
by Congress near the Lincoln and Washington monuments. The memorial fund agreed 
to maintain it in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, surplus money from the original drive had been sufficient to finance 
maintenance. But the discovery of the hairline cracks and other anticipated 
expenses made a bigger budget appear necessary, Scruggs said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just decided a few months ago that looking at the long-term needs, we 
should have an endowment of about $1 million to provide enough income," Scruggs 
said. "We have already started a direct-mail appeal, and money is coming in." 
</P>
<P>
The fund recently bought a supply of Bangalore granite from India to ensure 
that replacement panels match the original wall, he said. The replacement 
granite has been polished and placed in storage at Quantico Marine Base near 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Gray in its natural state, the stone turns almost black when polished, making 
the gold-etched lettering appear to float on the surface of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Since the monument's 1982 dedication, 262 names have been added and many more 
corrected as new information about Vietnam casualties has emerged. Last year, 
the addition of 60 names to the walls cost $90,000, Scruggs said. 
</P>
<P>
The memorial's designer, Maya Lin, said in an interview that she does not 
believe the flaws are serious. "I was only the designer," she said, "but I am 
certain the technical people who built it did their absolute best." 
</P>
<P>
Now a practicing architect in New York, Lin was a 21-year-old architecture 
student at Yale University when she won the $20,000 first prize for her 
controversial design. 
</P>
<P>
The starkly simple memorial is a wide, V-shaped excavation walled in granite. 
Visitors descend from the surface along sloping paths to the vertex, where the 
walls are 10 feet high and the names of the first and last fatalities of the 
war are engraved. 
</P>
<P>
The memorial is situated atop filled land on what was once wetlands bordering 
the Potomac River. The adjacent Lincoln Memorial, completed in 1922, has 
suffered from settling problems, and a planned ground-floor museum there has 
never been opened because of dampness. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the cracking, Scruggs said the Vietnam memorial also has experienced 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
"I was down there today," he said, "and I actually did find a new scratch on 
panel 59 E (the 59th panel on the east wall) and what looked as if somebody had 
thrown some kind of liquid on Panel 25 E."

CAPE TOWN, South Africa

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South African government's negotiations chief said Tuesday that he is 
looking for a more "cooperative attitude" from the African National Congress 
now that President Frederik W. de Klerk has, at great political risk, freed the 
guerrilla group to operate openly inside South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is only fair that in answer to the considerable strides the state 
president has taken, some steps should at least be taken on the other side to 
lessen the gap between the two parties," said Gerrit Viljoen, De Klerk's 
minister of constitutional development. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Viljoen spoke in Cape Town, ANC leader Walter Sisulu arrived in 
Johannesburg after consultations with the ANC executive committee in Europe and 
told reporters that the ANC has no plans to open negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question yet of direct discussions with the government," the 
77-year-old Sisulu said. "Nothing fundamentally has changed." 
</P>
<P>
The public sparring indicated the deep divisions, fostered by decades of 
animosity and mistrust, that must be overcome by the government and the ANC 
before the two leading forces in South African politics can sit down at a 
negotiating table and begin discussing a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes for breaking the logjam rest largely with jailed nationalist Nelson R. 
Mandela, the most widely respected black leader in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The white minority-led government believes that a free Mandela will be able to 
persuade the ANC to begin negotiations on power-sharing with the government, 
and it wants to grant his wishes, insofar as it is able, to avoid later public 
confrontations with Mandela that could scuttle the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Viljoen, a silver-haired former classics professor who has met Mandela dozens 
of times in prison, said Tuesday that the 71-year-old ANC member serving a life 
term for sabotage is "a leader of stature . . . who will make a very important 
contribution toward starting negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
But the Rev. Allan Boesak, who met Mandela on Tuesday, said that while the 
black leader called De Klerk's speech "bold, courageous and hopeful," he did 
not believe it had cleared the way for talks between the government and the 
ANC. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk says he has decided to release Mandela unconditionally, and Viljoen 
says the release will come "very soon." But Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) 
Botha urged reporters Tuesday "not to believe people who say the decision rests 
solely with the South African government." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's wife, Winnie, has said her husband is refusing to leave prison until 
the government lifts the 3 1/2-year-old state of emergency and releases all 
activists jailed for politically inspired crimes. 
</P>
<P>
But Boesak said the world's most famous prisoner had set no such preconditions. 
</P>
<P>
"He will not hold onto the chairs and tables and kick and say, 'I won't come 
out,' " Boesak said after a three-hour meeting with Mandela at Victor Verster 
prison farm near Cape Town. "But he will warn them: 'If you do release me and 
the conditions that we have put have not been met, then I will be obliged to 
make a statement on those conditions.' " 
</P>
<P>
The government has declined to specify the factors delaying Mandela's release, 
other than to cite the prisoner's own "personal considerations" and government 
worries about his safety. 
</P>
<P>
Botha, one of the architects of De Klerk's liberalization policies, said the 
state of emergency, several key provisions of which were eliminated Friday, 
will be ended "as soon as possible." But he suggested that it might not be 
removed before Mandela's release. 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa has been going through an uneasy time," Botha said. "If we 
withdraw all the regulations and suddenly large-scale turbulence starts and 
forces us to reintroduce these measures . . . I can assure you we will pay a 
heavier price than (if we) just test the waters for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government is seeking an ANC response to its new policy 
reforms. In his speech Friday, De Klerk lifted a ban on the ANC and about 60 
other anti-apartheid groups, removed restrictions on nearly 400 activists and 
rescinded provisions of the emergency decree that had not been comprehensively 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
The moves went a long way toward meeting the pre-negotiation demands of the ANC 
and other anti-apartheid groups. The ANC has said it welcomes De Klerk's 
actions but has pointed out that several demands remain to be met, including 
the release of Mandela and other political prisoners and an end to the 
emergency decree. 
</P>

"Through all the stages of its history, the party has tried to consolidate its 
power by any means possible," Ivan I. Antonovich, a ranking Communist Party 
researcher, noted in an interview Tuesday. And that's what makes "this period 
we are living through . . . unique." 
</P>
<P>
In his most dramatic step against that flow of party history, Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has now called publicly for the Communists to yield their 
constitutional monopoly on power and allow development of a truly pluralistic 
political system. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the Soviet leader is turning his back not only on the late 
dictator, Josef Stalin, whose legacy he has long openly disavowed, but also on 
V. I. Lenin, the founding father of the Soviet state. And he is setting out on 
a new and largely unmarked course knowing that the change will reverberate 
literally through every factory, office and schoolroom across this vast land. 
</P>
<P>
It was Lenin who championed the "dictatorship of the proletariat" 14 years 
before the 1917 Russian Revolution, when the fledgling Russian Social 
Democratic Workers' Party split into Bolshevik (later to become Communist) and 
Menshevik factions. 
</P>
<P>
It was Lenin who said the proletariat would only stay in step if led by a 
small, dedicated core of revolutionaries, and that "for the center . . . to 
actually direct the orchestra, it needs to know who plays which violin and 
where, who plays a false note and why, and how and where it is necessary to 
transfer someone to correct the dissonance." 
</P>
<P>
It was also Lenin who declared the "undivided political supremacy" of his party 
after taking less than a year either to destroy all non-Communist political 
organizations or render them impotent. 
</P>
<P>
It remains a matter of historical debate whether Lenin meant permanently to 
relax the party's authoritarian grip with the introduction in 1921 of his New 
Economic Policy, which abolished the state's monopoly over small business. In 
the same year, the party also created the institution of the Politburo, the 
handful of top leaders who collectively set national policy. And it outlawed 
"factionalism," its term for organized minority opposition within the ranks to 
the policies decided by the majority. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Lenin's intention, after his death in early 1924, Stalin progressively 
centralizedpower until he ruled as a virtual dictator, ending any pretense of 
consensus politics, even among the small clique at the top. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1927, at the party's 15th Congress, Stalin had managed to crush a 
number of top rivals, launch the first five-year plan for economic development 
and set the stage for the forced collectivization of agriculture, steps that 
heralded one of the 20th Century's most costly experiments in social 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Stalin's great purges of the 1930s, followed by World War II, reinforced the 
totalitarian system. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after Stalin's death, his successor as party leader, Nikita S. 
Khrushchev, made his famous "secret speech" to the 20th Communist Party 
Congress, condemning the dictator's crimes and launching an earlier period of 
relaxation. Within months, there was turmoil in Eastern Europe, culminating in 
the ill-fated Hungarian uprising in November, 1956. 
</P>
<P>
And by 1964, Khrushchev was ousted and his "thaw" reversed by a new leadership 
headed by Leonid I. Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
What Brezhnev gave to the party he headed, if not to his country, was nearly a 
generation of unprecedented job security. Once in place, a party boss was 
secure. And there followed a period of extraordinary corruption, cronyism, and 
stagnation. Whatever idealism remained from the original Communist creed was 
slowly strangled. 
</P>
<P>
For all his reputation as a fearsome revolutionary, Lenin was still complaining 
five years after the revolution that he could not control the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
"Suppose we take Moscow, with its 4,700 responsible Communists," he told the 
11th Party Congress in 1922, "and suppose we take that huge bureaucratic 
machine, that huge pile. Who is directing whom? I doubt very much whether it 
can truthfully be said that the Communists are directing this pile. To tell the 
truth, they are not doing the directing. They are being directed." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Gorbachev inherited something of the same problem more than 60 
years later. The bureaucracy is securely in Communist hands now, but he has 
found those Communist bureaucrats at least as resistant to change as the 
non-Communist predecessors who frustrated Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union today reaches into nearly every aspect 
of Soviet life, from management of industry to control of the Bolshoi Ballet. 
It is not just a Politburo and a Central Committee, or even 19 million 
individual members. 
</P>
<P>
It is 440,000 cells, or "primary party organizations," in every factory, farm, 
school, and military unit -- organizations that convey instructions from the 
top of the party pyramid to the bottom, and that keep tabs on the performance 
and advancement of people throughout the system. 
</P>
<P>
Party committees parallel government structures at every level, from the 
village council through the 157 provincial party bosses, some of whom 
effectively rule over territories larger than most West European countries. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated in his efforts to reform the system from the top, Gorbachev has 
already managed to unleash grass-roots forces to aid him in shaking the system 
out of its lethargy. He has turned the Parliament from a rubber stamp for party 
policy into a real forum for debate. He has allowed the growth of "popular 
fronts" that function like political parties in several of the country's 
constituent republics. 
</P>
<P>
While there are none yet, Gorbachev now holds open the possibility of rival 
parties on a national level with his proposal to eliminate Article 6, the 
constitutional provision that guarantees the Communist Party's "leading role." 
</P>
<P>
But Antonovich, vice chancellor in charge of research for the party's Academy 
of Social Sciences, said Tuesday that by opening up the election process to 
non-party candidates, Gorbachev has already effected a creeping revolution that 
will take hold this spring in local and republic-level elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Who the hell cares about Article 6?" Antonovich said. "Whether it stands or 
doesn't stand, the party is out of power."

The government has decided to sharply restrict overseas study by requiring 
Chinese university graduates to work for five years before they become eligible 
to study abroad, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Western educational specialists said the government wants to use the five-year 
work rule to halt a "hemorrhaging" flow of tens of thousands of talented young 
people who have left to study in the West but often fail to return to China. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to impose the new rule follows President Bush's recent promise to 
extend the visas of Chinese students in the United States.

CHINESE POLITICAL PRISONERS REPORTED BRUTALLY BEATEN

News seldom leaks from Qincheng Prison, a secretive facility on the outskirts 
of Beijing believed to hold several hundred top student and intellectual 
leaders arrested for their roles in last spring's pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
But as China has lifted martial law in Beijing and begun to release some of 
those detained last summer, more information is filtering out about conditions 
there and in other institutions where political prisoners are held. 
</P>
<P>
Asia Watch, a New York-based human rights organization, summarizes much of the 
currently available material in a report released today that charges Beijing 
with pursuing a policy of waisong neijin -- presenting to the world an external 
appearance of relaxation while actually intensifying repression. 
</P>
<P>
The report notes a "drastic deterioration in the general standards of human 
rights observance" since last June's crackdown, and charges that conditions for 
prisoners "are both harsh and brutal." 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of those detained at Qincheng bear wounds and injuries inflicted 
as a result of severe beatings by prison guards, many have given false 
confessions under duress, and others have become mentally ill," the report 
states in paraphrasing comments by a Chinese student to the Hong Kong newspaper 
Ming Bao in January. 
</P>
<P>
The student, who according to Ming Bao's report had recently been released from 
Qincheng, said that "influenza, lung infections and other diseases were . . . 
spreading throughout the prison, and 'pitiful wailing sounds' could be heard 
coming from many of the cells." Students "were being forced to write fresh 
confessions every day." 
</P>
<P>
Charges that beatings are commonplace draw support from scenes aired on 
state-run Chinese television last June, when detained protesters showed obvious 
bruises. Since mid-summer, however, as China has sought to present a more 
benign face to the world, there have been few official reports about the 
treatment of imprisoned demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all unofficial reports have been based on anonymous sources because of 
the danger inherent in speaking to foreign reporters about such subjects. 
</P>
<P>
But a few days ago, too late to be included in the Asia Watch report, an editor 
of the official school newspaper at Beijing Teachers University gave the 
Associated Press an on-the-record interview about his 185-day experience in a 
Beijing jail, most of whose inmates were ordinary criminals. 
</P>
<P>
The editor, Gao Xin, 33, who became prominent as one of four intellectuals who 
staged a hunger strike in Tian An Men Square in early June, said he joined the 
protests because he was angered by the government's May 20 declaration of 
martial law. 
</P>
<P>
"The army's guns should be pointed outward, not inward at the people," Gao said 
in his recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Gao said he shared a 100-square-foot cell with at least seven men at a time and 
that he was let out for exercise only twice in half a year. For the first three 
months of confinement, his family and fiancee were unable to learn anything 
about where he was being held. 
</P>
<P>
"The loneliness of the spirit was terrible," Gao said. He added, however, that 
treatment was worse for the accused rapists, murderers and thieves with whom he 
shared his cell. 
</P>
<P>
"The others got only two steamed rolls at lunch and dinner, but the guards gave 
me as many as I wanted, because they sympathized with me," Gao said. 
</P>
<P>
In backing up its charges of beatings and torture, Asia Watch cites statements 
by Wang Yang, a Chinese citizen who was arrested in July while trying to help a 
Taiwanese journalist meet secretly with prominent student leader Wang Dan. Wang 
Dan, who topped the Chinese government's list of "most wanted" fugitive student 
activists, was also arrested in this incident. He is believed to be among those 
now held at Qincheng. 
</P>
<P>
Wang Yang, for reasons that are still not clear, was released after 45 days and 
allowed to travel to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with the Hong Kong-based Chinese-language Singtao News, 
cited by Asia Watch, Wang Yang stated that for his entire 45 days in custody he 
was shackled by handcuffs and leg irons. He also said that "on each of his 
daily interrogations by the police he was badly beaten." 
</P>
<P>
Other released prisoners have told foreign reporters of being touched with 
electric batons, or cattle prods, which the Asia Watch report describes as 
"perhaps the most widespread" form of torture used in Chinese prisons. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government denies that official policy ever allows the use of 
torture. But before the June crackdown, the official media occasionally ran 
articles exposing cases of unauthorized torture. 
</P>
<P>
The Asia Watch report notes that there have been at least 40 officially 
announced executions of protesters, including many convicted only of crimes 
against property, such as burning vehicles or setting fire to trains. The 
report cites the case of Sun Baohe, who according to the Jinan Daily was 
executed last Oct. 14 for setting fire to an automobile during a June 6 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
While most international attention has been focused on the situation of 
students and intellectuals, the Asia Watch report states that "it is the 
workers in China who have in fact borne the brunt of the recent and continuing 
repression." 
</P>
<P>
Workers "form the great majority of those who have been detained," the report 
states. "Their conditions of detention are much harsher than those of other 
groups. . . . They are also the ones most likely to be subjected to torture and 
other forms of gross ill-treatment during police interrogation. Significantly, 
all those known to have been executed since June 4 were either workers or 
unemployed."

HOUSE AND SENATE PANELS APPROVE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF PANAMA AID 
</P>

Congressional committees, moving with lightning speed, gave initial approval 
Tuesday to the first installment of the Bush Administration's $1-billion aid 
package for Panama, with plans to send the measure to the President for his 
signature as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
In separate actions, the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations 
committees approved identical proposals providing $500 million to help rebuild 
public works and $42 million in emergency "humanitarian" aid. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration said it would submit legislation later this month for 
another $500 million worth of medium-term loan guarantees and trade benefits 
for Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The prompt action Tuesday confirmed that Congress is ready and willing to speed 
enactment of the aid package without excessive partisan wrangling over content 
or which party ought to receive the credit. The full House is to take up the 
aid measure today. The Senate will act later this week. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the House panel Tuesday, Bernard Aronson, assistant 
secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said: "Risking doing too little, 
too late far outweighs the risk of acting too generously and too hurriedly." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed $42 million in humanitarian aid would help people whose homes or 
businesses were damaged during the pre-Christmas invasion by U.S. forces and 
the looting that followed. 
</P>
<P>
The $500 million will finance major public works projects designed to create 
jobs and rebuild roads and will inject new cash into Panama's once-flourishing 
banking system, which was strangled by economic sanctions imposed by the United 
States in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
About $125 million will be used to help bring Panama up to date in its payments 
to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, a prerequisite to 
the country's obtaining further loans from those institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The $500 million worth of medium-term help that the Administration will request 
later ranges from restoration of duty-free status for Panamanian exports to 
revival of Panama's allocation under the U.S. sugar-import program. 
</P>
<P>
One possible snag in speeding the aid package through Congress is the growing 
dispute over Panama's refusal to revamp its banking laws to prevent the 
laundering of drug money. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said that much of the reason that Panama flourished as an 
international banking center before 1988 was that a large part of its banking 
business came from drug barons. The country historically has had protective 
banking secrecy laws.

NORTH SAYS HEARING MADE FAIR TRIAL IMPOSSIBLE; 
</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA: HE SEEKS REVERSAL OF CONVICTION. HIS ATTORNEY MAINTAINS THAT 
EARLIER TESTIMONY WAS A "COMPELLED CONFESSION." 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer for Oliver L. North urged a federal appeals court Tuesday to overturn 
his Iran-Contra conviction on grounds that the former Marine's televised 
testimony to a congressional committee amounted to a "compelled confession" 
that destroyed his hope for a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Barry Simon said the judge who presided over North's trial last year 
failed to make sure that the 1987 congressional hearings did not influence 
either jurors or witnesses in the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
Simon also said U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell should have permitted 
North to call former President Ronald Reagan as a defense witness. 
</P>
<P>
Two members of the three-judge panel of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Laurence 
Silberman and David Sentelle, questioned prosecutors closely about why Reagan 
was not put on the stand. Silberman said he is convinced that Reagan's 
knowledge of North's case was such that he would have been compelled to testify 
had he not been President. 
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of basic fairness," the defense should at least have been given 
the written answers that Reagan submitted to the Iran-Contra grand jury in 
response to its questions, said Silberman, who was appointed to the court by 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Sentelle, also a Reagan appointee, suggested that the former President lost his 
right to claim executive privilege because he provided the written answers and 
also gave information about the Iran-Contra affair to the Tower Commission and 
the independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that if you have waived privilege and answered questions, you 
can't come back and claim it . . . ," Sentelle said. "If you waive it, it's 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell ruled that Reagan's testimony was not relevant to North's defense 
because the two men never were alone together and, therefore, others could 
provide any information that the defense might have gotten from the former 
President. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell's refusal to require Reagan to testify contrasts with Judge Harold H. 
Greene's ruling on Monday that the former President must give videotaped 
testimony in the trial, scheduled to begin Feb. 20, of former White House 
National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter. But Greene said Poindexter 
reported directly to Reagan and North did not. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing ran more than an hour beyond its scheduled 90 minutes because the 
members of the panel -- Chief Judge Patricia Wald, Silberman and Sentelle -- 
peppered Simon and Gerard Lynch, who argued the prosecution's case, with 
questions. The jurists, who frequently appeared skeptical of both sides, gave 
no hint of their ultimate ruling. 
</P>
<P>
A written opinion will be issued later. That decision may be appealed to the 
full circuit court and ultimately to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
North was convicted last May 4 on three felonies -- altering and destroying 
official documents, accepting an illegal gratuity, and aiding and abetting in 
the obstruction of Congress. All charges arose from the Reagan Administration's 
secret arms sales to Nicaragua and the diversion of some of the proceeds to 
anti-government rebels in Nicaragua. The former National Security Council staff 
member and his wife, Betsy, listened to the appellate hearing but took no part 
in the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
North spent six days on Capitol Hill giving sworn testimony under a law that 
permits congressional committees to compel a person to reveal incriminating 
evidence despite Fifth Amendment rights by granting an immunity that is 
supposed to guarantee that the testimony will not be used against the person in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of the prospective jurors in the North case were rejected because 
they admitted that the hearings had influenced them. But Simon maintained that 
most of the others were also affected, even if they did not realize it. 
</P>
<P>
"Jurors who heard a compelled confession -- which is what immunized testimony 
is -- cannot put that out of their minds," Simon said. He added that witnesses 
in North's criminal trial may have been influenced by the congressional 
hearings. The only way to find out, he said, would have been for Gesell to 
conduct a "line-by-line" review of the testimony during a post-trial hearing, 
which the judge refused to do. 
</P>
<P>
"That would take months and months," Judge Wald said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon agreed that the procedure would be time consuming but maintained that 
nothing less would protect North's Fifth Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said North's claim that the congressional testimony tainted the entire 
criminal proceeding "has a surface appeal, but it goes far beyond what is 
required by law." The former Columbia University law professor was recently 
named to head the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York 
and argued the case for Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said Gesell was careful to ensure that the congressional testimony had no 
impact on the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Simon devoted very little of his oral presentation to his contention that North 
should have been allowed to subpoena Reagan as a witness. But the issue clearly 
interested the judges. The court may have to face it again if Reagan appeals 
Judge Greene's order to give videotaped testimony in the Poindexter case. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch agreed that Reagan "is treated somewhat differently because he (was) the 
President." But, he said, the written answers were so general that they would 
have been of little help to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's lawyers have not specifically invoked the doctrine of executive 
privilege, although they have claimed that the former President is protected by 
the Constitution from being forced either to testify or to turn over papers. 
</P>
<P>
In defending the trial judge's decision to bar Reagan's testimony, Lynch said 
the evidence would have been irrelevant. Therefore, he said, there was no need 
to decide whether executive privilege would apply. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not talking about executive privilege," Lynch said. "I'm talking about the 
relevance of the testimony." 
</P>
<P>
But Silberman maintained that if North had been a State Department official, 
the secretary of state would surely have been summoned to testify. He said 
Reagan's testimony might have helped North prove that he thought his actions 
were authorized and, therefore, not illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch responded that North had never claimed that he received authorization 
directly from the President but had, instead, inferred the authorization from 
what he was told by Poindexter and former National Security Adviser Robert 
McFarlane.

GEN. POWELL GIVES PRIORITY TO FUNDS FOR STEALTH BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A key congressional Democrat, exploring how deeply strategic weapons can be cut 
without losing Pentagon support for arms control talks, was told Tuesday that 
canceling the B-2 Stealth bomber could be fatal but that eliminating the 
Midgetman missile probably would not. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing on President Bush's defense budget, House Armed Services Committee 
Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) probed the Administration's tolerance for strategic 
weapons cuts in a lively exchange with Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion presaged what is expected to be one of the hottest budget 
battles on Capitol Hill this year in the midst of massive change in Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Powell testified that ending production of the radar-evading B-2 would cause 
the chiefs of the military services to "make a very careful reassessment" of 
the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) being negotiated by the United 
States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the chiefs had supported START talks in part because the B-2 
could be used to take advantage of proposed rules for counting nuclear warheads 
under consideration in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
When Aspin asked if Congress had to fund all 132 planned B-2s for the chiefs to 
continue endorsing START, Powell said he would have to check that. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin, suggesting how far he might be willing to go beyond the 13 planes 
already in the pipeline, rejoined: "Try 30." 
</P>
<P>
"All right, sir," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin also asked Powell what the military chiefs would do on START if Congress 
killed the truck-borne Midgetman strategic missile but retained the rail-mobile 
MX. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Administration has requested funds for both long-range weapons in 
its fiscal 1991 budget, Powell said the chiefs probably could live with only 
the MX. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing Powell and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Aspin asserted that 
"change is outracing both our government's arms control proposals and the 
defense budget you have put before us. 
</P>
<P>
"There are new realities in the world but no new thinking at home to match 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Aspin and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), who spoke separately with 
reporters, predicted that the House would substantially cut President Bush's 
$295.1-billion defense request, especially proposed spending on strategic 
weapons and troop levels in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Foley called recommendations for heavy increases in spending for the MX, 
Midgetman and the "Star Wars" anti-missile program "highly questionable in 
today's environment." 
</P>
<P>
At the House hearing, Aspin led a parade of Democrats and Republicans sharply 
challenging Cheney's proposal to close 43 military bases -- including 10 in 
California -- and to consolidate or realign scores of others. 
</P>
<P>
In the roughest treatment dealt Cheney all day, Aspin questioned his former 
House colleague's reputation as a "smooth operator" and warned: "You've got to 
play this thing a little less confrontational if you want this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The committee chairman said Cheney should have done what his predecessor, Frank 
C. Carlucci, did in moving to close bases two years ago: propose having a 
bipartisan commission develop the list. Congress eventually approved the 
closing of 86 bases. 
</P>
<P>
Aspin suggested that Cheney wants to use his new hit list as a political club 
to intimidate lawmakers, especially Democrats, who seek to cut Bush's defense 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Although some bases need to be closed, Aspin said, the Administration must 
accept creation of a commission to oversee the process. That is the only way 
Congress will pass legislation sought by the Administration to clear judicial 
obstacles blocking base closings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, responding that he was open to the commission idea, denied that his 
list was politically motivated. Aspin challenged that claim. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheney," he said brightly but with an edge to his voice, "you remind me of 
Claude Rains in 'Casablanca.' Cheney is shocked -- shocked! -- to discover that 
there is politics going on in this town." 
</P>
<P>
"No, that's high praise, Mr. Chairman," Cheney responded, laughing, "high 
praise, indeed."

U.S. SHIFTING ITS MILITARY FOCUS IN PERSIAN GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. military planners have been told to create a new policy for the Persian 
Gulf emphasizing defense of friendly Arab states instead of Iran's 
vulnerability to a Soviet attack. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of a Soviet thrust into Iran to seize oil fields and gulf ports long 
has dictated U.S. strategy and troop deployments in the region, but the Soviet 
Union's preoccupation with internal economic problems and regional ethnic 
disputes has made a potential Iranian offensive far less likely, defense 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The policy shift is contained in the latest Defense Planning Guidance, a 
biennial classified policy document issued by the secretary of defense to help 
the military services as they draw up their budgets for the coming five years. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from a significantly relaxed assessment of the Soviet and Warsaw Pact 
threat to Western Europe, the document offers few surprises and little specific 
guidance to help military officers carry out their long-range planning. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Pentagon official involved in preparing the recently completed report 
says its guidance is likely to be rendered obsolete within months by 
international events and other studies now under way at the Pentagon. The 
official briefed a small group of reporters on the condition that he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The document reflects the difficulty of strategic planning in an era of 
dizzying change. In years past, the report has been much longer than this 
year's 28-page version and has offered highly specific advice to the services. 
</P>
<P>
"A document that's five or six minutes old is out of date these days," a 
military officer familiar with the latest guidance said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior defense officials are conducting extensive studies to determine 
appropriate U.S. military policy in the Far East, the Persian Gulf and Europe 
after an anticipated conventional force reduction agreement is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Additional reviews are under way of technology and its effect on national 
security policy, on the "Star Wars" space defense system and on four costly 
aircraft development programs. 
</P>
<P>
The results of those studies, due in the next few months, are likely to cause 
"major revisions" to the just-issued guidance, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a senior Pentagon policy-maker said "Star Wars" is being 
fundamentally reassessed and "might be restructured" as a result of the current 
review. 
</P>
<P>
The guidance notes that the United States is likely to lose some or all of its 
bases in the Philippines in coming years and orders the services to plan other 
ways to defend U.S. interests in the Pacific. It also says that Japan and 
Korea, although important U.S. allies, must bear a higher share of the cost of 
their defense.

PLO ASKS GORBACHEV TO HALT JEWISH EMIGRATION

The PLO's parliament in exile sent a memorandum to Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev on Tuesday, urging him to halt the emigration of Soviet Jews to the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"In the name of human rights, we appeal to you to take speedy measures to stop 
the emigration of Soviet Jews, which represents . . . Jewish raids on our land 
and homeland," the Palestine National Council said in a five-page memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
The PNC, considered to be the legislative arm and governing body of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, was the latest in a series of Arab 
organizations to express concern over increasing Soviet Jewish emigration to 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 40,000 to 100,000 Soviet Jews are expected to go to Israel during 
the next year because of a loosening of emigration requirements by Moscow and a 
decision by Washington to restrict the number of Soviet Jews moving to the 
United States.

FEINSTEIN AND VAN DE KAMP TO DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein Tuesday challenged Atty. Gen. John 
K. Van de Kamp, her opponent in the Democratic governor's race, to six separate 
debates before the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there are differences in our positions on critical issues . . . and it 
is my hope that the campaign for governor can transcend the buzzwords and 
whispered innuendo that have become too much a part of the political process," 
Feinstein said in Fresno and San Diego during the second day of a two-day tour 
of California to formally announce her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein gave reporters copies of two letters, one of them to Van de Kamp 
seeking the debates and the other to state Democratic Chairman Edmund G. Brown 
Jr. asking him to help set up a debate schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Among the issues Feinstein said she would like to debate are the environment, 
education, health care, crime and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's campaign manager, Richie Ross, said Tuesday: "We absolutely 
accept and we would suggest that . . . we debate those issues where we 
disagree. Have you seen her list? She calls for a debate on senior citizens. 
Everybody's for it. They're both Democrats and there is not going to be a 
difference. The debates instead become little candidate forums."

FOR SALE: A SIGN OF THE TIMES FOR SOCKERS?; 
</P>
<P>
PROFESSIONAL SOCCER: OWNING THE SOCKERS HAD BEEN FUN FOR RON FOWLER, UNTIL 
ATTENDANCE AND ADVERTISING PROBLEMS TURNED THE FUN INTO A BURDEN, GIVING RISE 
TO THOUGHTS OF UNLOADING THE TEAM.

<P>
Ron Fowler, the Sockers' owner since October of 1987, said Tuesday he will 
consider selling the Major Indoor Soccer League team at the end of the season 
if attendance and advertising revenue don't increase. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a fair assesment," Fowler said. "You can only have so much fun 
for so long. It's become a burden this year." 
</P>
<P>
Attendance this season is actually 6.5% higher than at this point last year, 
but Fowler said advertising revenue is 40% below preseason projections. 
</P>
<P>
Total attendance for 14 games is 115,076, an average of 8,220. Last season, the 
Sockers drew 108,008 during the first 14 games, an average of 7,715, on the way 
to an average of 8,383 for 24 regular-season home games. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler had been looking for increases over last year of 10% in attendance and 
20% in advertising revenue. He said another factor as he considers a possible 
sale will be the stability of other MISL franchises and the possibility for 
expansion and revenue from league promotions. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we learned the hard way last year is that you're as weak or 
strong as your weakest link," Fowler said. "And some of the other franchises in 
terms of lack of attendance in the playoffs and lack of professionalism in the 
front office really created some problems. The commissioner (Earl Foreman) has 
been working very diligently to bring the standards for the league up." 
</P>
<P>
Even if attendance and advertising revenue increase, Fowler said he likely will 
attempt to sell 50% of the team after this season. He is currently its sole 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
"If I see some positive indicators, I will probably look at maintaining the 
managing general parter level . . . and bring in partners," Fowler said. "If I 
don't, I would probably consider selling the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to have a broader-based ownership for this team. However, I'm not 
going to have broader-based ownership unless I think the economics are right, 
because some of the people I'd be looking to bring in are friends as well as 
business associates." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, owner of Liquid Investments, Inc. -- parent company to Mesa 
Distributing, which distributes Miller Brewing Co. products to San Diego -- 
took control of the Sockers after Bob Bell, the managing general partner for 
nearly 10 years, resigned in October 1987. Ron Cady, a longtime friend and 
business associate, was appointed president, and both immediately began 
reorganizing the budget. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cady, 30% of travel costs and approximately 35% of administrative 
staff costs were cut after he and Fowler took over in 1987. In addition, player 
salaries were cut by about 33% after the Sockers filed for Chapter 11 under 
federal bankruptcy law in April 1988. That coincided with a league-wide crisis 
that led to a salary cap of $875,000 per team, a $400,000 reduction. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers, which had lost about $2 million during Bell's final season as 
owner, also eliminated many cash expenditures and began trading promotional 
considerations for services. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we spent a lot of money," said Randy Bernstein, the Sockers' vice 
president for the past five seasons. "I think one of the things Ron Cady and 
Ron Fowler have done is put their thumbs on the expenditures. They definitely 
want to know every dollar that goes out." 
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1987 under Bell, the Sockers lost a total of $9 million. In 1980, 
he owned 95% of the team, but because of debts incurred during seven outdoor 
seasons, he brought limited partners in for 1984. By 1985, his share of 
ownership was 17.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cuts that began in 1987, Fowler said the Sockers lost $1.5 million 
in 1987-88 and $1 million last season, spending $3.5 million while taking in 
$2.5 million in gate receipts and advertising revenue. This season, Fowler 
projects losses of between $400,000 and $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
Finances aren't the only obstacles. The Sockers (12-15), currently in last 
place in the Western Division, are off to the worst start in their history. And 
there have been strained relations on the team, particularly between veteran 
forward Steve Zungul and Coach Ron Newman. 
</P>
<P>
"The frustration for us this year has been the product on the field," Fowler 
said. "If we were winning, our attendance would be stronger than it is." 
</P>
<P>
Among reasons the franchise's financial situation might be expected to improve: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sockers will benefit from the Feb. 21 MISL All-Star Game at the San 
Diego Sports Arena, which Fowler expects will net the team "close to six 
figures." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sockers are no longer offering two-for-one ticket promotions, meaning 
they are bringing in more money per ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Under Bernstein's direction, there are now more than 20,000 participants in 
the Sockers' youth program, which offers ticket discounts and opportunities to 
meet players to members between the ages of five and 19. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Home games have been redesigned to offer more attractive halftime shows, 
including Frisbee and rugby demonstrations and ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sockers, Cady said, do more player appearances than any other 
professional team in town. According to Holli Traeumer, the Sockers' director 
of promotions and public relations, players do an average of three to four 
appearances each month. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In January, the MISL signed a nine-game contract with ESPN that will give 
the league much-needed exposure, although the games will be tape-delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two weeks ago, the team introduced an eight-game ticket package designed to 
create a base for future season ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Sockers are dealing with a continuing struggle to educate people 
about a sport that has never been consistently popular with U.S. spectators. 
Socker marketing surveys indicate only 10% of San Diegans have ever been to an 
indoor soccer game. Cady said that while most of the people polled have heard 
of the Sockers, many say they have no reason to want to go to a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're still fighting a syndrome in people in their 30s on up that 
didn't grow up with the game of soccer," Cady said. "It's not an American 
sport. It's sort of an international sport." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler would like to change the ownership structure to include more people in 
the hope that it would assist marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was feasible to have a thousand owners of the soccer team at relatively 
small amounts of money, that's what I'd like to see," Fowler said. "But 
administratively, it becomes a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Fowler has learned that selling indoor soccer is different than 
selling beer. 
</P>
<P>
"From a business standpoint," he said, "it's been an unmitigated disaster."

STATWATCH: HIGA READIES FOR ASSAULT ON 1,500TH POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forward Gabe Higa, the most prolific scorer in Quartz Hill High history, raised 
his career scoring total to 1,422 points Tuesday night by scoring 18 against 
Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Higa, a four-year varsity player who is averaging 23 points a game this season, 
conceivably could reach the 1,500-point plateau before season's end. 
</P>
<P>
Easier said than done, however. Only one game remains on Quartz Hill's league 
schedule so Higa, who has signed to attend UC Irvine in the fall, will need to 
post big numbers against playoff opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see him get 1,500," Coach Don Moore said. "If we can find a 
pigeon, I'm certainly going to let him score." 
</P>
<P>
Free throws: Chris Loll of Thousand Oaks has made 70 of 87 free throws (80.5%), 
including 20 of 22 in three victories last week. . . . Moorpark's Brian Lester 
had a streak of 25 successful free throws snapped against Bishop Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Records: Camarillo's David Harbour hit a three-point basket in the third 
quarter at Simi Valley on Friday, giving him 626 points and surpassing Gil 
Banales' single-season record of 624. . . . With 42 points against Burbank, 
Hart's Micah Ohlman eclipsed Steve Valenzuela's school record of 37. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting: Although it beat Pasadena, 60-59, in double overtime last week, 
Crescenta Valley missed 17 of its first 18 shots from the field.

THE 'TALKING' AT MCEG IS NOW ABOUT WHAT'S NEXT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With an impressive $127 million in box office grosses, the sleeper hit movie 
"Look Who's Talking" has helped a little-known independent film company in more 
ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
The film proved that Management Co. Entertainment Group, the movie's producer, 
was capable of more than art-house fare. It resuscitated the career of John 
Travolta, a key MCEG client and the film's star. 
</P>
<P>
And it established the credibility of MCEG's chief executive, a flamboyant 
young lawyer named Jonathan D. Krane, who arranged the production deal with the 
film's owner-distributor, Tri-Star Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
For MCEG, now comes the hard part. 
</P>
<P>
Four months after the success that put it on the map, the Santa Monica concern 
is looking for follow-up hits, hustling to refinance a pile of debt and trying 
to quiet persistent industry talk that with rapid growth has come internal 
dissension and disarray. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a critical time for them," says Dennis McAlpine, analyst with the 
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. investment bank in New York. "They've got a hit behind 
them, and a lot of questions ahead." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, MCEG's story illustrates the predicament now faced by most 
independent movie companies. After booming growth through much of the 1980s, 
Hollywood's smaller film production and distribution companies have been forced 
to make a crash adjustment to a world where financing is hard to come by and 
the major studios have increased their financial muscle and reach. 
</P>
<P>
Krane's efforts to put together the company also illustrate the irresistible 
lure many feel for building a small film company, against lengthening odds. 
</P>
<P>
Krane, 37, has expanded MCEG in seven years from a tiny talent management 
agency to a diversified concern with production, distribution and finance arms 
and with revenue that may approach $200 million this year. His most ambitious 
step was last July's $83-million acquisition of a much larger foreign 
distribution company, Virgin Vision, from Richard Branson, the British 
entertainment and airline entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
As he has built the company, Krane, who graduated from Hollywood High at 15 and 
studied law at Yale, has earned a reputation as inspired, hard working, 
abrasive and domineering. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't easy making all this stuff happen," says Krane, who is married to 
actress Sally Kellerman. "I have to say 'no' to a lot of people. . . . I'm sure 
at times I come off like a jerk." 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the appearance of disarray at MCEG has been the departure over 
the past several months of a series of top managers. Among them were Al Newman, 
marketing chief; Glen Shipley, chief financial officer; Michael Lauer, head of 
business affairs, and Beth Cannon, at one time head of the talent management 
operations. Last month, Charles Weber, who had been MCEG president for 10 
months, abruptly gave up the post to become a consultant to the company. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials describe the turnover as growing pains, brought on in part by 
its efforts to eliminate overlap after the acquisition of Virgin Vision. "We 
outgrew some people, and some people outgrew us," says Krane. 
</P>
<P>
Yet company officials also acknowledge that there is lingering bitterness among 
some who have left the company. "Some people have been spreading nasty things 
about Jonathan," says William J. Rouhana Jr., MCEG's vice chairman and 
co-founder. "Hollywood is a jealous place." 
</P>
<P>
MCEG faces a lawsuit from producer Simon Lewis, who contends that Krane fired 
him without cause as producer of "Look Who's Talking" during the filming of the 
movie. Lewis says Krane later slandered him by telling a reporter for the trade 
paper Daily Variety that Lewis was never the film's producer but only Krane's 
production assistant. Krane says the suit has no merit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people close to the company say the investment firm of Kidder, 
Peabody &amp; Co., which loaned $67 million to MCEG for the Virgin Vision 
acquisition and is also its investment banker, is keeping a watchful eye on the 
company. Kidder has been influential in a number of key moves recently, 
including the appointment and departure of key executives, these people say. 
</P>
<P>
Krane, the company's controlling shareholder, has been intimately involved in 
every aspect of the MCEG's operations, from talent management and casting to 
film editing, although he has recently relinquished some role in production. 
</P>
<P>
"Jonathan is the sun, and the rest of the company revolves around him," says a 
former insider. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a Los Angeles auto leasing executive, Krane founded MCEG in 1982 and 
worked as chief executive of Blake Edwards Entertainment from 1983 until 1987. 
He says he met Kellerman, who is 16 years his senior, at a group therapy 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Krane is known for a taste for expensive Italian clothing, Rolls-Royce sedans 
and books on advanced physics. He and Kellerman live in a home perched above 
Laurel Canyon that has drawn wide attention for an addition designed by the 
architect Frank O. Gehry. 
</P>
<P>
Krane's blueprint for the company was designed to help it avoid the pitfalls 
that have undone so many independents. MCEG's talent management, movie 
production, distribution and finance arms are supposed to support each other to 
increase their odds of success. 
</P>
<P>
The company's films, for example, sometimes provide work for MCEG-managed 
actors and directors. The distribution operations can help MCEG cover 
production costs through sales of the company's movies to theaters and 
television and for home video use. With the Virgin Vision acquisition, MCEG is 
betting that it can exploit growing overseas demand for lower-budget U.S. film 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
Krane is also trying to cultivate a reputation as the cheapest guy in 
Hollywood. He says MCEG plans to keep the production cost of its average film 
to about $3 million -- compared to about $18 million for the majors -- so the 
company doesn't risk too much on any single project. 
</P>
<P>
But will this master plan work only on paper, as some competitors contend? 
</P>
<P>
What the company can do in cutting costs, Krane says, was demonstrated in "Look 
Who's Talking," a comedy about a baby who speaks with an adult voice (provided 
by actor Bruce Willis). 
</P>
<P>
Krane struck a deal with Tri-Star Pictures based on his hunch that he could 
keep production costs to about half of the budgeted $14 million. He signed 
Travolta for about half his usual $4-million fee, shot the film in lower-cost 
Vancouver, Canada, and shortened the production schedule. Costs came in at 
about $8.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Heckerling, the film's director, gives MCEG a lot of credit for the 
picture's success. Tri-Star, the film's owner and distributor, had been moving 
without haste to shoot the picture and planned a limited regional release that 
didn't promise great profit. 
</P>
<P>
Five years after director Heckerling had written the script, three potential 
leading actresses had read it and "I was getting very depressed," Heckerling 
says. "It was a 'go' movie that wasn't going anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
"Look Who's Talking" was Hollywood's top box office money maker for five weeks 
last fall, and now there are plans for a sequel, a TV sitcom and perhaps a 
cartoon series. 
</P>
<P>
Still, MCEG's take may be rather modest. Of the $127 million gross, MCEG may 
net $10 million to $12 million, industry officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Any earnings MCEG does receive will come in handy, for the company isn't 
expected to report a profit until at least next year as it digests the Virgin 
Vision acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Kidder's loan for the acquisition was supposed to be repaid by last Dec. 15. 
Instead, the deadline was extended to March 30, and Kidder put up an additional 
$5 million in fresh loans. 
</P>
<P>
At a time of jitters in the credit markets, the delay stirred speculation that 
MCEG may have had trouble lining up lenders. Richard Intrader, the Kidder 
banker in charge of the deal, acknowledges that "the lending environment had 
changed between August and December." 
</P>
<P>
But Vice Chairman Rouhana insists that the company has had no trouble and will 
soon complete the refinancing with bank loans, commercial paper and funds from 
possible deals he won't discuss. "We're in the middle of doing a number of 
things," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Rouhana boasts that within six months the company will cut its $131-million 
debt burden to 50% of capital from its current heavy 85%. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Dixon, a Kidder securities analyst and MCEG's biggest fan on Wall 
Street, claims that the Virgin Vision acquisition will make MCEG the 
third-largest overseas distributor of English language films, hedging the risk 
of MCEG's movie-production ventures. "This company is superbly positioned," he 
raves. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market seems less enthusiastic. MCEG's stock, trading at $4.125 a 
share during the peak of the success of "Look Who's Talking," has since 
slumped, closing Tuesday at a bid price of $2.0625 a share, off 6.25 cents, in 
over-the-counter trading. MCEG lost $11 million on revenue of $31 million for 
the six months ended last Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
In March, MCEG expects to release two films: "Chains of Gold," an action story 
about a social worker fighting New York drug lords, which stars Travolta, and 
"Boris and Natasha," a film based on the two Russian spies in the old Rocky and 
Bullwinkle cartoons that stars Kellerman and Dave Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Krane says the company may soon break with past practice by working out a 
so-called "rent-a-major" deal with a major studio or an independent movie 
company for domestic theatrical distribution of its films. Such deals reduce 
the risks for producers but also can limit their money-making potential, since 
distributors typically claim 15% to 30% of box office rentals. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MCEG is a company in flux. The concern has scaled back its talent 
management division, laying off 25 employees just before Christmas as part of 
what Krane says is a new strategy of relying on fewer but higher-producing 
talent managers. "Managers whose client base didn't excel left the company," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Observers are watching to see how smoothly MCEG will refinance the debt. 
Further down the road, a key question is whether MCEG will be able to produce 
or acquire, and then market, the two dozen pictures a year that Virgin Vision 
will need to remain a player in distribution. 
</P>
<P>
What the company really could use right now, outsiders say, is another hit. 
Company officials insist that's not necessary. "This company isn't dependent on 
any single film," Rouhana says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MCEG AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
A diversified entertainment concern, Santa Monica-based Management Co. 
Entertainment Group manages talent and produces, distributes and finances 
movies. The company lost $2.5 million on revenue of $34 million for the fiscal 
year ended March 31, 1989; for the six months ended Sept. 30, it lost $10.9 
million on revenue of $31.1 million. In August, MCEG acquired Virgin Vision, a 
British-based distributor with revenues of $148 million for the fiscal year 
ended July 31, 1989.

4 FED PRESIDENTS BACK MOVE FOR ZERO INFLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four Federal Reserve Bank presidents told Congress on Tuesday that the current 
rate of inflation is too high and voiced strong support for a bill that 
supports the central bank's efforts to attain zero inflation. 
</P>
<P>
They said the benefit would outweigh the short-term economic pain that such a 
move would produce. 
</P>
<P>
"Inflation may well re-accelerate in the absence of a clear signal to the 
public that Congress fully supports the Federal Reserve Board's commitment to 
lower inflation," said Robert P. Black, president of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Black and the three other presidents endorsed a resolution proposed by Rep. 
Stephen L. Neal (D-N.C.), chairman of the House Banking monetary policy 
subcommittee. If passed by Congress, it would not legally mandate the Fed to 
reduce inflation to zero over the five-year period mentioned in the 
legislation. Rather, the Fed would be encouraged to aim for zero inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution is also supported by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan, who along with other monetary policy-makers is being pressured by 
the Bush Administration to stimulate economic growth through lower interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
But White House economic adviser Michael J. Boskin said at a news conference 
Tuesday that he did not favor the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that it makes sense for Congress to try to micro-manage the 
Federal Reserve," said Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's monetary policy is set mainly by the Federal Open Market 
Committee, which is composed of the seven-member Federal Reserve Board in 
Washington and the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. 
</P>
<P>
The bank presidents told Neal's subcommittee that the open market committee was 
committed to an anti-inflationary policy but said it would be bolstered by a 
clear vote of support from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Robert T. Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said 
work done by his staff indicates that a recession is not necessary to bring 
inflation down to zero by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
But the unemployment rate, now at 5.3%, could rise to between 6.75% and 7.75%, 
he said. At the same time, growth, as measured by the gross national product, 
would have to be 1 to 2 percentage points slower than the 2.5% to 3% growth 
that the bank presidents said was the fastest achievable without accelerating 
inflation.

Hallmark to Buy Back Network Debt: Hallmark Cards Inc. began an offer to buy 
back at a discount some $270 million in debt securities used to finance 
Univision Holdings Inc. under a plan to ease the debt burden on the 
unprofitable Spanish-language broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
The action by Kansas City, Mo.-based Hallmark, which owns a 63.5% stake in 
Univision, followed Univision's failure to make $10 million in interest 
payments due last week on some of the debt. Univision, the nation's largest 
Spanish-language communications company, said it missed the payments because of 
insufficient cash flow.

Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline company, said Tuesday that it 
lost $362.8 million in the fourth quarter of 1989 as subsidiaries Eastern 
Airlines and Continental Airlines both posted losses. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air's deficit was widened from a net loss of $224.4 million in the fourth 
quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The latest quarterly loss pushed Texas Air's loss for 1989 to $885.6 million -- 
a record high for the U.S. airline industry. That compared to its 1988 loss of 
$718.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter revenue fell to $1.7 billion from $2 billion. For the full year, 
Texas Air's revenue was $6.7 billion, down from $8.6 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The October-December figures include a $56.1-million net loss for Houston-based 
Continental, narrowed from a $99.2-million loss in fourth quarter 1988. 
Continental's fourth-quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For the year, Continental turned a $3.1-million profit, reversing a 
$315.5-million loss for 1988. Full-year revenue was $5.1 billion, up from $4.7 
billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with Continental's strong improvement in profitability in 
1989," Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo said in a statement. "In addition, 
given the significantly negative factors affecting all airlines in the fourth 
quarter, Continental stands out as the only major carrier showing marked 
improvement in year-over-year fourth-quarter results." 
</P>
<P>
Continental's figures included one-time net gains of $81.2 million from asset 
sales and $10.6 million in retired debt. 
</P>
<P>
Miami-based Eastern, which is reorganizing under federal bankruptcy court 
supervision, showed a fourth-quarter net loss of $282.6 million on revenue of 
$482.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 1988, Eastern lost $101.7 million on 
revenue of $844.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1989, Eastern lost $852.3 million on revenue of $1.5 billion, 
compared to a 1988 loss of $335.4 million on revenue of $3.8 billion.

TREASURY AUCTION IS OFF TO A GOOD START

Investors gave a hearty reception to the $10 billion of three-year notes the 
U.S. Treasury auctioned Tuesday, starting the first-quarter refunding on firm 
footing, analysts and dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
But most stopped short of predicting a strong outcome for the rest of the 
government bond sale, meant to raise $30 billion in new money to cover the 
government's borrowing needs. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the $10 billion each of 10- and 30-year issues that will be sold 
today and Thursday may not find such eager buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The average yield was 8.43%, up from 7.77% at the last auction on Nov. 9, 1989. 
It was the highest rate since three-year notes averaged 9.12% on May 9, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"The easy part of the refunding is over. We still have the tough part to bid 
on," one trader said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese dealers and investors bought 30% to 35% of the $10 billion of 
three-year notes auctioned Tuesday, slightly more than the usual 25% to 30%, 
Japanese dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
But the same Japanese dealers said they took the less risky three-year notes 
instead of 10-year notes simply because of their responsibility as primary 
dealers.

First Union National Bank on Tuesday stopped distributing copies of a 
newsletter that referred to Germans as "Huns" and Japanese as "Nips" in an 
article satirizing fears of foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
The bank also issued apologies about the article appearing in the Feb. 1 
edition of the newsletter, which the bank said already had been mailed to about 
600 of its customers, after it received media calls asking about the piece. 
</P>
<P>
William R. Hackney III, First Union's chief investment officer and the author 
of the article, referred questions to the bank's public relations staff. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to satirize American economic weaknesses, and he deeply regrets 
his choice of words," said First Union spokesman Jeep Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a request for a copy of the newsletter, Bryant said the bank was 
"embarrassed by its content . . . so we've stopped distributing it."

Question: There have been a lot of negative comments about advertising, but one 
of the positive things about it is that it has encouraged my children to ask 
for specific foods that I believe are good for them. For example, they will ask 
for a certain brand of cereaL that I suppose is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't that positive? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I would much rather have children learn about the factors that make a 
food nutritious, rather than have them learn a brand name. The most popular 
brand of cereal, which may be the brand most heavily advertised, is not 
necessarily the most nutritious. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, while some children may learn about cereals through advertising, 
others may become as familiar with the brand names of candy, cookies, and 
potato chips. I don't think we can rely on advertising to educate our children 
about nutrition; the primary responsibility is still the parents'.

STATE TO TAKE A TAX BITE FROM SCHOOL FUND-RAISERS 
</P>

Hundreds of school organizations that peddle everything from football buttons 
to hot dogs as a way to earn money for school activities are facing for the 
first time the same burden as most business people -- sharing the take with the 
tax man. 
</P>
<P>
The new tax bite comes as a result of a recent State Board of Equalization 
ruling that a high school wrestling team in Monterey has to pay a sales tax on 
thousands of dollars it made selling fried calamari. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 decision sets a precedent that places new responsibilities on school 
organizations to either collect a sales tax on certain items they sell or 
obtain a tax exemption from the Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
Discovered and later billed by tax authorities conducting a routine check at a 
local fair, the Monterey High School wrestling team balked at paying up. The 
team claimed that, as a nonprofit high school organization, it was entitled to 
a tax exemption and did not owe $1,000 in sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But, acting on the advice of its lawyers, the board majority ruled last month 
that either on purpose or by accident the Legislature had repealed automatic 
tax exemptions for school organizations in the mid-1980s. At that time, staff 
attorney Ron Dick said, lawmakers replaced a law giving school organizations 
blanket exemptions with a new measure that specifically named those 
organizations that would not be required to pay the tax. 
</P>
<P>
He reasoned that any groups -- such as school athletic teams -- that were not 
named in the law would not be entitled to an automatic exemption. 
</P>
<P>
On the list of exempted organizations were the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Cub 
Scouts, YMCA, YWCA, Future Farmers of America, Future Homemakers of America, 
4-H Clubs, Special Olympics, Little League, Bobby Sox, Campfire Inc., Future 
Business Leaders of America, Distributive Education Clubs of America, 
Vocational Industrial Clubs of America, Collegiate Young Farmers, America Youth 
Soccer Organization, California Youth Soccer Assn. and Pop Warner Football. 
</P>
<P>
Any other youth organization, Dick said, would have to apply to the board for 
exemption before they sold taxable goods. The board would then have to decide 
on a case by case basis whether the exemption was justified. 
</P>
<P>
Two board members -- Controller Gray Davis and Chairman Conway Collis -- 
disagreed with the staff lawyer's interpretation, insisting that the 
Legislature never intended to make schoolchildren wend their way through the 
state's complicated tax laws. They argued, without success, that by passing the 
new law, legislators meant only to expand earlier exemptions and not to replace 
them. Davis and Collis cast the two dissenting votes when the Board of 
Equalization voted to turn down the appeal by the Monterey wrestling team. 
</P>
<P>
"Raising money for athletics is as American as apple pie and here we're 
requiring them to go through bureaucratic hoops," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't believe the Legislature intended this result. Next they'll be 
taxing little 6-year-olds selling lemonade outside their home." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Peterson, superintendent of schools in Orange County, predicted that 
imposing taxes on school organizations would become a politically volatile 
issue that would force lawmakers to pass legislation to stop it. He also 
denounced the ruling by the Board of Equalization as a waste of taxpayer 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the amount of money that's involved here is not equal to (the cost of 
paying) the number of new employees you'd have to have to enforce it, so it's a 
lose-lose situation," Peterson said. "It would just give us a bigger 
bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the ruling now will force school organizations to familiarize 
themselves with tax laws that are complicated enough to give a Philadelphia 
lawyer a headache. 
</P>
<P>
In order for a school organization to know whether, for example, its food sale 
items are taxable, it will have to delve into narrowly drawn laws governing its 
temperature. In this case, hot prepared food is taxable; cold food generally is 
not. So if the organization sells a hot fried ham sandwich on toast it is 
subject to tax, but a cold tuna on toast is not. 
</P>
<P>
Because candy manufacturers have been influential with the Legislature, candy 
proceeds are usually not taxable. Neither are baked goods. But when candy, 
baked goods or other food items are sold within a place where admission is 
charged -- such as a dance, a football game or a fair -- it is subject to the 
tax. Restaurants operate under a different set of tax rules. 
</P>
<P>
As a practical matter, Collis said, most organizations will have no way of 
knowing either when something is taxable or how to obtain an exemption. Davis 
said it is apparent that school groups don't know about the law because state 
records show none of them have ever applied for an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
And while the exemptions are expected to be granted almost automatically to 
school groups, both Collis and Davis said it will take weeks, if not months, 
for the requests to work their way through the bureaucracy to the board. 
</P>
<P>
"To make groups go through the bureaucratic rigamarole of applying for an 
exemption is just making it that more difficult for them to operate. These 
programs are for school kids; they are not a business. These resources should 
go into teaching kids and not be bogged down in the tax bureaucracy," said 
Collis. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Grant, the Monterey High School wrestling coach who was the first to get 
hit with the special tax, said the Board of Equalization's decision is 
particularly burdensome for high school sports programs which increasingly have 
had to resort to fund raising to make up for cuts in athletic budgets. When he 
took the coaching job at Monterey High 12 years ago, Grant said, his budget was 
$12,000. Last year it was under $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
What was once an occasional activity has become a way of life for coaches, he 
said. And what were once modest ventures such as car washes and bake sales have 
become more elaborate as the financial needs of team sports become more 
critical. Monterey wrestling team members and their parents spend nine days 
each summer selling calamari at the Monterey County Fair and net nearly 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every coach in the United States has to do this," Grant said. "You're a 
fund-raiser and a coach. It's sort of a necessary evil. I have so many friends 
who have dropped out of coaching because of the frustration of fund raising." 
</P>
<P>
And now with the tax burden added, he said, the job is even harder.

GOOD AS GOLD: Claiming a county organization larger than those in some states, 
Orange County's Republican Party is a potential gold mine for U.S. Sen. Pete 
Wilson -- if he can overcome some conservatives' hesitancy toward him (A3). . . 
. County party officials say Wilson's gubernatorial campaign should be able to 
raise more than the several hundred thousand dollars President Bush generated 
in Orange County in 1988. . . . Orange County's generosity for Republican 
candidates is so abundant that GOP candidates from other states hold 
fund-raisers here. Dana Parsons and Kristina Lindgren

TROUBLED KIDS: Juan Cardenas, 12, assigned to Juvenile Hall for accidentally 
shooting and killing a friend in the Mall of Orange last December, doesn't 
belong in the California Youth Authority with hardened offenders, county 
juvenile authorities said. . . . Only 2 to 3% of the county's youthful 
offenders go to a CYA institution. . . . The county's traditionally low 
commitment rate to CYA, Deputy D.A. John Conley said, is in part due to the 
variety of optional facilities not available in some other counties. Dana

</P>

MEDFLY: MALATHION FOES ENLIST A NEW ALLY -- THE HOMELESS -- WHO SAID THEY WERE 
NOT PREPARED FOR THE AERIAL SPRAYING AND WERE CAUGHT OUT IN THE OPEN.

<P>
Besieged by pleas from malathion-wary residents, a split Board of Supervisors 
on Tuesday refused to end a "state of emergency" over the Mediterranean fruit 
fly problem. But for the first time, the board voiced formal reservations about 
whether aerial spraying is the best way to combat the infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the board declined to oppose the state over the emotional Medfly issue, 
critics were enlisting the newest -- and perhaps unlikeliest -- citizen 
warriors in the malathion battle. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Legal Aid Society of Orange County took testimony in Garden 
Grove's Pioneer Park for three hours from a dozen homeless people who said they 
were caught unprepared by last month's spraying. The lawyers plan to file a 
lawsuit later this week to try to halt the applications until the state 
provides a shelter for perhaps hundreds of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
The sprayings "tore my stomach up and I got chills and nausea," said Gilbert 
Arndt, huddled in an alley while sharing a cigarette and a quart of beer with 
two friends. 
</P>
<P>
Arndt said he hopes that the depositions that he and other homeless people gave 
to Legal Aid lawyers, complaining of illnesses that ranged from nausea and 
vomiting to bad dreams, may help stop up to a dozen sprayings that are planned 
through summer in parts of nine cities around Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little strange, but we're not crazy," Arndt said. "In my opinion, what 
it boils down to is if enough people complain, they got to listen." 
</P>
<P>
So many people complained at Tuesday's packed Board of Supervisors' meeting 
that the board met through the lunch hour for an unusually long, five-hour 
session on the renewal of the county's Medfly state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, after hearing directly from state officials for the first time 
about their controversial efforts to thwart the fruit fly, three of the five 
supervisors told the malathion protesters that the county has no power to stop 
the state's Medfly assault. 
</P>
<P>
However negligible their practical power, the supervisors' formal stances on 
the controversial issue carry tremendous symbolic importance at a time of 
rising protests in Orange County over the potential health hazards posed by 
aerial applications of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that political reality, the supervisors agreed to qualify their 
emergency declaration with an amendment, saying that their vote "does not 
constitute an endorsement" of malathion spraying and urging the state to 
"aggressively pursue alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, bearing signs at the meeting that read "Stop Poisoning Us" and 
similar messages, had wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, more than 30 people from Orange County, as well as some from Los 
Angeles and Riverside counties, voiced their fears about the pesticide's 
toxicity and urged the county to take an active role in stopping its use over 
their homes in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-square-mile area of Brea, La Habra and Fullerton is to be sprayed on 
Feb. 12. A 36-square-mile area around Garden Grove and Westminster, home to 
many of the protesters at the board meeting, is scheduled for its second 
spraying on Feb. 15, pending the outcome of a hearing that day in Sacramento on 
a lawsuit brought by several local cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very, very frustrating to be told that we are voiceless . . . that we 
have a dictator sitting up in Sacramento," Marion Pack of Santa Ana told the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Like Pack, speakers voiced mistrust and frustration with the system of 
governing that has brought malathion into their back yards. Many said that, 
despite the state's assurances, they fear for the health of their children. A 
few said they already think that they have been bothered physically by the 
malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Near tears, Joan Magnuson of Riverside told officials about her chemically 
hypersensitive sister, who she said had to move out of Garden Grove because of 
the "life-threatening" reaction posed by the malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The malathion critics found allies in two of the five supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, an early malathion critic, questioned state 
officials sharply about the wisdom of the malathion spraying and again voted 
against the emergency declaration. 
</P>
<P>
He was joined this time by Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who had abstained two 
weeks ago when the declaration last came up for renewal. On Monday, she 
organized a delegation of city officials to Sacramento to voice their concerns 
about what they charge is the state's mishandling of the Medfly issue and its 
failure to allay public fears. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder suggested that the emergency declaration has taken on some tangible 
implications. She pointed to the comments of a Sacramento Superior Court judge 
last month when he referred to the county's emergency declaration as one factor 
in refusing to halt the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
But Board Chairman Don R. Roth and Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and Thomas F. 
Riley, citing a legal opinion by the county counsel, said they believe that the 
state can move ahead with its spray plans regardless of the county's position. 
</P>
<P>
By opposing the emergency declaration, they asserted, the county may only be 
opening itself up to legal liability from future lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said the county faced a "lose-lose proposition." In the end, Vasquez 
voted for the emergency declaration but offered an amendment that sought to 
distance the county from the state's actions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not advocating, we are not endorsing aerial spraying," Vasquez said in 
the amendment. "We prefer other alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
State agriculture officials at the meeting assured supervisors that they are 
pursuing nonspraying options and plan to establish a third plant in Hawaii to 
produce sterile Medflies. The sterile flies, in short supply, are used to try 
to breed the fruit fly population into extinction. They have not been available 
for use in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, state officials said they are confident that the aerial 
pesticide applications will do the job in safely protecting the state's 
$16-billion agriculture industry from Medfly infestation. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Food and Agriculture Director Henry Voss, who drew hisses 
from the anti-malathion crowd when he left the board meeting early to return to 
Sacramento, said: "The eradication effort is working. . . . We are finding 
fewer flies . . . (and) I am confident the infestation is under control." 
</P>
<P>
Voss added: "Allowing the Medfly to become a permanent resident of the state 
would be a disaster, economically and environmentally." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James Stratton, a medical epidemiologist with the state Department of 
Health Services, asserted that studies have borne out that the low malathion 
dosages used in sprayings "do not pose any risk to the public of a systemic 
poisoning." 
</P>
<P>
He did caution, however, that the possibility of the pesticide triggering 
allergic reactions is still "an open question." 
</P>
<P>
It is this type of physical reaction that malathion critics may cite in trying 
to halt the sprayings. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Legal Aid Society as part of its planned lawsuit on behalf 
of the homeless, Dr. Alan Broughton, a Santa Ana physician who said he 
specialized in pesticide exposure, reported: "The symptoms exhibited in (the 
homeless people's) declarations -- chills, headache, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, 
eye irritation and disorientation -- are symptoms consistent with malathion 
exposure." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the crowded Medfly arena, city councils in Anaheim, Laguna Niguel, 
Yorba Linda and Fullerton drew dozens of residents concerned about malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel and Fullerton put off any action on the issue, but Anaheim's City 
Council joined a growing list of North County cities that have urged the state 
to delay spraying because of health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim council also asked the Legislature to give local officials some 
control over pesticide policy. But despite earlier discussions, it postponed a 
decision on whether to join the cities of Huntington Beach, Garden Grove and 
Westminster in an ongoing lawsuit to try to halt the spraying.

DIANNE KLEIN: SUPERVISORS TURN ASIDE DOUBTS ABOUT MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Finally, it was her turn. But before Nettie Castle, a retired schoolteacher 
from Garden Grove, could tell the powers-that-be what she thinks of malathion 
spraying, Supervisor Don R. Roth interrupted her. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do the spraying," he said. "It's out of our control. It's the state 
that does the spraying." 
</P>
<P>
Nettie said that she understood that, as did the others who had addressed the 
board before her. Still, she wanted to say her piece. She got caught in the 
spraying last month and came down sick. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the manicured talk about no risk that she had just heard from state 
officials, Nettie thought that getting doused in malathion was not a good 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
She remembered when they used to X-ray feet at the shoe store to figure out 
which shoes would be the best fit. They don't do that anymore. And what about 
generic drugs, she wondered. Turns out now that some of them aren't too good 
for you either. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe you could tell the governor that down here we are kind of different," 
she said. "We don't like this. I wonder if it is some manner of getting even? 
It seems like they are going to do a lot of dumping on us." 
</P>
<P>
Roth cracked a smile. He said he liked Nettie's style. Then he dismissed her. 
</P>
<P>
Neither she nor any of the other 30 people who told the Board of Supervisors 
that they opposed aerial malathion spraying could change his mind. Roth never 
wavered. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly five hours of testimony Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors voted 3 
to 2 not to revoke the so-called Medfly emergency in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
This was expected. Nothing was changed. The buck just passed a little further 
down the line. 
</P>
<P>
Roth and Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who suggested that those made ill by the 
spraying simply move out of the area, said they supported Gov. Deukmejian's 
emergency declaration that allows the aerial malathion spraying wherever state 
entomologists see fit. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they opposed the spraying, they stressed, the Board of Supervisors was 
powerless to stop it. But by also declaring Orange County a disaster area, they 
would protect the county from liability in the event that it is named in a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, declare an emergency and protect yourself from any legal 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez softened his own support by proposing an amendment 
-- which he, Riley and Roth passed -- that said the declaration of an emergency 
does not necessarily mean that the county advocates aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Harriett M. Wieder and Roger R. Stanton, whose districts include the 36 square 
miles in the current Medfly target range, said in essence that that was a lot 
of poppycock. Their constituents were watching. They voted no. 
</P>
<P>
So far, three Medflies have been found in Orange County: two in Westminster and 
one in Brea. Isi Siddiqui, the assistant director of the California Department 
of Food and Agriculture, said that could mean that 1,500 to 3,000 Medflies are 
really on the loose here. 
</P>
<P>
This, in the eyes of the state, is an emergency. And maybe it truly is. But 
state officials, and it seems most of the supervisors, don't like to hear any 
doubts. 
</P>
<P>
When Stanton hinted that the state reaction might be overblown, Siddiqui said 
he should give him a lesson in Entomology 101. 
</P>
<P>
And initially, the state discounted the public concerns entirely. It was only 
Monday, after Wieder and a delegation of Orange County city officials flew to 
Sacramento to protest, that plans were announced to monitor air and water 
quality after the Southern California sprayings. A health advisory panel will 
also be formed. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, as state officials suggest, those who are caught in the trenches of 
the war on the Medfly should not be concerned that opinions are mixed on the 
safety of malathion spraying. You'll see, they say. It will all work out just 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
But at Tuesday's meeting, it was clearly the minority who appeared to believe, 
rightly or wrongly, that everything would indeed work out as the state 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
Most in the crowd, however, seemed outraged and scared. 
</P>
<P>
One woman's sister, extremely chemically sensitive, cannot now live in her own 
house in Garden Grove. One father pleaded on behalf of his 2-year-old daughter, 
who has trouble drawing her breath. Another woman said she was frustrated to 
hear that her voice doesn't matter, that a dictator in Sacramento was making 
sure that democracy does not prevail. 
</P>
<P>
As I listened to this parade of supplicants -- all of them asking that their 
voice be heard -- I couldn't help wondering why so many minds appeared to be 
closed to what they had to say. 
</P>
<P>
They may be needlessly alarmed, or they might just have a point. The Orange 
County Board of Supervisors should have voted against extending the county 
state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
It may not have stopped the spraying, but it would have shown the voters of 
this county that at least their concerns are being heard. 
</P>

LAGUNA BEACH MAY USE GOATS ON FIREBREAKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
City officials, tired of depending on human solutions to maintain firebreaks 
necessary for protection of the community's pristine hillsides, voted Tuesday 
to consider hiring up to 800 goats for the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very interested in saving the people of Laguna Beach thousands of 
dollars," said Councilman Robert F. Gentry, "but we have to work through the 
environmental questions." 
</P>
<P>
If an agreement is reached with state and county officials on environmental 
issues as well as sharing the costs, the goats would work on about 12 miles of 
firebreaks around the perimeter of the seaside colony. The goats would be 
helped by shepherds, dogs, horses and occasional hand crews. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a natural program," goatherder Ken McWilliam said from his Los Angeles 
station Tuesday afternoon. "It's an art and a science." 
</P>
<P>
But Laguna Beach residents Tuesday night said they feared goats would ravage 
the landscape, import lime disease, get loose or breed uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to study the environmental issues before making a final 
decision. Because the land abuts county and state land, city officials want 
those governments to share the costs. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliam said he has had goatherds working in Topanga Canyon and in Northern 
California. Laguna Beach Deputy Fire Chief Richard Dewberry visited the herder 
and his goats last December. Now he wants them in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed," Dewberry said. "He has so much experience that he can 
do things (with goats) that I never knew could be done." 
</P>
<P>
Dewberry said the goal is not to clear all growth but to "feather," or reduce 
the amount of fuel for fires. 
</P>
<P>
"Goats can do that when used properly," he said. "It's all a matter of timing." 
</P>
<P>
McWilliam said his goats are bred for jobs like this. 
</P>
<P>
"They can eat as much as a cow, but they don't pull out the roots," he said. 
"They prune, rather than destroy. And they can eat a lot of poison plants that 
would knock a domestic goat right out." 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach move toward goat recruitment is the latest step in a history 
of efforts to maintain firebreaks that were originally constructed in the '50s 
and '60s by California Department of Forestry and Orange County Fire Department 
crews made up of jail inmates, Dewberry said before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early '60s, political and philosophical opposition to the breaks began 
to mount," Dewberry said. "Awareness (about fire danger) wasn't as good as it 
is today. People didn't like to look at firebreaks and inmate crews." 
</P>
<P>
By 1981, only traces of the breaks remained, but by then people had again 
rallied to the necessity of fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, state and county crews began to reinstall the breaks, Dewberry said. 
Now, firebreaks exist from Emerald Canyon to Laguna Canyon, from the Alta 
Laguna Park to Moulton Meadows and intermittently south to about the middle of 
South Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
Dewberry said those efforts are commendable but insufficient for the 
never-ending job. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is to do it more efficiently, more cost-effectively and to 
get the job done," he said. "The inmate crews are great, but there are just not 
enough to go around. And other crews are spread thin and are hard to keep in 
one place for long-term projects because of demands from other services." 
</P>
<P>
Goats are cheaper, too. 
</P>
<P>
Dewberry said goats and related equipment cost from $600 to $800 an acre. 
Figures from the California Department of Forestry cite a manpower cost of $800 
to $1,800 per acre, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If this plan goes, we would hire McWilliam, who already has the goats," he 
said. "People have been talking about using Catalina goats, but they have to be 
trapped and transported. That presents a logistical problem." 
</P>
<P>
Dewberry also said the wild Catalina goats could die being trapped. "The goats 
we would use will be fenced at night for protection from wild animals," he 
said. "We're looking at areas near breaks which would work for that." 
</P>
<P>
Dewberry stressed that environmental concerns would be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
"People actually see deer grazing better (than before the break) once the grass 
grows in," he said. "And we will make them as attractive as possible and be 
very sensitive to rare and endangered species of plants." 
</P>
<P>
Dewberry said he has an appointment with state fire officials later this month 
to discuss the proposal.

RECLUSIVE COUPLE FOUND DEAD AFTER 2 WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bodies of an elderly couple believed to have been dead for two weeks were 
found in their apartment after worried neighbors notified police that the 
reclusive pair had been missing, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa police broke into the triplex on the 1300 block of Baker Street and 
found Nicolas F. Ydaboy, 84, and his bedridden wife, Lucinda, 81, dead. The 
couple died of natural causes, according to autopsy results. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary autopsy results indicated that Ydaboy died first, from heart 
failure, said coroner's investigator Stan Zak. The man's body was found in the 
living room of the two-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
It is believe that his wife, unable to care for herself, died three to four 
days later in her bed. Possible causes of her death are extreme dehydration and 
conditions related to hardening of the arteries, Zak said. Final autopsy 
results will not be available for more than two months, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The woman was senile and would have been helpless without her husband because 
he totally took care of her needs," said landlord Allen Milbert, who purchased 
the building six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The couple have no known relatives in the area, Zak said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were a very loving, devoted couple who lived in total isolation -- they 
weren't interested in neighbors coming to the door," he continued. "And through 
their interdependence, they ended up perishing together." 
</P>
<P>
Milbert said he alerted residents in an adjacent apartment that something 
appeared to be amiss because Ydaboy, who was consistently prompt in mailing 
cashier's checks for the rent, had missed a monthly payment. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Tao Do called police at 9 p.m. Sunday. He, too, was worried because 
Ydaboy hadn't taken his daily walk to the mailbox in more than two weeks and it 
was overflowing with letters. In addition, Do said, the couple's ground-level 
apartment had remained dark several nights in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very nice man," Do said, noting that he rarely saw Ydaboy's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Milbert said Ydaboy's wife did not appear to be aware of her surroundings and 
often spoke to herself in a foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart went out to them," he said. "Their life was pretty well coupled. 
(Ydaboy) was a very fine person and a very proper and proud man. I think he was 
very protective of his wife. When I knocked on the door, he would open it only 
a crack. I would've liked to interact with them more, but I respected their 
privacy." 
</P>
<P>
The couple did not own a car, but Milbert said their apartment was 
well-furnished, with religious icons and family photos decorating the front 
room. Ydaboy was always well-dressed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Do nor his family had been inside the couple's apartment. He said the 
only noise they heard was the sound of the television at night and voices from 
people who occasionally visited. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that in the last year, no one has come to visit them," Do said. 
"They just stayed inside. Sometimes, I'd talk to (Ydaboy) out by the trash 
cans. I'd say 'Hi' and ask how he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
The elderly man never mentioned any hobbies, family or friends, Do said. 
</P>
<P>
Milbert said he did not know the source of the couple's income. 
</P>
<P>
"They had lived there for years and always paid the rent one day in advance, so 
no one questioned it," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
A former resident of the building next door recalled a brief encounter with the 
timid couple when his children lost the family's pet turtle in the Ydaboys' 
back yard, which he described as overgrown with weeds. 
</P>
<P>
"The old man was very nice and let us go through the house to get to the yard," 
Mike Bremer said. "His wife was sitting in a chair, but it didn't seem like she 
could move too well. From the musty smell in there, it seemed like they kept 
the doors and windows closed all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Bremer added that he wasn't surprised that it took neighbors in the duplex two 
weeks to realize something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't the type of people that would come out of the house very often," 
he said.

SILVA REVERSES VOTE; MAYOR ROTATION DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Jim Silva this week reversed an earlier vote, nullifying the 
council's plan to rotate members into the mayor's seat. 
</P>
<P>
Silva said he reconsidered his position, and on Monday night voted against the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the measure failed without debate. Three of the five present 
council members favored the proposal, but under the City Charter, four 
supporting votes are required to adopt an ordinance. Both of the absent council 
members, Jim MacAllister and John Erskine, had previously voted against the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which Mayor Pro Tem Peter M. Green had proposed, would have 
eliminated the council's system of electing its mayor and mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed rotational system, the sitting mayor pro tem automatically 
would become mayor at the council's first meeting each December; thus, Green 
would have become mayor later this year for the first time in his six years on 
the council. The council member with the next most consecutive years of council 
experience would have succeeded Green as mayor pro tem, moving next in line to 
become mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Green said he favored the system because it would have enabled him to plan his 
1991 work schedule were he to become mayor. He also said he believes the 
current election method breeds "back-room" political maneuvering and bickering 
among council members. JOHN PENNER

LEARNING THE ABCS OF HANDICAPS

Francisco Burgos, a second-grader at Arroyo Elementary School, didn't like 
being blind. As soon as he could, the boy took off the black scarf tied around 
his eyes and squinted in the bright morning sunshine. He was thrilled that the 
experiment was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept bumping into stuff," he said. "It's kind of sad for people who are 
blind." 
</P>
<P>
For about 15 minutes Tuesday, the school's playground was filled with children 
careening about in wheelchairs, tapping white canes while wearing blindfolds 
and pushing themselves forward in walkers. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, said teacher Nancy McCloud, is give the children a first-hand 
experience of what it's like to be handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they develop an understanding of differences between people," McCloud 
said. "They physically know the meaning of the old proverb, 'Walk a mile in my 
shoes.' They've rolled a mile." 
</P>
<P>
Gina Kim, 7, of Santa Ana, who had seen a walker at her grandmother's house, 
said she now has a better idea of what the grandmother goes through. "I think 
she's kind of hurting in her body," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Thompson thought being blind was scary. But she quickly pointed out that 
many blind people are aided by guide dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to use special things and they are differently-abled," the 
7-year-old from Santa Ana said. 
</P>
<P>
Her classmate, Athina Singer, who helped guide Thompson around the schoolyard, 
added, "We shouldn't laugh at them and we shouldn't feel sorry for them. If you 
tease them, they won't feel OK." 
</P>
<P>
McCloud developed handicap education lessons for the state-funded Mentor 
Teacher program in which instructors show their colleagues innovative ways of 
teaching traditional and special subjects. The program will be introduced to 
all of Arroyo's second-grade classes by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
McCloud's lessons integrate information about being handicapped into regular 
course work. When pupil students study George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, 
they'll study Helen Keller as well. 
</P>
<P>
During silent reading time after lunch, pupils can select from such books as 
"I'm Deaf and That's Okay" or "I Can Sign My ABCs." When music is discussed, 
the class will hear a few songs from blind musician Stevie Wonder's latest 
album. When pupils discuss the alphabet, they will learn a few letters in 
Braille. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators have even become involved in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Several children experimenting with wheelchairs have visited Principal Gerry 
Aust's office. He said he never mentions the wheelchairs and treats the 
students like any other child coming into his office. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids can really be cruel without meaning to be cruel," he said. "If we can 
make them aware of these people, we've given them a good education." DANICA 
KIRKA

The parents of a man who was shot to death by an Anaheim police officer have 
filed a claim against the city. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory A. Rosenberger, 25, was shot by Officer Lee Smith, 36. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberger, a suspect of drug activity, was fired on during a struggle with 
two Anaheim officers Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberger's parents, Gary and Colleen Rosenberger of Brea, filed the claim, 
which is the first step toward a lawsuit. The couple could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although the claim does not specify damages, it was filed to Superior Court, 
which mandates that a minimum of $10,000 in damages be requested, said Mark 
Persson, city claims manager. 
</P>
<P>
Persson said that the claim is "brand new" and that the city attorney's office 
will need more information about the case from the Police Department and the 
district attorney office's investigation before commenting. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Police Chief Capt. Jack Flanagan said it is the department's "belief 
that the officer was justified in the use of his weapon . . . that he acted 
with prudence."LISA MASCARO

Consultants for the Pick Your Part auto-wrecking yard appealed to the City 
Council on Tuesday night after failing to win Planning Commission approval to 
move the operation from Stanton to the site of a former landfill in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for a group of about 100 residents who oppose the relocation, which 
they said would put the industrial-style operation too near their homes, said 
they expected the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Steyerman, accompanied by other members of the Stop Pick Your Part 
Committee, said they will again don their yellow T-shirts and show their 
opposition when the council holds a hearing on the appeal. No hearing date has 
been set. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-acre lot is at 2925 W. Lincoln Ave. Most of the homeowners who oppose 
the proposal live in a housing tract north of the site. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants for the company, which must move from its current location by March 
1, had compiled detailed plans for what they called a state-of-the-art 
auto-recycling center, hoping to assure residents that the operation would not 
be a typical junkyard. LISA MASCARO

MOBY SHARK LOOKS STARTLING, PROVES HARMLESS; 
</P>
<P>
FISHING: A 30-FOOT PLANKTON-EATER SUFFOCATES IN A GILL NET OFF THE NEWPORT 
PIER. IT'S THE SECOND UNUSUAL CREATURE TO DIE RECENTLY IN SUCH A NET.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Larry Capune went for his afternoon paddle aboard a 12-foot surfboard, he 
wasn't ready for what he saw being towed by a fishing boat. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort of looked behind this boat as it floated by me, and a huge fin popped 
up from the water," said Capune, who nearly fell off his board when a giant, 
30-foot basking shark passed by, suffocated from being trapped in a gill net. 
</P>
<P>
Fish experts said Monday's capture of a basking shark, especially by a gill 
net, is highly unusual for Southern California coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
Marine biologist Jeffrey Landesman said the giant fish, which weighed about 
4,500 pounds and was harmless to people, was caught about a quarter-mile off 
the Newport Pier by fishermen who were gill-netting for halibut. Narrow-weave 
gill nets catch fish by entangling their gills in the mesh. 
</P>
<P>
The shark's dying in a gill net "really bothered me," Capune said. "Here 
they're catching everything in those gill nets and ruining it. It's very 
depressing." 
</P>
<P>
Landesman, who works at Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro, said: "The shark 
was probably close to shore, which is atypical but not totally uncommon for 
basking sharks." 
</P>
<P>
Basking sharks are the second-largest fish in the ocean, next to the whale 
shark, and sometimes grow 45 feet long and weigh 8,000 pounds. They are usually 
found in schools, swimming dozens of miles offshore, Landesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen one in the water myself," he said. "Usually only professional 
underwater photographers and fishing boats spot these sharks, which swim near 
the surface of the water." 
</P>
<P>
Although they are members of the fish family that includes man-eating great 
whites, the basking shark is a gentle creature that feeds only on plankton or 
microscopic organisms. 
</P>
<P>
The giant shark has a mouth big enough for an average-size man to stand up in, 
Landesman said. The mouth is used to gather in food and also helps the fish get 
oxygen through its gill system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They can strain about 2,000 tons of water an hour through their giant mouths," 
Landesman said. "But they need to swim about two to three miles per hour to get 
enough oxygen and feed. This one died because he got caught in the gill net and 
could no longer travel forward." 
</P>
<P>
Capune, a world-class paddler, said he followed the San Pedro-based fishing 
boat, Cam Ranh, as it was helped into Newport Harbor, thanks to a tow line from 
another vessel, the Maria Fatima. However, the Cam Ranh's skipper could not 
find a truck big enough to haul out the fish. The Harbor Patrol eventually 
escorted the Cam Ranh with its catch out to sea about 6 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what became of the giant shark. Landesman, who was 
part of a Cabrillo team that examined the shark at Newport Harbor, said that 
although the shark's flesh is edible, fisheries do not use or want them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no market for basking sharks, but I'm sure in some parts of the world 
they may be eaten," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabrillo team was given permission to sever the fish's tail for study and 
eventual display, a task that took five volunteers several hours, Landesman 
said. The tail section alone was seven feet wide and weighed 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The shark's skin was extremely tough," Landesman said. "We tried to puncture 
the tail to run a rope through it and secure it, but it was so hard we couldn't 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
He said the skin was very abrasive, with "small spikes" that acted like small 
grappling hooks and cut into the biologists' arms as they worked. 
</P>
<P>
"With most sharks, you can run your hand in one direction and the skin is 
smooth, but abrasive if you run it in the opposite direction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"With this basking shark, it was extremely abrasive in both directions. Just 
carrying the 150-pound tail into the truck left our arms bloodied." 
</P>
<P>
The shark was male and 9 to 18 years old, he said. Age is estimated by counting 
the number of rings of meat around the fish's vertebrae. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second unusual capture in recent months by gill-netters, he said. In 
November, an 18-inch, extremely rare angler fish was caught 20 miles south of 
San Clemente Island. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) is the principal sponsor of a statewide 
initiative that would extend a ban on gill-net fishing along the coast from 
Point Conception to the Mexican border. Dolphins and fish in addition to the 
species that gill-netters are targeting routinely die in the nets. 
</P>
<P>
The thought of losing a magnificent creature such as a basking shark to a gill 
net was disturbing to both biologists and Capune, the startled surfer. 
</P>
<P>
"After all," Capune said about the basking shark, "what's left of him? Some 
piece of his tail in a museum so kids can touch it?"

LANSDALE MEETS WITH SENATOR SEEKING HER RESIGNATION;

Completing her round of apologies and explanations, CSU Trustee Chairwoman 
Marianthi Lansdale met with the state's most powerful senator Tuesday to 
discuss why she claimed a community college degree she hadn't earned during her 
appointment and confirmation in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Marianthi Lansdale, a part-time Huntington Beach resident, met with Senate 
President Pro Tempore David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) to concede that she 
erred in claiming she had earned the degree but vigorously defended her 
accomplishments as a trustee and indicated that she would not step down. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti called for Lansdale's resignation when the California State University 
chairwoman admitted in a December interview with The Times that she did not 
obtain an associate of arts degree in literature from Long Beach City College 
in 1959 as she claimed on her resume. Lansdale was appointed to the prestigious 
higher education panel by Gov. George Deukmejian in 1985 and confirmed by the 
Senate in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Since the disclosure, Lansdale has issued a public apology for the misstatement 
of her background and offered to meet with Roberti to discuss the controversy. 
In early January, her colleagues on the board of trustees issued a unanimous 
vote of confidence in her leadership of the 24-member panel, which exercises 
broad control over 20 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lansdale also apologized privately to Deukmejian, to whom Lansdale 
and her husband contributed more than $100,000 during the 1982 gubernatorial 
campaign. Deukmejian said last month that the falsification was a "bad mistake" 
but that he would not ask Lansdale to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's remarks were a clear signal that Lansdale would stay on the board, 
since the Senate currently has no power to invalidate its confirmation. But 
Lansdale, accompanied by CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, kept her commitment 
Tuesday to meet with Roberti to try to mend fences. 
</P>
<P>
After a half-hour closed session, Roberti said he renewed his request that 
Lansdale step down from the board. But he added, "There is nothing I can do. 
</P>
<P>
"My specific responsibility is to guard the confirmation process, and an error 
was made," he said. "In most appointments, I guess that wouldn't be a 
significant error, but in an educational appointment, it was an error of 
significance." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said Lansdale conceded the error but indicated that she would not step 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"She and Chancellor Reynolds went through a whole list of things Mrs. Lansdale 
has been involved in -- child care, minority hiring. It was well-taken and an 
important statement as to what she is doing in her position," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lansdale controversy has inspired a piece of legislation that would give 
the Senate the power to expel gubernatorial appointees who are found to falsify 
their educational credentials, which would be submitted to the Senate under 
penalty of perjury. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sen. Daniel E. Boatwright (D-Concord) said Tuesday that he is 
drafting legislation to establish minimum requirements for appointees to the 
CSU and community college governing boards. Community college appointees would 
be required to have at least an AA degree, while CSU board members would need a 
bachelor's degree, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really amazed that there was no educational criteria for appointment to 
the state college trustees," Boatwright said. "When the Lansdale story broke, 
that's when I first became aware that there was no educational requirement to 
be a state college trustee or a member of the community college board of 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always assumed that if you were going to govern, say, the CSU system 
that you would have had to know something about it, would have had to 
experience the problems of getting a BS or a BA degree," he said. "To me, this 
highlighted the need for legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are no educational qualifications for the trustees, who are 
political appointees. A CSU spokesman said that at least 10 of the 96 trustees 
since 1960 have not had college degrees.

In what could be a step toward public ownership of thousands of acres of 
pristine canyon country, the Orange County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday 
unanimously agreed to look into ways of buying the controversial Laguna Laurel 
development site from the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone agrees that purchasing the site is an acceptable alternative to 
building on it," said Tom Mathews, an aide to Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who 
proposed a feasibility study. "But we are talking about a large amount of 
money, $50 (million) or $100 million." 
</P>
<P>
Mathews said the county would search for state bond money, grants or federal 
funds to buy all or part of the proposed development site. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, environmentalists who have waged a decadelong battle to block the 
controversial housing project in Laguna Canyon between the San Diego Freeway 
and Laguna Beach, welcomed the Board of Supervisors' decision as a move toward 
preserving the environmentally sensitive Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very important first step, and I am thrilled with the vote on the part 
of the supervisors," Laguna Mayor Lida Lenney said. "It reads very positively." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors also authorized the county staff to get an independent appraiser to 
help in setting a value on the property. Depending on who is quoting the 
figures, the value has ranged from $50 million to $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
In order to raise enough money to buy the Laguna Laurel site, a ballot measure 
would be needed. But it would be doomed from the start unless the board scales 
back its demands that the Irvine Co. pay for road improvements related to the 
San Joaquin Transportation Corridor, some observers said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. and the city of Laguna Beach, a leading opponent of the 
development project in Laguna Canyon, agreed last month to ask supervisors to 
explore the possibility of placing a measure to buy the Laguna Laurel site on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be considered the first step in a purchasing program to put the 
canyon in public ownership," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
"While we all might agree that purchase of the site is an acceptable 
alternative to development, I believe it is only prudent to study the 
feasibility of bond financing and other methods of purchase before we consider 
putting the issue before the voters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent meeting between Laguna Beach and Irvine Co. officials, Riley 
said he was asked whether he thought purchase of the site would be acceptable 
to the county. 
</P>
<P>
"My opinion at the time, and to date, is affirmative, provided that public 
benefits negotiated as part of the development agreement between the county and 
the Irvine Co. would not be lost," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Those benefits include the Irvine Co.'s commitment to provide right of way for 
the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor and grading for the tollway, and 
improvements and widening of Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 2,100-acre site owned by the company, 1,300 acres have been dedicated 
open space under the development agreement signed in 1988. The actual 
development area, with 3,200 proposed homes and a golf course, is only about 
800 acres. The rest of the land, including the pristine 550-acre Laurel Canyon, 
could not be developed. There are three natural lakes on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The property would fit nicely into an existing network of parks, including 
Crystal Cove State Park, Irvine Coast Wilderness Regional Park and Aliso/Wood 
Canyons Regional Park. The parks would total nearly 16,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Although environmentalists and the developer have been warring over the project 
since the early 1980s, the battle has intensified in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
In November, more than 7,000 people converged on the Laguna Canyon to protest 
plans by the Irvine Co. to build the project. Many of the marchers came from 
outside the Laguna Beach area, stirring hopes among politicians that the 
preservation of the canyon may be of countywide concern, making a ballot 
measure more viable. 
</P>
<P>
Some warned that the cost of the land may be too high because many of the 
public benefits that the Irvine Co. agreed to are in the price of the 800 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
"If it didn't include all the extras and it was just to raise enough money to 
compensate the Irvine Co. for the land, the property would probably get down to 
a reasonable price," said Carolyn Wood, president of the Laguna Canyon 
Conservancy. "I think they are trying to glob too much into it and it makes the 
property too expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Although many support the land being protected as open space, others have 
expressed doubts that voters in financially conservative Orange County would 
support a tax increase to purchase open space.

TALE OF THE ALLEY CATS: 3 FLEW IN, 3 SLIPPED OUT

CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rescued from a pack of 30 cats trapped in a New York City alley, Sassy, Pumpkin 
and Blackie appeared headed for the lush life. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to find a New York family able to adopt all three cats, businessman Mel 
Skolnik flew the felines across the country to a willing person in Corona del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
But the West Coast life apparently didn't agree with the cats because they have 
disappeared. And Skolnik is intent on finding out what happened to them. 
</P>
<P>
Skolnik, who owns an Irvine printing company, has paid for 21,000 flyers to be 
distributed to Corona del Mar and Newport Beach residents offering a $1,000 
reward for information leading to the return of the cats. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he has received about 100 calls, but no leads. 
</P>
<P>
"We are heartbroken," said Skolnik, 49, a part-time Newport Beach resident 
whose New York girlfriend is a devout animal lover. "We just want to find out 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
The three cats are about 1 year old with golden eyes. Sassy and Pumpkin are 
dark gray, similar in looks to Russian blue cats, with short hair and whitish 
noses. Blackie is a short-haired black cat with a few white markings. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the sweetest creatures in the universe," said Elisabeth Brenhouse, 
Skolnik's girlfriend. "I don't know if they can survive by themselves. They 
grew up together and were inseparable." 
</P>
<P>
The couple's relationship with the cats started last year when Brenhouse heard 
about a large group of cats that were unable to get out of a city alley. 
</P>
<P>
"A man was lowering food down to them, but the situation was coming to a head," 
she said. "The tenants were planning to poison them because they were crying 
and making so much noise." 
</P>
<P>
Brenhouse and Skolnik, who already had adopted seven homeless pets, contacted a 
trapper who specializes in feral cats -- ones that are difficult to catch 
because they are not accustomed to being around people. The cats were captured, 
and Brenhouse said she was able to place 27 of them in foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining three -- Sassy, Pumpkin and Blackie -- lived with Skolnik and 
Brenhouse in their apartment overlooking Central Park for more than a month 
while the couple searched for a permanent home for the cats. 
</P>
<P>
"They really started to come around after a while," she said. "I could pet them 
and touch under their little chins, and they played with toys." 
</P>
<P>
But the quarters became cramped, especially because the couple already had two 
cats and five large dogs. So Skolnik, who frequently flies between coasts, 
found a home for the cats with a woman he knew in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whom he declined to name, lives at the Baywood Apartments on San 
Miguel Drive. Skolnik said the woman agreed to keep the cats together, which 
was crucial to Skolnik and Brenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this person would be reliable," Skolnik said. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, after questioning the woman regarding the cats' whereabouts, he 
discovered that the cats had been missing from that apartment since 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't relate to the cats and didn't tell me she was having problems," he 
said. "She said she lost them. I don't know what really happened." 
</P>
<P>
So Skolnik spent $1,000 more to distribute the flyers through the South Coast 
Shopper, a weekly direct mail publication. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 100 calls he has received, he said, "mostly, people are just 
sympathetic." 
</P>
<P>
Other callers said they have seen cats matching the description in the flyer, 
but the tips haven't worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to offer this money because we feel we have a special interest in 
finding out what happened to them," Skolnik said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am heartbroken beyond words," Brenhouse said. "I feel that it is my 
responsibility, and if I'd kept them, then they'd be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Brenhouse said that if the cats are found, she will take them back. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't trust anyone in the world with them anymore," she said. "I'd be the 
happiest person in the world to see them again."

JETS' OWNER SAYS HE'S NOT SELLING TEAM

The president of the Winnipeg Jets said he has no plans to sell the NHL team to 
an investors' group from Anaheim, in the wake of Canadian news reports Tuesday 
that a purchase offer was made. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not accepted any offers," Jets President Barry Shenkarow said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not moving and we're not selling the team. Let's drop it." 
</P>
<P>
Shenkarow conceded that he has been approached by people who "said they want to 
buy the team." Among the offers was one from Anaheim, said Shenkarow, who 
declined to identify the individuals involved. 
</P>
<P>
"They saw who is the smallest franchise, in the smallest market," said 
Shenkarow, who is negotiating with Winnipeg for a new arena in addition to 
revenue from concessions and luxury suites. 
</P>
<P>
He also declined to say how much has been offered for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"If an expansion franchise is worth $50 million, you can figure it out," 
Shenkarow said. 
</P>
<P>
Shenkarow wants an arena to replace the existing 15,405-seat Winnipeg Arena and 
to boost revenue. He said the chances of getting a new facility in Winnipeg are 
"50-50." If a new arena is not built, Shenkarow said, he would entertain other 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
Shenkarow said he is unfamiliar with Anaheim's proposed arena, which has been 
challenged in court by the Rams, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Monet, president of Ogden Financial Services, the firm selected to build 
and operate Anaheim's proposed 20,000-seat arena, said there is a group 
prepared to buy a basketball or hockey franchise for the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
But Monet and city officials have declined to identify the would-be owners 
other than to say "it's not the city, not Ogden."

BUDGETING: UC IRVINE COACHES KNOW ALL TOO WELL HOW TO STRETCH THEIR BUDGETS.

The UC Irvine men's tennis team is ranked No. 9 in the country, but when it 
comes to funding, the Anteaters are a Bottom 10 contender. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Greg Patton's already austere budget has been cut this year, part of an 
attempt to balance the department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm down to the bone," he says. 
</P>
<P>
So, how does the ninth-best collegiate tennis team in the nation make ends 
meet? 
</P>
<P>
"We cook up a bunch of spaghetti and have a spaghetti feast," Patton said, 
cheerfully. "My budget has always been small, so I don't think I've been cut as 
much as some other sports. But I've sure had to tighten the belt and creative 
fund-raising is more important than ever now. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have to perceive that things are first-class, so it just means I have 
to do my homework and see that things appear first-class. We're going to 
Kentucky and they will provide housing and (meal) per diem. Or a school like 
Miami, they've got so much money, it's a drop in the bucket for them to fly out 
a UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made a lot friends in coaching and we get a lot done on the good-ol'-boy 
system. We don't stay in hotels, we stay in homes. Our per diem is about $15 to 
$18 this year, but we don't have to hitch-hike to meets or anything." 
</P>
<P>
The UCI athletic department's 1989-90 operating budget is approximately $2 
million. The school has 19 Division I sports and under NCAA rules, could offer 
as many as 160 full scholarships. It currently funds 65, most of which are 
divided up by coaches and shared among student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past six or seven years, UCI's athletic department's deficit has 
reached $1 million. But it's not as if Joe's Sporting Goods is notifying a 
collection agency. The money is owed by the university to the university and a 
five-year plan to pay off the debt from general campus funds has been 
instituted. 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if past administrations were corrupt or even inept, however. More 
than half ($650,000) of the deficit came from payments athletics was forced to 
make because of cost overruns during the building of the Bren Center, which was 
supposed to cost $10 million but came in closer to $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
The administration could decide to cut some of Irvine's sports -- they need 
only six men's and six women's sports to remain in Division I -- but most of 
the sports are so poorly funded that dropping them would be, well, a drop in 
the bucket. 
</P>
<P>
"We're totally underbudgeted, in any and every area, from staff to personnel to 
facilities," baseball Coach Mike Gerakos said. "You could even cut some sports 
and not save much money, the sports are so under-budgeted and coaches are 
underpaid. The crux of the matter is there isn't enough money in the pot and I 
don't see how it can get any worse. You can't get water out of a rock." 
</P>
<P>
Let Vince O'Boyle, track and cross-country coach, illustrate: 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say they decided to drop both men's and women's track and field and 
men's and women's cross-country," O'Boyle said. "You cut out my $35,000 salary, 
(women's track coach) Danny Williams' $28,000, one assistant at $10,000 and the 
other at $5,000. Then you save $45,000 total in scholarships and $43,000 total 
in operating budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"That means 102 student-athletes are out of luck and you've saved a grand total 
of $166,000." 
</P>
<P>
The university decided to move into Division I in 1977-78, but it didn't 
increase funding or make plans for future financial increases. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches didn't necessarily want or make that decision," O'Boyle said. "So, 
well, if you're going to do it, support it. I guess that has to come from the 
top down. But help us out a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Horace Mitchell, vice chancellor for student affairs who is the acting athletic 
director, and Otto Reyer, who is actually running the athletic department until 
a new athletic director is named, hope to boost the coffers through stepped up 
fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
But even they admit that if Irvine is to keep its budget balanced, it will have 
to raise more money than ever just to stay even . . . which basically means 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we're saying as an institution is that we will evaluate where we 
are when the new A.D. is in place and where we want to go," Reyer said. "That 
evaluation hasn't been done. And it needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"The university has said there will be no more deficits. We've guaranteed that 
won't happen again. But we're not providing what it takes to compete in 
Division I right now.

LOFTY POTENTIAL CAME UP SHORT FOR 6-9 WAIKLE

Connie Waikle seemed destined to be a college basketball star. 
</P>
<P>
The former Villa Park High School standout had intelligence, a great attitude 
and talent, said Jim Irby, her coach at Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Most noticeably, she had something coaches often joke that they can't teach: 
height. By the time Waikle graduated in 1983, she was 6-feet-9. With such 
height, Irby believed Waikle could be a force at the Division I level. It never 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
An assortment of injuries, along with adjustments to four colleges in five 
years, slowed the progress of a player Irby called the best girls' center he 
has seen in 15 years as a coach in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Things didn't work out like I thought they would," said Waikle, 24, now a 
telemarketer for a company in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
After averaging 22.5 points and 12 rebounds a game, and setting a school record 
for most points in a season (632) as a senior at Villa Park, Waikle went to the 
University of Hawaii. Before her college career began, she tore ligaments in 
her left ankle during a weightlifting workout and missed all of preseason 
practice. She averaged only 3.1 points a game and, when her coach took another 
job, she transferred to Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The injury was a sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
"My body just wore out," said Waikle, who lives in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
She redshirted at Long Beach during the 1984-85 season, became unhappy with the 
program and transferred to Saddleback College. Injury-free, she scored 29.4 
points a game and was the state's leading women's community college scorer at 
Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
Waikle then transferred to San Diego State, confident of earning a starting 
spot for the 1986-87 season, but injuries hit again. An early-season knee 
injury kept Waikle out of two games and limited her effectiveness all season. 
She averaged 4.1 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Optimism arrived along with the start of her senior year, but so did another 
injury. This time, a stress fracture in her left foot in mid-December caused 
her to miss six weeks. By the time the season ended, Waikle was scoring 2.6 
points a game. She said the sport "wasn't much fun for me." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I experienced it," she said. "I just had some bad breaks. It would 
have helped if I would have stayed in one place. I didn't know what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Talk of her high school career brings smiles, however. She remembers helping 
Villa Park to the Century League championship in 1983, a season in which she 
set school records for rebounds in a season (337) and field goal percentage 
(54.5). 
</P>
<P>
Succeeding wasn't always easy. At a time when Waikle wanted to be "one in the 
crowd," her size brought jokes from opposing fans. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me work harder," she said. "When people yelled things, I liked to put 
it in their face. It didn't bother me on the court, (but) socially it did. They 
called me every name in the book. They still do, but I'm able to accept it 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Officials were also none too eager to protect a player who towered over 
opponents, said Irby. "She came out of every game with bruises on her legs, 
hips and back, red scrapes on her arms," said Irby, now an assistant girls' 
coach at El Toro and assistant men's coach at Christ College Irvine. "They beat 
her up." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Waikle survived, Irby said, and excelled. 
</P>
<P>
Irby had to think for only a moment before deciding where Waikle ranks among 
other high school centers. 
</P>
<P>
"Connie was the best," he said. "A kid like that comes along once in a lifetime 
at the high school level, even at the college level."

THESE DAYS, BIG GIRLS CAN PICK UP PACE TOO; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: TALL, DOMINATING HIGH SCHOOL CENTERS NO LONGER USE A WALK-IT-UP, 
DUMP-IT-IN STYLE OF PLAY. NOW THEY PUSH THE TEMPO AND RUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when a high school girls' basketball coach dreamed of having 
that one big girl, say anywhere from 6-foot to 6-foot-3, who could make the 
team a contender. 
</P>
<P>
A player whose only concern was to amble upcourt on offense and set up shop on 
"The Block," that low post position on either side of the line that designates 
the free throw lane. 
</P>
<P>
There she would wait until her teammates lobbed the ball to her for a sure two 
points, even if it sometimes took two offensive rebounds and three shots to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
They usually weren't particularly quick or skilled at much else, but coaches 
with smaller centers would be envious nonetheless. "You can't teach height," 
they would say. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the times, they are a changin'. 
</P>
<P>
As more girls get better coaching and become involved in year-round programs, 
the skill level of the center has improved. The walk-it-up, dump-it-in, 
pound-it-down-your-throat style largely has been replaced by fast-break 
basketball, and coaches are looking for centers who can keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
And they are out there. Among the tallest are 6-5 Zrinka Kristich -- who heads 
a trio of 6-footers at La Habra -- Ocean View's Jennifer Sullivan (6-2 1/2), 
Mission Viejo's Jennifer Rohrig, (6-3), Loara's Traci Titus (6-2), Los 
Alamitos' Allison Arredondo (6-2) and El Toro's Sara Bone (6-0). Among the 
smallest of the dominating county centers are Orange's Nicole Champion (5-10) 
and Brea-Olinda's Jinelle Williams (5-9). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've met a coach who wouldn't like to push the tempo and run," 
said Mark Trakh, coach of Brea-Olinda, the top-ranked girls' team in 
California. "If you look at the top 10 teams in the county, almost all of them 
run. I know the top four -- Brea, El Toro, Ocean View and La Quinta -- run and 
they run almost identical breaks." 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta Coach Kevin Kiernan agrees. "You don't want the slow-plodding team 
where you walk it up and work for the five-foot shot," Kiernan said. "Teams 
want to push it up the floor. It's more fun to coach and more entertaining, 
and, athletically speaking, the girls coming up are getting used to running. 
They've been going to camps, playing in summer leagues and moving the ball up 
the courts. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to keep away from slow centers. I want a center who runs the floor real 
well and can step outside and hit the shot. If you get a big girl you can teach 
her the post moves. But if you have a really, really mobile center who can run 
the floor and hit the outside shot, then you teach her the post moves (and) 
you've got the complete package. Of course, you don't find too many of those 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Three of the top four schools in the county have post players at least 6-0. 
Ocean View has the largest in Sullivan, who contends with El Toro's Bone, La 
Quinta's Amy Jalewalia and Mission Viejo's Rohrig for top honors in the county. 
</P>
<P>
None of these senior centers dominate all phases of the game. Each has 
strengths in different areas, but they all can run the fast break despite their 
size. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia was last year's state scoring leader with an average of 32 points a 
game. She most likely will play wing when she attends UCLA this fall, but for 
La Quinta she plays center -- sort of. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you could call her a point-center," Kiernan said. "She dribbles down, 
hands it off, then goes inside and posts up. I hate to use the word center. I 
hate to pigeonhole any of the players. I like to just call them forwards and 
centers." With Kiernan's more mobile approach to post play, Jalewalia is 
averaging 33 points, 11 rebounds and four steals a game. 
</P>
<P>
Bone, like Jalewalia, most likely will not play center when she goes to 
Dartmouth this fall, but she is doing the job for the Chargers this season, 
averaging 18 points and 10 rebounds a game. Bone is a bit heavier than 
Jalewalia, but she still is not the complete package. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not really physical," El Toro Coach Greg Yeck said. "She is more 
graceful -- a finesse player." 
</P>
<P>
Yeck said his ideal center would dominate and intimidate on defense before 
thinking about offense. "It would be nice to think a player could dominate to 
the point that people would hesitate to drive and take it inside," Yeck said. 
"We don't have that luxury with Sara. They are willing to take her on. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not imposing to look at. She is a nice kid, always smiling. There isn't 
that fear factor when you look at her. And she just doesn't come up with the 
real aggressive block -- the kind where you just clean somebody, where you get 
the crowd oohing and aahing." 
</P>
<P>
What Bone gives El Toro is good size and quickness. She can pull up and take a 
three-point shot off the fast break or drift out from the pressure of taller 
centers to hit the 15-foot shot. "It's kind of nice to know that the first 
person to get down the floor sometimes on your fast break is your center," Yeck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For size there is no one better than the 6-2 1/2, 185-pound Sullivan, last 
year's Sunset League Most Valuable Player and the center for third-ranked Ocean 
View. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, she appeared cast in the old hug-the-block mold. "She has come 
a long way," Kiernan said. "When we first saw her we thought, 'She is going to 
hurt us inside but we can beat her up and down the floor.' But she has worked 
on it and her lateral movement is better and she gets up and down the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan gives Ocean View offensive versatility. With her, the Seahawks are one 
of the few teams that have the option of walking the ball up and using a power 
strategy to score. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the big things with her is she is a prime-timer," Ocean View Coach 
Ollie Martin said. "When the game is on the line, she comes up with the big 
block or big basket or makes some sort of key play at key times." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan doesn't have the offensive versatility, mobility or shooting touch of 
Bone, but she uses her body well. She is tough to get around once she seals out 
a player on the block. 
</P>
<P>
But can she fast break? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can get the rebound, outlet the ball and still be down on the fast 
break," Martin said. "Very few girls her size can do that. She can do it the 
whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan is perhaps most valuable as a shot blocker. "Defensively she changes 
the way you play," Kiernan said. "You can't just take the ball inside." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's progression from fast-break trailer to occasional fast-break leader 
was no accident. Like many Orange County centers, she has made the effort to 
find competition her size in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan attended three basketball camps the summer between her sophomore and 
junior years and three more -- the invitation-only Blue Star Camp in Indiana, 
and camps at Nevada Las Vegas and UC Santa Barbara -- last summer. She has a 
shooting coach and trains in special strength shoes designed to help improve 
her jumping ability. 
</P>
<P>
The camps and practice have paid off. Sullivan averages 18 points, 14 rebounds 
and five blocked shots a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Against players my size I tend to fake more," Sullivan said. "I do different 
things more when there is someone there in my face. It's good. I become quicker 
when I turn because I don't have as much time." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan also has learned what colleges want from their centers -- mobility. 
</P>
<P>
"Most recruiters are more impressed if you can go down and be a part of the 
fast break rather than just come down at the end of the break or just get down 
for that matter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, who is sifting through recruiting letters from UCLA, Louisville, 
Loyola Marymount and more, has not decided on a college. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrig, however, has made a decision. She won't play her college basketball 
anywhere. She has opted instead to play volleyball at Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Many county coaches point to Rohrig as the top county center despite their 
belief that she never realized her potential in the sport. She leads the county 
in rebounding with 19 and averages 19 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Rohrig could be by far the best center in the county but the kid is into 
volleyball," said Yeck, whose Chargers have taken a back seat to Mission Viejo 
and Rohrig in the South Coast League the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen Sullivan, Rohrig and Titus, and of those three, the one who could 
be most dominant is Rohrig. She has that 6-3 frame, and when she puts those 
arms up she plays like she is 6-8. She had our kids changing shots and missing 
all kinds of shots because they knew she was around there. 
</P>
<P>
"When she is on, she is devastating. I think (she moves) better than Sullivan. 
She gets up and down real well, it just depends whether she is on." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrig, Sullivan, Bone and Jalewalia graduate this year, but there is a core of 
tall and talented centers who are serious about their off-season work and ready 
for life in the fast-break lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge's Deanna Harry (6-2) is only a junior, but Coach Eric Bangs says she 
is an excellent defender. Her presence inside allows his guards to gamble for 
steals out front. 
</P>
<P>
University's Tara Wolff (6-0), a sophomore, already has shown an aptitude for 
floating outside for the 12-foot shot, and she is right at home filling a lane 
on the fast break. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most talent in one spot, look to the Highlanders. La Habra has 
Leslie Ferguson (6-0) and sisters Ana (6-1) and Zrinka (6-5) Kristich. All 
three play in the Amateur Athletic Union in the off-season. Ferguson, who leads 
La Habra with 15 points and 10 rebounds a game, will graduate this year, but 
Ana is a junior. Zrinka, a sophomore, already has impressed many. 
</P>
<P>
Trakh calls La Habra "the nightmare team" because nobody can match up well with 
the trio. Of Zrinka, he said, "She is potentially the best kid to come out of 
Orange County. She is very well-schooled at the post. She is 6-5 but she moves 
really fluidly and she knows what she is doing." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kiernan, "Once they get the ball in to Ferguson or the sisters, it's 
pretty much over. They just volleyball it in. It's a tip drill for them." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean the Highlanders are thumping the ball inside throughout every 
game. La Habra Coach John Koehler prefers to run the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows we are emphasizing the big girls underneath, they just don't 
realize we are still flying down the court. Ana and Leslie can run, and on 
occasion Zrinka has gotten out ahead of everybody and gotten the easy layup." 
</P>
<P>
But the centers most likely to get downcourt ahead of everybody on the fast 
break are Los Alamitos sophomore Allison Arredondo and Loara junior Traci 
Titus. Both have coordination, speed and size. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about the kids from Los Alamitos and Loara is they are probably the 
best athletes on their teams," Loara Coach Gary Blate said. "They are the 
fastest on their teams and the most physical. Usually 6-2 girls aren't able to 
do that. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the kind of kids you have to use the word, 'potential' with all the 
time and you have to wait to see how far they are going to come along to meet 
that potential."

ORANGE LUTHERAN'S PARKINSON SETS MARK WITH 6-GOAL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freshman forward Amber Parkinson scored a county-record six goals in Orange 
Lutheran High School's 10-0 victory over Brethren in an Olympic League girls' 
soccer match Tuesday in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson, who has 30 goals this season, scored four in the first half and two 
in the second before leaving the game midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's six goals in a game ties her with four others for third place on 
the all-time Southern Section list. The Southern Section record for goals in a 
game is held by Shannon Maddock of Torrance, who had eight against Long Beach 
Wilson during the 1984-85 season.

Center Ian Long made two free throws with one second remaining to give Newport 
Harbor High School a 63-62 victory over Saddleback Tuesday night. The outcome 
kept his team in a first-place tie with Estancia and Corona del Mar in the Sea 
View League with one game remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Long was fouled after grabbing an offensive rebound and his team trailing, 
62-61. Long, a 260-pound center who is being recruited by several Division I 
colleges to play football, showed he's adept in a pressure situation by calmly 
making both shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't hear while I was shooting," Long said. "When I made the first one, 
the pressure was off because I knew the worst we could do was overtime. I knew 
if I made the second one, the game was over and I would be the hero." 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback (15-10, 4-5) overcame a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter by 
scoring 28 points and held a one-point lead with 12 seconds remaining. Newport 
Harbor (17-7, 6-3) missed the front end of four one-and-one free-throw 
opportunities in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a chance and started fouling them in the fourth quarter and it worked 
for a while," Saddleback Coach Pat Quinn said. "This game was indicative of our 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Reserve Huy Nguyen scored 11 of his 16 points in the second half to lead 
Newport Harbor, missing only one shot. Nguyen was the leading scorer and most 
valuable player on Newport Harbor's junior varsity team last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Our last four games have been like this," said Bob Sverum, Newport Harbor's 
first-year coach. "We tried to give it away, but Ian came through." 
</P>
<P>
In other Sea View League games: 
</P>
<P>
Estancia 53, Tustin 52 -- Torrey Hammond made a 10-foot jump shot with seven 
seconds remaining to give Estancia (15-8, 6-3) a come-from-behind victory. 
Estancia trailed, 52-49, with 37 seconds remaining when Hammond made two free 
throws to cut the deficit to one point. Tustin (18-6, 5-4) called a timeout 
with three seconds remaining but Phuong Tran's three-point shot bounced off the 
remain at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 72, University 53 -- Warren Johnson and John Paulson each had 16 
points and Jeff Jackson added 10 to lead host Corona del Mar (15-9, 6-3). Klaus 
Perwas had 29 points for University. 
</P>
<P>
In the Academy League: 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran 85, St. Michael's 38 -- Brad Pluckhan had 22 points, 10 rebounds 
and eight assists and Rob Hasty had 20 points for visiting Cal Lutheran (10-7, 
6-3). Jocques Wright had 18 points for St. Michael's. 
</P>
<P>
St. Margaret's 71, Heritage Christian 33 -- Ryan Westendorf had 23 points and 
20 rebounds as host St. Margaret's (16-4, 9-0) clinched the league championship 
and won its 13th consecutive game. Dann Campaigne added 20 points, including 16 
in the fourth quarter for St. Margaret's, ranked second in the Southern Section 
Small Schools Division. 
</P>
<P>
In the Olympic League: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita 85, Whitney 45 -- Dan Bathey had 28 points, Chris Stone 16, 
Jeff Layne 10 and Mike Guevara had four points and nine assists to lead host 
Santa Margarita (10-12, 7-6). 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran 71, Capistrano Valley Christian 54 -- Daryl Cole had 19 points 
for visiting Orange Lutheran. Jason Rodarmel had 13 points for Capistrano

ISLAND WATER SPORTS OPENS RETAIL OUTLET IN LAGUNA NIGUEL

The surf-wear industry started on the Southland's beaches and swept the rest of 
the country like a wave. And now it seems to be traveling full circle, with the 
recent arrival in Laguna Niguel of Island Water Sports, a licensee of a 
Florida-based apparel chain. 
</P>
<P>
The retailer, which sells such well-known surfwear labels as Stussy, Billabong, 
Rusty and Rip Curl, is the first West Coast outlet for Deerfield Beach, 
Fla.-based Island Water Sports. And if the founder of the 11-year-old Florida 
company has his way, Island Water Sports stores soon will be stretching from 
Santa Barbara to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"People look to the West Coast for what's happening and for trends," said Kirk 
Cottrell, chairman and majority owner of Island Water Sports. "California is 
necessary for our validity." 
</P>
<P>
So even though there are now 23 Island Water Sports stores in Florida, 
Colorado, Georgia and the Canary Islands, Cottrell has big plans -- many of 
them involving California. 
</P>
<P>
After raising $300,000 through a private stock placement last spring, Cottrell 
formed Island Water Sports Franchise Group. Within the first year, that company 
hopes to have 25 franchise stores, most of them in Florida, including 15 
conversions of existing licensees, said Rick Englert, president of the 
franchise group. 
</P>
<P>
Cottrell hopes to open 10 stories in California within a year. Over a five-year 
period, the company hopes to have 50 West Coast stores in California and, 
perhaps, Arizona, Cottrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Island Water Sports stores range from 1,500 to 4,000 square feet and have sales 
of about $286 per square foot, company executives said. Compiled by Mary Ann 
Galante, Times staff writer

BATTLE RAGES OVER BIODEGRADABLE PLASTICS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: PLACENTIA DIAPER FIRM IS PART OF DEBATE FOCUSING ON WHETHER THE 
PRODUCTS ARE AN ECOLOGICAL SOLUTION OR PART OF THE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, Placentia businessman Bob Chickering was looking for ways to 
expand beyond the tiny business of selling cotton swabs when he discovered the 
disposable diaper. It looked like a good business, and one of his researchers 
owned some useful patents. 
</P>
<P>
But Chickering saw that the environmental problems posed by plastics were a 
threat to disposable diapers, and it was also crucial to avoid competing 
head-to-head with the powerful masters of the $3.5-billion industry, Procter 
&amp; Gamble Co. and Kimberley-Clark Corp. 
</P>
<P>
There seemed to be an elegant solution to both problems: a biodegradable diaper 
that would disintegrate after it was thrown away. It seemed one could be made 
using a cornstarch-laced plastic resin that had been available for years, and 
it could be niche-marketed to the tree-hugging set. 
</P>
<P>
Chickering's company, American Enviro Products, began marketing Bunnies as an 
environmentally sound diaper last July and had sold 40 million by the end of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
But today, Chickering finds himself embroiled in a heated national debate over 
whether biodegradable plastics -- which are also used in some plastic bags and 
other packaging products -- are part of the solution to the waste-disposal 
crisis, or part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
It's a debate that has produced some strange bedfellows: environmental groups 
have joined with Procter &amp; Gamble in calling biodegradable plastics a 
fraud, while a hodgepodge of plastics vendors and agribusiness firms have 
suddenly begun preaching the need for urgent action on the garbage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
And a seemingly straightforward question of science -- do these plastics 
biodegrade, or not -- has been buried beneath the complicated politics of 
environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
Using biodegradable products is "the difference between doing something and 
doing nothing," proclaims the National Corn Growers Assn., a powerful supporter 
of cornstarch-enhanced plastic, in full-page ads in USA Today. But the 
Environmental Defense Fund and other environmental groups counter that even if 
the plastics do biodegrade, they will only inhibit efforts to cut down on the 
growing mountains of solid waste. 
</P>
<P>
Chickering, a genial man who doesn't pretend to understand the complicated 
chemistry of bio-degradability, concedes that biodegradability isn't a 
cure-all. "It's not a simple issue, but we're very comfortable with the 
technology," he said. "The research shows that cornstarch-based plastics break 
down faster than any other." 
</P>
<P>
Rmed International, a tiny company based in Sedona, Ariz., that markets its 
Tendercare diapers in health-food stores and by mail-order, is far less modest. 
The firm asserts unequivocally in its product literature that its plastic -- 
which is produced by the giant agriculture company Archer-Daniel-Midland -- 
"will break down completely into carbon dioxide and water in U.S. landfills." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of biodegradables, such as Environmental Defense Fund senior 
scientist Richard Denison, say that is nonsense. "Even materials that are 
readily degradable don't degrade in landfills, where there's very little 
moisture or oxygen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, efforts to prevent landfills from contaminating the air and ground 
water have resulted in new designs that effectively entomb the garbage and 
prevent degradability, sanitation experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Denison also asserted that even if the plastics do degrade, they can release 
toxic materials -- such as cadmium and lead -- that are used to color the 
plastics. And even under ideal conditions, critics contend that the 
cornstarch-based plastics simply break down into tiny particles. The cornstarch 
is eaten away so the plastic appears to disintegrate, but the rugged plastic 
polymer molecules remain in the environment to be eaten by unsuspecting fish 
and fowl, Denison and others maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Gialiana Tesoro, a professor of polymer chemistry at Polytechnic University of 
New York, said the claim of a complete breakdown of the plastic is "incomplete 
and misleading," if not an outright lie. "Every organic material will 
ultimately degrade," she noted, adding that all plastics are made from 
petroleum products, which are organic materials. But the speed at which that 
happens depends on the specific composition of the plastic and the 
environmental conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely complicated issue," she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many scientists say there is not yet a definitive answer to the 
question of whether biodegradable plastics really break down completely, and 
under what circumstances. The Federal Trade Commission and the California 
attorney general's office, which have opened investigations into the validity 
of advertising claims about biodegradability, are wading through contradictory 
studies on the matter, and many more studies are in the works. The final answer 
may be still be some years off. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it is probably safe to say the biodegradable products break 
down somewhat faster than regular plastics, and they break into invisible 
pieces fairly quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But, environmentalists maintain, the use of biodegradable plastics also gets in 
the way of sound waste-reduction policies. That's because they give people the 
illusion that they are doing something about the plastic problem, when the real 
solution lies in reducing the use of plastic altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional cotton cloth diapers, for one, are an obvious alternative for the 
environmentally conscious, though they have to be made and cleaned and thus 
have some negative environmental effects of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Disposable diapers, which are made mostly of a (degradable) wood-pulp absorbent 
wrapped in a plastic back sheet, are believed to account for 1% to 2% of all 
the solid waste in U.S. landfills. 
</P>
<P>
"All plastics represent the throwaway ethic," said David Tam, solid waste 
chairman for the Bay chapter of the Sierra Club. "We believe in reusable 
products." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, biodegradable plastics are incompatible with existing plastic 
recycling methods, and thus they could impede ongoing efforts to massively 
increase the amount of plastic that is recycled. 
</P>
<P>
"This will threaten the entire recycling approach," said Randall Curlee, an 
economist and waste specialist at Oak Ridge National Laboratories. "I don't 
regard biodegradables as part of the solution." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, plastic recycling is hardly widespread at the moment, and 
biodegradable proponents claim with some justification that there is no reason 
in principle that recycling processes can't be adjusted to accept biodegradable 
products. Tim Draeger, spokesman of the National Corn Growers Assn., also 
points out that "trying to recycle diapers is not a practical option" because 
of the human waste mixed in with the plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of biodegradable plastics are fighting the environmentalist 
offensive on a number of fronts. They've commissioned more studies on how fast 
the cornstarch-based plastics break down, supported trial efforts to dispose of 
them by composting, developed a common standard for what constitutes a 
recyclable plastic, and advertised the contribution they claim that the 
plastics can make to the solid waste problem. 
</P>
<P>
But their most convincing argument is one which relates not to the current 
products, but to future ones. Draeger calls the current biodegradable products 
the "Model T" of starch-based plastics, with new and even more degradable 
products to come. Indeed, the New Jersey consumer products firm Warner-Lambert 
recently announced that it had developed a plastic that could be made entirely 
from starch. 
</P>
<P>
A product of that sort would indeed satisfy many of the objections to 
biodegradable products now on the market, and Warner-Lambert's announcement was 
lauded by environmentalists. But for Chickering and some of his fellow 
entrepreneurs, such developments are a mixed blessing. The big consumer 
products concerns will almost certainly get into the "green" product game with 
such a material, and that would undercut part of the reasoning that prompted 
American Enviro Products to use biodegradables. 
</P>
<P>
The success of companies like American Enviro "is going to be short-lived," 
predicted Bonita Austen, a consumer products analyst with the investment bank 
Wertheim Schroeder. When Procter &amp; Gamble and Kimberly-Clark -- which 
Austen said control 49% and 31%, respectively, of the diaper market -- find a 
fully degradable plastic that can make good diapers, they will market the 
products heavily. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll make it tough to compete," said Austen.

Short sales increase: Just three months after its "grand reopening" to 
celebrate a $100-million renovation, Newport Center/Fashion Island is noisily 
touting its 54% mall-wide sales increase during the 1989 fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, mall officials relate the quarterly increase -- representing total 
sales of $77 million or $67 per square foot -- to the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
But considering that Fashion Island added 70,000 square feet of retail space 
for 60 new stores, the upswing isn't too surprising. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Lazzarevich, a mall spokeswoman, said fourth-quarter sales totals without 
the newly added stores were not available. Not counting the mall's anchor 
tenants, including Bullock's Wilshire and Neiman-Marcus, mall sales in the 
fourth quarter climbed 33.4% to $39.9 million from $29.9 million, she said. 
Those numbers, however, also include the new retail footage. 
</P>
<P>
Among Orange County's other malls, preliminary indications are that 1989 
fourth-quarter sales showed modest gains. 
</P>
<P>
Not including anchor tenants, here are the sales tallies reported by some of 
Orange County's top-grossing malls for the last period, October-December, 1989: 
Brea Mall was up 8%; Westminster Mall down 1.5%, and Buena Park Mall up 5.5%.

'REQUIEM' TO REUNITE SOPRANO RUTH GOLDEN AND CHORALE'S WILLIAM HALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When New York Opera soprano Ruth Golden steps on the stage of Segerstrom Hall 
in Costa Mesa on Friday night, she will be collaborating with an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
Golden will be one of two soloists in Brahms' "Ein deutsches Requiem" with the 
Master Chorale of Orange County, led by music director William Hall. (The other 
soloist will be baritone Rodney Gilfry.) 
</P>
<P>
"I've been singing on and off with Bill Hall since 1981," Golden said in a 
recent phone interview. "I think I've done nine or 10 works with Bill, and it's 
been a wonderful association." 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, she sang in Poulenc's "Gloria" with Hall when he led his first 
concert as a guest conductor of the Master Chorale in December, 1987, several 
months before he was appointed the group's music director. 
</P>
<P>
Golden grew up in Southern California and remembers being "always musical, 
doing shows as a child. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the obligatory piano lessons at age of 6," she said. "But it all started 
to take when I was at Beverly Hills High School. Then music became very 
serious. I did about 100 concerts a year in my junior and senior years." 
</P>
<P>
She went to UC Berkeley to study music as an undergraduate, and a trip across 
the bay changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw (Luciano) Pavarotti and Teresa Stratas," she recalls, "in (Puccini's) 
'La Boheme.' That was a very life-changing experience." 
</P>
<P>
She decided to pursue opera seriously, moving back to Los Angeles and 
completing a master's degree in music at the University of Southern California 
in 1980. She entered the San Francisco Opera Merola training program for young 
singers in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
She has studied with Martial Singher, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Gwendolyn 
Koldofsky and Nina Hinson. She continues vocal studies in New York with Ruth 
Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really important to have someone you check in with vocally," she said. "I 
feel that our responsibility (as singers) is to study our whole careers and 
refine our repertory." 
</P>
<P>
Golden joined the New York City Opera in 1985 and began singing "mostly lyric 
repertory" -- Mimi in "Boheme," Marguerite in Gounod's "Faust," Zerlina in 
Mozart's "Don Giovanni," among other roles. 
</P>
<P>
She was seen locally during the NYCO's two stints at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, as Micaela in Bizet's "Carmen" in 1987, and as the 
Second Lady in Mozart's "Die Zauberflote" and as Natalie (a.k.a. Valencienne) 
in Lehar's "The Merry Widow" in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
All along, she has mixed recital work with opera because "in this country, the 
music world being what it is, versatility is a premium." 
</P>
<P>
She will sing her first Countess in Mozart's "Le nozze di Figaro" in 1991. "I 
will go to try it out in Anchorage, Alaska, to work out the kinks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There is an opera company in Anchorage? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it puts on four productions a year. It's a company in which singers can 
go to try out roles in a risk-free environment, to try out new directions. 
Places like Anchorage are perfect. It has a 2,500-seat theater, an enthusiastic 
audience. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In big cities, you do repertory you've done quite extensively." 
</P>
<P>
Golden is branching out to Europe, as well, "mostly for guest engagements, to 
expand my repertory, not to relocate there. 
</P>
<P>
"I long for other opportunities, but not to the exclusion of leaving my native 
shores," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Golden said she approaches opera "architecturally" because of her early start 
as a pianist. "I'll play through a score, singing on open vowels to get a 
feeling of the musical line. But I'll also start studying the source -- whether 
a play, libretto or novel -- and read about the literary conception of the 
character. 
</P>
<P>
"At the point I really start working with the music, learning the text and the 
music together, the character takes shape with the musical level. I start to 
really think about the character's motivation, so that the audience then has a 
sense of real life or feeling about them. . . . Composers such as Mozart or 
Puccini have so much going on with the character." 
</P>
<P>
Working with a stage director "becomes a negotiation process," Golden said. 
"There are always ones that are difficult." She remembers as "most interesting" 
her performances as Despina in Jonathan Miller's production of Mozart's "Cosi 
fan tutte" for the Opera Theatre of St. Louis in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I sang one recitative eight different ways until he said, 'That's the one!' 
That was really a challenge. He didn't want Despina to be a prim, French maid, 
but very earthy, dominant, someone who tells the ladies how to deal with men." 
</P>
<P>
Golden's problem, she said, was that she "was still making her a little too 
cute. He said, 'more earthy, more knowledgeable, more salt of the earth.' So I 
edged away from the cute, flirtatious approach. It was a matter of degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"So he cast me as very frumpy -- instead of being pretty and cute -- and 
holding a dishrag in my hand the whole time!" 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Golden will be soprano soloist with the Master Chorale of Orange County 
in Brahms' "Ein deutsches Requiem," William Hall conducting, Friday at 8 p.m. 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. 
Rodney Gilfry will be baritone soloist. Hall also will conduct Brahms' 
"Schicksalslied." Tickets: $12.50 to $35. Information: (714) 556-6262. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ANY DOUBTS, by the way, that the Master Chorale would have an orchestra for its 
program Friday were dispelled late Monday when the organization deposited a 
cashier's check for $21,000 to cover musicians' fees with the Orange County 
Musicians Assn., Local No. 7 of the American Federation of Musicians, according 
to Frank Amoss, president of the local. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Symphony, originally announced for the concert, had pulled out 
because the Master Chorale still owed the orchestra $37,000 for concerts Oct. 
27 and Dec. 3. The chorale then said it would assemble its own orchestra, 
through the union. But union officials said that they would require a bond for 
the entire amount of musicians' salaries for Friday's concert, to be posted 
before the first rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chorale has paid the Pacific $5,000 of its debt, according to 
Randy Johnson, president of the Pacific's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
No repayment schedule has been worked out but, Johnson said Tuesday, "I feel 
satisfied that the Master Chorale is doing everything it reasonably can in 
order to pay off this debt. I have every confidence that we are going to get 
paid. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If you go back over a five-year period, there isn't an arts organization in 
the county that hasn't had financial trouble at one time or another. In this 
instance it happens to be the Master Chorale." 
</P>
<P>
AND DON'T BE SURPRISED if you notice microphones hanging above the stage at 
Friday's Master Chorale concert -- and at future concerts by the Master Chorale 
and the Pacific Chorale. The organizations will be taping the concerts for 
archival or grant-getting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
YOUNG LOCAL classical or popular musicians can try for up to $1,500 in cash 
awards through the 1990 B. Douglas Sawtelle Musical Scholarship Competition, 
being sponsored by the Orange County Musicians' Assn., Local No. 7 of the 
American Federation of Musicians. A separate $500 Mick Price Scholarship will 
be awarded to a young jazz musician. 
</P>
<P>
All applicants must be Orange County residents and music majors either in their 
senior year of high school or enrolled in a college or junior college as of 
fall 1990. Awards are for instrumental musicians only (as opposed to vocalists, 
conductors or composers). Winners will be invited to appear in a public 
recital, to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for application is March 16. Information: (714) 546-8166.

A Newbury Park man unhappy about the investigation and prosecution of his son's 
death was in jail today after allegedly making death threats against a Ventura 
County prosecutor and an assistant sheriff, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Flores, 47, was being held in lieu of $500,000 bail on suspicion of 
threatening an executive officer, Sheriff's Lt. Kelli McIlvain said. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvain said Flores was arrested Tuesday night after calling the district 
attorney's office and threatening to kill Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Holmes and 
Assistant Sheriff Oscar Fuller. Authorities declined to give details of the 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
The threats were apparently motivated by Flores' unhappiness over how 
authorities handled the death of his son, John Flores, 18, during a Jan. 20, 
1989, fight at a party in Newbury Park, McIlvain said. The death was 
investigated by the Sheriff's Department, and two men were arrested. One was 
later convicted of assault, and the other was acquitted after being tried on a 
charge of manslaughter.

Jimmy Van Heusen, a Tin Pan Alley veteran who won four Academy Awards and 
composed such memorable tunes as "Love and Marriage" and "Swinging on a Star," 
has died at his desert home, it was announced today. 
</P>
<P>
He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
Van Heusen died Tuesday night of complications of pneumonia. His death was 
confirmed today by the Riverside County Coroner's Office.

Most Americans can hum at least a few bars of several Van Heusen tunes -- "High 
Hopes," "Call Me Irresponsible" and "All The Way." 
</P>
<P>
He chiefly collaborated with such lyricists as Johnny Mercer, Johnny Burke, 
Eddie DeLange and most notably, Sammy Cahn.

<P>
The Communist Party that for decades swore its red tide would cover the globe 
bowed to a different revolution today and agreed to allow alternative political 
parties to compete for control of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The decision amounts to an acknowledgment that new political forces have taken 
root and that it is no longer possible or desirable to crush them with the 
repressive tactics of the past, which ranged from mass murders under dictator 
Josef Stalin to the dissident arrests preferred by Leonid I. Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev said the Central Committee proposed a real 
presidential system with a Cabinet, a radical concept for the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The plenum supported the idea of asking the people to approve the introduction 
of a presidential government in this country," Yakovlev said. "That is to say, 
the president should be elected for a certain term and he and his Cabinet shall 
have full power." 
</P>
<P>
The stunning decision by the party's Central Committee to give up the 
Communists' constitutional monopoly on power was a triumph of political 
maneuvering by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He packed the meeting of the 
249-member body with more than 700 other officials, many of them progressives 
who took the floor to demand radical reform. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the guests also were allowed to vote on the new party platform, 
said Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a famed eye surgeon and one of the participants. He 
spoke in an interview on Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
"Article 6 will no longer be, there will be a multiparty system. There will be 
a normal democracy," Fyodorov said, referring to the article in the Soviet 
Constitution that guarantees the Communists a leading role. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot rule out the emergence of new parties," Politburo member Vitaly I. 
Vorotnikov said in remarks reported by Tass news agency. "But we Communists are 
not going to surrender our positions. Just as any party in the world, we shall 
be waging a struggle for our rights." 
</P>
<P>
For three days, Gorbachev's draft platform was strongly criticized from both 
right and left at the Kremlin meeting. Radio Moscow said the Central Committee 
also agreed to advance the date of the next party Congress from October to no 
later than July. The Congress, the most powerful party body, is the only group 
empowered to choose a new Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee is considered by reformers to be the bastion of 
conservatives wary of Gorbachev's reform program. The Congress would offer 
Gorbachev another chance to reform the committee to his liking. 
</P>
<P>
Sources inside the Central Committee meeting said it would recommend to the 
Supreme Soviet parliament that it delete Article 6 of the constitution in the 
first step of a two-stage government process. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet could take up the issue at its next session beginning Feb. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, final authority for changing the constitution rests with the 
Supreme Soviet's parent body, the Congress of People's Deputies. At its last 
meeting in December, the Congress heeded Gorbachev's plea for a delay and 
blocked an effort by reformers, led by Andrei D. Sakharov, to strike Article 6. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee meeting was seen as the Communists' last chance to reform 
their party before local elections scheduled this spring, in which Communist 
candidates are expected to fare poorly. 
</P>
<P>
After a sharp debate that wound up the Central Committee meeting, Pavel 
Zinoviev, party chief on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Soviet Far East, said 
the committee recognized a small loyali1936990310 Vice President Anatoly I. 
Lukyanov told a news conference the Central Committee appealed to a larger 
group of Lithuanian Communists who declared themselves independent of Kremlin 
control to return to the fold before the Congress, implying they would not be 
allowed to send delegates to the nationwide meeting as long as they assert 
their independence.

Three former McMartin Pre-School defendants filed a slander suit today against 
the parent of a child allegedly molested at the school, charging that he has 
defamed them in interviews on national talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court suit against Robert Currie was filed by the founder of the 
preschool, Virginia McMartin; her daughter, Peggy McMartin Buckey, and her 
granddaughter, Peggy Anne Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed in response to remarks Currie made on a number of television 
talk shows following the Jan. 18 acquittals of Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, and 
her son, Ray Buckey, 31, on 52 molestation counts stemming from the alleged 
sexual abuse of pupils at the preschool from 1978 to '83. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that since the verdicts, Currie has continued to state his 
belief that all the defendants in the case are guilty.

Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) suggested today that countries receiving the 
biggest share of U.S. foreign aid, which includes Israel, could face cuts of as 
much as 10% or 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, did not mention Israel 
or other major recipients such as Egypt, Greece, Turkey, the Philippines and 
Pakistan in a Senate speech. 
</P>
<P>
But the former Senate Democratic leader said cuts in aid for some countries 
could be "substantially larger" than the 5% across-the-board reduction for all 
recipients proposed recently by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole in order to 
redistribute the funds to Eastern Europe and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"Some countries, certainly the largest of our historic aid recipients, can 
probably take cuts substantially larger than 5% -- somewhere between 10% and 
20% would be more realistic, I would think," Byrd said. 
</P>
<P>
A cut of 20% for Israel, the largest single recipient at $3 billion, would 
reduce aid by $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Some recipients might not take any cut at all," Byrd said. "There is one thing 
for certain: No foreign aid country has earned the right to our money or 
resources. And no foreign country can assume it has an American entitlement 
program."

A teen-age girl died this morning 4 1/2 days after becoming the world's first 
recipient of an implanted device that works like a lung. 
</P>
<P>
LDS Hospital spokesman Tim Madden said Melicia Harvey, 16, of Arthur City, 
Tex., died of pulmonary failure at 5:30 a.m. The experimental IntraVascular 
Oxygenator -- a 20-inch bundle of hollow synthetic fibers that delivers oxygen 
to the blood -- functioned as intended until the girl's death, Madden said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey had been in critical condition throughout the experiment with severe 
respiratory distress syndrome, which results from a variety of causes and is 
characterized by inability of the lungs to transfer oxygen to the blood. 
</P>
<P>
The IVOX, approved for use for up to a week to allow damaged lungs to rest and 
recover, was implanted during two hours of surgery Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, whose father, Atrell Harvey II, is employed by Campbell Soup Co., had 
been a member of the student council at North Lamar High School in Paris, Tex. 
The girl's mother, Edith, died Jan. 31 of undisclosed causes.

JACKSON VISITS S. AFRICA, HOPES TO SEE MANDELA

Jesse Jackson, beginning a visit to South Africa, said today that he hopes to 
see Nelson R. Mandela "walking down the streets of Johannesburg" before his 
12-day trip ends. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. civil rights leader, granted a visa by the government after several 
rejections in the last decade, planned to meet President Frederik W. de Klerk 
and Foreign Minister Roelof (Pik) Botha as well as with leaders of the 
anti-apartheid movement. 
</P>
<P>
At an airport news conference, Jackson declined to say if he had requested a 
meeting with Mandela, the African National Congress leader who is expected to 
be released soon, after more than 27 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no commitment from the government to meet him," Jackson said. "I hope 
to see him walking down the streets of Johannesburg. The whole world hopes to 
see him free." 
</P>
<P>
In a widely hailed speech on Friday, De Klerk lifted a 30-year ban on the ANC, 
scrapped other restrictive measures and pledged to free Mandela promptly. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a moment in South Africa's history that must be seized," Jackson said. 
"If the government moves back, there will be chaos. . . . But if the government 
seizes the political moment and moves forward, we will see the dawn of a new, 
free and democratic South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had set two goals for the trip -- to encourage unity among black 
political factions and to "address the unfounded fears of the whites." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he favors continuation of sanctions against South Africa, he 
replied: "The real issue is to end apartheid. Sanctions will end with 
apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk gave "a great speech," he said, but "apartheid is still in place. . . 
. Nelson Mandela is still in jail." 
</P>
<P>
The Afrikaner Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi white supremacist group, has 
threatened to mount protests against Jackson, but only a handful of right-wing 
demonstrators were seen at the airport and they obeyed police orders to avoid 
displaying placards. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and his wife, Jackie, were welcomed by senior leaders of the 
anti-apartheid movement, including Walter Sisulu, an ANC colleague of Mandela, 
and church leaders Allan Boesak and Frank Chikane.

KOHL TO VISIT MOSCOW, WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS GERMAN REUNIFICATION

<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will travel to Moscow on Saturday and to 
Washington later this month to confer on the prospects for German unification 
in the face of the dramatic changes unfolding in Eastern Europe, officials in 
both capitals announced today. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Kohl will meet at Camp David, Md., White House aides 
traveling with Bush in San Francisco said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is also conferring this weekend at Camp David with NATO Secretary General 
Manfred Woerner, the aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III is now in Moscow, reportedly carrying the 
outline of an allied plan on German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze announced the surprise visit by 
Kohl and his foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, while speaking to 
reporters at the start of Shevardnadze's meeting with Baker in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important process," Shevardnadze said. 
</P>
<P>
East German Premier Hans Modrow was recently in Moscow for talks that also 
covered reunification. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major stumbling blocks to union of the two Germanys is Western 
insistence that Germany stay in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the 
alliance forged after World War II to defend against attack from the Communist 
East Bloc. The Soviet Union and its allied states formed the Warsaw Pact in 
response, but now that military pact appears to be disintegrating.

An international ban on ivory trading is proving effective in the struggle to 
save Africa's endangered elephants, a World Wide Fund for Nature official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The ban, agreed to by the United Nations Conference on International Trade in 
Endangered Species last October, has quashed the demand for ivory and forced 
prices down, fund spokesman Rick Weyerhaeuser said. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of ivory has fallen (about) 50% since the ban was announced," he 
said. "First indications are that (the ban) is proving successful." 
</P>
<P>
But he said the group fears the refusal of some southern African countries to 
accept the ban might jeopardize efforts to protect the continent's dwindling 
elephant population.

A money bag inside an armored truck shifted and struck the deadbolt lock of the 
vehicle's back door today, causing it to open and spill 16 bags containing 
$320,000 onto a downtown street. 
</P>
<P>
The Loomis Armored Inc. vehicle was on its way to the Federal Reserve Bank in 
Cleveland when the incident occurred about 7 a.m. Guard Robert Hutchison said 
people who saw the spill offered to help pick up the bags, which each contained 
$16,000 in $1 bills. He said he pulled his gun to prevent theft.

<P>
McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. will lay off more than 10% of its employees by 
Feb. 23 because of reduced defense spending by the government, company 
President William P. Brown announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The move will involve about 400 workers each at the company's base plant in 
Mesa, Ariz., and at its California Manufacturing Center in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
The company employs 5,900 in Mesa and 1,650 in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
"We must reduce our work force to meet the reality of our delivery schedule 
with the U.S. Army," Brown said in a prepared statement from Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The Mesa plant has been producing Apache helicopters for the Army at the rate 
of 10 per month. Brown said that number would be reduced to six a month in June 
under a contract that ends in mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company still has good prospects of international sales of Apaches. 
</P>
<P>
The other step in the company's retrenchment is elimination or delay of 
discretionary spending, Brown said.

N.Y. FUR COMPANY TO SELL RETAIL UNIT TO SEOUL FIRM

Fur Vault Inc., whose profits have been hit by an industry slump due largely to 
increasingly vocal animal-rights activists, said today it agreed to sell its 
retail fur unit to South Korea's Jindo Corp. for as much as $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jindo, a Seoul-based fur maker and retailer, said the deal is one of the 
largest U.S. acquisitions by a Korean company. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this acquisition is a very significant step toward enhancing our 
already strong U.S. presence in the fur business," Young Kim, president of 
Jindo, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Fur Vault, based in New York, said Jindo agreed to pay $11 million to $15 
million for the unit, depending upon a final asset valuation at the May closing 
of the deal. The pact is subject to government and shareholder approvals. 
</P>
<P>
"The sale of the Retail Fur Group is consistent with the Fur Vault's previously 
announced strategic plan. It will bring to an end successive operating losses 
of the Retail Fur Group . . . and will permit the company to concentrate its 
energies in more profitable areas," Fur Vault President Robert Miller said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Fur industry sales have been dented as increasingly visible animal-rights 
activists have taken their cause to the streets. Anti-fur activists, besides 
handing out pamphlets showing bloodied and cruelly captured animals as well as 
staging marches, have gathered in front of fur retailers' operations in an 
effort to stop shoppers from buying furs. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the activity has focused on New York -- the fur capital of the world -- 
where animal-rights groups have placed ads in newspapers and on radio, put up 
billboards and hung posters in subways. 
</P>
<P>
Some militant groups have also harassed fur wearers and broken or spray-painted 
windows of fur stores. 
</P>
<P>
But the industry has lashed back with its own ad campaign calling for the 
upholding of the right to wear fur in an attempt to save its $2 billion in 
annual sales.

DAVID SELBY GIVING UP SAFETY OF 'FALCON CREST'

Put Ted Turner, William Randolph Hearst and Rupert Murdoch together, and add 
just a touch of Ernie Kovacs, and you might have the character that David Selby 
has played on "Falcon Crest" for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Channing is -- among other things -- larger than life. And that's just 
the way Selby wants him. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the first thing Selby did when he got the part was to start 
reading the Wall Street Journal. He decided to play Channing, he says, "with a 
slight twinkle in the eye." 
</P>
<P>
Selby plays Channing with the same zest he put into the vampire Quentin in 
"Dark Shadows" and Michael Tyrone of "Flamingo Road" or Avery Brundage on "The 
Life and Loves of Avery Brundage." 
</P>
<P>
Yet you can't get much farther from these scheming characters than David Selby 
himself, a sweet-tempered, unassuming Southerner who has always been a dreamer. 
"I didn't get into acting to search my psyche," he says over lunch in Studio 
City. "I got into it to be swashbuckling and get the girl." 
</P>
<P>
He may be fearful, but Selby has decided that this will be his last season on 
"Falcon Crest." And that's a brave decision for an actor. There are few jobs in 
the field that are as steady as a nighttime soap. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frightening, but at the same time it can be a bit of an adventure," he 
says. "I'm honestly ready for it. It doesn't bother me too much. I'm not sure 
why. It's not the fact that I made some money. Money was never the answer for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Selby, 48, and his wife, Chip, have been married 22 years. They have three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who say his success in "Falcon Crest" has put him in a strong 
position, he says, but that "hasn't occurred to me yet. And it hasn't occurred 
to a lot of other people yet -- because there's not a lot of people ringing my 
bell. 
</P>
<P>
"I know leaving 'Falcon Crest' will be hard. But there are other things I want 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
With a little coaxing he admits that he'd love to play Ted Turner and Billy 
Graham, a combination that seems to suit David Selby.

THE WEEKLY tabloids were said to be offering up phenomenal sums to cover the 
Roseanne Barr-Tom Arnold wedding, which took place recently. But Roseanne aced 
out the supermarket papers. She feels they've made her life at the top pretty 
miserable. So the TV star gave her exclusive coverage, for free, to Life

keep out the paparazzi and media gate-crashers. We'll see Roseanne as a

MARY MARTIN is in and out of Cedars-Sinai in L.A. for more chemotherapy, and on 
top of that, she is recovering from a recent auto accident that left her with a 
chest fracture and a broken ankle. But the seat belt saved her life! (The star 
already survived one serious car crash that took the lives of her pals Ben 
Washer and Janet Gaynor some years ago.) In spite of these setbacks, Mary says, 
"I've led a charmed life!" And she is in excellent spirits.

WHEN AVA GARDNER died, Harper's Bazaar was already on the stands with its story 
about "Ava's Men." This week, People has its heart-stopping cover photo of the 
beauty taken way back when by the late Philippe Halsman. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few additions to last week's coverage of Ava's funeral in 
Smithfield, N.C. Many visitors to the funeral home were upset that the casket 
was closed at the family's insistence. One group said, "Why, we've come all the 
way from Arkansas to see Ava!" The person who seemed most grieved at the 
graveside was Ava's longtime housekeeper, Carmen Vargas. Many mourners went on 
to visit the Ava Gardner Museum in the star's childhood home.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ALL COLD REMEDIES 'WORK' THE SAME -- THEY REALLY DON'T 
</P>

<P>
It's a billion-dollar industry that flourishes on misery -- sniffles, sneezes 
and sore throats. But despite the ads on television promising instant relief, 
most cold remedies provide little more than smoke and mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
Antihistamines are a mainstay of the runny nose market. But while they help 
against allergies and hay fever, they are almost useless against the common 
cold. The FDA has been asked to reject antihistamines for cold treatment, but 
the agency has so far avoided the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Pain killers like aspirin and acetaminophen are common ingredients in cold 
remedies. Doubtless, ibuprofen will start showing up in the near future. But 
are such drugs helpful against a cold? 
</P>
<P>
In most cases the answer is no. Garden-variety colds are not generally 
associated with aches and pains or high fevers. If you feel like you've been 
hit by a truck, chances are you have the flu instead of a cold. 
</P>
<P>
What about gargles, sprays and throat drops? None will cure a sore throat or 
really do much to relieve inflammation, which is what causes the pain in the 
first place. A salt water gargle (one-half teaspoon of salt in an 8-ounce 
glass) may provide as much temporary relief as most lozenges. 
</P>
<P>
Oral decongestants such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) and phenylpropanolamine 
(PPA), found in Contac, Dimetapp and Alka-Seltzer Plus, can help a stuffy nose. 
They tend to dry out the mouth and nasal passages in the process, though. 
People with high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, prostate enlargement 
or an overactive thyroid gland should probably avoid such products. 
</P>
<P>
Nasal sprays that contain topical decongestants such as Afrin, Duration, 
Otrivin or Neo-Synephrine are extremely effective and appear safer than oral 
decongestants, but they can only be used for three days. After that you run the 
risk of developing a dependency because when you stop spritzing your sinuses 
the congestion returns worse than before. 
</P>
<P>
So what should you do if you catch a cold? For one thing, stay home. The first 
few days you will be the most contagious, so don't share it with everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Elliot Dick, one of the country's leading cold researchers, has become a 
believer in massive doses of vitamin C. To get this vitamin into white blood 
cells where it is needed he suggests several grams a day. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what your favorite treatment -- chicken soup, vitamin C or every pill 
and potion in the pharmacy -- your cold will probably go away in a week. And if 
you take nothing at all it will likely last seven days.

Kitty Dukakis' doctors have advised her not to discuss her addiction problems 
in her public appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"Her therapist and she agree that it is critical that she not be so upfront 
about her problems. It appears that her speaking might be over. Or very 
limited." The Massachusetts first lady recently returned home from an 
alcoholism treatment center and Tuesday night, in one of her first public 
appearances since returning home, she joined her husband, Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis, at a ceremony formally forging a sister state relationship between 
Massachusetts and the Japanese state of Hokkaido. She also has resumed work on 
her memoirs, "Now I Know."

British rock star Billy Idol was recovering today after undergoing seven hours 
of surgery to repair a serious leg fracture suffered in a motorcycle accident, 
a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
Idol, 34, nursing a "major break" of his right leg and a fractured left arm 
suffered in the accident Tuesday morning, remained in serious but stable 
condition at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, hospital spokesman Ron Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Golden, Idol's publicist, said it is unclear how his injuries might 
affect his career. 
</P>
<P>
Idol was planning a tour to support his new album and has a role in director 
Oliver Stone's upcoming film about the 1960s rock group The Doors. The film is 
scheduled to begin shooting in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Wise said Idol will probably be hospitalized for at least two weeks, recovering 
from injuries that took three orthopedic surgeons seven hours to repair.

GIANTS' MEGGETT ARRESTED ON CHARGE OF SOLICITING SEX

New York Giants running back David Meggett was arrested today and charged with 
lewdness and soliciting a prostitute after allegedly offering to pay an 
undercover female police officer for sex, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Three days after scoring a touchdown in the NFL's Pro Bowl game, Meggett, 23, 
was arrested around 11:45 a.m. by vice officers in the Fells Point area of 
Baltimore, said city Police Agent Arlene Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
Fells Point is a restored waterfront area popular for its nightclubs and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore Evening Sun said Meggett was arrested after he stopped his car 
and allegedly called over to the undercover officer. When she asked what he 
wanted, he said he wanted a date and was willing to pay $40, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief conversation, the officer signaled to other officers who were 
watching and Meggett was taken into custody, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Meggett gave police a home address in North Charleston, S.C. He was to have a 
bail review hearing this afternoon. Both charges are misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
As a rookie with the Giants, Meggett was voted to the Pro Bowl after finishing 
fourth in the NFC among punt returners, averaging 11.4 yards per return, and 
ninth among kick returners with a 20.5-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
Meggett was the Giants' fifth-round draft choice in 1989, the 132nd player 
chosen, after finishing third in the nation among NCAA Division I-AA players in 
all-purpose yardage, averaging 179.1 yards per game at Towson State University. 
</P>
<P>
He was voted to the NFL Pro Bowl after a rookie season in which he ranked 
fourth in the NFC in punt returns and ninth in kickoff returns. 
</P>
<P>
Meggett scored a touchdown in the third quarter of the Pro Bowl in Honolulu on 
Sunday that gave the NFC a 13-7 lead. The NFC won the game, 27-21.
