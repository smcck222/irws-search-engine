President Bush and his wife, Barbara, will be brushing up on lullabies after 
becoming grandparents for the 11th time. Their daughter-in-law, Sharon, gave 
birth to a 7-pound, 2-ounce baby girl in Denver, the White House said. Ashley 
Walker Bush was delivered at 3:45 a.m. at Denver's Rose Medical Center. A White 
House statement said that the mother and child were resting comfortably. The 
new father is Neil Bush, the third oldest of the Bushes' five children. Ashley 
is her parents' third child. The statement quoted the First Lady as saying she 
and her husband are "very excited" by and "enormously grateful" for the birth 
of their granddaughter.

 -- "Wop bop a loo bop a wop bam boom" are not the typical lyrics for official 
state music. But Rep. Billy Randall, a Georgia state legislator from Macon, 
wants "Tutti Frutti," which contains those lyrics, to be the state's official 
rock 'n' roll song. The Democrat said he introduced the measure to give some 
overdue recognition to "Little Richard" Penniman, a Macon native whose style 
was copied by many of the rock stars of the early 1960s, including the Beatles. 
"Quite frankly, I don't think Little Richard has ever gotten the acclaim or the 
notoriety for his contribution to rock 'n' roll," Randall said. "Tutti Frutti," 
Little Richard's first big hit, reached No. 2 on the rhythm and blues chart in 
1955 and became a rock standard. Georgia's state song is "Georgia On My Mind" 
by Ray Charles.

 -- Veterans of the Ronald Reagan Administration are not the only political 
insiders who get book contracts. Bert Lance, the President Jimmy Carter aide 
who was pushed out of Washington by charges of financial irregularities, has 
signed with Summit books to write about his experiences. The book, which is due 
for publication in the fall of 1990, will touch on his work on behalf of Carter 
and, more recently, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, politics in general and his 
successful fight against charges of bank fraud.

 -- Country music singer Loretta Lynn has been hospitalized in Nashville, 
Tenn., after a fall, a spokeswoman says. Lynn was hurt when she slipped and 
fell while vacationing recently in the Bahamas with her husband, O.V. (Mooney) 
Lynn, said Lorene Allen, vice president of Loretta Lynn Enterprises. "She is in 
Park View Hospital for observation because she . . . broke her arm and suffered 
unbelievable pain, and that is all I know at this point," Allen said. SHIRLEY

SHORING UP THE S&amp;LS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush appears to have come up with constructive proposals to reform 
the savings-and-loan industry and to take precautions against major new 
reverses among the banks. Now Congress, through hearings, must determine 
whether the proposals are as good as they look. 
</P>
<P>
His plan is certainly an improvement over earlier talk of a direct tax on 
deposits. But he was the first to acknowledge that the new plan involves costs 
that would almost certainly be passed along to depositors. That probably would 
be a small price to pay for the security afforded by federal deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
He intends action on three fronts: (1) a $90-billion bailout as the federal 
government protects depositors in the failed savings-and-loan institutions, 
with the federal government moving quickly to take over the weakest; (2) a 
reorganization of federal regulatory agencies, increased inspection and tighter 
regulation -- including a doubling of mandatory capital in savings-and-loan 
institutions; (3) a $50-million increase in Justice Department funding to 
facilitate the hot pursuit of those who may have violated the law. 
</P>
<P>
The savings-and-loan industry itself would bear close to half the estimated 
cost. Taxpayers would cover the other half, with a first-year budget of $1.9 
billion. It will be for Congress to sort out the equity of that formula for 
burden-sharing. It may be significant that some in the industry had expected to 
pay more. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the deposit-insurance rates for banks would also be increased 
as a preventive measure to build reserves of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp., dangerously depleted by big bank failures. This, too, would be matched 
by tougher regulation to try to avoid more disasters. The bank funds would not 
be used to cover savings-and-loan rescue operations, which seems fair. 
</P>
<P>
There are lingering doubts about the plan that may be resolved when more 
details become known. It is not clear whether the new supervision by the 
Treasury Department would be adequate to guarantee the President's commitment 
that "the situation is not repeated again." It was, nevertheless, reassuring 
that regulators are already implementaing takeovers of failing institutions. 
There is clearly a need for more and better inspection by the federal 
regulators, but there is no way at this stage to judge the adequacy of Bush's 
plans in this area. Some experts are skeptical that the special $50-billion 
bond issue, and the $40-billion bailout contrived last year by the Reagan 
Administration, would be adequate. It will be important for Congress to look 
closely at the deals struck last year to sell off failing savings-and-loan 
institutions in exchange for modest new investments and tax concessions to be 
sure that those remedies did not serve merely to postpone the risk of yet 
another collapse in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Bush's plan acknowledges an inexcusable and outrageous failure of 
business and government that now burdens everyone. He is right, of course, to 
affirm the obligation to make good on deposit insurance within the limits of 
the law. And he is right, also, to pursue those who apparently committed 
crimes. But it is important to remember that many of those responsible for the 
disaster were guilty of no felony. They were guilty of reckless management 
driven by greed, and complaisant supervision enamored of deregulation. And that 
atmosphere was encouraged at the highest levels of government. Bush appears 
intent on change. That would indeed be appropriate.

YELLOWSTONE LIVES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Western senators and congressmen still are beating the bushes for scapegoats in 
the aftermath of last summer's fires in and around Yellowstone National Park. 
As the new session of Congress was getting under way, Sen. Alan K. Simpson 
(R-Wyo.) told a Wyoming newspaper that congressional hearings would have two 
major goals: "to avoid this kind of thing in the future and to pin blame for 
what happened in the past." There would be a new cast of characters in the 
National Park Service under the Bush Administration, he said, and they would be 
selected to some degree on the basis of fire-fighting policy. 
</P>
<P>
Such retribution is senseless. A careful analysis of what really happened in 
Yellowstone last summer demonstrates that very little could have been done to 
affect the scope of the fires or the extent of destruction. The chairman of a 
federal fire-management review team said that "there never was a way to 
preclude what happened in Yellowstone this year." 
</P>
<P>
The review team, while not passing judgment on the Yellowstone decisions, 
defended the National Park Service's policy of permitting certain naturally 
caused fires to burn themselves out in pursuit of acceptable ecological goals. 
But the officials added that fire-fighting efforts might have to be undertaken 
in some instances because of social and economic consequences. The Yellowstone 
fires were fought with considerable success in preventing economic loss, 
specifically in the saving of man-made structures like Old Faithful Inn and 
related buildings. But the major damage may have been political, as officials 
like Simpson and Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) joined the panicky attacks on 
Park Service and Interior Department officials for not doing more to stop the 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the fires burned far less acreage than was being reported last August 
and September. The biggest fires were fought from the beginning because they 
had been man-caused. The majority of the large fires did not even begin within 
Yellowstone, but in lands outside the park under the jurisdiction of the U.S. 
Forest Service, which has a more vigorous fire-suppression policy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best retrospectives of the park fires, written by nature writer Ted 
Williams, appeared in the January issue of Audubon magazine. Williams was 
vacationing in Yellowstone during the peak of the long fire season. From his 
own observations, and from follow-up research, Williams found that while the 
fire perimeter encircled 1.4 million acres, the vegetation in 30% to 70% of 
that area was untouched. "I'd seen and guessed that there was 10% black," 
Williams wrote, but the Park Service estimated 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Some plant life remained in all but one-tenth of 1% of the 1.4 million acres. 
While the politicians had complained about the sterilization of the soil in 
vast stretches of the fire area, implying that nothing would grow there again, 
soil scientists and wildlife biologists said that there was no soil 
sterilization, even in the most intensely burned regions. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also complained that the Park Service was reluctant to use bulldozers 
to cut fire lines. The lines that were actually plowed with the machines proved 
ineffective. Foot crews armed with axes worked best. Much of the damage that 
the Park Service must contend with was caused by bulldozers where they were 
allowed to tear up meadows. 
</P>
<P>
The fires were part of a natural process that probably would have, and should 
have, occurred decades ago but for past policy of putting out every fire as 
soon as possible. This permitted dry fuel to build up on the forest floor. 
Turned to tinder by drought conditions, all it needed was one spark. 
</P>
<P>
As Williams left Yellowstone last fall, he said that he reflected on all the 
changes that Yellowstone had undergone since the last Ice Age. Except for the 
wolves hunted to extinction in the area, all of Yellowstone was still there. 
"Nothing basic had changed," he said. "The park had survived all those 
millennia with scarcely any human help." And, presumably, Yellowstone will 
survive even the angry politicians still seeking scapegoats.

THE PERVERSION OF TRUTH CONTINUES IN ALLEGING A PORN-CRIME LINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL GOLDSTEIN, Al Goldstein is a contributing editor for Penthouse magazine 
and the publisher of Screw, which he describes as a satirical-sexual newspaper. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Ted Bundy ended his last jailhouse interview just hours before he went to 
Florida's electric chair for the crime of murder, he left a different kind of 
carnage behind. Truth was massacred, logic was crippled and maimed, the ground 
was littered with tautologies and half-truths. 
</P>
<P>
His partners in this, the last crime that he was able to commit, were the 
media, for the loving and devoted credence that they lent to his claims, and 
James Dobson of the Los Angeles religious broadcast "Focus on the Family." Ted 
Bundy lied all the way through his dramatic last interview, and the media 
didn't call him on it, and Dr. Dobson actually fostered those lies. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson is a former member of the so-called Meese Commission, the pro-censorship 
task force assembled by our now-disgraced former attorney general. If anyone 
has anything bad to say about adult-oriented material, Dobson is there to hear 
it and add his hearty hosannas. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy had plenty bad to say about sex and violence in the media. In fact, he 
blamed the media for his crimes. But if we are to remain a nation guided by 
reason and not by such jailhouse histrionics, we must formulate an answer to 
Bundy and, more important, to Dobson. 
</P>
<P>
Let us begin at the beginning, and focus on the family, as Dobson and Bundy 
did. Their argument was artfully conceived. They portrayed Ted as a young boy 
from a perfectly fine home who was corrupted by the influence of pornography. 
That "fine solid Christian home" (as Bundy put it) deserves a closer look, 
because it allowed Dobson to extrapolate the dangers to his own constituency. 
"Pornography can reach out and snatch a kid from any house today" is how master 
manipulator Bundy put it in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
But was Ted Bundy's early life average or normal? Was Ted's house "any" house? 
He was an illegitimate child, and the grandfather who raised him was a violent 
man who vented his aggressions against people and animals both. At 4, Ted was 
removed from his grandparents' house by his mother, who took him to Seattle, 
where she later married a man who was seen sending roundhouse rights in Ted's 
direction. If this is the "solid Christian home" that Dobson is intent on 
presenting, we are all in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Dobson didn't call the killer on his rather obvious lie (although all the facts 
are available in the numerous books on Bundy). But what was Bundy's reason for 
twisting the truth? The man whom Dobson asked us to believe was, of course, a 
pathological liar. But he had a reason for this particular lie, and he stated 
it: "I hope nobody will try to take the easy way out and try to blame or 
otherwise accuse my family of contributing (to his crimes)." Don't worry, Ted, 
the media will swallow your easy way out -- "pornography made me do it" -- 
hook, line and sinker. 
</P>
<P>
The facts about violence and pornography clearly point away from the conclusion 
that Dobson wants to draw from the monstrous case of Ted Bundy. Adult 
entertainment is such an easy target, since many of its users are too timid or 
guilt-ridden to defend it. The implicit message of the Dobson-Bundy interview 
is that we should censor adult material. But censorship, once embarked on, has 
a way of growing out of control. Look to Iran, or the Soviet Union, to see 
about that. 
</P>
<P>
Does porn cause violence? Clearly, no. In laboratory settings, viewing 
nonviolent sexually explicit material actually reduces aggressive tendencies. 
This suggests that nonviolent pornography can help reduce the rate of rape. In 
fact, that is exactly what happened when Denmark legalized pornography: Rape 
rates went down, and then stabilized at a lower level. 
</P>
<P>
But that's "nonviolent" sexual material. Isn't all pornography getting more 
violent, as Dobson suggests? The Meese Commission itself did a study of the top 
dozen "men's sophisticate" magazines. The study concluded that there was a 
negligible violent content in these mainstream magazines -- only 0.6% of the 
total imagery! Yet Dobson repeatedly tars Playboy, Penthouse and soft-core 
material with the same brush that he uses for "slasher" movies. In fact, in the 
interview Bundy himself did not refer to pornography without the qualifier 
"violent." 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, James Dobson is offering the Ted Bundy interview on videotape as a 
fund-raising vehicle for his "Focus on the Family." It is a vile and cynical 
effort to inflame the censorship debate in America. The Big Lie of Dobson's 
argument is concealed, Goebbels-style, within his rant: If you read Playboy or 
Penthouse, you will turn into Ted Bundy. Does this make any sense to anyone 
outside the puritanical precincts of Dobsonland? 
</P>
<P>
It is fortunate for us all that the lies and killings of Ted Bundy have stopped 
forever. James Dobson's assault against the truth continues, however. Until the 
debate about censorship is conducted beneath the aegis of reason, and not 
manipulated behind a smokescreen of emotion,the First Amendment and its 
guarantees of free expression remain in danger.

FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, RICHMOND DECISION IS A DETOUR, NOT A DEAD END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

University School of Law, was the director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense 
and Educational Fund, Inc., for many years.Bill Lann Lee is an attorney in the

<P>
The Supreme Court's action in striking down a program for minority business 
contracts in Richmond, Va., has been called a disaster for affirmative action. 
We disagree. The court did not prohibit affirmative action generally or 
minority-business programs specifically. Rather, it spelled out steps that a 
state or local government must follow to establish a bona fide program of 
minority-business access to contracted work. The decision will not harm 
affirmative action in the long run. In the short run, it will result in another 
round of unnecessary hearings and litigation, and may very well discourage many 
minorities and women from starting their own firms. 
</P>
<P>
Minority-business enterprise programs, like other affirmative-action plans, are 
voluntary efforts by public or private institutions that earmark benefits for 
minorities or women. While often justified as a means of overcoming past 
discrimination, they also serve the beneficial purpose of closing the divisive 
gap between minorities and white males in our society. The Supreme Court has 
upheld affirmative-action programs in cases involving private employment, 
teacher hiring, state job promotion and university admissions -- the latter in 
part because students learn better in an environment of cultural diversity. 
None of these rulings are called into question by the Richmond decision. 
</P>
<P>
Government efforts in this area began with the Nixon Administration's effortsto 
develop minority-owned business. Congress enacted a 10% minority set-aside 
requirement for federally funded public-works contracts in 1977, which the 
Supreme Court upheld in 1980. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger's majority opinion 
cited congressional findings of disparities between the significant minority 
population and the minuscule number of public contracts given to minority 
firms, and held that race-conscious legislation was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The minority-contract program in Richmond was modeled on the federal statute 
affirmed in the 1980 decision. The Richmond City Council had relied on the 
congressional findings of a national problem and did not hold hearings 
specifically concerning Richmond. The only statistical evidence was in this 
startling disparity: Minority contractors had received less than 1% of 
Richmond's public contracts, although the population was more than half 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
The court's majority opinion, consistent with the approach of earlier 
affirmative-action opinions, set forth formal steps that would result in a 
valid set-aside program. While deferential to federal legislation, the court 
announced that it would strictly scrutinize state and local programs. These 
would survive strict scrutiny if there was a strong factual basis that the 
program was needed and if the program was narrowly tailored. 
</P>
<P>
The court found that in Richmond there was no proper evidence of local need for 
the program. There was no statistical evidence of the availability of qualified 
minority contractors or the number of minority firms that received subcontracts 
from white prime city contractors. As to narrow tailoring, the lack of 
statistical evidence of a shortfall between minority firms available and those 
awarded subcontracts meant that there was no evidence of any fit between the 
program's requirements and the conditions that gave rise to it. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion, although formalistic, is unexceptional in light of the court's 
earlier cases. The need for a proper factual predicate is not new or unique. 
States and cities with such programs must now follow the decision and hold the 
necessary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The decision's failing is more fundamental. The court ignores that the problem 
Richmond addressed was not local, but national. As the Burger court recognized 
in 1980, minorities and women throughout the nation have been excluded from the 
construction industry for years. The Richmond program was only a local version 
of the program upheld in 1980. It has long been recognized that state and local 
governments have a role in enforcing national policies. 
</P>
<P>
In the Richmond case the majority itself observed that Congress, under the 14th 
Amendment, may authorize "state action that would be foreclosed to the states 
acting alone." Richmond was not acting "alone"; the statute that the earlier 
court upheld established a national policy in favor of programs to encourage 
minority-business enterprise. Moreover, the city of Richmond, like almost every 
other state or local government, operates programs with federal grants that 
require conducting such programs alongside locally funded programs. Under the 
court's overly strict analysis, these must be unnecessarily justified on a 
local basis. 
</P>
<P>
There is a way to avoid the cumbersome city-by-city, state-by-state proceedings 
that the court now requires. Congress has ample authority (under the 14th 
Amendment and the Commerce Clause) to permit states and localities to adopt 
minority-business enterprise programs without the restrictions of the Richmond 
decision. Congress should address the failure of the court to recognize the 
national scope of the specific evil to which these programs are directed. 
Congress should expressly declare that state and local governments are 
empowered to establish minority-business enterprise programs on the same terms 
as the federal government itself.

CUMMINGS, PIERCE LEAD BUCKS TO 115-106 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Few thought the Milwaukee Bucks would have the fourth-best record in the 
National Basketball Assn. this far into the season. 
</P>
<P>
But they made believers of the Cleveland Cavaliers Tuesday night at Milwaukee. 
With Terry Cummings scoring 31 points and Ricky Pierce leading a late charge, 
the Bucks beat the Cavaliers, 115-106, for their fourth win in a row and their 
19th in their last 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are 3 1/2 games ahead of the third-place Milwaukee in the tough 
Central Division, and the Bucks have given Cleveland reason to believe they 
pose at least as tough a challenge as the Detroit Pistons, who are three games 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four best records are in the Central. Cleveland, best in the NBA 
is 34-11, the Pistons are 30-13, the Lakers 32-14 and the Bucks, who were 11-10 
after the first quarter of the regular season, are 30-14. 
</P>
<P>
One reason this victory is impressive is that the Cavaliers (14-9) have the 
NBA's best road record. Another is that, while the Cavaliers were at full 
strength, the Bucks were missing Sidney Moncrief and promising rookie Jeff 
Grayer. Both have knee injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Daugherty kept the pressure on the Bucks in the first half when he was 9 
for 12 and Cleveland led, 60-56. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings, who has scored 81 points in three games with the Cavaliers, scored 18 
in the first half to keep the Bucks in the battle. 
</P>
<P>
By early in the last quarter, the Bucks led by six. But Cleveland had an 8-0 
run and, with 7:30 remaining, led, 96-94. That's when Cummings and Pierce went 
to work. A 7-0 run was interrupted by two Cleveland baskets, but Pierce sank 
two baskets and Cummings another to make it 107-100 with 4:40 left. 
</P>
<P>
After losing 13 of their last 20 games last season and getting knocked out in 
the first round of the playoffs, the Bucks were not highly regarded going into 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Age was one reason. Jack Sikma was 33, both guards, Moncrief and Pressey, were 
over 30. There was age everywhere except for injury-prone Grayer, just out of 
Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
Until Del Harris, in his second season as the replacement for popular, 
successful Don Nelson, took 7-foot-3 center Randy Breuer out of the starting 
lineup and put 6-foot-10 Larry Krystkowiak in, the Bucks appeared destined to 
be an also ran. 
</P>
<P>
But Sikma thrived at center and Krystkowiak, in his third pro season out of 
Montana, became a giant at power forward. He has averaged 11.8 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know," Cummings said, "is that people are taking us seriously. We have 
known for some time we are capable of beating anybody. This was a big one." 
</P>
<P>
New York 117, Washington 105 -- On a night when they played poorly at home, the 
Knicks were fortunate to have Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley around to 
control the boards. 
</P>
<P>
And, when Ewing scored 12 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter, the Knicks 
won their 17th in a row at Madison Square Garden. They are 20-1 at home. The 
only loss was to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a terrible game," Ewing said. "But now, we have enough confidence to 
win. Last year we would have lost this one." 
</P>
<P>
The struggling Bullets have lost seven in a row on the road and are now 3-19 
away from home. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 109, Seattle 99 -- Obviously, the Nets fine performance against the 
Lakers Sunday night was not a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
With Dennis Hopson scoring 20 points and the other guard, Lester Conner turning 
in a triple-double at East Rutherford, N.J., they beat the SuperSonics for the 
second time in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Conner, who had 13 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in this game, had 13 
points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds last Tuesday at Seattle when the Nets ended 
the Sonics' 17-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets didn't do anything for the teamwork of the Sonics. Dale Ellis, who 
scored 34 points and Xavier McDaniel, who had 15, got into a heated argument in 
the dressing room. Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff sent the media out as 
tempers raged. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the fight was good," Bickerstaff said. "Maybe it will fuel the fire. 
The fight was caused by the frustration of losing." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 118, Charlotte 93 -- Michael Jordan was knocked flat by a stray elbow 
to the face and came up limping in the first quarter at Chicago. It turned out 
the elbow belonged to teammate Bill Cartwright. 
</P>
<P>
But, Jordan scored 14 points in the third quarter, eight of them in a row, to 
break the game open. Jordan, who scored 32 points and had five assists in 32 
minutes, sat out the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 96, Miami 77 -- The Heat played its normal road game, sinking only five of 
their first 25 shots and lost for the 21st time in 22 games away from home. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone, the No. 2 scorer in the NBA had 26 points for the Jazz, now only 
one-half game out of first in the Midwest Division, and John Stockton had 20 
points and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 114, San Antonio 99 -- Kenny Smith sparked a 17-2 burst late in the 
third quarter at Sacramento that put the Kings in front and Ricky Barry, with 
three bombs, kept them in front to end a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings trailed, 67-66, in the third quarter before Smith scored seven points 
in the rally. In the last quarter Berry scored 11 of his 23 points to keep the 
Kings in command. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 134, Dallas 125 -- Jerome Kersey scored a season-high 33 points and 
reserves Steve Johnson and Kiki Vandeweghe keyed a fourth-period rally to lead 
the Trail Blazers at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers, down by as many as 16 points, trailed 104-92 after three 
periods but Johnson scored nine of his 14 points in the opening 6 1/2 minutes 
of the fourth quarter, including two consecutive rebound baskets that capped a 
24-9 spurt and gave Portland a 116-113 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Vandeweghe scored nine of his 17 points in the final period as the Trail 
Blazers outscored Dallas, 42-21. DAN HAFNER

Doug Norvell of Oxnard caught a 16-pound largemouth while Mark Simpson, also of 
Oxnard, caught one weighing 15 1/4 pounds. "We're not seeing stringers with 
double digits," a lake spokeswoman said. "But we're not getting too many small 
fish, either."

FLEMING TAKES 142-PIN LEAD IN BOWLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rene Fleming of Oklahoma City, Okla., never looks at the scoreboard when she's 
bowling and it worked to her advantage Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
While Michelle Mullen of Matteson, Ill., bowled a 300 game, two 280s and a 269, 
Fleming concentrated on her fundamentals and threw strikes in more games. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming, a right-hander, averaged 231 a game to take a 142-pin lead over Paula 
Drake of Broken Arrow, Okla., in the Ladies Pro Bowlers tour $30,000 Canoga 
Park tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look at the scoreboard because I find it affects my form," Fleming 
said. "I used to guide the ball more when I knew I was winning and overpowering 
it when I was losing. Now, I just bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming went 12-3-1 in match play, earning 375 bonus points and has a 8,232 
total. Drake is second at 8,090 and Mullen third with 8,048. SEAN WATERS

WITH KITI OUT, VALHALLA NO MATCH FOR MONTE VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SPRING VALLEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rafid Kiti used to play basketball. Very well. When he sat on the bench, it was 
for a brief rest. Or maybe a few minutes at the end of a blowout. 
</P>
<P>
Now he sits in the second row. 
</P>
<P>
Kiti, a 6-foot-5 1/2 guard/forward, was greatly missed Tuesday by his Valhalla 
teammates, who were little match for host Monte Vista in a showdown of the 
cream of the Grossmont 2-A and 3-A boys' leagues. Monte Vista jumped out 
quickly in the first half en route to a 93-73 victory. 
</P>
<P>
And Kiti, dressed in street clothes, sat and watched. He worked on a Tootsie 
Pop and wondered: What if? 
</P>
<P>
Last week, while sitting in class, he began having trouble breathing. He went 
home. By the time he got there, he could hardly breath at all. 
</P>
<P>
Kiti's older brother, Steve, asked him what was wrong and decided to take Kiti 
to the hospital. There, he sat in the emergency room for 4 hours and breathed 
with help from an oxygen tank. The doctor diagnosed it as a collapsed lung and 
operated. Twenty minutes. The most pain Kiti had ever experienced. He spent 
nearly a week in the hospital. And now, in the middle of a senior season in 
which he is ranked fifth in the county in scoring, he has to sit and hope he'll 
be able to come back for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it happened," Kiti said. 
</P>
<P>
So what now? 
</P>
<P>
"I sit there watching, thinking (the team) could have done this, they could 
have done that." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Valhalla (14-8) could have done a lot more with Kiti's services. No 
question about it. And Monte Vista (14-4) took full advantage. As if Kiti's 
absence wasn't enough, Valhalla's other senior starter, Jon Scurlock, missed 
the game with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
So Monte Vista played a two-three defense, designed to stop Valhalla's Tony 
Clark. He still managed to score a team-high 28 points. Clark's performance was 
offset by Joe McNaull, Monte Vista's center, who scored a season-high 34 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista led by 20 at halftime and never again was challenged. With Kiti 
earlier this season, Valhalla beat Monte Vista by 12. 
</P>
<P>
So what if Kiti were healthy? 
</P>
<P>
What if nothing, says Valhalla Coach Manny Silva. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't think about Rafid," he said. "We've just got to go out there and 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Zach Peck, Monte Vista's coach, realizes things would have been different if 
Kiti, who averages 24.3 points a game, were on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," he said. "If Kiti had been in there it would have been a lot different. 
Although some of the other kids are blossoming now that he's gone." 
</P>
<P>
Bren Jacobsen scored 20 for Monte Vista, and Jeff Polinsky added 19. Tony Lee 
had 20 for Valhalla, including three three-pointers.

DIXON AND LINCOLN SLOW OLP'S RUN TOWARD TITLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Our Lady of Peace, leading by eight with 3 minutes left in the third quarter, 
looked as if it would defeat Lincoln for the second time and all but wrap up 
the City Central League girls' basketball championship. 
</P>
<P>
But Lincoln's 6-foot-2 sophomore center, Sheila Dixon, had different ideas. 
</P>
<P>
During the final 11 minutes, Dixon scored 13 of her game-high 29 points to lead 
Lincoln past OLP, 57-51, Tuesday at St. Augustine's gym and keep the Hornets' 
title hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
OLP (16-5, 6-1) is striving for its first league title after beginning 
basketball just three years ago. The Pilots still lead Lincoln (14-5, 5-2) and 
San Diego (9-10, 5-2) by a game with three left for each team. 
</P>
<P>
With league games remaining against San Diego, Hoover (1-12, 0-7) and Crawford 
(6-14, 2-5), OLP would have been in excellent position for the championship had 
it beaten Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"A win would have really iced the cake," said Carol Burnett, OLP's coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets, who lost to OLP earlier (57-56), this time used their overwhelming 
height advantage to dominate the boards, especially on the offensive end. 
Dixon, with 16 rebounds (eight offensive) was the leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more aggressive, and I got more rebounds today," said Dixon, who stands 
six inches higher than OLP's tallest starter. 
</P>
<P>
"(Height) is our biggest problem," Burnett said, "We don't have any. We have to 
be smart, and we have to be fast. Today, we weren't. And that's why we lost." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 29-27, at the half, OLP went on a 14-4 run led by Tammy Tavares (18 
points, seven steals, six assists). Lincoln then went on a 14-3 run to retake 
the lead, 47-44. 
</P>
<P>
It was 52-49, Lincoln, with 2:08 remaining, when Dixon got an offensive 
rebound, scored and was fouled. She made the free throw, then another quick 
basket after an OLP turnover, and Lincoln led, 57-49. Tavares' 15-footer with 
26 seconds left ended the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Keisha Mobley scored 12 points and had eight rebounds for Lincoln. Kathy Bashi 
scored 12 points, Deanna Beauparlante 11 and April Velk 10 for OLP. JIM

CORRESPONDENCE OF TWO MEN OF LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Selected Correspondence of Kenneth Burke and Malcolm Cowley, 1915-1981, 
edited by Paul Jay (Viking: $29.95, 448 pages) 
</P>
<P>
As a young man in my college years, I engaged in three furious and passionate 
exchanges of letters -- the love letters by which I courted my wife, the 
letters that my brother and I wrote to each other when he was in Paris and 
safely out of reach of the draft during the Vietnam War, and the letters in 
which I confided my literary ambitions to a friend from high school who had 
sought his own fortunes on a commune in Mendocino. I poured my heart and soul 
into those letters, sometimes writing two or three times a day. By the age of 
21, however, I found that I had spent my passion for letter-writing, and I 
turned to other literary endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
What we discover in "The Selected Correspondence of Kenneth Burke and Malcolm 
Cowley" is, among many other things, that the passionate letter-writing of 
one's adolescence and young adulthood can be sustained over a lifetime. Indeed, 
"The Selected Correspondence" is quite literally the life's work of two 
enduring figures of American literature. 
</P>
<P>
Cowley, the distinguished critic and literary historian ("Exile's Return"), 
studied at Harvard, volunteered as an ambulance driver in World War I, and 
spent his expatriate years in Paris. Kenneth Burke -- who has also 
distinguished himself as a critic ("A Grammar of Motives" and "A Rhetoric of 
Motives") as well as a poet -- studied at Ohio State University and Columbia, 
then dropped out to become "a Flaubert" in New York. Each man went on to invent 
himself as a force in the noisy literary battles of the 20th Century. Now we 
learn that their most impressive literary achievement may have been the letters 
that they have exchanged throughout their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Burke and Cowley, who befriended each other as high school students in 
Pittsburgh in the early years of the century, began an exchange of 
correspondence that has lasted more than 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The Selected Letters" is a sweeping intellectual history of the 20th Century, 
an intimate chronicle of the ideas and personalities and events that have 
informed and inspired the last four or five generations of American men and 
women of letters. At the same time, the book can be approached as a kind of 
two-headed autobiographical novel embodied in the letters exchanged by two 
bright, ambitious and accomplished men who find in each other a kindred spirit, 
a confessor, a goad, a fellow soldier in the literary campaigns, a comforter in 
old age. 
</P>
<P>
We first meet Burke and Cowley as brash and callow young men: "Last night I had 
the fullest hours of my life; I was at Theodore Dreiser's," Burke writes in 
1915. "I managed to worm myself shyly into conversation with Dreiser, but not 
until I had suffered the painful humiliation of finding myself addressing the 
air." 
</P>
<P>
We see them, too, as men grappling with the vagaries and frustrations of life, 
struggling to build careers and relationships and reputations: "I feel hollow 
as a sucked egg," Cowley complains in a letter from 1931, when he was working 
as literary editor of the New Republic. "If I could drop everything, go to 
Europe, write an ambitious book, I'd be cured quickly; but I don't want to drop 
the New Republic. . . . What's the answer?" 
</P>
<P>
And we see them in old age, mellow and reflective, enduring the losses of 
colleagues and loved ones, and struggling against new infirmities: "For both of 
us a mild consolation is that we're not just stumbling into the shadows," 
Cowley writes in 1980. "Both of us are better known in our 80s than we were in 
our 60s." 
</P>
<P>
The correspondence is filled with preening and posturing, carping and 
kvetching, and -- not infrequently -- the flatulence of inflated egos. ("I 
don't want to be a virtuoso," Burke writes in 1918. "I want to be a -- a -- oh 
hell, why not? I want to be a -- yes -- a genius.") Early on, we suspect that 
Burke and Cowley are writing for readers other than each other -- indeed, they 
were writing for the ages. By 1982, Cowley is ready to go public with the 
letters: 
</P>
<P>
"I made a review of my literary remains or disiecta membra and decided that 
they included material for nine, count them, nine books," Cowley wrote. "One 
project we ought to think about is the Burke-Cowley correspondence. By this 
time there's nothing like it in the American 20th Century."

Although revamped, given a new name, a new boss and a more traditional look, 
the syndicated "USA Today on TV" has been axed by WCBS-TV in New York and will 
leave the station at the end of the month. What the program didn't have was a 
new time slot in New York. WCBS has always aired it at 2 a.m., and Bob Jacobs, 
president of GTG Marketing, which syndicates the show, said he didn't consider 
its axing by the station a major worry since "at 2 a.m. it basically was off 
the air anyway." He said "only a handful" of stations have dropped the show 
since its premiere last fall. It currently is aired by 153 stations, including 
KNBC-TV in Los Angeles, where a spokesman said Tuesday "it is doing very well 
for us" since its move from KCBS-TV Channel 2 a month ago. ALEENE MacMINN

The space age Jetsons of TV fame are coming to the big screen. Universal 
Pictures and Hanna-Barbera Productions are making "Jetsons: The Movie," a 
full-length animated feature based on the popular television series of the 
1960s. The film will feature the original voices of the Jetsons: George O'Halon 
as George, Penny Singleton as Jane, Janet Waldo as Judy, Don Messick as their 
dog Astro, Jean VanderPyl as Rosie the Robot and Mel Blanc as Mr. Spacely. 
Patric Zimmerman has replaced the late Daws Butler as the voice of Elroy 
Jetson. In the film -- scheduled for release in the fall -- George gets a 
promotion and the family moves to a new neighborhood. ALEENE MacMINN

There's slow biz for "Les Miz," so come July 2, "Les Miserables" is folding its 
barricade at the Shubert Theatre and heading for San Francisco. Lagging 
attendance -- particularly in the balcony seats and on weeknights -- is the 
official explanation. However, the show is not scheduled to open in San 
Francisco until fall, and reports have circulated that the producers are 
closing here early to avoid paying the actors a per diem during a two- or 
three-month hiatus. But a spokeswoman for the show insists that's not so. 
"Equity rules allow for them not to be paid, so the producers really don't have 
to, and they haven't decided yet whether they will or not." Venues and dates 
aren't firm for the Bay Area staging, but a late-September or early-October 
opening is expected. ALEENE MacMINN

PIANISTS, BASSOONISTS FEATURED IN CHAMBER CONCERT AT GINDI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALBERT GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The slight variation from traditional programming that marked the third concert 
of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society series on Monday night 
was more an oddity than a genuine novelty. 
</P>
<P>
The composer was one Arcady Dubensky, a Russian born in 1890 but dwelling in 
New York for the most part of his life and scarcely known to fame. 
</P>
<P>
But Dubensky had a propensity, if not exactly a great talent, for writing music 
for unusual combinations of instruments. Thus, the piece that brought him to 
light on this occasion, in Gindi Auditorium of the University of Judaism, was a 
Prelude and Fugue for four bassoons, maybe the only known example of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
If it has competitors for the distinction it does not matter much, for the 
piece adequately served as a present exercise for David Breidenthal, Walter 
Ritchie, Patricia Kindel and Alan Goodman, an ensemble expert both individually 
and collectively. 
</P>
<P>
There was more substance but not necessarily more weight to Arensky's Piano 
Trio in D minor, Opus 32. The work was composed in 1894 and shows its age as a 
relic of light-hearted Romanticism. Its main purpose seemed to be to provide a 
comprehensive exhibition of the talents of the pianist, a chore lightly and 
zestfully disposed of by Zita Carno. Richard Leshin on violin and Howard Colf 
on cello successfully supported Carno. 
</P>
<P>
Antonin Dvorak's Quartet in E-flat, Opus 87, likewise starred a pianist, this 
time a guest in the person of Armen Guzelimian. 
</P>
<P>
Dvorak, whose star seems at times to decline but never actually sets, 
challenges the pianist with a part of concerto dimensions. Guzelimian never 
pushed himself out of the ensemble frame, but within those limits he gave a 
reading of splendid scope, ornamented with glitter and constantly disposed 
musically in the firmest ensemble terms. 
</P>
<P>
It was a rousing performance and the participants were repeatedly recalled. 
String players were Elizabeth Baker, violin, Ralph Fielding, viola and Barry 
Gold, cello. ALBERT GOLDBERG

<P>
HAMILTON STICKS WITH STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Hamilton, whose three day run at Alfonse's ends tonight, has become a 
symbol of the jazz world's youthful traditionalists. 
</P>
<P>
Despite exposure to (and respect for) all the vicissitudes of the tenor 
saxophone during the post-swing era, Hamilton continues to convey through his 
horn the warmly impassioned values one associates with the trend-setters of the 
1930s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
He growls not, neither does he honk or squeal. All one expects from him is the 
natural sound of this inherently beautiful instrument, brought to bear on some 
of the great standard songs. Very rarely does he play a tune that was composed 
after he was born. That was his modus operandi when he began his professional 
career in Providence, R.I.; today, at 34, now an international star, he remains 
happily unchanged in his ways. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever possible Hamilton joins with a group of his old Rhode Island 
associates. On this occasion, for the usual economic reasons, he is working 
with a local rhythm section. This seems much less restrictive when you consider 
that he is backed at Alfonse's by the Gerald Wiggins Trio, with Bob Maize on 
bass and Jake Hanna on drums. 
</P>
<P>
Wiggins is the all-purpose pianist, as rhapsodically compelling on a ballad 
like "Skylark" as he is rhythmically engaging in an up-tempo blues. As for 
Maize, a chorus by this limber performer is much more than a mere interlude 
between piano solo and saxophone finale; it's an event, an important entity in 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton chooses mutually compatible material: "I Hear a Rhapsody," "Candy," 
"But Beautiful." Without sounding derivative, he brings colorfully to life the 
verities established decades ago by giants like Coleman Hawkins and Ben 
Webster. Once described as a good wind who was blowing us no ill, he continues 
nobly to live up to that characterization. LEONARD FEATHER

KUDELKA'S NEW 'COMFORT ZONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Kudelka's important new work for San Francisco Ballet, "The Comfort 
Zone," is like an Olympic relay race, with the flame of the ballet -- its 
remarkable energy and invention -- held high while passed from team to team on 
stage at the War Memorial Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
This sense of a shared trajectory and destination, with a community of dancers 
making collaborative contributions en route, also shaped Kudelka's recent 
"Concerto Grosso" for the Joffrey Ballet and "Dreams of Harmony," his 
large-scale San Francisco Ballet success of 1987. Once again, Kudelka has found 
a dynamic paradigm for an ideal society and also made a statement about the 
continuity of classical dancing. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Comfort Zone," however, the young Canadian choreographer divides his 
cast into teams of three, a unifying structural premise drawn from the 
accompaniment: Beethoven's mighty Triple Concerto for Piano, Violin and Cello. 
</P>
<P>
Color-coded in Santo Loquasto warm-up suits, each team has its own movement 
signature -- a scooping/swimming gesture, perhaps, or a recurrent running lift 
-- but all are alike in their surge to cover space, their serene, 
non-competitive athleticism. 
</P>
<P>
But if three people make a stable, productive unit in Kudelka's world, he 
doesn't trust twos. As in his bitter study of sexual incompatibility, "The 
Heart of the Matter," the central pas de deux here details a nasty power 
struggle, one defined through formalized arm wrestling and resolved positively, 
it seems, only because Beethoven's music mandates a hopeful conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
In style, the workis propulsive, muscular, intense -- requiring the full 
technical resources of contemporary ballet in the trios plus considerable 
dramatic heat and extraordinary stamina in the turbulent duet. San Francisco 
Ballet responded Saturday with dancing that amply fulfilled Kudelka's thematic 
purposes without ever coarsening the musical line. Kudelka, after all, may be 
the obvious successor to Kenneth MacMillan in the realm of downbeat 
contemporary dance drama, but he works at a level of taste and sophistication 
(especially in his choice and use of music) that MacMillan has never reached. 
</P>
<P>
In the overlapping ensemble passages, some of the finest young dancers of the 
company flashed by, including Andre Reyes, Lawrence Pech and, once again, the 
prodigiously accomplished 20-year-old Elizabeth Loscavio. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the pas de deux belonged to Evelyn Cisneros and Anthony Randazzo 
-- she memorably stifled, rebellious, but fascinated with her partner/opponent 
in spite of herself and he superbly unyielding, manipulative, instinctual until 
combat yielded to accommodation. So much for modern romance. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Louis LeRoux led a polished account of the score, with Roy Bogas, Roy 
Malan and David Kadarauch the capable soloists. "Ballo della Regina" and 
"Rodeo" (both previously reviewed) completed the program.

PETITIONS FILED TO FORCE VOTE ON MIRAMAR LAKE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending a monthlong campaign, a citizens group that is attempting to block 
development on the hills north of Lake Miramar filed petitions with the San 
Diego city clerk's office Tuesday to force a citywide referendum on the 
3,360-home project authorized by the San Diego City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Save Miramar Lake Committee said they had gathered 45,000 
signatures on their petitions, enough, they believe, to qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the Miramar Ranch North project's developer, BCE Development, 
responded Tuesday afternoon by filing a lawsuit in Superior Court claiming that 
the petitions are invalid. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit against City Clerk Charles Abdelnour and City Manager John Lockwood, 
attorney James Milch claimed that the Save Miramar Lake Committee had violated 
city law by failing to attach to each petition the entire "development 
agreement" under which the 1,200-acre project would be built. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Seek Court Order 
</P>
<P>
Milch said he will seek a temporary restraining order barring Abdelnour from 
determining whether the petition drive succeeded in collecting the 25,593 valid 
signatures needed to place the development agreement on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate counter-move, an opposing community group presented the City 
Council with petitions that its chairman said contain the signatures of 43,000 
people who support the development contract between the city and BCE, primarily 
because the agreement calls for the developer to build a road, a library, two 
parks and fire station before the first new home is occupied. 
</P>
<P>
Those petitions, gathered by the Committee to Protect Your Community, have no 
legal effect on the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of action ended the first phase of a bitter intra-community dispute 
that has raged in the Scripps Ranch area since the council gave final approval 
to the development agreement Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Led by an impromptu organization of about 200 volunteers who gathered the 
signatures in less than 30 days, the Save Miramar Lake Committee effort is 
being watched closely, and in some cases abetted by, a handful of the city's 
slow-growth advocates and potential opponents of incumbent District 5 
Councilman Ed Struiksma. Struiksma, who faces re-election this fall is a strong 
backer of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign prompted BCE and some other interested developers to spend more 
than $100,000 to block the petition-gathering effort, said Bob Dingeman, 
chairman of the Committee to Protect Your Community. In a campaign financed 
largely by BCE, at least two letters in support of the agreement were sent to 
all 5,216 registered voters in Scripps Ranch in recent weeks, and tens of 
thousands of phone calls were made to voters city-wide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call for Withdrawal 
</P>
<P>
Dingeman's group also published newspaper ads in the San Diego Union and 
Tribune this weekend, urging signers to withdraw their names from the Save 
Miramar Lake Committee's petitions by sending Abdelnour a coupon contained in 
the advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper campaign netted just 140 responses, Abdelnour said in a memo to 
the council Tuesday. Under city law, no more responses can be accepted now that 
the Save Miramar Lake Committee has filed the petitions. 
</P>
<P>
The direct mail and telephone campaign produced 2,877 letters of support for 
the agreement from voters city-wide, Dingeman said. He gave those to the 
council Tuesday, along with his petitions in support of Miramar Ranch North. 
</P>
<P>
J. Gary Underwood, co-chairman of the Save Miramar Lake Committee, said he is 
"elated" that his group collected the 45,000 signatures within the 30 days 
allowed by city law, noting that nearly half of them were collected by 
volunteers. The rest were gathered by a private firm hired by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The opposition did a lot of tricks, and they used a lot of money," Underwood 
said. "It didn't make any difference. People make the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Claiming that his organization spent just $15,000 to $20,000 to collect the 
same number of signatures as his opponents, Underwood said: "That should tell 
the City Council and the mayor that this is something people feel very strongly 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Although the referendum calls for rescinding the entire development agreement, 
Underwood's group actually opposes just 658 homes, an industrial park and a 
road that BCE plans to build on the hills that slope down to Lake Miramar. 
Underwood said his committee would support construction of all 3,360 homes, as 
long as they are built on the northern side of the hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expensive Campaign 
</P>
<P>
If the referendum qualifies, the City Council has the option of moving to 
rescind the development agreement instead of placing it on the ballot. 
Underwood called for negotiations to accomplish that without an expensive 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I would start negotiations soon on a new development agreement without having 
to go to a referendum," he said. "But, if they want to take to the ballot, 
that's fine with us too." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute now appears headed for a courtroom, where a Superior Court judge 
will be asked to determine whether the Save Miramar Lake Committee conducted 
its campaign legally. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Ron Johnson, whose office would defend the city if it 
decides to fight BCE's lawsuit, said the city's lawyers are still researching 
Milch's claims. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that, "In looking at the position enunciated by Mr. Milch, we 
don't believe he's correct." 
</P>
<P>
Underwood, who received assurances from Abdelnour's office that his petitions 
were legal, called the lawsuit "totally frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the type of thing that people with big money always bring up, and they 
always lose," he said.

LOOP PROPOSAL AIMS AT EASIER I-5-ARDATH ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember old "Wrong Way Roy Riegels," the football player who scooped up a 
fumble in the 1929 Rose Bowl and rambled toward the wrong goal line? Well, 
here's a highway overpass for him. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego transportation officials are considering a proposal for a massive, 
$12-million U-turn that would provide the long-awaited link for North County 
commuters between Interstate 5 and the gateway to La Jolla: Ardath Road. There 
is now no northbound entrance to the freeway or southbound exit onto Ardath. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Configuration Is Not for Dummies 
</P>
<P>
This, however, is not a simple set of freeway ramps. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, motorists heading out of La Jolla in search of northbound 
Interstate 5 would first steer east on California 52. Half a mile down the 
highway, they would veer onto a sprawling, horseshoe-shaped overpass that would 
loop them back west. Heading the way they came, our intrepid drivers could then 
catch another ramp leading to Interstate 5 north. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, drivers speeding south on Interstate 5 would rumble east on 
California 52, hit the high-speed overpass and swing back west to pick up 
Ardath Road and zip into La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Riegels would be pleased. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan, which is to be studied later this year by the state 
Transportation Department, has yet to win many staunch boosters in La Jolla. 
Moreover, officials with Caltrans grumble that the big loop seems, at first 
blush, to be a bit wrong-headed. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to discourage the city from it, but they indicated they want us to go 
forward with a study," said Kurth Barnes, a deputy district director for 
Caltrans. "We just don't know how many people would really use it." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes noted that motorists can now accomplish the same U-turn by heading a bit 
farther east on California 52 and using the underpass at Regents Road. Others 
sometimes simply take 52 all the way east to Interstate 805, which joins 
Interstate 5 just a few miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
"This overpass would save maybe 1,300 feet of travel and maybe a couple of 
minutes over turning off at Regents Road," Barnes noted. "We'll have to weigh 
the costs against that sort of benefit. . . . But just studying it doesn't 
commit us to it. The final conclusion may be that it shouldn't be built." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Answer Is Sought 
</P>
<P>
Though well aware of the plan's shortcomings, San Diego traffic officials are 
eager to see some sort of solution to provide the missing link between 
Interstate 5 and Ardath Road. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of ramps has prompted motorists to flood a trio of streets leading out 
of La Jolla -- Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla Shores Drive and North La Jolla 
Scenic Drive -- in an effort to reach Interstate 5 via La Jolla Village Drive. 
</P>
<P>
About 55,000 vehicles a day are expected to use La Jolla Village Drive as 
nearby UC San Diego expands during the next decade. By providing a link between 
Ardath and the freeway, traffic on La Jolla Village Drive could be reduced by 
up to 20%, traffic planners predict. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see the advantages and the disadvantages of the U-turn," said Allen 
Holden Jr., deputy director of the city's transportation planning division. 
"It's not a simple one. I can see the benefit in providing those missing moves. 
But I can also see that this is a fairly expensive project and the U-turn is 
obviously not the same as providing the moves right there at the interchange." 
</P>
<P>
Given their druthers, most officials would much prefer a simple, direct link 
between Interstate 5 and Ardath Road, an idea that's been debated for more than 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On a Steep Grade 
</P>
<P>
But such a project is not so simple. Ardath Road sits well up a steep hillside 
from the freeway, and an entrance and exit would require gargantuan bridges 
that would cost more than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, the bridge project might gobble up so much room to the north that it 
would interfere with traffic using the freeway's intersection ramps at Gilman 
Drive, said Caltrans' Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, planners turned to the idea of the big loop off California 52. 
It is now one of more than 80 proposals on a list of road projects in the city 
to be addressed by council members Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Funding, meanwhile, could prove a less testy problem than winning backing for 
the big loop. The city already has begun setting aside $12 million for the 
project from money collected under Proposition A, the 1988 half-cent sales-tax 
measure designed to improve the county's transportation network. 
</P>
<P>
If the overpass proves infeasible, another solution might be construction of a 
"Texas U-turn" off California 52 at Regents Road, Holden said. That proposal, 
which could be completed at much less cost, would loop an extra lane through 
the underpass at Regents, allowing motorists to avoid a pair of existing 
left-turn signals while making a U-turn to head back west. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Loop Is Main Focus 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, planners are focusing on the big loop, but La Jolla residents 
have given the proposal a lukewarm reception. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Whittemore, La Jolla Town Council president, said the cost of the overpass 
would be less expensive than a direct link, but he is concerned that it might 
create a magnet for traffic from Pacific Beach. Before the big loop is built, 
he said, traffic planners should look toward improving the freeway entrances 
and exits in Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Want Extra Traffic 
</P>
<P>
"Pacific Beach doesn't like it when La Jollans drive through their town, and we 
don't want Pacific Beach residents coming through La Jolla to head north on the 
freeway," Whittemore said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Grizzle, a longtime La Jollan and a traffic engineering aficionado, is 
dead set against the loop. As she sees it, the overpass is "a Band-Aid 
approach" that will only send more cars reeling toward the notorious Ardath 
Triangle, the traffic-choked intersection between Ardath and Torrey Pines 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people in La Jolla think the idea is pretty silly, which is 
what I think," Grizzle said. "This overpass is not really going to help things. 
I just don't think it makes good sense, particularly when you're talking about 
spending that much money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The problem: There's no exit from southbound Interstate 5 onto Ardath Road, the 
main route leaving downtown La Jolla. And there's no entrance to northbound 5 
from Ardath. The loop might simplify life for people trying to get into and out 
of La Jolla.

CUTS COULD MIRE OCEANSIDE SAND PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
CITY WILL ENTER CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FRAY TO RESTORE FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1982, the Army Corps of Engineers has spent nearly $12 million trying to 
build an experimental sand-bypass system in Oceanside that would dredge the 
city's harbor and replenish sand on eroding beaches. 
</P>
<P>
After frustrating delays, city officials were hopeful that the innovative 
system, an alternative to costly traditional dredging, would at last begin 
operating in July. 
</P>
<P>
But, just when the city thought it had conquered the problems met early in the 
project, the future of the system is once again in jeopardy. Proposed federal 
budget cuts threaten to force the Corps of Engineers to abandon the job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan to Enter the Fray 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that, after investing this much time and money, they plan to 
enter the congressional budget fray in an attempt to save the project. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the proposed cutbacks for the coming fiscal year "ludicrous," Dana 
Whitson, Oceanside's special projects director, said city officials, including 
Mayor Larry Bagley and City Manager Ron Bradley, will travel to Washington 
later this month to meet with lobbyists and try to persuade Congress to restore 
the project's funding. 
</P>
<P>
"They've spent nearly $12 million total, if you include costs for development, 
design and engineering," Whitson said. "That they would walk away from it, 
quote, to save money, is ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
"If completed, this could have widespread application," Whitson said. "It has 
tremendous experimental value in that it could help decrease the cost of 
dredging harbors throughout the nation. We're gearing up for a big effort to 
get funding reinstated." 
</P>
<P>
In theory, the bypass system will use jet pumps to suck sand from Oceanside 
Municipal Harbor's silt-clogged entrance channel and dump it on beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The project was immediately beset by mechanical problems, but, since a change 
in contractors last fall, the system is expected to be in operation in July, 
Whitson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funding Gone in September 
</P>
<P>
However, unless planned budget cuts are restored, money will run out by the end 
of September, and the multimillion-dollar pumps will become useless, Whitson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my understanding that the funds were cut" by the Office of Management 
and Budget, Mayor Larry Bagley said. "After all the money that has been spent 
and the potential this project has, we feel that money has to be put back in." 
</P>
<P>
As a cost-saving measure to reduce the Army Corps of Engineer's budget, the OMB 
decided to eliminate the corps' operation and maintenance account for harbors 
with less than 25,000 tons of commercial activity a year, Whitson said. The 
sand-bypass system is financed through the operation and maintenance budget. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which was expecting to receive nearly $5 million through the account 
for the project and dredging, won't receive a cent if Congress approves the 
cuts, Whitson said. 
</P>
<P>
He argues that the proposed cuts unfairly penalize the project, which he says 
never should have been financed through the corps' operation and maintenance 
account in the first place. Typically, a project requiring substantial capital 
and construction is financed through the corps' construction account. 
</P>
<P>
But, because the bypass project was considered an alternative to dredging, 
which is considered a maintenance operation, it was budgeted under the 
operation and maintenance account, Whitson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Could Become Useless' 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping budget cuts will affect more than the bypass project; they will 
also prevent many of the state's harbors from financing needed dredging, said 
Thane Young, a lobbyist with the Washington-based Ferguson Co. 
</P>
<P>
The lobbying firm represents the city of Oceanside, the Oceanside Municipal 
Harbor District and the city's redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
"A categoric decision was made not to spend any money at all on operation and 
maintenance," Young said. "That means 21 out of 27 harbors in the state will 
not receive funds for operation and maintenance, which is basically used for 
dredging. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is continued for a number of years, those harbors could become useless 
as they silt over with sand deposits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young said lobbying to restore the funds must be successful by summer, when 
Congress is expected to pass appropriation bills for the fiscal year, which 
begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Perry Davis, a spokesman for the Corps of Engineers, said work on 
the project will continue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Happy With the Work 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody here is happy with what they're doing, and it appears that it will 
be ready to go by the First of July," Davis said of the work by Healy Tibbitts 
Construction, a San Francisco-based marine projects company that took over the 
Oceanside work last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The original contractor, Maecon Inc. of Irvine, was fired by the corps last 
April when it failed to get the system operating after three tries. 
</P>
<P>
"But, come October, we would have to stop it because there wouldn't be any 
money," Davis said.

COUNCIL APPROVES PRICE CLUB OPENING WHERE GATEWAY MARKETPLACE STOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday approved the opening of a new members-only Price 
Club in Southeast San Diego on property that formerly housed the Gateway 
Marketplace, which was forced to close after operating only nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wes Pratt, whose district includes Southeast San Diego, called the 
prospects of the Price Club succeeding where the Gateway Marketplace 
supermarket failed "considerably better." Pratt and other supporters of the new 
Price Club argue that the retail outlet will have a "regional draw" of 
customers that will benefit the economically depressed area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ownership Transferred 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego College of Retailing, a private, nonprofit business, owned the 
Marketplace. Under the terms of an agreement approved by the council, the 
college transferred ownership to the Price Club, which in return agreed to let 
the college stay in the building when it is refurbished. The school has agreed 
to include at least 25 young people from Southeast San Diego in its training 
classes each year. Pratt said the college will honor this commitment for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Price Club officials have also agreed to make 4,000 square feet of building 
space available for small, minority-owned businesses in the renovated complex. 
The officials have also pledged to hire people from the area, which has one of 
the highest unemployment rates in the city, Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with the original Gateway Marketplace was that it couldn't draw 
enough people from the community to support it. The Price Club has a regional 
draw that will bring people from throughout the county to the area. . . . 
Southeast San Diego can benefit from this influx because some of these 
customers will also shop here. . . . I look at this as an opportunity to 
continue to build the economic base in my district," Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$10 Million in Sales 
</P>
<P>
According to Pratt, initial estimates show that the Price Club will generate 
about $10 million in sales and $600,000 in sales-tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt said he still wants to attract a major supermarket to Southeast San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that the Price Club will be a signal to other investors to invest 
in the area. This is a major development and we hope that it can lead to a 
supermarket eventually opening in the area," said Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt said he is not sure when the Price Club will open, but said it will be 
before the end of the year. Price Club officials could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Marketplace opened last year with much fanfare and a $3.5-million donation from 
Price Co. Chairman Sol Price, founder of the Price Club, and 6 acres from the 
city. Supporters of the supermarket hoped that it would play a major role in 
the revitalization of Southeast San Diego by providing jobs and a badly needed 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
The store was closed in September, after officials announced that it was not 
getting the support of the community.

It is tempting to do our best to forget Ted Bundy, but this man and the lessons 
that his life offers must not be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy roamed the country on a 20-year trail of premeditated, sadistic violence 
-- a trail marked by rape, mutilation and murder. In a chilling final interview 
beforehis execution, he discussed at length some of the formative influences in 
his destructive life. The role of alcohol abuse is not surprising, but the role 
of hard-core pornography in his life sheds new light. 
</P>
<P>
Bundy documented his early exposure to hard-core pornography, saying that the 
material had a "crystallizing effect" on his violent tendencies and his 
eventual acting out of the fantasies he had seen depicted for so long. Bundy 
referred to hard-core pornography as the fuel for his fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
We could dismiss these conclusions as the 11th-hour ramblings of a psychopathic 
murderer if the evidence supporting them were not so strong. Most Americans are 
unaware of a 1985 study of 36 other serial murderers by the FBI. According to 
the final report of the 1986 Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, 81% 
of those studied "said their biggest sexual interest was in reading 
pornography." 
</P>
<P>
The words of Arthur Bishop, executed in June for having sodomized and murdered 
five boys (ages 4 to 13) in Utah, are particularly illustrative: "Pornography 
wasn't the only negative influence in my life, but its effect on me was 
devastating. I lost all sense of decency and respect for humanity and life, and 
I would do anything or take any risk to fulfill my deviant desires." 
</P>
<P>
Like Bundy, Bishop went on to describe his progress in the use and abuse of 
pornography. Starting with addiction to common pornography, he escalated to a 
need for more violent, degrading material and to an increased propensity to act 
out fantasies portrayed in such material. 
</P>
<P>
For those who have seen today's hard-core pornography, the progression is not 
surprising. The range of degradation includes the explicit depiction of 
simulated and real rape, whipping, bondage, torture, urination and bestiality 
(sex with animals). The material is a far, far cry from the airbrushed 
centerfolds of 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
When one sees the true content of the hard-core world, it's not difficult to 
believe that, as many researchers and studies have confirmed, it has 
contributed to the rise in the abuse and degradation of women. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Bundy, like so many who have gone unnoticed before him, reminds us that the 
time has come to stand together in opposing pornography. In most states, laws 
are already on the books to prosecute this material. The Supreme Court has 
declared unequivocally that obscenity is not a protected form of speech. Yet 
hard-core pornography remains readily available on the shelves of adult 
bookstores and so-called "family" video outlets. 
</P>
<P>
So what lesson can we learn from the death of a serial killer? That we no 
longer can remain ambivalent. Each of us must stand up and let our local, state 
and federal officials know that hard-core pornography destroys lives and must 
be stopped. The world of hard-core has already produced enough victims. How 
many more Bundys or Bishops must tell us of pornography's destructive role? How 
many more studies must be completed? How many more lives must be lost before we 
say enough? It's time that the charade of hard-core pornography's innocence 
ended.

ROBBINS RAISES MONEY FOR RACE THAT MAY NEVER BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under a recently enacted campaign reform act, state Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Tarzana) has become one of the first lawmakers in California to begin to 
raise money to run for a political office that does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins has declared his intention to seek a Los Angeles County supervisorial 
seat in the San Fernando Valley, which he hopes will be created through a 
lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department to force the supervisors to redraw 
district lines. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has claimed that the boundaries violate the federal 
Voting Rights Act by diluting the electoral strength of the county's Latinos. 
Robbins maintains that the five supervisors -- who deny the discrimination 
claim -- may eventually create both a Latino-dominated district in central Los 
Angeles and a new Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit is tentatively scheduled to go to trial Aug. 8. But Robbins is not 
waiting for the outcome -- he is off and fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
He filed his intent to run for supervisor with the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission on Jan. 30. In his filing, he cited 1992 as the 
prospective election year. He said he was advised by his attorney to pick the 
latest possible date for the election, although he expects the matter to be 
settled in time for a 1990 election. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins will begin raising money for the supervisorial seat at his annual 
birthday fund-raiser March 9 at the Century Plaza Hotel. He said this week that 
he expects to net about $200,000 at the dinner, featuring singer Rita Moreno. 
The $500-a-person event generally draws 500 to 600 people. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 73, the electoral reform measure adopted by voters in June, a 
lawmaker must declare his intention to run for a specific office before he 
begins raising money for the campaign. The money can only be used to campaign 
for that office. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, lawmakers could receive money for one office then transfer it 
to a campaign committee for another position. 
</P>
<P>
If the supervisors do not create a Valley district, Robbins said, he expects to 
return the proceeds from the birthday dinner to his donors. He has vowed not to 
run against Supervisor Mike Antonovich, a Republican who represents much of the 
Valley and who was reelected in November. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fund Use Restricted 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it is unlikely that Robbins would be able to use the funds for a 
campaign in another supervisorial district, said Sandra Michioku, spokeswoman 
for the Fair Political Practices Commission. But "we would have to review 
that," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Michioku said Robbins is not the only would-be candidate to file to raise money 
for a seat that does not yet exist. She said others have stated an intention to 
run for potential city council seats in unincorporated areas where proposed 
cityhood is being put before voters. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, 45, has said for months that he is ready to leave the Senate after 16 
years. He says his weariness with the Sacramento commute is compounded by a 
malformed Eustachian tube that has made flying increasingly painful for him. 
The Eustachian tube equalizes pressure on both sides of the eardrum. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Robbins said this week that he is unwilling to rule out a 
reelection bid in 1990 if a Valley supervisorial district is not created. Under 
Proposition 73, he could also open a Senate reelection committee and raise 
money for that race at the same time he pursues the supervisorial bid. 
</P>
<P>
He would not, however, be permitted to transfer money between the two 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not feel comfortable raising money for more than one office at one time," 
Robbins said. "I'm going pretty far on the supervisorial seat." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins is a potentially strong supervisorial candidate. He is a prolific fund 
raiser who has established himself as a champion of Valley concerns. He is also 
a wealthy attorney and real estate developer who has substantial holdings in 
Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he is one of the Legislature's most controversial members, a 
political maverick who has been criticized for courting special-interest 
contributions. He was also investigated by the state attorney general's office 
last year for using campaign funds to make large loans to business associates. 
The six-week review found no evidence that Robbins had broken any laws. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, chairman of the Senate Insurance, Claims and Corporations Committee, 
has also been mentioned as a possible candidate for the newly created post of 
state insurance commissioner in 1990. He reiterated this week that he would not 
close the door on that high-stakes race, either, although he would only 
consider it if the supervisorial option does not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins has nearly $400,000 in his Senate campaign fund. Under the Fair 
Political Practices Commission's interpretation of Proposition 73, he will be 
able to use much of that money for the future political race of his choice. He 
will be prohibited from carrying over only those amounts that exceed the 
individual and political action committee contribution limits established by 
the campaign reform act. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said he has not yet determined how much of this money will be available 
for a future campaign.

L.A. SUES TO FORCE 5 CITIES TO REPORT ON USE OF SEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for the city of Los Angeles have sued to force five smaller cities, 
including Glendale and Burbank, to file reports on their use of the troubled 
Los Angeles sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Those two cities, along with Beverly Hills, El Segundo and Culver City, have 
resisted enforcement of a law, approved unilaterally last year by Los Angeles 
officials, that requires cuts in any development that generates sewage. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Los Angeles said that the suit, filed Monday in Los Angeles 
Superior Court -- was prompted by the cities refusal to file periodic reports 
on new development, as required by the law. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the smaller cities contend that Los Angeles has no jurisdiction 
to meddle in their affairs. Burbank and Glendale officials reacted angrily 
Tuesday to the lawsuit and said they would fight it as unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Los Angeles is out of order in trying to do this . . . and I refuse to 
put up with it," Glendale Mayor Carl Raggio said. "It's hard for us to live 
next door to them when they act like a rogue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resentment in Burbank 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Mayor Al F. Dossin echoed the resentment: "I don't know where Los 
Angeles gets off telling us how to run our city." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Los Angeles, meanwhile, say the city has the legal power to 
protect the sewer system from a threatened breakdown due to excessive growth. 
No Superior Court hearing of the lawsuit has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials said last year that a disproportionate amount of waste 
was flowing into sewers from cities that contract to use the system. By 1991, 
city engineers have said, rapid growth threatens to flood the sewer system with 
more waste than it can safely treat. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Los Angeles City Atty. John F. Haggerty said the law requires the 
cities to file the quarterly reports, which are to contain information on new 
development, the number of building permits issued and the amount of sewage 
expected from those developments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Below Allotments 
</P>
<P>
Burbank and Glendale officials said they have contracts to discharge certain 
amounts of sewage into the Los Angeles system and that both cities are below 
their allotments. They added that they have taken steps to reduce the amount of 
waste sent to Los Angeles in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank has spent $14 million in a treatment plant that will handle about 5 
million gallons of sewage a day. The city sends about 7 million gallons of 
sewage a day to the Los Angeles Hyperion treatment plant, 3 million gallons a 
day less than allowed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Public Works Director Carl Brooks said he wondered how Los Angeles 
could impose restrictions on growth when Burbank was under its contracted 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Raggio said Glendale recently instituted a 10-year plan to regulate 
development. He added that Glendale sends only 15 million gallons a day out of 
the allowable daily 25 million gallons to the Hyperion plant. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles has mismanaged, not us," Raggio said. "Their problem is their 
problem."

AROUND THE VALLEY: 'I DON'T THINK WE'D SURVIVE IF WE HAD TO SLEEP OUT THERE 
TONIGHT.'

<P>
It was 6:34 p.m. Monday, and Dearlo Williams was staggering around the 
ornamental howitzer on the front lawn of the National Guard armory in Van Nuys, 
howling at the darkness and the bitter wind. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers flowing past on Victory Boulevard, snug in their autos, were deaf to 
Williams' shrieks. 
</P>
<P>
"I got diabetes. I get seizures! You gotta voucher me. Aaaaaaaaaooooooowwww! 
I'm not going to take this. Aaaaaaoooooowwww!" 
</P>
<P>
Vans from charitable organizations, loaded with more homeless street people 
like Williams, poured into the armory's parking lot. With the wary quickstep of 
those who know from experience that street theater can be a fuse burning toward 
heavy trouble, they hurried past him. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the armory of the 3rd Battalion of the 144th Field Artillery was being 
converted into a shelter for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
On cold nights, the state allots armory space to organizations that care for 
the homeless. It was already down to 41 degrees, and it was clear the night was 
going to bring cold that would have brass monkeys suing for workman's comp. 
</P>
<P>
Five National Guardsmen in camouflage fatigues hung out in an office just 
inside the door while workers from Los Angeles Family Housing, a charitable 
group, took charge of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"When they began the program last year, we were open one night and only one guy 
showed up," said Capt. John Smith, who heads a cadre of 12 full-time Guardsmen 
who run the armory. "But they got more organized and we've been open 35 nights 
now since Dec. 15." 
</P>
<P>
The cold wave had driven increasing numbers of the homeless to the armory -- 66 
on Friday, 83 Saturday and 105 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Childress, the shelter director, said one of his problems involves 
dealing with protests -- like Williams' -- over distribution of vouchers good 
for a night in a motel with a private bath, hot water, TV and privacy -- 
amenities rare in artillery armories. 
</P>
<P>
"We only get about four or five vouchers a night, and we save them for families 
-- mothers with little children -- or people with really serious physical 
disabilities, in wheelchairs or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, these guys know we have the vouchers, and they want to get into a 
motel. Some of them have some sort of physical condition. Some others just want 
to get what they can. It's pretty hard to tell one from the other, but we only 
have a few vouchers." 
</P>
<P>
Williams had shrugged off an offer by Childress' assistant, Thomas Chandler, to 
call an ambulance for him and went storming through the door to scream outside. 
</P>
<P>
The Guardsmen, preparing to go home, glanced out of their office occasionally 
but left the shelter's problems to Childress and Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
A bench blocked the entrance to a hallway leading to vaults where rifles, 
machine guns and grenade launchers are kept, guarded by strong locks and 
electronic alarms. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the deal is that the homeless don't go wandering around that part of 
the armory," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one Guardsman stays behind each night the shelter is open -- "just to 
make sure the building is still here tomorrow," said Staff Sgt. Rich Harbo, a 
part-time Guardsman from Canyon Country who volunteered for the duty. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler and two women, wearing black sweat shirts identifying them as "staff" 
in large white letters, ran a registration desk. Army-green cots stood in rows 
on the concrete floor of an airplane-hangar-sized drill practice room, 120 feet 
by 70. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Findlay and Clark Fraizer and Laura ("just Laura") sat together. 
</P>
<P>
Laura, 22, grew up in Pacoima. Findlay was raised in Van Nuys, and Fraizer said 
he graduated from Sylmar High School. 
</P>
<P>
Laura wore a pink sweat shirt with "Mom" in white letters. "It's a present from 
my 4-year-old son," she said. "I've been living on the streets for two or three 
years now, and he stays with my mother." 
</P>
<P>
"We had a van but it was destroyed by vandals," said Findlay, who was 
celebrating her 30th birthday. "It's nice here. Things are under control. It's 
bad enough living in a van in Pacoima, but it's worse if the shelter's out of 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Running around their cot was Johnnie Johnson, 18, who went to Van Nuys High. He 
and a buddy had shucked their shoes to play barefoot basketball at a hoop put 
in by the Guard staff for lunchtime games. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually sleep, like, behind apartment buildings or wherever," Johnson said. 
"The cold is ridiculous, man. I don't think we'd survive if we had to sleep out 
there tonight." 
</P>
<P>
By 11 p.m., it was 39 degrees. There were 112 bodies on cots in the vast room, 
dimly lighted and filled with the aroma of many feet. Most were asleep under 
army blankets. 
</P>
<P>
A mother with three children got the motel vouchers. Williams had abandoned his 
protest and was asleep under the basketball hoop. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler tried to catch some sleep in his chair at the registration desk. A 
gangly private had been found to relieve Harbo. 
</P>
<P>
Four miles away on Ventura Boulevard, under the bright lights of the La Reina 
center, John O'Brien settled in for the night on an RTD bench with a thin 
blanket and a screw-top bottle of wine in a paper bag. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too hard for him to get to a shelter," said a homeless friend. "He can 
hardly walk." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, who has watery, pale blue eyes and a white beard, objected. "I can 
walk," he said. "I was in the Army. Walked from France to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be OK," he said, refusing a ride to the shelter. "I've got the whole 
universe here with me," pointing to the sky full of frosty stars. 
</P>
<P>
By daybreak, it was 36.

PROFESSOR DENIES OFFERING A'S FOR RAFFLE-TICKET SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Cal State Northridge professor who is appealing his dismissal by the 
university denied Tuesday that he offered students A grades in exchange for 
selling raffle tickets to benefit a foundation that he ran. 
</P>
<P>
Eleazu S. Obinna testified at a state Personnel Board hearing at the university 
that he encouraged students to sell raffle tickets during the spring semester, 
but "I did not discuss sales for a grade." 
</P>
<P>
Obinna was fired for allegedly offering his students A grades for selling $100 
worth of raffle tickets on behalf of the United Crusade Foundation, which 
Obinna founded in 1982. He will continue to draw his salary until his appeal is 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Obinna, a 17-year tenured professor in the Pan-African studies department, 
testified that the allegations might have come from a female student who was 
distraught about her breakup with Obinna's son. 
</P>
<P>
Obinna added that he had angered the former school administrator who initiated 
the investigation by criticizing him a year earlier in letters to CSUN 
President James Cleary and California State University Chancellor W. Ann 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Obinna, who holds a doctoral degree from UCLA, said that the 82 students 
enrolled in his upper-division field studies course were required to attend 
field trips, perform 45 hours of community service and write a term paper. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, four students had testified that they were told that the only work 
required in the course was to sell raffle tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Obinna said the university failed to follow its own guidelines by announcing in 
a press release last April that he was being fired for his part in the alleged 
grade-selling scheme. Obinna said he first learned of his pending dismissal 
from television and newspaper reports. 
</P>
<P>
Former instructor Willie Bellamy was also fired for allegedly telling his 
students that they could earn A grades by selling raffle tickets. The raffle 
was subsequently canceled and the money has been held in trust pending its 
return to ticket buyers, Obinna said. 
</P>
<P>
The raffle money was to have been used to create a community center in Pacoima 
to assist black residents, Obinna said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing before Administrative Law Judge Byron Berry is expected to conclude 
today. No decision is expected for at least two months, Berry said.

LACKADAISICAL CSUN MANAGES TO DISPOSE OF CAL STATE L.A., 72-70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
Looking for a quiet place to study Tuesday night? The Cal State Northridge gym 
was the place to be. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there was a basketball game going on, but that wasn't going to bother any 
of the 217 in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Why, it was so quiet inside that Darren Matsubara, Northridge's point guard, 
claimed he heard echoes when he called out a play. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even have to yell," Matsubara said. "I'd just say, 'One' and everyone 
in the gym could hear me." 
</P>
<P>
Another person who could be heard loud and clear all night was Northridge Coach 
Pete Cassidy, who was none-too-pleased with his team despite its 70-62 victory 
over Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Going hard is a habit and we didn't display that at all tonight," Cassidy 
said. "We got a 12-point lead and we figured it was over. We relaxed, and I'm 
not pleased with that at all." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Matadors, their opponent wasn't exactly bursting with 
energy, either. 
</P>
<P>
If, as Cassidy said, going hard is a habit, coasting was the trend in this game 
-- even for those not directly involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand what happened," CSUN forward Alan Fraser said. "It was like 
everybody was in second gear and couldn't get out of it. The band . . . . I 
think they were playing at half-speed, too. It was ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L.A.'s record should have been the most obvious excuse after the 
game. The Golden Eagles came in 3-17. 
</P>
<P>
Still, those on the CSUN side denied taking their opponent lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried about this one," Matsubara said. "The one thing I didn't want to 
happen was a team that wasn't going to the playoffs to hurt us in the 
standings. I didn't want to look back and say, 'that loss to Cal State L.A. is 
the reason we're not going.' " 
</P>
<P>
And with the current state of the standings in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn., every game takes on that much more importance. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (13-8) is 4-4 in CCAA games, leaving it in a four-way tie for third 
place with Chapman, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Cal State Bakersfield. The 
Matadors play back-to-back games at home Thursday against Bakersfield and 
Saturday against San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L.A. came in having won its first conference game in 23 tries last 
Saturday against Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
That win, plus earlier strong performances against the CCAA's top teams, UC 
Riverside and Cal State Dominguez Hills, had Matador players and coaches 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
But the concern never manifested itself on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kept throwing people in and out to see if anyone wanted to play hard -- 
and smart," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Matsubara: "We had no emotion at all. I kept saying to the guys in the 
huddle, 'We keep playing around like this and they're going to sting us.' " 
</P>
<P>
It almost happened. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge coasted along with a double-digit lead for much of the second half 
before Cal State L.A. clawed back into contention. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors led, 61-53, with five minutes left, but the Golden Eagles 
outscored CSUN, 9-3, during the next two minutes to trim the margin to 64-62. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was clinging to a three-point advantage with 17 seconds left when a 
foul -- and a few choice words from Coach Henry Dyer -- took the Eagles out of 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
Jemarl Baker of CSUN was fouled by Omar Bray with 17 seconds left, prompting 
Dyer to take out his frustration on the officials who hit the CSLA coach with a 
pair of double technicals and kicked him out of the gym. 
</P>
<P>
Baker made all four free throws to stretch CSUN's lead to 69-62. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L.A. closed the gap behind the play of forward Rhodney Moore, who 
scored a game-high 22 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Matsubara and Fraser led Northridge with 14 points each. Derrick Gathers added 
11 and Baker 10. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Bowser missed his third game because of a sore hip that seems to be 
getting worse. He will be examed by a doctor again today.

CLU OFFENSE MAKES TOKEN APPEARANCE IN LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The beleaguered offense of Cal Lutheran's basketball team awoke just long 
enough to make it interesting Tuesday night, but it never posed a real threat 
to visiting Westmont College. 
</P>
<P>
Westmont spent most of the second half protecting a 20-point halftime lead, and 
the Warriors eventually held onto 12 points of that advantage to claim a 95-83 
Golden State Athletic Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
For Cal Lutheran, the loss was the latest disappointment in a season full of 
letdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"We've really been digging holes for ourselves," Cal Lutheran Coach Larry Lopez 
said. "I don't know why it takes us so long to get going." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the 20-point deficit, Cal Lutheran's offense finally got untracked 
at the outset of the second half. The Kingsmen then made a spirited -- if 
futile -- charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been playing real well lately, except for about seven minutes of each 
game," said Lopez, whose Kingsmen dropped to 8-15, 2-7 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran cut Westmont's lead to seven in the last three minutes, but the 
Kingsmen could get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen outscored Westmont, 24-14, in the first 10 minutes of the second 
half, but just when Cal Lutheran closed to within striking distance, the 
Warrior offense rose up and took charge. 
</P>
<P>
Westmont Coach Chet Kammerer said that he was surprised at how tenaciously the 
Kingsmen played during their rally. 
</P>
<P>
"We missed some good opportunities inside in the second half, but we just could 
not stop them late in the game," Kammerer said. "We put as much pressure on 
them as we could." 
</P>
<P>
Kammerer said that the Warriors' ability to control the boards in the first 
half was the key to their halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Westmont (14-9, 8-1) outrebounded Cal Lutheran, 18-12, in the first half and 
35-29 in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran stayed close through the first 10 minutes of the game, but the 
Warriors spent the second 10 minutes burying Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 18-18, with 10:25 left in the half, Westmont launched a 
23-4 run to take a commanding lead. Chris Hahs made two free throws after 
center Mike Demeter's intentional foul to give Westmont its biggest lead, 
46-24, with 1:48 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Steve deLaveaga scored a game-high 34 points for Cal Lutheran, which dropped 
its third game in a row. Jeff Logsdon added 13 points and Charles Jackson and 
Dave Rowlands had 12 and 11 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kelly came off the bench to lead Westmont with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly has played in five games after sitting out 10 games because of a stress 
fracture in his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Smidt added 16 points for the Warriors, who have won six in a row and 11 
of their past 13. Peter Partain added 15 points for Westmont and Dan Swanner 
had 14. 
</P>
<P>
With five games remaining for Cal Lutheran, Lopez said that the Kingsmen's 
chances of making the NAIA District 3 playoffs are slim. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have to win all five games to even have a chance," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen play host to Azusa Pacific on Saturday.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
MYERS BECOMES BOLD AROUND THE BASKET DURING ROYAL SURGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One gets the feeling Russell Myers would rather pass on all this attention 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal High forward with the baby face and baby jumper, with the man-sized 
body and man-sized inside presence, is -- can it be? -- shy. 
</P>
<P>
And, for a shy guy, the 6-foot-5 junior did the worst possible thing: He scored 
81 points and grabbed 37 rebounds last week in Marmonte League wins over Simi 
Valley and Newbury Park and a loss to Westlake. He made 27 of 37 field-goal 
attempts and 27 of 35 free throws in the process and put the Highlanders 
(11-12, 6-5 in league play) in a position to make the playoffs for the first 
time since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Myers is absolutely thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty big goal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Coach Joe Malkinson smiles and breathes deeply when asked for an 
explanation of Myers' personality. He leans back on his chair. He breathes 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoy Russell," he says finally. "Even though he scored 81 points 
last week, he doesn't tell everyone he scored 81 points. You wouldn't even know 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want the human side of him, he's very happy-go-lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Or go to his best friend on the team -- J. P. Ouellette. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more relaxed, sarcastic, kinda mellow," Ouellette said. "Russell just 
lets things come to him." 
</P>
<P>
Like the ball, for instance. Against Simi Valley, Myers made his first nine 
shots and scored 31 points as the Highlanders beat their intracity rival for 
the first time in the past nine tries. Then, on Friday, he scored 32 and had 16 
rebounds against Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
Myers, however, would prefer to deflect the credit to Royal guards Greg Laranjo 
and Ouellette. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got the ball more, so I scored more," Myers said. "All I had to do was 
make a little layup. Nothing to it." 
</P>
<P>
Bunches of little layups, actually, but Myers isn't counting. He's made lots of 
those, starting with the times his father, Craig, a coach at Royal in the late 
'70s, would open the school gym for his son. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was little, he always had a key to the gym," Russell said. "Probably 
the biggest thing with my development is I've been around it so long." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Myers played basketball at Simi Valley High, continued on at Ventura 
College and Cal Lutheran and had a tryout with the Chicago Bulls of the 
National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
So Russell gets his court sense from dad? 
</P>
<P>
"We talk a lot, because he knows what he's talking about," Russell said. 
"Usually I don't listen. I've got to learn to listen better." 
</P>
<P>
He's listening to someone. Myers is nearing the top of school record lists for 
points in a season, points in a career; game, season and career rebounds; free 
throws attempted and made; blocked shots; even charges taken. And, he is still 
just a junior. 
</P>
<P>
Myers is quick for a player of his size. His slew of uncontested layups are as 
much a tribute to his speed as they are to the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"This year he looks like an athlete," Malkinson said. "He always had a quick 
first step, but this year he has really improved. I don't think anyone has a 
chance against Russell at 15 feet because he's got such a quick first step." 
</P>
<P>
Malkinson reasons that as the team gets better, so does Myers. And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Russell has probably been the impetus, but J. P.'s floor game has 
improved, everybody's really has," he said. "We put it in the big picture 
rather than telling Russell or J. P. they've got to carry us. In the offense we 
run, Russell gets himself open and the guys get the ball to him." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Myers doesn't need all that attention anyway.

LUCAS PROVIDES SPARK FOR NORTHRIDGE WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paula Lucas has spent much of her two years on the Cal State Northridge women's 
basketball team as a seldom-used reserve. But, because of injuries, her role 
has grown more important lately. 
</P>
<P>
And so have her contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas scored a game-high 23 points and grabbed six rebounds to lead the Lady 
Matadors to an 85-64 victory over Cal State Los Angeles on Tuesday night at 
CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was 9 of 17 from the field and 5 of 6 from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Arlotto added 20 points and seven rebounds for CSUN, which improved to 
16-6, 4-3 in California Collegiate Athletic Assn. play. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L. A. (13-10, 4-3) shot 39.1% and committed 25 turnovers. Trisha Maly 
led Golden Eagle scorers with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Lupe Quintana, a three-time all-conference selection for CSLA, was held to only 
two points and nine rebounds in 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Cavalin, CSUN's leading scorer and rebounder, made her first appearance 
after missing three games because of a pulled groin muscle. Cavalin scored nine 
points and grabbed eight rebounds in 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In other women's games: 
</P>
<P>
Biola 66, Cal Lutheran 47 -- Heidi Griffith scored 17 points, but she received 
little support from the rest of her teammates in an NAIA District 3 loss at Cal 
Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Biola led, 34-26, at halftime and held the Regals (6-14, 4-7 in district play) 
to 21 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Biola's Donna Pollema scored a game-high 41 points as her team improved to 
6-14, 4-7. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental 71, UC San Diego 67 -- Forward Joelle Orton scored a game-high 22 
points to lead Occidental in a nonconference game at Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
Genevieve Wilkinson (11), Sharon Bruner (12) and Jennifer Giller (15) all 
scored in double figures for Occidental (5-11). 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge 9, Chapman 0 -- Northridge, ranked No. 5 in the nation in 
Division II, coasted in its season and California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
opener at Chapman. CSUN swept all six singles and all three doubles matches. In 
singles, Allison Kincaid (6-0, 6-1), Kalico Yandall (6-3, 6-1) and Brenda 
Pantano (6-0, 6-2) won handily.

DOLLAR CLOSES MIXED IN THIN TRADING

<P>
The dollar finished mixed against major foreign currencies Tuesday in trading 
marked by speculation about interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said trading was thin because of holidays in Asia and 
West Germany, and other European markets were uncertain after Monday's 
interventions by central banks to bring down the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were reluctant to buy or sell dollars in large amounts without having a 
clear idea of whether the Federal Reserve is likely to push up short-term U.S. 
interest rates, which would help the dollar, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The currency markets probably want to get a picture of the interest rate 
situation here in the U.S.," said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst at Smith 
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The main event affecting the dollar this week is likely to be President Bush's 
budget speech to Congress on Thursday, dealers said. Reassuring words about 
cutting the federal deficit would bolster the dollar, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar eased to 129.50 Japanese yen from Monday's 129.60. In 
London, the dollar traded lower at 129.43 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 
129.48 yen from 129.41. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the pound rose to $1.7377 late Tuesday from $1.7345 on Monday. Later 
in New York, the pound rose to $1.7370 from $1.7366. 
</P>
<P>
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared to Monday's late rates, 
included: 1.8716 West German marks, down from 1.8725; 1.5893 Swiss francs, down 
from 1.5898; 1.1828 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1823; 6.3680 French francs, 
down from 6.3705, and 1,364.8 Italian lire, down from 1,366.5. 
</P>
<P>
Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared to Monday's late rates, 
included: 1.8720 West German marks, down from 1.8810; 1.5913 Swiss francs, down 
from 1.5969; 6.3700 French francs, down from 6.3950; 2.1140 Dutch guilders, 
down from 2.1200; 1,365.50 Italian lire, down from 1,370.50, and 1.1813 
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1840. 
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion prices were higher in Europe and lower later in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The late gold price in London was $392.55 an ounce, up from $388.95. In Zurich, 
Switzerland, gold rose to $392 bid from $387.50. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery fell 
to $392 from $394. Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold rose to 
$390.10 from $391.90.

Financial markets in Hong Kong were closed for the Chinese lunar new year

REVIVED DOW SURGES 26.07, CLOSES AT POST-CRASH HIGH

The rally on Wall Street that began at the start of the year took on new life 
Tuesday, propelling the Dow index to a post-crash closing high in heavy trading 
and snapping a four-day retreat. 
</P>
<P>
News that General Motors split its stock and raised its dividend started the 
revival, while a growing belief that President Bush will announce steps to trim 
the budget deficit when he addresses the nation Thursday night added to the 
overall enthusiasm on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 26.07 to 2,347.14, its highest close 
since the October, 1987, crash. The last time the average closed higher was 
Oct. 15, 1987, two trading days before the crash, when it stood at 2,355.09. 
</P>
<P>
GM, a component of the Dow index, soared 4 3/8 to 93 7/8 in heavy trading. The 
jump accounted for 6.25 points of the gain in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 11 to 4 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with Big Board volume rising to 
217.26 million shares, up from Monday's 150.98 million. 
</P>
<P>
Another surging stock that lent support to the rest of the market was Union 
Carbide, which jumped 2 1/8 to 30 1/8 and was the most actively traded issue on 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
Carbide, often the subject of takeover rumors, was once again said to be a 
target, but analysts said a chunk of the buying Tuesday came from investors who 
wanted to take advantage of the chemical company's upcoming dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Baker, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton, said Wall Street had 
expected the Federal Reserve to raise its discount rate Tuesday, but when the 
anticipated hike failed to materialize, stocks rallied further. 
</P>
<P>
Other factors contributing to the advance were Congress' vote to kill a pay 
raise for House and Senate members and top Bush Administration officials, and 
positive reaction to President Bush's announcement Monday of a bailout plan for 
the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't get much more positive news across the board," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Wall Street's recent gains have come from its own upward momentum as 
investors have jumped into the market to avoid missing the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case again Tuesday, said Alfred E. Goldman, a market analyst with 
A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's developments "created all kinds of intestinal problems for those on 
the sidelines," Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the market appeared to have returned to an upward track after its 
pause, which included a 10-point drop in the Dow index Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The market was ripe for a good rally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Big gainers Tuesday included Ford Motor, up 1 1/8 to 55 7/8, and IBM, up 1 to 
127 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
A big loser was Burlington Resources, which fell 2 3/4 to 46 3/8. On Monday, 
the stock soared 10 points after Pennzoil said it acquired 8% of the company's 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities rose 30.094 to close at 2,947.239. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 1.83 to 168.02. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index closed up 3.82 to 346.41; its 500-stock 
composite index rose 3.59 to 299.63. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index was up 3.19 to 409.19; the American Stock Exchange 
index picked up 1.90 to close at 326.38. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, Japanese share prices firmed to a new record close Tuesday after 
falling from earlier levels on profit taking in surging sectors such as 
construction. The Nikkei 225-share index rose 51.90 to 31,880.65. 
</P>
<P>
On the London Stock Exchange, shares recovered after Monday's drop to end at a 
post-crash high. The Financial Times 100-share index closed at 2,072.8, up 28.5 
from Monday's close.

SHORT-TERM BONDS MAKE MOVE NOT SEEN SINCE '82

<P>
Bond prices advanced Tuesday as the government began its regular quarterly sale 
of new securities by auctioning $9.76 billion in new three-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbed 9/16 point, or $5.60 per $1,000 
face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, 
fell to 8.79% from 8.85% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
That left the 30-year bond trading at a lower yield than the three-month 
Treasury bill, something that hasn't happened since April, 1982. The 
three-month bill yielded 8.82% in late activity, down from 8.83% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term rates normally are higher than short-term rates because investors 
demand a premium for keeping their money tied up longer. The reverse situation 
reflects, some analysts say, how the Federal Reserve has been pushing up 
short-term rates to keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
In the first stage of the quarterly auction, the Treasury sold three-year notes 
at the highest level for that maturity since August, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The average yield was 9.18%, up from 8.59% at the last auction on Nov. 8, 1988, 
and the highest since three-year notes averaged 9.53% on Aug. 6, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
rose 3/32 point, intermediate maturities rose by between 7/32 point and 11/32 
point and long-term issues rose 19/32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, rose 2.84 to 1,139.85. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials were up. Moody's investment grade corporate 
bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.29 to 300.26. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds rose 1/32 point. The average yield to maturity held at 7.57%, the same as 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills fell 4 basis points to 8.52%. 
Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.95% as the discount fell 8 basis points to 
8.46%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 9.07% as the discount fell 6 basis 
points to 8.41%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.875%, unchanged from late Monday.

FEARS OF SHORTAGE KEEP COFFEE PRICES PERKING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Coffee futures rallied for the fourth straight day Tuesday as reawakened fears 
of tightening supplies stirred New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, copper futures prices gained following an extended string of 
losses, gold and silver futures fell, livestock and meat, energy, and grain and 
soybean futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures settled 1.55 to 3.34 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in March at $1.4134 a pound, the first close above the psychologically 
important $1.40 level since Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The March contract has risen by 9.23 cents a pound, a gain of nearly 7%, over 
the past four sessions. The advance has been fueled partly by concerns about 
the tight availability of coffee for delivery against the March contract and 
partly by fears that a continuation of the sharp price decline witnessed during 
the last two weeks of January could trigger a cutback in producer shipments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Cause Shortages 
</P>
<P>
The International Coffee Organization, a price control group composed of the 
largest coffee producer and consumer countries, would be required to order a 
1-million-bag reduction in exports of robusta coffee beans if an indicator 
based on the 15-day moving average of cash coffee prices falls to $1.20 a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
The indicator stood at $1.2259 at the close of business on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the indicator would have to drop even further before affecting 
shipments of the arabica coffee beans traded in New York, "it makes some people 
apprehensive that if the cut were imposed, it would lead to shortages," said 
Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a general labor strike in Brazil, the world's largest coffee 
producer, also contributed to the bullish tone. Brazil's two major unions have 
scheduled a meeting on next Monday to set a strike date. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures surged on New York's Commodity Exchange after falling sharply in 
five of the six previous sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the advance to technical factors and increased buying of 
actual copper. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 1.15 to 2.60 cents higher, with March at $1.315 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver futures slipped on the Commodity Exchange in reaction to the 
dollar's gains against other major currencies and the continuing outlook for 
low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $1.40 to $1.70 lower, with April at $395.50 an ounce; silver was 
3.9 to 4.7 cents lower, with March at $5.89 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Hog futures prices steadied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange following 
Monday's steep decline, but pork belly futures fell again on selling linked to 
an unexpected increase in hog slaughters. 
</P>
<P>
Most cattle futures moved higher, boosted by strong cash markets. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle settled 0.22 to 0.45 cent higher, with February at 75.67 cents a 
pound; feeder cattle were 0.15 cent lower to 0.15 cent higher, with March at 
84.50 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.40 cent lower to 0.28 cent higher, with 
February at 42.30 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 0.22 cent to 0.92 
cent lower with February at 38.60 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Among energy futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas 
Intermediate crude oil settled 0.15 to 0.32 cent higher, with March at $17.70 a 
barrel; heating oil was 0.01 to 0.49 cent lower, with March at 49.87 cents a 
gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.04 cent lower to 0.52 cent higher, with 
March at 49.26 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean and corn futures advanced late in 
response to firmer cash prices for soybeans and soybean meal. Wheat finished 
narrowly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 2 cents lower to 1.75 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in March at $4.2725 a bushel; corn was 0.50 cent to 1.50 cents higher, 
with March at $2.67 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1.50 cents lower, with March 
at $2.14 a bushel, and soybeans were 1 cent to 3.50 cents higher, with March at 
$7.575 a bushel.

Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s 1988 net income increased 39% from last year to $387 
million. Sales rose to $4.77 billion, up 7%. The New York broadcast and 
publishing concern said its broadcasting operations reported a 14% gain for the 
year, although ABC Television Network reported a slight loss because of special 
event programming such as the Winter Olympics, the mini-series "War and 
Remembrance" and coverage of the U.S. presidential election. The company also 
said publishing earnings fell 12% because of sluggish advertising demand at 
specialized publications.

JAPAN'S KODO DRUMMERS LEAD PACK IN INTENSITY OF TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a safe assumption that the late Keith Moon never got up at the crack of 
dawn for a 10-kilometer run, even when he wasn't out touring with The Who. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true of Cream's Ginger Baker, Ratt's Bobby Blotzer and all the 
other great rock 'n' roll performers whose prowess behind the drums was -- or 
is -- often rivaled by their prowess at partying all night and sleeping all 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Not so for the famed Kodo drummers of Japan, whose full-bodied drumming 
technique is considerably more intense, and exhausting, than Western styles. 
Accordingly, their vigorous, samurai-like training regimen leaves little time, 
and even less stamina, for partying. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not rock musicians, we're professionals," company director Takashi 
Akamine said. "We devote our lives to training and maintaining our physical 
fitness." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. The 16 Kodo drummers -- 11 of whom will be appearing Friday and 
Saturday at Symphony Hall in downtown San Diego -- live together on Japan's 
tiny Sado Island, where they do get up each morning at the crack of dawn for a 
10K run. 
</P>
<P>
After a quick shower, they take turns cooking breakfast and cleaning house. And 
then, promptly at 9 a.m., it's off to the rehearsal hall for another eight 
hours of grueling physical and mental conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Kodo drummers are trained to attack their drums with their entire bodies, and 
with a Zen-like concentration. Their aim, after all, is to play the drums so 
that listeners not only hear, but also feel, the "tribal heartbeat 
reverberating through their bodies," according to Akamine. 
</P>
<P>
This "heartbeat" is pounded out on five different traditional Japanese drums, 
of assorted sizes, and a Chinese gong. The main drum is the miyadaiko, which 
was first used more than 700 years ago in 
</P>
<P>
ancient Japanese religious ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Performances are often quite frenzied, Akamine added, climaxing in the "Odaiko" 
finale in which two drummers, clad only in loincloths, flail a giant 900-pound 
drum -- carved from the trunk of a single tree -- with large clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Technique-wise, there are better rock drummers, better jazz drummers, better 
classical percussionists," Akamine said. "But what makes us unique is both the 
intensity and the fact that we maintain this intensity for the entire 
performance, which generally lasts an hour and 40 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
To add variety, the Kodo troupe also uses several nonpercussive instruments, 
such as the koto, or Japanese harp, and the shamisen, or Japanese banjo. 
</P>
<P>
The musical selections range from traditional Japanese instrumentals to 
contemporary pieces written by the drummers themselves, sometimes in 
collaboration with outsiders like the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra, the Berlin 
Radio Symphony Orchestra and American jazz drummer Max Roach. 
</P>
<P>
The art of Kodo drumming is rooted in ancient Japan, when village boundaries 
were established by the farthest distance at which a drum could be heard. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe was established in 1971 as Ondekoze, or "demon drummers," by a 
Japanese philanthropist who wanted the island of Sado to be known for something 
other than farming and fishing, Akamine said. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as they graduated from high school, most of the young people went to 
the big city," Akamine said. "So, to stop people from leaving -- and to attract 
other young people to the island -- he started a traditional performing arts 
group." 
</P>
<P>
The company spent most of its early years training and developing its act, with 
performances limited to the Far East and, starting in 1975, occasional visits 
to the United States and France. 
</P>
<P>
After a name change to Kodo, or "heartbeat," in 1981, the drummers began 
regularly touring the United States, Europe, South America, and even Australia. 
Highlights include sell-out performances at the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival in 
Los Angeles and, a year later, the Edinburgh International Festival in Scotland 
and London's Queen Elizabeth Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have had nothing but kind words to say about the Kodo drummers. The 
Guardian in London hailed their performance as "an exhilarating revelation of 
the emotional and spiritual power of the drum." Le Monde, the Paris daily, 
said, "Their drums are globes of fire, cannons, extraterrestrial suns, and the 
men that play them perhaps are gods." 
</P>
<P>
And according to the New York Post, "There is both innocence and tradition 
embodied in this drumming, as well as brazen virtuosity and a subtlety of 
detail. Its rhythms really do move the tribal blood still running through our 
urban veins." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a rock group, we're not on TV or in the movies, but we're very 
popular among certain people," Akamine said. "And we seem to be getting more 
popular all the time."

SAN DIEGO ROCKERS' REVUE SPOOFS GENRE'S EXCESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They go by the name of Country Dick Montana with Mojo Nixon and the Pleasure 
Barons, starring Dave Alvin. And they're not out to change the face of rock 'n' 
roll, just to give it a playful slap or two. 
</P>
<P>
The three principals in this 14-member, San Diego-based revue, after all, have 
devoted their careers to stripping rock 'n' roll of its excesses: Montana, as 
drummer and occasional lead singer with local roots-rockers the Beat Farmers; 
Nixon, another hometown boy, with his manic talkin' blues; and Alvin, as 
founder of Los Angeles rockabilly revivalists the Blasters and, later, the 
All-Nighters. 
</P>
<P>
So now that all three have a little time off, they've decided to join forces 
and, with tongues firmly in cheek, celebrate those excesses on a three-week, 
17-city concert tour of the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The Pleasure Barons' stage show, and costumes, promise to be as tacky, sleazy, 
and cheesy as anything you'll see in a Las Vegas showroom. And their repertoire 
includes such melodramatic lounge-lizard standards as Elvis Presley's "Burning 
Love," Clarence Carter's "Patches," and a medley of songs made famous by the 
King of Camp himself, Tom Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Las Vegas, the next generation," the gruff-voiced Montana said 
solemnly. "There's plenty of room in all these songs for us to turn them into 
huge, gaudy production numbers. As soon as you hear them, you're going to be a 
happy person, and you're going to leave thinking you got a lot more than you 
bargained for." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Montana and Nixon, other San Diego members of the Pleasure Barons 
include Beat Farmer Joey Harris, Comanche Moon's Paul Kamanski, former DFX2 
frontmen David and Douglas Farage, ex-King Biscuit Blues Band saxophonist Jon 
Viau, singer Caren Campbell, and Tom Cook, who doubles on trombone and 
pedal-steel guitar. Joining them will be a second saxophonist and the three-man 
rhythm section from Alvin's All-Nighters. 
</P>
<P>
The revue's tour begins next Wednesday in Redondo Beach and includes two local 
stops: Feb. 16 at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach and March 4 at the 
Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa. The last date is March 5, in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
After that, it's time to get serious again, with Montana and Nixon heading out 
on the road with their own bands and Alvin returning to the studio to record 
his next LP. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really the only chance we get to do it all year, due to conflicting 
schedules," Montana said. "We are, however, looking forward to doing a Phase 2, 
sometime next year, and actually taking this thing to Las Vegas, where it 
belongs." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ron Shane is a 30-year-old San Diegan with an academic background in 
classical literature and a musical future in heavy metal rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Shane has a doctorate in romantic poetry from the University of California at 
Santa Barbara and now teaches English at San Diego State University, Grossmont 
College and San Diego City College. 
</P>
<P>
He's also the lyricist, singer and choreographer for Mental Anarchy, a new 
local heavy metal band inspired as much by the deathless prose of Shelley, 
Byron and Rimbaud as by the deafening strains of Guns 'n' Roses, Motley Crue, 
and Def Leppard. 
</P>
<P>
It's a perfect match, Shane said. 
</P>
<P>
"If Shelley and Byron were alive today, they would love to take their poetry 
and set it to heavy-metal music," Shane said. "They were into undermining the 
lower-realm rationality that governs people and pulls people back, the 
enslaving mediocrity that most people are encumbered by. 
</P>
<P>
"And, since heavy metal is the only thing we have left in our society that 
hasn't been quelled, that doesn't conform to the norm, they would laud me for 
finding them a forum that espouses the same sense of mental rebellion and 
recalcitrance which they expressed through their writings." 
</P>
<P>
The nucleus of Mental Anarchy is five members of veteran San Diego rock band 
Stallion and revolves around the vision of Shane. But, before the group makes 
its official debut sometime in April at the San Diego City College Theater, 
Shane hopes to expand his vision by recruiting more songwriters and musicians, 
as well as between 12 and 14 dancers. 
</P>
<P>
The first in a series of auditions will be held Saturday, beginning at 1:30 
p.m., at Jack LaLanne's American Health Spa in the Midway District. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: The late Roy Orbison's first album of new material in a decade, 
"Mystery Girl," was posthumously released last week by Virgin Records -- less

Southern California will get a taste of Soviet vanguard art March 25, when the 
Dorothy Goldeen Gallery in Santa Monica opens a six-week show of works by Igor 
Kopystianski and Svetlana Kopystianskaya. The couple were darlings of Sotheby's 
ground-breaking auction last July in Moscow, where rock star Elton John bought 
one work by each of the two artists for a total of $151,360. (The couple's 
token take from the auction was about $200,000, 60% of the hammer price.) In 
the Goldeen show, Kopystianski will exhibit works from two series: "Restored 
Paintings," oils on canvas that are manipulated to appear old and worn, and 
"Interiors," three-dimensional constructions made of painted canvases. 
Kopystianskaya will exhibit oil and tempera paintings covered with narratives 
in Cyrillic script, intended as an ironic comment on the dominant role of 
literature in Russian education and culture. ALEENE MacMINN

FAA, PILOTS CLASH ON USE OF SIGHT RULE OVER CERRITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could vigilant pilots -- using the "see and avoid" rule to scan for other 
aircraft -- have avoided the fiery 1986 midair collision over Cerritos in which 
82 people died? 
</P>
<P>
Probably, Federal Aviation Administration officials say. They contend that the 
regulation is the best way to separate commercial jetliners from smaller planes 
not fitted with sophisticated instrument-flying equipment. 
</P>
<P>
No way, counter some aviation experts and many pilots. "It's antiquated at 
best," said airline Capt. Don McClure, head of the Air Line Pilots Assn.'s 
accident investigations board. "There are physical limitations over what a 
pilot can do given the duties in the cockpit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Restricted Airspace 
</P>
<P>
It is a lingering controversy that has been rekindled as the civil trial over 
responsibility for the Aug. 31, 1986, collision between an Aeromexico DC-9 and 
a small Piper Archer airplane enters its third month. More than 50 lawsuits 
have been consolidated in the Los Angeles federal court case brought by the 
families of the crash victims against the FAA, Aeromexico and the estate of 
William K. Kramer, 53, the pilot of the small plane. 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that Kramer's plane was in airspace restricted to only jetliners 
on approach to Los Angeles International Airport. But his liability is not a 
major issue since his estate, consisting of a $1-million insurance policy and 
$20,000 in other assets, will not cover the damages sought by the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the plaintiffs have accused the FAA and Aeromexico of gross 
negligence, hoping to collect millions of dollars from the two defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The trial's testimony has centered so far around the FAA and whether Walter 
White, the air traffic controller guiding the DC-9 in the minutes before the 
accident, saw the Piper Archer on his radar screen. White testified that it was 
not there. 
</P>
<P>
Several radar experts have testified that data stored in FAA computers shows 
that Kramer's plane should have been visible on White's radar scope. Thus, they 
said, White was negligent by not advising the jetliner of the small plane. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the FAA has gone on the offensive by calling several experts who have 
testified in recent days that Kramer and the DC-9's crew were not vigilant 
because they apparently did not look out for each other. 
</P>
<P>
If they had been, two experts testified, the pilots involved would have seen 
each other and avoided a collision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flying in Straight Lines 
</P>
<P>
They noted that both planes were flying in straight lines, taking no evasive 
action, and that the Aeromexico crew made no radio transmissions about other 
planes in its area for 90 seconds before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why Kramer, a pilot unfamiliar with the Los Angeles airspace, ended up in 
airspace reserved for jetliners, FAA witness Bernard Coogan, an accident 
investigator who has been a pilot for 40 years, replied: 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to account for it is that he was careless. He was not diligent." 
</P>
<P>
Another FAA witness, John Olson, vice president of flight operations for 
Braniff International Airways, added that the DC-9's pilot, Capt. Antonio 
Valez-Prom, 46, and co-pilot Jose Hector Valencia, 26, also had duties to see 
and avoid. 
</P>
<P>
"The Aeromexico crew was not vigilant," Olson concluded. "(If it had been) . . 
. they would have seen the Piper Archer." 
</P>
<P>
Given the sunny skies at the time of the accident, the pilots should have seen 
each other at a distance of 5 to 7 miles and taken evasive action, Olson added. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA's insistence that the "see and avoid" rule is valid has elicited heated 
rebuttals that date back to the 1920s, when the regulation was first imposed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Physical Limitations' 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't work," Aeromexico attorney Frank Silane said outside the court. "It 
has physical limitations with the function of the eye and a pilot's workload in 
the cockpit." 
</P>
<P>
Reminded of Olson's conclusion about the Aeromexico crew, Silane replied: "It's 
easy to say that in a vacuum when you're not confronted with cockpit duties at 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago lawyer George Archer, who is representing the families of the DC-9's 
crew, said that the FAA rule was implemented at a time when planes traveled 100 
m.p.h. Now, he said, jetliners move at 500 to 600 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
McClure, who has investigated accidents for the pilots association for 17 
years, said that pilots have frequently complained that a complete scan of the 
windshield could take as long as one minute -- looking in prescribed sectors 
for about 10 to 15 seconds each. That's a particularly long time when a plane 
may travel one mile in as little as 14 seconds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Given a jetliner pilot's other duties, McClure concluded in a telephone 
interview, "you can't do both." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorney Steven J. Riegel, who is representing the FAA, 
pointed out that there have been adjustments that make the rule applicable 
today. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the introduction in the early 1970s of traffic control areas, 
setting aside specific airspace for commercial jetliners over large urban 
areas, was an important improvement. Los Angeles, which has seen a deluge of 
small planes competing for airspace with jetliners, was one of the first areas 
in the country to restrict the use of airspace. 
</P>
<P>
Also, radar control systems have been instituted to help separate planes, 
especially in heavily congested areas like Los Angeles. These three-level 
systems track aircraft during takeoffs and landings, approaches and at cruising 
altitudes. 
</P>
<P>
The case is expected to go to the jury by early March.

2 HOUSES USED IN DRUG DEALING SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities on Tuesday seized two houses that they say were used in the drug 
dealing by an organization that has controlled the distribution of cocaine in 
the northeast San Fernando Valley for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The houses at 11649 Fenton Ave., Lake View Terrace, and 11236 Adelphia St., 
Pacoima, were taken in what Los Angeles and federal authorities called the 
start of a joint effort to follow up on raids and arrests at drug houses with 
civil seizure of the properties. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said the two houses were operated by the Bryant Organization 
until they were closed Sept. 29 when a 200-officer task force raided 15 
locations where members of the ring lived or sold drugs.

ACTOR RECUPERATING FROM THROAT SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oscar-winning actor Sean Connery, the original screen James Bond, was resting 
comfortably at home in Los Angeles after an operation to remove a benign growth 
from his throat, his agent said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Connery "had a node on his vocal cord that was successfully removed," his 
agent, Peggy Stevens, quoted Connery's wife, Micheline, as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery was performed about a week ago. Stevens said, "Any reports of 
cancer are absolutely not true." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have instructed Connery, noted for his distinctive Scottish brogue, not 
to use his voice for up to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens would not say where the surgery was performed, adding that Connery is 
at home and preferred to remain secluded. 
</P>
<P>
Connery won the Academy Award for best supporting actor in 1988 for portraying 
an aging Chicago police officer in "The Untouchables."

BRADLEY CHOOSES EX-HUD OFFICIAL AS HOUSING CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl D. Covitz, undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development in the Reagan Administration, was appointed Tuesday by Mayor Tom 
Bradley to head the Los Angeles City Housing Authority Board of Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley chose Covitz, 49, to replace former Chairman Alvin Greene, who was 
forced to resign in December after he missed commission meetings for six 
months. At the time, Bradley relieved Deputy Mayor Grace Davis of duties as 
liaison to the Housing Authority and reprimanded his chief of staff, Mike Gage, 
for failing to keep him informed of Greene's repeated absences. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected to easily confirm Covitz's appointment. He 
returned to Los Angeles last month to run Landmark Communities Inc., his 
Beverly Hills development firm, and continues to work on solutions to the 
savings and loan crisis as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a good background in dealing with issues of public housing," Bradley 
said at a City Hall press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this will strengthen the commission and will give us the kind of 
experience that I think is going to be very helpful as we deal with the 
problems that face that authority in the months to come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ideal Partner' 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Robert Farrell praised the selection. 
</P>
<P>
"If one were to ask for a more ideal partner in helping us to deal with the 
housing crisis in the city, the mayor could not have found a more capable 
person," said Farrell, chairman of the council's Grants Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member commission sets policy and provides oversight for the Housing 
Authority. The agency maintains 33,000 residential units in 21 projects and 
several rent-subsidy programs in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Federal conflict-of-interest regulations may prevent Covitz from making direct 
appeals to HUD officials in Washington for additional subsidies, Bradley 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Covitz had been HUD undersecretary since 1987. He was responsible for the 
day-to-day activities of HUD and was involved in taking over operations of the 
troubled Chicago Housing Authority. He said he is not familiar with housing 
needs in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I need a little bit of time to research, understand and be briefed on 
the issues," Covitz said. "I know the overall objective as it relates to 
providing a helpful, safe, sanitary living environment for the tenants." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Departure From Policy 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move, Bradley said he advised several commissioners of his plans 
to name Covitz chairman. In most cases, the mayor lets his commissioners select 
the chairman of city boards. 
</P>
<P>
"It is no reflection on anyone else sitting on the commission," Gage said. "It 
is that this guy . . . obviously knows a great deal about the system and the 
process and will be an enormous asset to the Housing Authority." 
</P>
<P>
Acting Chairman Louis Janicich said he had not been informed of Bradley's 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any problem with it," Janicich said. "He is qualified and has 
great HUD experience. At this point in time . . . I will go along with it."

U.S. VOWS MORE INDICTMENTS IN CAMARENA CASE; 
</P>
<P>
BIG MEXICAN TRAFFICKERS EXPECTED TO BE CHARGED IN DRUG AGENT'S 1985 MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the fourth anniversary of the brutal slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique 
Camarena in Mexico, federal prosecutors said Tuesday that they will return 
indictments this year against the men, believed to be powerful Mexican drug 
lords, responsible for instigating the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking publicly for the first time since a federal court jury convicted three 
lower-level drug traffickers in the 1985 abduction and murder, Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Jimmy Gurule said he expects a federal grand jury to return indictments 
before the end of the year against "the people that were involved in the actual 
decision-making, who ordered (the murder)." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview before the start of a memorial service commemorating Camarena's 
kidnaping in front of the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara on Feb. 7, 1985, Gurule 
was critical of the new Mexican government's appointment of an attorney 
general, Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, who was governor of the state of Jalisco 
at the time of Camarena's murder there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City 'Owned by Traffickers' 
</P>
<P>
"He was the governor in 1985 when Guadalajara was just a haven for narcotics 
traffickers, was virtually under siege, and in a sense owned by traffickers," 
Gurule said. "This was going on under his watch for all intents and purposes, 
and to go ahead and appoint him as your head national law enforcement officer, 
I think, is a slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
Gurule, who is prosecuting the case in the United States, was also critical of 
Mexican authorities' failure to complete prosecution of Rafael Caro-Quintero, a 
powerful Guadalajara drug baron, who is believed to be one of those who ordered 
Camarena's killing after the narcotics agent led a series of damaging raids on 
his marijuana plantations. 
</P>
<P>
Caro-Quintero was indicted by a federal grand jury in the United States, but 
authorities never sought to extradite him after the Mexican government vowed to 
prosecute him as a Mexican citizen in Mexico City. Caro-Quintero has been 
jailed since shortly after the murder but has been convicted only on drug 
charges. A verdict in his murder trial is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, that's very disturbing on our part, that while they're 
resistant to letting him come here for trial, saying he's a Mexican national 
and he'll be aggressively prosecuted there, the fact remains that nearly four 
years have gone by and we're still waiting," Gurule said of Caro-Quintero. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Convicted in U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Convicted in the United States last year in the Camarena murder were former 
Mexican Police Officer Raul Lopez-Alvarez, Rene Martin Verdugo-Urquidez, a 
suspected associate of Caro-Quintero, and Jesus Felix-Gutierrez, who supposedly 
headed Southern California operations for the Caro-Quintero organization. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers said the three were tried as "scapegoats" for powerful drug 
barons being protected by the Mexican government. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's memorial service was held at the Church of the Immaculate Conception 
in the Pico-Union District, one of the most heavily drug-impacted neighborhoods 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 people, including much of the Los Angeles Drug Enforcement 
Administration force, sang hymns and offered prayers for an agent they called a 
martyr to the nation's war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Kiki Camarena was too gentle to live among wolves," said Charles Lugo, 
intelligence supervisor for the DEA in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Father Greg King, pastor of the church, recounted how he had been approached by 
drug peddlers near the church, even in his cleric's collar. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to remember Enrique Camarena, to remember his dedication, to pray 
that he accepts life eternal, but also to remember that we have a grave 
problem, that it is a social problem facing not just individuals, not just 
families, but our nation," King said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is fitting that tonight when we pray for Enrique Camarena, we pray for one 
another. We pray for strength that as a people we can stand together against 
the living death of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reminder to Public 
</P>
<P>
Lynn White, spokeswoman for a public relations firm that coordinated the 
memorial, said the service was intended to remind the public of the need to 
pursue Camarena's killers and halt drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexican 
border. 
</P>
<P>
"It is essentially a memorial service in Mr. Camarena's honor for the 
dedication to the war on drugs -- for what he started, which is yet 
unfinished," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has been retained by Michael Mann, creator of the television series 
"Miami Vice" and "Crime Story," who is producing a documentary series on the 
Camarena case based on writer Elaine Shannon's book "Desperadoes."

You can't get divorced or sentenced to state prison or found liable for a 
traffic accident next Monday, because all California state courts will be 
closed to celebrate Abraham Lincoln's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
While the judges in Los Angeles County are playing golf, however, their clerks 
are scheduled to work. Except the clerk, Frank S. Zolin, who will be out

It was the Legislature that closed the courts for Honest Abe's day, with a new 
law designed to make sure that courts in every county all celebrate the same 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
That, the legislators hoped, would shush complaints from lawyers who drive from 
county to county without knowing who's open for business and who's off 
celebrating one of the courts' lesser-known 12 annual holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The new law provides that "officers and employees of the courts shall observe 
only judicial holidays," including Lincoln Day. 
</P>
<P>
But county officials claim that the 200 or so court clerks -- not to mention 
deputy sheriffs, district attorneys and public defenders who people the courts 
-- are employees of the county, rather than employees of the state court. 
</P>
<P>
And county employees, the county employers say, cannot have the day off, unless 
their bargaining units negotiated for it in their contracts. The clerks didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody brought it up. I don't think anybody was aware of the statute," said 
Anthony R. Segall, one of the clerks union's two lawyers. "The Coalition of 
County Unions negotiated for 15,000 employees, and only 200 are clerks. So it 
just got overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
No problem. Court clerks know their way to the courthouse and they sued. 
</P>
<P>
So Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin will be asked Thursday to permit 
the clerks to observe Lincoln Day on Monday as they feel the new state law 
requires them to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be enslaved on the birthday of the Great Emancipator!" said 
Charles Fooks, president of the clerks union, Local 575, American Federation of 
State, County and Municipal Employees AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Plea to Heart 
</P>
<P>
Segall will argue the clerks' case alone Thursday because his partner, Glenn 
Rothner, took the plea for a holiday to heart. 
</P>
<P>
"In honor of Lincoln Day," Segall said, "Glenn went skiing." 
</P>
<P>
Because courtrooms, and some whole courthouses, will be closed throughout Los 
Angeles County on Monday, Zolin has arranged for two work sites -- Torrance and 
the downtown courthouses -- where clerks can assemble to file documents and 
perform other catch-up tasks. He expects about 60 of the clerks to show up, 
with others taking the day off as a vacation day. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Zolin said, the merger of the county clerk's office with the court 
administrator's office begun in 1985 will be complete, and such controversies 
will be history. About 130 "judicial assistants" who do the same work as court 
clerks but were hired under the new combination office, for example, are 
considered court employees and will have Monday off. 
</P>
<P>
Zolin has circulated a memo informing all clerks hired under the old system 
that they are welcome to switch status at any time, with the same pay and 
benefits but no bargaining unit and with Lincoln Day off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newest Title 
</P>
<P>
Despite his newest title of county clerk, Zolin has no doubt about his own 
right to take Monday off for golf in the judges' tournament. 
</P>
<P>
He is also executive officer of the Superior Court and jury commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"In both those jobs I am clearly a court employee," he said, "and two out of 
three titles have to be right."

RAPIST WHO ASSAULTED 11 GIRLS GETS 127-YEAR TERM

A former Los Angeles karate instructor was sentenced to 127 years in state 
prison on Tuesday for a series of assaults, including rapes, on 11 girls in and 
around South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ernest Hiroshige imposed the sentence on 
Somesha Shinda, 36, who also went by the name John Coleman. Shinda was 
convicted in October of 22 felony counts of rape, kidnaping, child molestation, 
forced oral copulation and false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
During Shinda's trial, in which all the victims testified, prosecutors said 
Shinda typically approached his victims as they were en route to school in the 
morning, brandishing a toy pistol. Shinda allegedly took many of his victims to 
a secluded back yard and assaulted them. 
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew Mullen, Shinda raped or otherwise 
sexually assaulted five of the girls. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks took place in South-Central Los Angeles, Lennox and Inglewood from 
September, 1987, through Feb. 25, 1988, when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, a mother noticed Shinda seemingly working on his car near her home 
as she watched her 13-year-old daughter walk to school. When the mother saw 
Shinda jogging after her daughter, she followed, taking down Shinda's license 
plate number, according to Dottie Pachot, a Los Angeles Sheriff's Department 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, she came upon her disheveled daughter, her underwear in her hand, 
saying she had been assaulted. Later that day, police arrested Shinda as he was 
about to leave his home.

INTEL LOSES NEC TRIAL BUT CLAIMS ANTI-PIRACY VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Striking a blow to the fortunes of high-technology pirates and copycats, a 
federal judge in San Jose ruled Tuesday in a case pitting Intel Corp. against 
its Japanese rival NEC that a key element in computer chips is subject to 
federal copyright laws. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William Gray handed a partial victory to NEC, ruling that 
the scrappy Japanese firm did not infringe on an Intel copyright for the 
microchips that act as the brains in first-generation IBM personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
But Intel claimed a broader victory in Gray's ruling that microchip codes are 
subject to copyright law -- a decision the American firm said would protect the 
investments that it and other innovative chip manufacturers have made in 
developing new technology. 
</P>
<P>
Experts in intellectual property law agreed, saying the decision would 
discourage the kind of imitation that has resulted in cutting-edge U.S. firms 
losing the profits on their inventions to lower-priced foreign copycats. 
</P>
<P>
"It draws a line against . . . lower-cost producers simply waiting for Intel to 
produce a top-of-the-line microprocessor which they then take to Hong Kong or 
Taiwan and duplicate at cheap labor and put in the market to compete with 
Intel," said Vincent Cox, a Century City attorney who specializes in 
intellectual property law. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives Intel a substantial incentive to go out there and invest heavily in 
obtaining a leadership role in the microprocessor field and then to reap the 
rewards," Cox added. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Jose case, Intel had complained 4 1/2 years ago that NEC, once its 
partner in a broad cross-licensing agreement, had violated its copyright on the 
microcode of its 8086/88 computer chip. Microcodes are the tiny instructions 
that are embedded in and help run a microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Microcode Called Software 
</P>
<P>
On the narrow issue, Gray said Intel had failed to protect its copyright. 
Although Intel had properly marked its devices with copyright notices, Gray 
said many of the devices, made by some Intel licensees, were distributed 
without the notices. As a result, Intel forfeited its copyright, the judge 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
But more importantly, say analysts, Gray sided with Intel and ruled that a 
microcode qualifies as a computer program and can be protected under copyright 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
NEC had contended that the Intel microcode did not meet the definition of a 
computer program. The microcode, NEC said, is virtually part of the computer, 
and thus not subject to copyright protection. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, said Intel's 
immediate loss of copyright protection on its 8086/88 chip was a minor blow, 
because the company no longer sells many of those chips. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a clear loss, but it does not hurt much," said Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
But he agreed that the long-term implications of Gray's ruling favored Intel 
and its innovative peers. "Intel has won a big victory in the long term," he 
said. "It certainly does make it difficult to copy a chip because it's very 
difficult for one chip to work like another if you don't copy the microcode."

Plessey Co. rejected as "outrageous" a revised proposal by Britain's General 
Electric Co. and West Germany's Siemens AG aimed at obtaining British 
government approval for a joint bid for Plessey. GEC and Siemens announced new 
proposals for dividing up various Plessey businesses should their takeover bid 
for the electronics and defense contractor succeed. The revised plan, submitted 
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is investigating the 
$2.96-billion bid for Plessey, was an attempt to calm British government 
concerns about maintaining competition in the electronics industry.

ENVOY TO BACK RENEWAL OF STEEL IMPORT QUOTAS; 
</P>
<P>
ALSO SEEKS GLOBAL TALKS ON GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES 
</P>

New U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills reiterated Tuesday that the Bush 
Administration will support a renewal of current U.S. steel import quotas but 
said she will first attempt to persuade other countries to cut their steel 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
In her first interview with reporters since taking office, Hills also indicated 
that she is moving to resolve the U.S. dispute with a European Community rule 
prohibiting the use of growth hormones in beef imported into community nations. 
However, she gave no details of any new U.S. proposals. 
</P>
<P>
And, as she did during her recent confirmation hearings, Hills hinted that she 
may be more flexible than trade negotiators in the last Administration in 
efforts to work out a compromise with the Europeans on the broader issue of how 
rapidly to reduce global farm subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Global Talks Sought 
</P>
<P>
Hills' reassertion that the Bush Administration will support a renewal of the 
steel quotas came as the steel industry prepared to launch a formal campaign to 
persuade Congress to extend the system of global import quotas that were 
imposed in 1984 and will expire Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.) and members of the House and Senate steel caucuses, 
which include members of steel producing states, plan to introduce legislation 
today to continue the quotas for five more years, despite protests from steel 
users. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in a letter written to Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) during the 
presidential election campaign last summer, already has pledged to support a 
continuation of the steel quotas, though he hinted -- as Hills said Tuesday -- 
that he would seek global talks first. 
</P>
<P>
However, most trade analysts said they hold little hope that such talks will 
get off the ground soon. The other steel producing countries agreed to put 
restraints on their exports only after the United States threatened to impose 
quotas unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
Steel users complained that the quotas exacerbated price hikes in the industry 
last year when steel was in short supply in this country. But that problem has 
eased and the lawmakers are expected to extend the current import quotas 
without serious controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In another trade-related development, Bush decided formally Tuesday not to 
block on national security grounds the proposed acquisition of Palo Alto-based 
Monsanto Electronic Materials, a silicon wafer maker, by Huels AG, a West 
German firm. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the sale had asked the Administration to intervene in the case, 
contending that the transaction would pose some national security risks. 
Monsanto Electronic Materials is the nation's last remaining major producer of 
silicon wafers. 
</P>
<P>
But a high-level U.S. review board found late last month that there is no 
evidence that the transaction will threaten U.S. security interests. U.S. 
officials said Huels had provided written assurances that it would keep the 
plant and research facilities inside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Hills' hint at some flexibility in the negotiations with the European Community 
over agricultural subsidies appeared to buttress a similar impression conveyed 
during her confirmation hearings in late January. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the United States has insisted that the Europeans agree to 
eliminate all agricultural subsidies by a specific date, perhaps as late as the 
year 2000. Hills said she still supports that proposal in principle, but she 
hinted that she might agree to softer wording. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over agricultural subsidies has been the main sticking point 
holding up movement on the 96-country Uruguay Round trade talks during a 
midterm review session in Montreal last December. Negotiators are scheduled to 
meet again in April.

PROTECTIONIST POLICY EMERGES IN S. KOREAN DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
JAPAN'S TEXTILES LIMIT CONTRADICTS CLAIM ON IMPORTS

During his trip to the United States that ended Tuesday, Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita cited a spurt in imports by Japan last year as proof that his country 
is transforming itself into a new kind of economic animal -- one intent on 
welcoming products from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
But an ominous contradiction of that claim has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
A dispute over imports of textiles from South Korea, once regarded as a key 
test of Takeshita's pledge at the Toronto economic summit last summer to 
promote more imports from Japan's Asian neighbors, has ended -- with Japan 
failing the test. 
</P>
<P>
After eight months of threats, culminating with the filing of an anti-dumping 
suit against Korean knitwear imports, Japan extracted an agreement from South 
Korea to limit exports of knitted sweaters to a 1% annual increase for three 
years, beginning this year. Korean manufacturers also agreed to set minimum 
prices on knitwear sold to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticized by Newspapers 
</P>
<P>
The agreement consisted of a pledge by executives of South Korea's textile 
industry to executives of Japan's industry. In that form, it enabled Takeshita 
to keep unblemished Japan's record as the only industrialized nation other than 
Switzerland that does not impose governmental textile import restrictions, even 
though they are of a type approved under a special General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade accord. 
</P>
<P>
Both governments worked hard behind the scenes to hammer it out, and Japan's 
minister of international trade and industry, Hiroshi Mitsuzaka, publicly said 
he "evaluated it highly." 
</P>
<P>
However, Japanese newspapers condemned the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The Asahi said in an editorial that Japan had forced the South Koreans to 
accept the "voluntary" restraints through threats -- in much the same way that 
the United States had threatened Japan to bring about this country's 
"voluntary" restrictions on exports of steel, machine tools, automobiles, 
textiles and other Japanese goods to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The precedent, the Asahi complained, could spur a host of other Japanese 
industries -- cement and steel, in particular -- to demand similar protection. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Kagayaki Miyazaki, chairman of the Japan Knitting Industry Assn., 
declared openly that he "expected this agreement to become a model for other 
industries." 
</P>
<P>
But officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said no other 
industry had made moves to emulate the textile makers. They also declared that 
the voluntary restrictions amounted to an extraordinary "emergency measure," 
not a harbinger of the future. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute did, in fact, serve to expose just how far Japan's textile market 
had opened to imports, as well as to spotlight the great expansion of sales of 
South Korean products here. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Japanese trading companies, supermarkets and other importers 
purchased about 110 million sweaters and cardigans from foreign countries, 
mostly in Asia -- or nine for every 10 men, women and children in the country. 
Japan has a population of 122.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Of the imported sweaters, about 63.5 million came from South Korea, according 
to the trade ministry. Imports in 1988 represented a 60% gain on top of a 62% 
upsurge in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Knitted sweaters from South Korea have been selling for between $15 and $30, 
while Japanese sweaters are priced from $39. 
</P>
<P>
Overall textile imports rose 39% to $10.6 billion last year to become Japan's 
second-biggest category of imports after oil and petroleum products. And in an 
industry in which Japan, until 1986, had consistently enjoyed a trade surplus 
dating back into the 19th Century, its deficit in manufactured textile trade 
rose to $3.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ability in Doubt 
</P>
<P>
The turnabout, nonetheless, represented just a small move in the direction of 
the U.S. example. With its $25 billion in textile imports, the United States 
still far outstrips Japan as the world's No. 1 importer. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, were already expressing doubt that Japan would be able to 
halt the import surge. 
</P>
<P>
Trading companies and supermarkets were reported shifting orders for sweaters 
to other Asian countries. South Korea, meanwhile, was expected to upgrade the 
quality and price of the sweaters it sells to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the effort to protect some 7,000 small Japanese textile firms, 
analysts said, is doomed as what one called a "mole-tapping" exercise -- trying 
to dispose of moles by running from hole to hole and beating the animals, one 
by one, as they come out.

New loans by the World Bank will reach a record $21 billion in the year ending 
June 30, up from $19.2 billion a year ago, bank officials predicted. The bank 
said $16 billion would go to the somewhat more prosperous countries that still 
need easy loans to raise their living standards. They pay interest at a 
variable rate, now 7.65% a year. More than $5.5 billion will go to the poorest 
countries from the bank's International Development Assn. It makes loans at 
less than 1% interest.

WOMEN SEEN CLOSING THE WAGE GAP; 
</P>
<P>
BUT STUDY SAYS GAINS CONTRIBUTE TO POVERTY, FAMILY SPLITS

Women's earnings are catching up to men's far faster than the common wisdom 
suggests, argues a new Rand Corp. study being released today. Yet women's 
economic progress, the study says, is contributing to the breakup of the 
traditional family and the "feminization" of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
The report by economists James P. Smith and Michael Ward -- who raised a furor 
4 1/2 years ago with an earlier study they conducted on women's pay -- projects 
that by the year 2000, women on average will be paid at least 80% of what men 
earn, up from 65% currently. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they warn policy-makers to recognize that rising wages draw 
women into the work force and discourage child bearing -- trends, they say, 
that destabilize the traditional family, contributing to rising divorce rates 
and the growing number of families headed by women. 
</P>
<P>
And since it is among those female-headed families that poverty increasingly is 
concentrated, they say, leaders need to consider whether policies that 
encourage women to work are having unintended negative consequences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Controversy

"One price of the very labor market success women have enjoyed may well be a 
less stable American family," says the study, which appears in the current 
issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Ward triggered controversy with their previous study challenging the 
widely held view that women had made few gains in closing the "wage gap" during 
most of the 20th Century. In fact, they said, women's wages had risen more 
quickly than men's from 1920 through 1980 and promised to continue narrowing 
the difference through the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Critics disputed their conclusion that discrimination was not a major factor in 
the lowering of women's wages and that government efforts to eliminate 
discrimination had done little to improve most women's standing. The initial 
indication is that the new study, though it takes pains to acknowledge the 
importance of government attention to correcting the inequities women face in 
the economy, will incur feminists' wrath as well. 
</P>
<P>
Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women, said Tuesday that 
the narrowing of wage differences between men and women is more the result of a 
decline in men's earnings, rather than any gains by women. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys who used to be in the steel mill earning $11, $15, $20 bucks an hour are 
now down to $5 bucks an hour, so of course women in comparison to them are 
doing better than they used to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Wayne, executive director of the National Committee on Pay Equity, said 
even the smaller wage gaps projected by the Rand economists were 
unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it were true that the wage gap was going to be 80% in the year 2000, 
there's still 20% missing that needs to be addressed," said Wayne, who heads 
the Washington-based coalition of women's, labor and civil rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Ward's argument that women's participation in the work force 
correlates with the increasingly feminine cast of poverty drew especially 
indignant responses. 
</P>
<P>
Susan M. Christopherson, a professor of city and regional planning at Cornell 
University in Ithaca, N.Y., said the women entering the work force in the 
largest numbers are mothers of young children -- a group that is working not 
out of choice, but rather to combat poverty or sustain family living standards. 
</P>
<P>
"To suggest that women entering the labor force is related to the 
disintegration of families is very unfair to those women who are entering the 
work force in order to maintain sufficient family income," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Ward write that other studies have understated women's earning gains 
by failing to take into account the fact that, in the past, many women entering 
the labor force had few skills and less-than-average education. Such women 
workers got low wages, pulling down the overall average of women's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Their analysis, by contrast, finds that women have steadily been gaining more 
skills and education over time -- gaining faster, in fact, than men -- as the 
U.S. economy has paid less for men's skills in such areas as manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leadership Gains 
</P>
<P>
The constant narrowing of the differences between the capabilities women and 
men bring to the job has had a dramatic effect in the 1980s, the study says. In 
1980, women's earnings were 60% of men's. But by 1986, women were earning 65% 
of what men earned -- "the largest and swiftest gain witnessed in this 
century," Smith and Ward write. 
</P>
<P>
The gains, they predict, will continue. Not only will women's earnings continue 
to rise more quickly than men's, but women will take their place in leadership 
positions in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The new women professionals of the last 10 years are now gaining partnerships 
in law firms, staff postions in major hospitals and middle management jobs in 
business," the study says. "The sheer numbers in the pipeline guarantee that 20 
years from now, some of these women will be senior partners, chiefs of staff, 
CEOs." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Smith said the study's findings argue against "massive 
public policy actions" to right injustices against working women.

TRUMP PLAYS TO WIN AT HIS OWN GAME

<P>
For the millions of Americans who want to make a fortune overnight, toy maker 
Milton Bradley and real estate tycoon Donald J. Trump will soon allow them to 
negotiate blockbuster deals in their living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, the flashy billionaire who recently published the autobiography "Trump: 
The Art of the Deal," is now the subject of a new $25 board game, "Trump the 
Game," Milton Bradley announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
The game, which will go on sale in the spring, is patterned after Monopoly and 
Trump's own career. Trump's well-publicized face, which was recently on the 
cover of Time magazine, appears on the game's play money, board, outer box and 
Trump cards. 
</P>
<P>
In the game, players compete to buy eight lucrative real estate properties such 
as hotels, casinos or convention centers with play money starting in 
denominations of $10 million. Trump said he has lost the game a few times 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is based on the high stakes world of wheeling and dealing and 'The 
Art of the Deal,' " Milton Bradley President George Ditomassi told reporters. 
The toy maker, a unit of Hasbro Inc., also makes the games "Life," "A Question 
of Scruples" and "Win, Lose or Draw." 
</P>
<P>
"I really like the game," said Trump, who rolled 14-karat gold dice at a 
ceremonial "closing of the deal" in Manhattan's sumptuous Trump Tower. "It's 
much more sophisticated than Monopoly, which I've played all my life." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's percentage of the game's profits, which he did not disclose, will go to 
charities such as cerebral palsy, AIDS research and help for the homeless, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the game makes many millions of dollars," said Trump, who owns the 
Plaza Hotel, Trump Tower, Trump Plaza and Grand Hyatt in Manhattan, and Trump 
Plaza &amp; Casino in Atlantic City.

ADOPTION AT SEA REVEALS THE SECRET LIFE OF OTTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It began as a chance encounter on a January morning last year, when marine 
biologists heard the penetrating, distinctive screech of a baby sea otter 
somewhere in a kelp bed just offshore near Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
By the time it ended about three weeks later, however, scientists from the 
Monterey Bay Aquarium had found evidence of something no one had previously 
suspected: Under certain circumstances, the California sea otter makes an 
excellent adoptive parent. 
</P>
<P>
Of itself, this new observation -- described by a research biologist in a 
scientific paper released by the aquarium this week -- is unlikely to affect 
the future of the otter as a species or influence the political battle that has 
grown up around attempts to keep the otter from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
There are now thought to be a little more than 1,500 adult otters and about 220 
pups in California waters, with the population showing modest increases each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But to Marianne Riedman, the research biologist who reported the new findings, 
the facility of the sea otter for adoptive parenting is an observation of 
scientific note and emotional reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
The Jan. 20 screeching in the kelp bed, Riedman said, was quickly investigated 
by aquarium personnel. Using binoculars and a telescope, they observed a pup -- 
about 4 months old -- swimming about in desperation and hunger. 
</P>
<P>
The pup's behavior quickly identified it as an orphan. It approached first one 
female otter and then another, only to be rejected with a snarl by each -- what 
was then thought to be normal otter behavior, Riedman said. At first, the 
options appeared to be a human rescue or acceptance that the pup would die. 
</P>
<P>
But then the pup swam up to an older female researchers had observed on and off 
for at least four years. She had been caught once and given a distinctive tag 
that identified her as Otter 203. 
</P>
<P>
Otter 203 had given birth a few weeks earlier, the scientists thought, but 
apparently had lost her pup. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adaptation to Mothering 
</P>
<P>
This chance circumstance was to save the orphaned pup. Apparently because her 
hormonal system was still attuned to mothering, 203 quickly accepted her new 
charge and treated the little one as her own. 
</P>
<P>
They swam together in the vicinity of Lover's Point, near the aquarium on 
Cannery Row. The pup nursed and 203 dove to bring back prey, adjusting her own 
diet from mussels to kelp crabs and purple sea urchins -- an apparently 
instinctive alteration of nutritional intake appropriate to nursing. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, biologists netted both animals offshore to give each a health 
check and tag the newly discovered pup, which turned out to be female and 
somewhat underweight. She was given tag 555. 
</P>
<P>
For three weeks, the observation continued. The last sighting, Riedman said, 
was on Feb. 4 of last year, when pup 555 was seen nursing just after 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Does This Happen Often? 
</P>
<P>
Riedman, for one, thinks such adoptions occur more frequently than scientists 
have realized. "I think female otters are probably primed to take care of 
orphans after they've given birth and if they have lost their pups." 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the odds are long. An orphaned pup would have to be in a section of 
the open ocean, and would have to encounter a female otter who had recently 
lost her young, all in a period of days before the pup died of starvation. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Riedman said, the bond between 203 and the pup 555 ended sadly. 
Four days after the two were last observed, the pup was found dead, washed up 
on Monterey State Beach. An autopsy was inconclusive, but Riedman speculated 
the pup may have gotten separated from 203 and been unable to find enough food. 
</P>
<P>
Then, about four months later, 203 died -- apparently the victim of the effects 
of old age. She was about 15 -- old enough in otter years to be her adoptive 
pup's grandmother.

<P>
DICK YORK IS DYING OF EMPHYSEMA BUT HE LIVES TO HELP THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SECTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ROCKFORD, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the make-believe world that made Dick York famous, his troubles would have 
been magically swept away with the twitch of a nose or the wave of a wand. 
</P>
<P>
But no television sitcom medicine can cure what ails York, who played Darrin 
Stephens, the harried, mortal husband of the comely witch, Samantha, in the hit 
series "Bewitched" more than two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
He shook off an addiction to painkillers but could not shake the chronic agony 
of a crippling spine injury or the aftereffects of a multipack-a-day cigarette 
habit. Nor could he elude the bank and bill collectors, who foreclosed on his 
West Covina home and sapped his life savings. 
</P>
<P>
These days, York is broke, bedridden and slowly dying of emphysema. He lives 
with his wife, Joan, on a $650-a-month Screen Actors Guild pension in the tiny 
red bungalow near Grand Rapids, Mich., that once belonged to in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this is not a sad story, because York is not a sad person or one to 
dwell in self-pity. Exuberant, excited, bursting with energy for someone whose 
slightest steps send him gasping for air, the 60-year-old actor has found one 
last part to play -- the role of his life -- as a one-man clearinghouse for aid 
to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Tethered to an oxygen tank and housebound for months, York spends hours on the 
phone each day chatting up radio talk show hosts, bureaucrats and just about 
anybody else who will listen to publicize the plight of street people and 
scrounge tons of clothes, food and bedding from government supplies. 
</P>
<P>
He may be an invalid in body, but not in spirit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just My Body That's Dying' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel wonderful -- it's just my body that's dying," he says with a raspy 
cackle and that slightly goofy Darrin Stephens grin stretched broad across his 
face. " . . . You know, three whales get in trouble and people from all over 
volunteer to help. Wouldn't it be wonderful if one old has-been actor with a 
hose up his nose could help millions of people?" 
</P>
<P>
Social workers from Detroit to Chicago say York has become a master at cutting 
bureaucratic mazes to scare up thousands of surplus military- and 
civilian-issue coats, cots, mattresses, sleeping bags, boots and other supplies 
long buried, and ripe for the taking, in government warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
"But his greatest contribution is heightening awareness of this problem 
nationally," said James Nauta, a Salvation Army official based in Grand Rapids. 
"He's very ill but he finds his way around the country by phone. People listen. 
When he talks, they respond." 
</P>
<P>
Champion for the downtrodden is a part for which York was typecast. He was a 
child of the Depression whose family faced a constant struggle to stay off the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
He was raised on Chicago's Near North Side in what now is a chic neighborhood 
of town homes and condominiums but then was mostly tenements. His parents often 
were out of work and broke. When they did not have the rent -- which was often 
-- someone had to stay in the family flat at all times to prevent the landlord 
from locking everybody else out. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy, York saw his father struggle with other men for food discarded in a 
garbage can. When he was 11, an infant brother died but the family could not 
afford to bury him. So York and his father slipped into a graveyard at night 
and laid the youngster to rest in a coffin crafted from a shoe box. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such hardships, York remembers his childhood as a happy time, 
influenced most profoundly, odd to say, by something he read in a Tarzan 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
"There's Tarzan captured in the land of the Fire Queen and ready to be 
sacrificed," York recalled. "He's tied up hand and foot and being carried up to 
the sacrificial altar. He's surrounded by 5,000 of these fierce beast-like 
characters and a knife is about to be plunged into his heart and somebody says 
to him, 'My God, Tarzan, why are you smiling?' And Tarzan says, 'Because I'm 
alive.' " 
</P>
<P>
Besides a cheery personality, York also had a beautiful boy soprano singing 
voice. A nun at St. Mary of the Lake school sent him to a singing coach, who in 
turn sent him to the Jack and Jill players, a training school for young radio 
and stage actors. Through Jack and Jill, he performed in dramas and public 
service programs on local radio stations. By the time he was 15, York starred 
in his own network radio show, "That Brewster Boy," on CBS. That was the year 
he also met Joan, his wife-to-be, another child radio star. 
</P>
<P>
He did thousands of radio shows in Chicago and New York, graduating to 
television and Broadway, where his credits include "Tea and Sympathy" and "Bus 
Stop." He also had supporting parts in several films, most notably as the young 
schoolteacher hounded by religious fundamentalists in "Inherit the Wind" with 
Spencer Tracy, Fredric March and Gene Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life-Changing Role 
</P>
<P>
A 1958 film, "They Came to Cordura" with Gary Cooper, proved, for York at 
least, to be his most memorable role. On the second to last day of shooting, 
York and several other actors were doing a scene that required them to lift a 
railroad handcar. At one point, the director yelled "cut" and everybody but 
York let go. The car fell on him and his spine was wrenched and the muscles 
around it torn. 
</P>
<P>
He worked through the pain rather than seek medical attention. He kept working 
for years, though the discs in his spine slowly crumbled. Over the years, he 
shrunk from more than 6-foot-1 to 5-foot-10 or so and gradually became hunched. 
</P>
<P>
By the time "Bewitched" premiered in 1964, York took heavy doses of 
painkillers, sleeping pills, cortisone and other medicines -- but only after he 
was done with each day's shoot and never while he was working, he is quick to 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
Still, his dependence on drugs grew, and, in 1969, he went into convulsions on 
the set, woke up in the hospital and was replaced on the show by another actor. 
He never returned. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 18 months, York stayed at home in bed in what he now admits was a 
drug-induced haze, as he tried to deaden his pain and heal his back. Finally, 
appalled by his stupor, he decided to go cold turkey. He moved in with his 
mother, who then lived in Buena Park, to spare his five children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bagpipes Night and Day' 
</P>
<P>
"I had a band playing in my head, bagpipes night and day," York recalled. "It 
just went on and on and on and on and on. . . . The fans whisper to you and the 
walls whisper to you and you look at television and sometimes it flashes in a 
certain way that sends you into a fit and you know that your wife has put her 
hand in your mouth so you won't bite off your tongue. You can't sleep. You 
hallucinate. I used to make a tape recording of rain so I could listen to the 
rain lying in bed at night to drown out those damned bagpipes." 
</P>
<P>
After six months, York was relieved when the hallucinations stopped and the 
ordinary pain returned. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Yorks took what was left of their savings and bought an 
apartment building in West Covina where they planned to live out their lives 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
But when tenants had difficulty paying the rent, York, mindful of his own 
youth, could not bring himself to evict them. Short of cash himself, he missed 
mortgage payments and the bank foreclosed. The Yorks held on to their apartment 
by cleaning other units in the building they once owned. In 1976, the actor who 
once earned a six-figure salary got his first welfare check. 
</P>
<P>
When Joan's father died three years ago, the couple, whose children were now 
grown, flew to Rockford for the funeral. York's emphysema worsened; he 
collapsed in the yard of his in-laws' home. He never returned to California, 
but it was, in a sense, the start of his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after his attack, a friend asked him to record inspirational tapes for 
a young Chicago girl who had been in a coma for years. He did more and more 
tapes for other shut-ins, just pressing the button on his recorder and saying 
whatever came to mind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Efforts Began 
</P>
<P>
He read up on the McKinney Act, a federal law that was supposed to set up 
government surplus giveaway programs but was under-used because of red tape. 
Then York, trading on his celebrity, started badgering bureaucrats and 
volunteers, first to find out what was in storage, then to figure how to shake 
it loose, and last, to transport it to shelters in need. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he pried loose enough for 15,000 changes of clothes -- second-hand 
pants, shirts, boots, socks, belts, field jackets and more -- from Army surplus 
stocks in Illinois; he worked to get thousands of mattresses and blankets 
stored in Wisconsin. Through his calls, thousands of blankets and cots were 
moved from a federal facility in Lansing, Mich., for distribution to Detroit's 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, his efforts surprise not only the charities but York himself. Last 
year, he told a friend there was a desperate need by the homeless for 
underwear. In weeks, thousands of pairs of panty hose -- good for warmth 
regardless of the wearer's sex -- showed up at the Dwelling Place, a Grand 
Rapids Shelter. Similarly, 5,000 cans of orange juice concentrate were 
delivered to the Salvation Army in Grand Rapids after York spread the word 
among friends and in interviews that shelter dwellers did not get enough 
vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how he does it," said Ron Still, an activist for the homeless in 
Reno, Nev., who has worked with York. "I don't question him. But more power to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
York calls his organization Acting for Life, but it consists of little more 
than a few friends across the country, a mail drop (P.O. Box 499, Rockford, 
Mich. 49341), a telephone and the moxie of a dying man possessed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Old Brown Chair 
</P>
<P>
His office, littered with his wife's cigarette butts, is an old brown lounge 
chair in the corner of the living room, surrounded by tapes to be recorded and 
stacks of mail from schoolchildren, well-wishers and fans, some of whom enclose 
a few dollars with their cards to help defray his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
With such modest assets, York sits in his ratty plaid bathrobe and fuzzy blue 
slippers and dreams of doing more. He spins plans to set up a regional 
distribution network for supplies to the homeless throughout the Midwest. And 
he talks of pressuring Congress to convert dozens of military bases, recently 
scheduled for abandonment by a federal commission, into homeless shelters. 
</P>
<P>
To the less dedicated, it may seem like tilting at windmills. 
</P>
<P>
But York, brimming with confidence, insists that somehow, someway, it will get 
done. "After all," he says, "when Tarzan sets off to save the world. . . ."

FIRST LADY FIRES FIRST SHOT IN LITERACY CAMPAIGN

The children at the Free Library of Philadelphia giggled when she read them the 
book, "The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day." 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday wasn't that sort of awful time for Barbara Bush, who became a 
grandmother for the 11th time in the early morning and later launched her 
campaign as First Lady to help combat illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Pennsylvania has a 29% illiteracy rate and "every major city has a 
big problem," Bush said in an interview that expanding the Head Start program 
for preschoolers to include maternal literacy and job training programs "just 
makes sense if those women aren't working. They don't want to be on welfare. 
They want to work." 
</P>
<P>
But asked what she would do to implement such programs, she replied: "I'm not 
going to see that it happens. I'm going to work very hard to encourage people 
to see that it happens." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Sen. Arlen Specter, (R-Pa.), who accompanied her, she added: "I 
don't feel my job is to do the Senator's job or the President's job. I feel my 
job is to encourage the corporate and private sector to help, whether it's 
individuals or agencies or Rotary Clubs or Lions' Clubs." 
</P>
<P>
Bush visited Philadelphia to help launch its "Love Is Reading Together Week," a 
program that included members of Temple University's Institute on Aging 
conducting a discussion about the importance of inter-generational ties, 
stressing reading as a family activity. 
</P>
<P>
When the question arose, "What's great about grandchildren?" Bush raised her 
hand, was called on, and answered, "You can love them and read to them and send 
them home." The remark produced a roar of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Bush noted that she and the President had become grandparents for the 11th time 
early Tuesday when Sharon Bush, wife of the Bushes' son, Neil, gave birth to 
7-pound 2-ounce Ashley Walker Bush in Denver. Bush said they plan to visit the 
new baby in the next month. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush, now a 34-year-old oilman, suffered as a child from dyslexia -- a 
learning disability that causes letters and words to be perceived backwards. 
</P>
<P>
But his problems were not the sole prompting for her interest in literacy, Bush 
said, noting: "I got interested in literacy because I spent one summer, 1978, 
thinking about all the things that worried me. And it suddenly came to me that 
every one of those things -- teen-age pregnancy, drugs, everything -- would be 
better if more people could read and write. 
</P>
<P>
"Neil," she said, "was very fortunate for several reasons. He is a 
hard-working, disciplined man, and he lived in a city where they had special 
tutors for people who are dyslexic. He had parents who not only loved him but 
worked with him and could afford to have help for him. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told Neil would never go to college. He not only went to college but 
he got a master's degree. . . . I give Neil enormous credit for that. But I 
want that for every single American child." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's All Good' 
</P>
<P>
Bush said she has had no unpleasant surprises, thus far, as First Lady. "It's 
all good. It's the most wonderful house. I told President Reagan last night -- 
it was his birthday and I called to wish him a happy birthday -- and I said I 
never walk down the halls that I don't say 'Thank you' to Nancy Reagan for 
making everything work. It's wonderful. . . . You're looking at one happy 
lady." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Bush relished her time reading Judith Viorst's book to the dozens of 
fourth- and fifth-graders from Lawton Elementary School gathered around her. 
</P>
<P>
The First Lady told them the incredible story of the young man who "went to 
sleep with gum in my mouth and now there's gum in my hair." His day gets worse. 
It ends with lima beans at dinner, kissing on television and the Mickey Mouse 
night light burning out. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing like this has happened to the new First Lady. But if it does, she might 
remember the last line she read to the children: "My mom says some days are 
like that."

REAGAN BIRTHDAY PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald and Nancy Reagan celebrated the former President's 78th birthday on 
Monday at a private dinner dance for 90 at the Bistro Garden hosted by the 
couple's friends -- William and Betty Wilson, Walter and Lee Annenberg, Armand 
and Harriet Deutsch, Norman and Erlenne Sprague and Earle and Marion Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a happy party," one guest reported, and still going strong after 11:30 
as a crowd stayed to dance. On the dinner menu -- at tables decorated with 
white roses, tulips and lilacs -- were baby chickens, pommes noisette, 
asparagus, baby carrots and young peas, a lemon birthday cake and Reagan's 
favorite dessert, tartufo (chocolate) ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy Cahn and Marvin Hamlisch performed songs they wrote for the occasion, 
Mary Martin sang and Bob and Dolores Hope sang a duet. Among other guests 
feting Reagan were former Secretary of State George and Helena Shultz, James 
and Gloria Stewart, Lew and Edie Wasserman, Tony Martin, Cyd Charisse, Betsy 
Bloomingdale and Ed Cox, Eva Gabor, Merv Griffin, William French Smith and Jean 
Smith, Charles and Mary Jane Wick and Tom and Chardee Trainer.

BENEFIT SCHEDULED IN BALTIMORE FOR 59 STRANDED SOVIET BALLET DANCERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A benefit performance by 59 Soviet ballet dancers from the Soviet Union's 
Donetsk State Opera and Ballet Theatre will be held at Baltimore's Lyric Opera 
House tonight to aid the dancers, who have been stranded in Baltimore since 
their tour of 15 Midwestern U.S. cities collapsed last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The tour is facing severe financial problems, and according to California 
producer David Hermon, between $200,000 to $250,000 must be raised before the 
tour can continue. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hermon's partner, Bill Merriman, the tour's problems began when 
Soviet officials refused to allow five of the tour's stars, including ballerina 
Lubov Kunakova from the Kirov ballet, to leave the Soviet Union. This caused 
American and Mexican backers to pull out of the tour, which had been billed as 
"Stars of the Russian Ballet." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was calling fraud," Merriman said. "These are young dancers, not the 
stars we advertised. To continue with the tour, we would have to start a new 
advertising campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Merriman said Tuesday that his Santa Rosa-based organization, Heart of the Art, 
Inc., had already invested about $500,000 in the tour and could not continue to 
back it unless "a financial angel" was found. 
</P>
<P>
Hermon said he had met with the Soviet officials, and that every effort would 
be made to get the tour back on track. For the meantime, however, the tour's 
Detroit dates (they were to have opened there Thursday) have been canceled, 
with other Midwestern dates remaining uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be staying in Baltimore through Friday, but beyond that, I don't know 
(what will happen with the tour)," Hermon said. "We re all very anxious to 
continue the tour, and we're still hoping to be able to do so, but the money is 
going to have to come from a third party." 
</P>
<P>
Hermon said he did not know how much would be raised by the last-minute Opera 
House benefit, but that those funds would be the start to getting the tour back 
on track. The dancers opened their tour at Opera House, performing for a sparse 
crowd during five weekend appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Preparations at the Opera House for the benefit were far from completed on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're just trying to put the stage back in working order," said the 
Opera House's building manager Tim Kroneberger. "Then we're just going to say 
the company will be performing in (an 8 p.m.) benefit and anyone who wishes to 
come or wishes to make a donation can do so." 
</P>
<P>
Hermon said he did not know what the dancers would be performing at the 
benefit.

L.A. COUNCIL ENACTS BAN ON ASSAULT GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED VOLLMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over strong gun owner objections and to the cheers of South-Central Los Angeles 
residents, the city enacted an emergency ordinance Tuesday outlawing the sale 
and possession of semiautomatic weapons such as the AK-47 assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning today, selling or offering to sell such assault weapons is illegal 
within the city limits. In 15 days, owners of the rapid-firing military-style 
rifles must render them inoperable or surrender them to police for destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Those violating the new law face six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used in Gang Shootings 
</P>
<P>
Assault rifles have been used increasingly in shootings involving gangs in Los 
Angeles and elsewhere. A gunman armed with an AK-47 killed five schoolchildren 
and injured more than two dozen in Stockton last month, prompting a number of 
legislative attempts to ban such weapons statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Gun owners and a National Rifle Assn. attorney predicted that the courts will 
strike down the Los Angeles ordinance. But even if the law overcomes legal 
challenges, gun owners and some law enforcement officials predict that it will 
be ineffective. They argued that criminals and gang members will not relinquish 
their rifles and can easily go to nearby cities to buy assault weapons legally. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically outlawed are sales and possession of about a dozen semiautomatic 
rifle types such as the AK-47, AR-15 and Uzi. Sawed-off shotguns and gun kits 
that can be assembled into an assault weapon are also banned. 
</P>
<P>
A semiautomatic weapon is described in the ordinance as one with a magazine of 
20 bullets or more and is able to fire single rounds rapidly with each pull of 
the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley signed the emergency ordinance about an hour after the City 
Council's unanimous vote. The 12-0 vote came after a highly emotional and 
raucous hearing featuring verbal parrying between South-Central residents and 
flag-waving gun advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said the new law sponsored by Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky is long 
overdue and should be used to prod state and federal lawmakers to enact even 
stronger and more far-reaching bans on semiautomatic rifles. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the time has come when those of us in elected office simply have to 
draw the line," Bradley said. "These weapons cannot be used for any legitimate 
reason other than to kill people, and I see no justification for anybody to 
sell them or possess them." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that cities can only enact misdemeanor laws, Bradley said the state and 
federal governments should make possession or sales a felony. He added that 
state or federal laws would also help control the sales of assault weapons in 
neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation pending in the state Senate and Assembly would make it a felony to 
possess or sell assault weapons. But sponsors of the state legislation have 
predicted it will be strongly fought by gun interests who have successfully 
opposed controls on weapons possession in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he will work to apply pressure on the state by approaching 
nearby cities to enact similar assault weapon bans. So far, Compton is the only 
other nearby city to move against semiautomatic rifles. Stockton, stunned by 
the attack on the schoolchildren, outlawed assault rifles Monday. Bradley and 
Yaroslavsky said that even if the state fails to act against the semiautomatic 
weapons, the city's law will pass muster in the courts. City Atty. James K. 
Hahn agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said the new ordinance was carefully crafted to avoid conflicts with 
existing state or federal firearms law. For example, the new ordinance neither 
addresses the registration of semiautomatic weapons nor the question of handgun 
or automatic weapon possession, all of which fall under state control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Attorney 'Confident' 
</P>
<P>
"We feel confident that we can make an argument that the City of Los Angeles 
under its police powers has the authority to ban the sale and possession of 
assault weapons. . . ," Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
But NRA attorney Richard Gardiner said state law preempts city law in 
regulating the possession of firearms of any type, including semiautomatic 
weapons. He was less certain on whether the city could ban the sales of assault 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Gardiner said the 3-million member organization will not directly challenge the 
Los Angeles ordinance but will probably back an "appropriate plaintiff," such 
as a gun shop owner. 
</P>
<P>
Gun shop owner Robert Kohn of B&amp;B Sales in North Hollywood told reporters 
that he will simply transfer his assault weapon inventory to his Orange County 
store in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Kohn called the city's action a "grandstand" and said the increasing popularity 
of assault rifles is traceable to the recent publicity they have received. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is so panicked that (government) is trying to take away their means 
of defense that they are buying nationwide in record numbers," Kohn said. "I'll 
probably lose a considerable percentage of business (because of the ordinance), 
but that's not involved here. (The city) is trampling on the rights of 
law-abiding citizens for emotional appeal and political mileage." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Chamberlain, an NRA member who repairs guns at a Van Nuys shop, said he 
will defy the new law because "I think what (the city) did was illegal." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not releasing my weapons to anybody. . . ," Chamberlain said. "Mussolini, 
Hitler and Stalin all pulled this stuff, and that's why you have communism in 
those countries where people were unable to protect themselves." 
</P>
<P>
While the new law's passage was booed by gun owners, it was cheered by 
South-Central Los Angeles residents. The rapid-firing weapons have become 
increasingly popular with some gangs based in South-Central neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The AK-47 and AR-15 rifles have been blamed for a number of drive-by shooting 
deaths in South-Central Los Angeles. Residents complained bitterly during a 
one-hour hearing that they have been terrorized by the nightly "chatter" of the 
semiautomatic guns. 
</P>
<P>
Gun owners complained as well. Opponents said the city ordinance violates their 
constitutional rights to "bear arms" and said the sweeping nature of the 
ordinance is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Firing back, Frances James, a leader of the South Central Organizing Committee, 
said gun owners opposed to the law did not understand. 
</P>
<P>
"You say it's your God-given right to have a gun," James said. "It's my 
God-given right to raise my child and know he'll go to school and know he'll 
come back alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have that right, right now." 
</P>
<P>
The city of West Hollywood voted Monday to draft an ordinance banning 
semiautomatic assault rifles and the Compton City Council approved a similar 
ban by a vote of 5-0 Tuesday night.

DOUGLAS WINS ORDERS FOR $11 BILLION IN JETS; 
</P>
<P>
RECORD-BREAKING PACTS FOR COMMERCIAL PLANES WILL ADD 5,000 JOBS THIS YEAR IN 
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN and ROBERT E. DALLOS, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas announced that it sold nearly $11 billion worth of commercial 
jetliners Tuesday, substantially more than was expected, and as a result will 
add 5,000 jobs this year at its Douglas Aircraft unit in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The orders and options for MD-11 and MD-80 passenger jets, booked from five 
airlines around the world, including American Airlines, marks the largest 
one-day sale in aircraft industry history and increases Douglas' backlog to $61 
billion in firm orders and various types of options. 
</P>
<P>
The company is so heavily loaded with aircraft orders that some of the planes 
are not scheduled to be delivered until the end of the century, and production 
is completely sold out until 1993, Douglas Aircraft President James E. Worsham 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Worsham disclosed in an interview in New York that orders for 
another 15 MD-11 jumbo jets worth $1.6 billion will be formally announced soon 
from three airlines in China. He declined to further identify the carriers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just very pleased with the acceptance of the airplane (MD-11) now," 
Douglas Senior Vice President William Gross said in a telephone interview. "But 
it took us longer to get acceptance of the MD-11 aircraft, especially in this 
country, than we had anticipated, having launched the program way back in 
December, 1986." 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines Chairman Robert L. Crandall said the carrier's purchases will 
provide for future route expansion and for replacement of some of the company's 
"older and noisier aircraft." American already has one of the youngest fleets 
in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Crandall said one important factor in selecting Douglas over Boeing was 
American's requirement for early deliveries. Boeing is backlogged on deliveries 
for its 747 jumbo jet and has encountered production problems that have led to 
delays. American obtained early delivery dates by assuming production slots 
previously held by British Caledonian, which gave them up after being acquired 
by British Airways. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that weighed most heavily is the great flexibility of this 
(MD-11) aircraft," Crandall said. "It is a smaller aircraft than the 747-400 
and thus can be used in a wider range of applications than can a larger 
aircraft." However, the MD-11, which has not yet entered service, has a range 
of up to 8,039 miles, depending on its configuration, and will be capable of 
trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic flights. 
</P>
<P>
The 5,000 additional jobs in Long Beach will bring Douglas' total employment to 
45,000 at its facilities in Torrance and Long Beach, which is the nation's 
largest aerospace production site. In 1981, when Douglas was on the verge of 
quitting commercial aircraft production, the company hit a low point of only 
12,000 employees in Long Beach and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Through a lucky combination of a boom in the commercial aircraft market and a 
deft plan for offering updated versions of its veteran airliner types, the 
company has returned to profitability after suffering through years of losses. 
</P>
<P>
The sales agreements announced Tuesday included 76 firm orders and options by 
five airlines for MD-11 aircraft, which cost about $110 million. American 
Airlines signed commitments for 50 MD-11s, Air Europe for 18, Aero Lloyd in 
West Germany for four, ZAS Airline of Egypt for two and Finnair for two. Firm 
orders cover 19 of the aircraft and options account for the other 57, Worsham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
American also placed options for 100 MD-80 aircraft, which cost about $25 
million each. Those aircraft would be delivered between 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
Although such a large proportion of the planes involve options, rather than 
firm orders, financial analysts were upbeat about McDonnell Douglas' prospects. 
With a firm order, an airline typically must make a down payment of 10% of the 
value of the plane, whereas an option requires only a 1% down payment and is 
more easily cancelable. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all good, firm orders, as long as the economy holds up," said 
Prudential Bache Securities analyst Paul Nisbet. 
</P>
<P>
Nisbet said investors had originally viewed the MD-11 as a "probable failure" 
but have begrudgingly changed that outlook to one of "optimism." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas stock gained 87.5 cents per share to close at $89 Tuesday in 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. On Jan. 13, the week before speculation 
arose about the American Airlines deal, the company closed trading at $79.50 
per share. Over the three-week period, the stock has gained nearly 12% in 
value. 
</P>
<P>
The first MD-11, which is a derivative of McDonnell Douglas' DC-10 wide-body 
airliner, is expected to make its first flight in May and be certified for 
delivery by the Federal Aviation Administration by spring of next year. The 
aircraft, which has three engines and travels at speeds of up to 588 miles per 
hour, is designed to carry up to 405 passengers. However, the American MD-11s 
will be configured to carry only 245 to 274 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas is carrying orders and options for 253 MD-11s, putting the 
company substantially ahead of the A-340, a competing jet built by Airbus 
Industrie, the European aircraft manufacturing consortium. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to say Douglas has won the competition against Airbus," Nisbet 
said. But he added, "Certainly, McDonnell Douglas has nosed ahead in the early 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas also announced Tuesday that Rolls-Royce of Britain will begin 
to offer jet engines for the MD-11, which is expected to help politically in 
efforts to market the airliner in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines also announced that it will buy 200 General Electric jet 
engines, worth about $2 billion, in addition to those that will come installed 
on the new McDonnell Douglas airliners. The engines will be used as spares and 
for installation on planes that American plans to obtain from other 
manufacturers, a GE spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Douglas has grown far beyond projections of only a year ago, it is 
encountering capacity problems in Long Beach, said Gross. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger and more complex aircraft are taking up more space at the facility and 
making it more difficult to increase production rates. Douglas produces 2.5 
MD-80s per week and plans to produce one MD-11 per week. 
</P>
<P>
The company will employ 16,000 workers on the MD-11 alone, Worsham said. 
</P>
<P>
Gross said the company is studying three options that would enable it to 
increase MD-11 production beyond the current plan of one a week. One of the 
three options would involve moving the entire MD-11 line out of Long Beach. But 
that "is only a study," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Douglas encountered significant problems last year when it fell 
behind schedule and failed to meet delivery deadlines on orders by a number of 
customers. Those delays are not getting any worse, but Douglas will not be back 
on its original schedule until early to middle 1990, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very unhappy with McDonnell Douglas," American's Crandall said Tuesday 
about the delay. "They have gotten that problem under control. . . . They have 
been delivering planes right on schedule and very high quality." 
</P>
<P>
But increasing the output of aircraft will be difficult even if Douglas can 
ease its internal constraints. Aircraft parts vendors, which supply 60% to 80% 
of the parts Douglas uses, are encountering capacity problems themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The multibillion-dollar aircraft orders being announced by Douglas and Boeing 
are having huge ripple effects throughout the Los Angeles basin, the biggest 
aircraft parts production center in the country. 
</P>
<P>
For example, M.C. Gill Corp., a family-owned El Monte aircraft parts producer, 
will be increasing its 170-member work force by more than 30% this year, 
principally due to MD-11 work from Douglas, President Stephen Gill said 
Tuesday.

The FBI has received a new allegation of misconduct against Defense 
Secretary-designate John Tower and has extended its investigation of the 
troubled nominee, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee said 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) said the White House agreed that the charge should 
be checked by the FBI. Warner indicated that Tower's confirmation proceedings 
would be delayed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Warner would not comment on the specifics of the new allegation, but 
Administration sources said that it related to campaign funds Tower may have 
received from a defense contractor when he was a senator. He said that the 
allegation should be investigated by FBI agents "in an orderly way, at their 
own pace." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the second-ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, Sen. J. 
James Exon of Nebraska, said Tuesday evening that he now opposes the Tower 
nomination. And Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the committee, has indicated 
privately to some Democratic colleagues on the panel that he also is leaning 
against the nomination, in part because of the seriousness of the charges 
against the former Texas senator and in part out of anger at the way the White 
House has handled the matter. 
</P>
<P>
However, an aide said Tuesday night that Nunn has made no public statement 
opposing Tower and would not make up his mind about the nomination until he has 
read the final FBI investigative report. 
</P>
<P>
"I really came to that decision (to oppose Tower) tonight after, or about, the 
time that the FBI report was delayed and after the shenanigans of today," Exon 
told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Exon had told The Times that he was "concerned that John Tower at one 
time, years or months ago, had a serious problem with alcohol. All during the 
investigation the question has been on many of our minds of whether that was 
still the case or has he corrected that problem." 
</P>
<P>
Warner's announcement was made only hours after President Bush and top aides 
had met at the White House with Warner, Nunn and Tower to discuss the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources said it will be difficult to resolve the new allegation 
quickly. They said there are questions about whether the report has been 
distorted by personal animosity against the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Serious Questions' 
</P>
<P>
One Democratic panel member, after being briefed by an FBI agent in his office 
late Monday, said that he was left with "serious questions" about whether Tower 
in fact has conquered his admitted alcohol problems, as Tower asserted before 
the committee last week. 
</P>
<P>
As partisan infighting grows in the Armed Services Committee and new 
allegations surface almost daily, Tower's confirmation appears seriously 
jeopardized. It now appears that no vote on the nomination will be taken this 
week, and the Senate will not be in session next week. 
</P>
<P>
The delay could leave the President without his key adviser on military matters 
and critical budget questions for nearly four weeks after the inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said Tuesday that he stands behind Tower, and Tower himself has given no 
thought to asking that his nomination be withdrawn, according to aides. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Bush met with Tower, Nunn and Warner for about 45 minutes 
Tuesday afternoon -- a meeting requested by the committee chairman, according 
to Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Bush stressed to Nunn that he supports Tower and wants to see him confirmed 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the guy I want for the job," Bush was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn told Bush and his senior staff members that he had "concerns" about the 
Tower nomination but did not flatly say he was opposed to it. He was "not that 
black and white about it," said a senior aide familiar with the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
A senior White House official, expressing annoyance at the latest delay in the 
protracted Tower confirmation, complained: "The problem is that this is a 
never-ending thing. You can always get new accusations. Are we going to have 
this guy die the death of a thousand cuts or are we going to get a decision?" 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a number of Republican senators, after hearing a 
preliminary briefing on Tower, declared the charges against him "groundless" 
and called for a quick confirmation vote. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the question of Tower's relations with the defense industry -- 
another key issue raised in his confirmation hearings -- it was learned that 
the FBI has obtained a document in which Tower acknowledged that, while working 
as a defense consultant in the summer of 1987, he advocated increased purchases 
of the MX missile. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration planned to deploy an additional 50 such missiles, but 
Tower said he believed that an additional 100 missiles would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Tower represented Rockwell International Inc., which was involved 
in the production of the MX, under a $120,000-a-year contract signed in July, 
1986. He signed the contract soon after he stopped serving as a principal 
strategic arms negotiator in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Tower said in the document that, regardless of whether he was associated with 
Rockwell, he would have considered the additional missiles necessary as part of 
the nation's strategic deterrent. As a senator, Tower had been a consistent 
supporter of the MX. 
</P>
<P>
If confirmed as secretary of defense, Tower could face decisions on future MX 
purchases, and on the continuing controversy over its basing mode. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Paul Houston, Melissa Healy and David Lauter contributed to this 
story.

A Senate panel listened to secretly taped conversations in which the chairman 
of the Navajo nation told a real estate broker how to cover up money the broker 
paid him for helping arrange purchase of a ranch by the tribe. The broker, 
Byron T. (Bud) Brown, taped the conversations in cooperation with investigators 
for the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs and testified with a grant of 
immunity before the panel's special investigative unit. Brown said he arranged 
for businessman Tom Tracy to buy an Arizona ranch and then sell it to the 
Navajos. The $7.2-million profit was shared by Tracy, Brown and tribal chairman 
Peter MacDonald Sr., he said.

President Bush's nomination of Clayton K. Yeutter as secretary of agriculture 
sailed through the Senate Agriculture Committee and the chairman predicted 
quick floor action. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the panel, said 
a floor vote to confirm Yeutter to the post could come as early as today. 
Approval of the former U.S. trade representative to head the Agriculture 
Department came on a voice vote at a three-minute meeting. Yeutter is a former 
USDA official who once operated a Nebraska cattle feedlot and was president of 
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

The insider stock-trading scandal that has plagued Japanese Prime Minister 
Noboru Takeshita's government since last summer claimed its 28th victim: the 
chairman of the No. 3 opposition party. Saburo Tsukamoto, head of the 
middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist Party, announced that he will not seek 
another term. To continue in the post he has held since 1985, he said, would 
damage the party's chances in Parliament elections in July. Last summer, 
Tsukamoto acknowledged having made a tax-exempt profit of $77,000 after buying, 
at a bargain price, unlisted shares in a subsidiary of Recruit Co. before the 
stock went public and the price soared.

Narcotics police have launched a major drug offensive in Colombia that has 
become the most successful crackdown on the nation's drug lords in five years, 
a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration official said in Bogota. The official, 
who asked not to be identified, said police have destroyed 2,600 pounds of 
cocaine in northwestern Antioquia province, compared with about 22,000 pounds 
destroyed in a major 1984 operation in southeastern Caqueta province, police 
said. Nevertheless, the official said, the new drive will have little impact on 
the price or availability of cocaine on U.S. streets.

Thousands of ethnic Albanian workers kept factories at a standstill in 
Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province. The strikes and sit-ins, fueled by a 
Serbian-inspired purge of local Albanian leaders, erupted last week. The unrest 
has spread to the biggest industrial plants in the province, where tension has 
grown increasingly acute since nationalist riots in 1981. Serbia, the largest 
of Yugoslavia's six republics, is waging a campaign to restore its political 
control of Kosovo -- a province where ethnic Albanians heavily outnumber Serbs 
and other Slavs. It was granted autonomy in 1974.

About 5,000 Polish coal miners pressed ahead with a strike, apparently defying 
appeals by two emissaries sent by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa. The miners 
said they stopped work shortly after midnight at the Belchatow mine, 90 miles 
southwest of Warsaw, after talks with management broke down. The strikers have 
demanded more pay but said they did not want to disrupt round-table talks in 
which the government is seeking a deal with the banned Solidarity union to help 
solve Poland's economic crisis.

Consumers should avoid eating ABC Brand cucumbers and red bell peppers 
purchased on or after Feb. 1 because they may be contaminated by pesticide, the 
state Department of Food and Agriculture announced. Samples of the vegetables, 
which are imported from Mexico, contained 10 times the level of methamidophos 
permitted by federal standards. It cannot be removed by washing and can cause 
flu-like symptoms including nausea, headaches and diarrhea. Albertson's, Boys, 
Hughes, Lucky, Pantry, Pavilions, Pavilion Places, Safeway and Von's markets 
told the state agency they do not handle ABC Brand produce.

Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said he will seek strong measures to 
combat air terrorism but nothing that will put U.S. carriers at a disadvantage 
in world travel markets. Skinner said at a news conference that he will attend 
a meeting of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization in 
Montreal next week to look for ways to prevent attacks on civilian aviation. 
Skinner also announced that Federal Aviation Administrator T. Allan McArtor, 
who was named to his post in 1987, is resigning. He said that McArtor turned 
down his offer to be considered to remain at the FAA. Responding to criticism 
of the FAA for not warning the public about threats against Pan Am Flight 103 
before a plane on the flight exploded over Scotland killing 270 people, Skinner 
said air travel cannot be stopped every time there is a threat.

The Philippine House of Representatives backed a presidential ban against the 
return of Ferdinand E. Marcos, saying the ailing former president might stir up 
trouble if he came home from exile. House Speaker Ramon Mitra said a majority 
vote supported President Corazon Aquino's ban on Marcos' return. But Mitra, who 
heads a pro-Aquino political party, said members of Congress might listen if 
the former ruler "is going to return some of the money" he allegedly stole 
while in office. Marcos is in guarded condition in a Honolulu hospital.

Hundreds of troops reportedly infuriated over the size of a pay raise rampaged 
through the streets of Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea, 
assaulting passers-by and destroying government property. Witnesses in the 
southwest Pacific nation said the soldiers blocked traffic and attacked 
journalists before police fired tear gas to disperse them. Australian 
Associated Press said the soldiers were angry over the raise, reportedly the 
first in 14 years, charging that it benefited only officers. Papua New Guinea, 
a former U.N. Australian trust territory, became independent in 1975.

Financial planner Henry Gherman, who fled to the Far East last summer with 
nearly $10 million in investors' money, pleaded guilty in Miami to federal 
embezzlement and mail fraud charges. Under a plea bargain agreement negotiated 
by federal officials and Gherman's attorney, he faces a maximum penalty of 35 
years in prison. Gherman, 52, also could be fined $1.75 million. The issue of 
restitution depends on bankruptcy court proceedings, according to U.S. Atty. 
Jeffrey Crockett. Gherman was arrested in Tokyo in October, 1988, and was 
returned to Miami last December. Court documents charged that Gherman 
"willfully and unlawfully devised a scheme to defraud, obtain money and 
property from clients" of Financial &amp; Investment Planning Inc. in North 
Miami Beach.

As "round-table" talks in Poland entered a second day, Solidarity leader Lech 
Walesa told supporters that although he would eventually like to see open 
parliamentary elections, his priority is the restoration of the union's legal 
status. At the formal talks with 57 participants, including a 25-member 
opposition group led by Walesa, authorities offered Solidarity legalization if 
the union endorses a package of economic and political reforms. Three working 
groups dealing with that proposal are to begin meeting this week. Meanwhile, 
government spokesman Jerzy Urban played down overly optimistic expectations for 
the talks. "It is an event of significance . . . but one should not imagine 
that . . . it is some magic wand."

50TH DISTRICT VOTERS CHOOSE TUCKER TO SUCCEED HIS FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA and JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The voters of the 50th Assembly District established a political dynasty 
Tuesday, sending Curtis R. Tucker Jr. to Sacramento to fill the Assembly seat 
held for 14 years by his late father, former Democratic Assemblyman Curtis R. 
Tucker of Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Tucker, a legislative aide who emerged from obscurity after his 
father died of cancer last October, beat three other candidates in a special 
election that drew few voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
With all 171 precincts reporting, Democrat Tucker had 12,250 votes or 71.2% of 
the total. Republican business consultant Mike Davis ran a distant second with 
3,235 votes or 18.8%. 
</P>
<P>
By capturing more than 50% of the votes cast, Tucker avoided a runoff against 
Davis. He is expected to be sworn in by Thursday in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood school board member Lois Hill-Hale, another Democrat on the ballot, 
drew 1,125 votes or 6.5%, and Los Angeles Police Officer Carl McGill, also a 
Democrat, received 411 votes or 2.4%. Democrat Roderick Wright, who dropped out 
of the race too late to be removed from the ballot, had 188 votes or 1.1% 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's name, combined with big-name endorsements from powerful Democrats and 
a huge war chest made him the heavy favorite in the race to fill the vacancy 
created after his father made California history last November by winning 
reelection after his death. 
</P>
<P>
At his storefront headquarters in Inglewood beneath the banner of his father's 
earlier campaigns, Tucker said, "the legacy is being passed on," not only to 
him but his supporters. "My name helped tremendously, but those people won this 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elder Tucker's Wish 
</P>
<P>
The elder Tucker, who rose from being the first black on the Inglewood City 
Council to become chairman of the Assembly Health Committee and patriarch of 
Inglewood politics, often said he hoped his son would succeed him. Citing that 
wish, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) backed the younger Tucker 
and placed financial and political muscle at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also pressured Gov. George Deukmejian to reschedule the election from its 
original date in April to February. Brown's support kept several potentially 
strong candidates -- Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent, Los Angeles City 
Councilman Robert Farrell and Inglewood Councilman Daniel Tabor -- out of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's victory gives Brown a crucial 41st vote in the 80-member Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the campaign, Tucker was the target of attacks from his opponents 
who questioned his credentials and called him an unqualified puppet. 
</P>
<P>
As he savored his victory, Tucker dismissed those charges and said the voters 
had ignored them as well. "They insulted the voters' intelligence" he said of 
his opponents. "The voters knew who the best candidate was. They saw through 
the smoke screens. The people were informed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mostly Democratic 
</P>
<P>
The predominantly black and Latino Assembly district includes Inglewood, El 
Segundo, Westchester, Lennox and parts of South-Central Los Angeles. It is 77% 
Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker outspent his rivals by a wide margin, with contributions from the 
medical industry and the Democratic establishment totaling nearly $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker kept a generally low profile during the campaign, missing most candidate 
forums. But his well-funded organization, run by political consultants and 
workers on loan from Speaker Brown's staff, sent election literature into the 
homes of voters and hit the streets and telephones in a concerted 
get-out-the-vote drive. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker is on leave from his job as a legislative aide to Assemblywoman Gwen 
Moore (D-Los Angeles), for whom he has worked about a year. He previously 
worked five years for Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
The other candidates were limited by their resources. Davis, 34, who raised 
about $11,000 from Republican leaders, concentrated on conservative voters in 
Republican El Segundo and Westchester, hoping low turnout in other areas could 
lead to an upset. He was seeking the seat for the third time, most recently 
losing to the elder Tucker last November. 
</P>

GEORGIANA HARDY; SCHOOL OFFICIAL FOR 20 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Georgiana Hardy, whose election to the Los Angeles Unified School District 
Board of Education in 1955 signaled the collapse of an archconservative 
majority and the beginning of a liberal era in local education, has died, it 
was learned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The woman who served 20 years on the board -- believed longer than anyone else 
in the 134-year history of the school system -- was 78 when she died of heart 
failure Monday at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter, Georgiana Rodiger, a clinical psychologist, said Mrs. Hardy had 
been in declining health for some time. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong liberal whose credentials included public service on the national 
level, Mrs. Hardy served on the school board from 1955 to 1975 and was school 
board president three times (1958-59; 1963-64 and 1967-68). 
</P>
<P>
Her election came at a time when conservatives representative of the McCarthy 
era were directing the school board and when textbooks they deemed unpatriotic 
were being kept out of classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
After her election Mrs. Hardy helped reshape and liberalize policies, among 
them one that had prevented the teaching of the aims and policies of the United 
Nations. Hers was an early voice for school integration because, as she told 
The Times in 1970: "It overcomes a lot of fears, and fear is the basis of 
prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
She spoke dozens of times as the board's social conscience and once, when a 
school construction bond issue had been defeated, chastised parents in a 
suburban area: "You supported bond issues when (your area) was undergoing its 
greatest growth, but once you had it made, you didn't give a damn what was 
happening in other parts of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Born Georgiana Sibley in Orange, N.J., she became involved in several national 
organizations, serving on the White House Committee on Youth from 1935 to 1939, 
as National Girl Scouts vice president from 1938 to 1942, as a member of the 
U.S. attorney general's Conference on Juvenile Delinquency in 1948 and as 
chairman of the Los Angeles County Conference on Community Relations from 1953 
to 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Hardy also was an early participant in civil rights demonstrations, 
picketing outside the National Theater in Washington to protest Marian 
Anderson's being barred from singing there because she was black. 
</P>
<P>
She attended the Eastman School of Music and Radcliffe College and was awarded 
an honorary doctorate by the University of Judaism in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Her first marriage ended in divorce, her daughter said. She then married 
attorney Jack Hardy, who died in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
In 1948, she moved to Los Angeles, where she became a book reviewer and 
panelist on the long-running educational TV program "Cavalcade of Books" on 
KNXT. The show won a George Foster Peabody Award in 1953 for best educational 
television show. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her daughter, Dr. Rodiger, and a son, the Rev. Charles 
Glenn, both from her first marriage, 14 grandchildren and two 
great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service will be held at 4 p.m. Saturday at All Saints Episcopal 
Church in Pasadena.

BLUE-SHARK MARKET TO BE SOUGHT IN COMPROMISE ON LONG-LINE FISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Department of Fish and Game does not often cozy up to commercial 
fishing interests, so its position in the long-line fishing experiment was 
confusing to some people. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas other sportsmen's advocates were calling for an end to the experiment, 
the DFG, represented by Al Petrovich, chief of marine resources, and Dennis 
Bedford, staff marine biologist, recommended to the Fish and Game Commission at 
Long Beach last week that 10 commercial permits be renewed, and so they were. 
</P>
<P>
Long-line fishing is the use of stainless steel gear trailed several miles 
behind a boat with about 100 12-foot leaders and hooks per mile. 
</P>
<P>
Long-liners last year caught 130 tons of mako sharks -- a prized sportfish -- 
and more than twice as many less-desirable blue sharks, virtually all of which 
were released. If the experiment were to be continued a second season, the 
sportfishermen at least wanted the commercials moved 50 to 60 miles offshore, 
far away from what the sportfishermen called the "nursery" area of the makos. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial fishermen said that would be dangerous in their 30-foot boats. 
One stood up and said, "That's absolutely ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
A sportfisherman responded: "You're killing all the babies." 
</P>
<P>
Between sessions of the emotional two-day meeting, a compromise was reached 
that seems to give the commercial interests just enough long line to hang 
themselves. The DFG does not intend to endanger the makos, so commercial 
fishermen now must promote a market for blue sharks, which are useful for 
little more than crab bait unless they can be bled alive and kept fresh to 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
But their second season will be shorter, four months instead of six, May 1-Aug. 
31. And so will their lines, four miles instead of five. They will be limited 
to 120 tons of makos, and they will be barred from the prime inshore area 
bounded by Point Vicente, Catalina Island, and Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they will be performing additional research for the DFG. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how big that nursery area (for makos) is," Bedford told the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
Petrovich said: "We feel we're proceeding cautiously." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Bedford added: "I think the sportsmen came out better than they 
thought. If you're going to conduct an experiment, you have to give it enough 
time. Also, we saw this as an opportunity to develop an under-utilized 
resource. We're trying to get (the commercial fishermen) to focus on the blue 
sharks. They're on notice now." 
</P>
<P>
The commercials say only a few boats can turn profits from a combined 120-ton 
limit on makos. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Raynor of Oxnard, a spokesman for the California Longliners Assn., said: 
"We will build a blue shark market or we're out of business." 
</P>
<P>
The permit for the third annual California special desert (Nelson) bighorn 
sheep hunt will be auctioned at the annual convention of the Foundation for 
North American Wild Sheep at Reno, Feb. 15-18. The first two went for $70,000 
and $59,000, respectively. The money is used for research and management of the 
animals in California. 
</P>
<P>
The permit will be valid for a 30-day season next November and December in the 
Marble and Kelso Peak-Old Dad mountains in San Bernardino County -- the only 
two of about 50 bighorn habitats in the state where the animals may be hunted. 
</P>
<P>
The special permit is in addition to eight general permits allocated to hunters 
by lottery, at $200 each. Interested persons may phone the foundation's 
headquarters at (307) 527-6441. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Fish and Game and the Society for the Conservation of Bighorn 
Sheep are looking for volunteers for guzzler (water collector) and census 
projects scheduled through October. Phone (213) 590-5158. . . . During its 
meetings at Long Beach last week, the Fish and Game Commission presented a 
resolution honoring Bill Nott for his work on behalf of sportfishermen and 
marine resources. Nott, the immediate past president of the Sportfishing Assn. 
of California, has been hospitalized for several weeks. His wife, Winn, 
accepted the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The Truckee Lions will conduct their second Sierra Sweepstakes sled dog races 
of the season Feb. 18-19 at the Truckee-Tahoe airport. Last month's event drew 
about 7,000 spectators over two days. . . . The DFG reported that 36 pronghorn 
antelope were drowned when the ice broke on a stream they were attempting to 
cross in Modoc County. Only two weeks earlier, 27 pronghorns were killed when 
hit by a train, also in Northern California. . . . Charles Huffman, 68, of 
Crescent City has been fined $2,400 for illegal possession of a bighorn sheep 
head, illegal gill nets, spike-jawed traps and some illegal hides. Huffman also 
was recently fined $5,000 for killing a trophy bull elk out of season. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG has proposed a special, limited either-sex deer hunt on Catalina Island 
from mid-October through January. Only 300 permits would be issued. Currently, 
all deer hunting on the island is under the jurisdiction of the Private Lands 
Management Area program. . . . The DFG has fitted 20 does in the San Bernardino 
Mountains with radio telemetry tracking devices. The U.S. Forest Service will 
assist in a project to determine habitat utilization and needs and avoid 
conflicts with other users. . . . Non-resident hunters have until March 15 to 
apply for deer, antelope, moose, bighorn sheep and mountain goat licenses in 
Wyoming. They may write the Wyoming Game and Fish Dept., Information Section, 
Cheyenne, Wyo., 82009.

Joe Humphreys, an author, fisherman and fly fishing instructor at Penn State, 
will be guest speaker at the Sierra Pacific Flyfishers' Feb. 16 dinner meeting 
at the Odyssey Restaurant in Mission Hills. Information: (818) 785-7306. . . . 
Mike Mathiot, Western Regional director for Quail Unlimited, will conduct a 
hunting and calling clinic March 2 at 7:30 p.m. at the Pasadena Center, Room 
C-316, 300 E. Green St. The fee will be $2. Reservations: (818) 351-0381. . . . 
A report here on the setback handed the geothermal power project at Hot Creek 
in the Eastern Sierra overlooked the influence of the Sierra Club in 
overturning the approval of the Mono County supervisors. Joseph Brecher, lawyer 
for the club's legal defense fund, and club activist Frank Stewart played major 
roles in the fight.

BRUBECK COMFORTABLE AFTER HEART SURGERY; NEW DRUMMER ADDED TO MCCOY TYNER TRIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Noted pianist and composer Dave Brubeck, famed for his rendition of "Take 
Five," successfully underwent a 4 1/2-hour, triple-coronary bypass surgery 
Tuesday at Yale University Hospital in New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors couldn't be more pleased with the results," said Russell Gloyd, 
39, Brubeck's manager. "He was in such sensational shape that everything worked 
out fine." Brubeck was resting comfortably in the intensive care ward late 
Tuesday, Gloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Brubeck's recuperation period is expected to be two months, and "the doctors 
anticipate no problems because he was in such great shape," said Gloyd. 
</P>
<P>
The pianist, despite known problems with clogged arteries for eight years, 
continued to tour steadily. He had been on a strict diet and had been walking 
five miles a day "up until two days before the surgery," Gloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
The operation forced postponement of Brubeck's scheduled appearances for at 
least two months, including several dates across the United States starting in 
late February, followed by a three-week European tour slated for March. 
</P>
<P>
"A dance program with the Murray Louis Dance Company in Winnipeg and Montreal 
in April may still take still place," Gloyd said, "but that's obviously going 
to depend on his condition." 
</P>
<P>
Brubeck, a jazzman who studied with classicist Darius Milhaud early in his 
career, formed his first quartet in 1951, and soon became one of the most 
popular of jazz musicians. Though his compositions "In Your Own Sweet Way" and 
"The Duke" have been widely recorded, he is still best known for his rendition 
of "Take Five," which was written by his longtime alto saxophonist, the late 
Paul Desmond. 
</P>
<P>
NEW DRUMMER: McCoy Tyner, the pianist who plays with a heavy yet most lyrical 
hand, has added a new drummer to his trio. Aaron Scott replaces Louis Hayes, 
who had been with the pianist since 1984. "I heard Aaron, who's from Chicago 
but had been living in Paris, when I was playing with the French National 
Band," said Tyner, who plays through Sunday at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in 
Hollywood. "I really liked him, and when Louis left, I thought he'd fit 
perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
Tyner still has no plans to add any horns to his tightly-knit threesome. "I 
love it, and besides I have an occasional big band that I put together in New 
York, and that has plenty of horns," he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
COME BLOW YOUR HORN: Musicians looking for their, to paraphrase Andy Warhol, 15 
minutes in the footlights can compete in the fifth annual Hennessy Jazz Search. 
The winner of this nationwide jazz talent contest, hosted by "The Tonight 
Show's" Doc Severinsen, gets a spot as opening act at the Playboy Jazz 
Festival's June 18 show at the Hollywood Bowl, plus $2,000 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
To enter, send a tape of your band, not more than 20 minutes long, to Hennessy 
Jazz Search, 3435 Ocean Park Blvd., Suite 201-JAZZ, Santa Monica, 90405. 
</P>
<P>
Entries, which must be postmarked by March 1, will be judged on their 
originality, technique and creative style by an as-yet-unnamed panel of jazz 
experts. Twelve semi-finalists from around the country will compete for the top 
award, which will be determined at a play-off held locally May 16. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENT AND CHOICE LPS: "Early Bird" (Sunnyside) from former Blakey pianist 
Donald Brown is a modern mainstream session that bubbles with enthusiasm and 
intelligence and ranges from sextet to solo piano tunes. "Bassically Simple" is 
a no-nonsense rhythm changes opus, "Speak Low" goes from back-beat funk to 
surging uptempo and "Playground for the Birds" has light-permeated buoyance. 
Reedman Donald Harrison, trumpeter Bill Mobley and vibist Steve Nelson stand 
out. . . . "Refuge" (Spindletop) is a New Age/contemporary jazz offering from 
guitarist-keyboardist's Ric Flauding. The leader stresses his compositional 
side, which runs from minimalistic pieces like "Heart Dancer" and "Mist and 
Fog," though he stretches out on guitar on "The Night Is Not Silent." 
Saxophonists Brandon Field and Keith Felch are other featured soloists.

AFGHANS TOLD TO EVACUATE SALANG HIGHWAY AREA

The Afghan army warned residents along the Salang Highway to flee their homes 
because of fierce fighting expected on the vital supply route between Kabul and 
the Soviet Union, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
With only one week before the last Soviet troops are due to leave Afghanistan 
under a peace accord, Tass said Muslim rebels battling the Soviet-backed Kabul 
government are again attacking food and fuel convoys. 
</P>
<P>
"If the criminal activities of the rebels do not stop, the Afghan armed forces 
will take the most decisive measures," Tass quoted the Afghan army command as 
saying. "The commander in chief is calling on citizens of those regions to 
leave their places of residence for some time to avoid any unnecessary 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
In Kabul, President Najibullah's beleaguered government said it has distributed 
guns to 30,000 members of the ruling party. It said about 45,000 party members 
who had already completed their military service have volunteered for reserve 
duty or joined self-defense and border units. 
</P>
<P>
Kabul Radio reported Tuesday that more than 150 "extremists" -- its term for 
the rebels -- were killed by government forces in the previous 24 hours, many 
of them in the eastern province of Nangarhar, according to the British 
Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tass said, the guerrillas launched dozens of rockets at the airport at 
Kandahar, Afghanistan's second city, but were driven off and sustained 16 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Soviet officials said at a news briefing Tuesday that their 
government is still behind Najibullah. "There have been no nuances or changes 
with regard to President Najibullah from the Soviet side," said Deputy Foreign 
Minister Igor A. Rogachev. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri K. Alexeyev, another ministry official, said about 15,000 Soviet soldiers 
were killed during the nine-year Afghan conflict -- 2,000 more than the Kremlin 
reported in May, 1988. However, he seemed unable to explain the discrepancy and 
said the new figure "doesn't mean . . . we had the bloodiest period of the war" 
during the withdrawal period.

SALVADORAN REBELS OFFER NEW TRUCE PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
BUT OFFICIAL CALLS CEASE-FIRE PROPOSAL TIED TO VOTE DELAY A 'TRICK'

Marxist guerrillas called Tuesday for a two-month cease-fire in El Salvador's 
civil war if the government will agree to postpone the presidential election 
until autumn, but the minister of defense described the proposal as "a trick 
with little credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Officials attending an all-party conference to frame a response to an overall 
peace plan that the guerrillas had put forth earlier said they are working on a 
possible postponement of the elections, now scheduled for March 19, until the 
end of April. 
</P>
<P>
The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the umbrella organization for 
five rebel groups, had said in the earlier proposal that if the elections were 
set back to Sept. 15, it would take part in them and abide by the results. 
</P>
<P>
The FMLN, as the guerrilla organization is known, dropped previous demands that 
the guerrillas be given a share of governing power and that their 7,000 
fighters be integrated into the army. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, the defense minister, said the guerrillas' 
proposal is aimed at disrupting the elections and dividing the political 
parties and the army. He said the military will not tolerate any violation of 
the constitution, which calls for a presidential election before the end of 
March. 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire offer was made in a statement issued to reporters Tuesday 
morning. It said that a truce could be arranged to begin 30 days before a 
negotiated new election date and continue for 30 days afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The offer came after Salvadoran politicians and U.S. officials, who have 
privately expressed doubts about the seriousness of the earlier rebel proposal, 
criticized it for not addressing a number of issues. For example, it made no 
mention of a cease-fire except for five days at election time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question Remains 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's statement, in addressing that criticism, left unexplained why a 
cease-fire would be necessary for 30 days after the election if the guerrillas 
were willing to accept the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
And although previous guerrilla statements have said that the Sept. 15 date is 
negotiable, Tuesday's statement said again that this date, which is the 
anniversary of Salvadoran independence, is of prime importance. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the statement emphasized that "the FMLN has been enormously 
flexible" and will continue its effort to put an end to a war that has taken 
the lives of 45,000 or more people. 
</P>
<P>
With the military opposed to extending the election past March on grounds that 
it would violate the constitution, a position largely supported by the U.S. 
Embassy here, the all-party conference has been struggling to compromise on a 
new date. 
</P>
<P>
A Christian Democratic Party delegate said there may be a loophole that will 
permit a delay until April 30. All candidates would be asked to withdraw from 
the first round of voting and the voting would be rescheduled for the end of 
April, when there was to have been a run-off if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear that the FMLN would accept such a plan. Although the guerrillas 
said they are flexible on a date, a rebel spokesmen said they need time to 
organize their followers as well as to negotiate a reorganization of the 
electoral machinery to ensure a fair vote.

With his 26-year Navy career in jeopardy and a court-martial imminent, Capt. 
Alexander G. Balian is determined to put up a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I did anything wrong," Balian said in an interview the other 
day. "I'm angry enough . . . to do what I have to do to get my name cleared, do 
what I have to do to continue my career." 
</P>
<P>
Balian has chosen to make the Navy prove its contention that he is to blame for 
an incident last summer in the South China Sea involving Vietnamese refugees 
who later resorted to cannibalism to survive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Given Food and Map 
</P>
<P>
Balian was the commanding officer of the amphibious transport ship Dubuque, en 
route to the Persian Gulf, when it encountered the refugees' vessel, a junk, 
last June 9. He gave the refugees food, water, a map and directions to the 
nearest land, but he decided not to take them on board his ship. 
</P>
<P>
The decision has haunted Balian and embarrassed the Navy since June 28, when 
the surviving refugees, picked up by Philippine fishermen, began telling 
stories of killings and cannibalism on the junk after the Dubuque left them. 
</P>
<P>
Balian is to be court-martialed beginning Friday at the Subic Bay Naval Base 
here on charges of dereliction of duty and disobeying orders. The proceedings 
will be open, and reporters from around the world are expected. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials had hoped to avoid such a spectacle. When Balian was relieved of 
his command last summer, he was offered a chance to appear before an admiral's 
mast, a closed administrative hearing with relatively restricted power to 
punish. 
</P>
<P>
It was an offer that Balian, the eldest son of an Armenian immigrant, decided 
he should refuse, as he is legally entitled to do. In choosing this course, he 
forced the Navy to either drop the issue or order a court-martial. But he risks 
more severe punishment: If convicted, he could be sentenced to four years and 
three months in prison, fined thousands of dollars and discharged from the 
Navy, losing all benefits, including his pension. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the Navy; it's my life," Balian said in the interview, "but I don't 
like what's happening to me, and I don't like some of the people that made it 
happen. . . . No one's writing me off except a few of my own seniors in my own 
Navy." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of Balian's defense is his contention that he made the correct 
decision based on the information available to him at the time of his encounter 
with the junk. He argues that the information was flawed due to a "cacophony of 
errors" committed by his crew, who were exhausted and edgy, he says, from a 
stepped-up schedule intended to get the Dubuque to the Persian Gulf as quickly 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Balian said his case is "just about identical" to that of Capt. Will C. Rogers 
III, commanding officer of the cruiser Vincennes, which shot down an Iranian 
airliner last July 3 in the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 people on board. In a 
report released last August, the Pentagon said the crew of the Vincennes made 
crucial errors that led Rogers to believe that the airliner was an attacking 
jet and give the order to fire on it. However, neither Rogers nor any member of 
his crew was disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
They returned home to San Diego last October to a hero's welcome arranged by 
the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same thing as with me," Balian said. "His crew was fatigued, they 
say. He made decisions -- correct decisions -- based on the information he got, 
and so did I." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politically Sensitive 
</P>
<P>
The only difference, Balian said, is that "those were Iranians and these were 
Vietnamese. We were at war with Iran." But the refugee incident came at a 
politically unfortunate time, Balian said, because the United States was 
negotiating with the Vietnamese for the return of troops missing in action in 
the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy reacts immediately to State (the State Department) and any other 
political influence -- to my chagrin sometimes," Balian said. 
</P>
<P>
Balian is charged with failing to obey Navy orders requiring that commanding 
officers render assistance to people and vessels in distress. The Navy also 
alleges that he ignored the tradition that all mariners offer assistance to 
anyone in distress at sea. 
</P>
<P>
It alleges that Balian failed to conduct a thorough inspection of the junk, 
failed to conduct a medical evaluation of the refugees, who were described as 
"visibly dehydrated and sickly," failed to assist refugees swimming in the 
water near the Dubuque and ordered crew members not to throw life preservers to 
them. The Navy also alleges that Balian violated regulations by not accurately 
informing his superiors of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
He has denied all the charges. Navy prosecutors have declined to discuss the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Only 52 of the 110 people reported to have boarded the junk survived the voyage 
from Ben Tre in Vietnam, which they left last May 22. Some apparently had died 
before the vessel met the Dubuque. Afterward, one refugee reportedly took 
control of the junk and the supplies and ordered the killing of three young 
passengers whose bodies were cannibalized. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the refugees are to be called as witnesses at the court-martial. They 
are said to be grateful to Balian for stopping and providing assistance at all. 
As many as 50 other ships reportedly passed them and ignored their pleas for 
help, Balian and his lawyers have said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no reason to believe that the refugees were in such bad shape," Balian 
said. "Had I known what I know now, not only would I have given them medical 
examinations, I would have embarked them and taken them to Singapore." 
</P>
<P>
He said his case should serve as a warning to others. Any ship captain who now 
does not stop to pick up refugees, regardless of their condition, "is just 
plain stupid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of his crew, Balian said, "I think they did the best job they could, but they 
certainly didn't do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inspected the Vessel 
</P>
<P>
When the junk was sighted on the morning of June 9, Balian sent his executive 
officer and several crew members in a launch to inspect the vessel. The 
executive officer decided not to go aboard because of obvious chaos on board, 
Balian said, adding that he concurred with that decision as a reasonable 
measure to safeguard his crew. 
</P>
<P>
A key problem, Balian said, was a 20-year-old Vietnamese-American sailor who 
was sent in the launch to translate. The sailor promised the refugees that 
another ship would be sent within two days to pick them up, a promise he was 
not authorized to make, Balian said, adding that he didn't hear of the sailor's 
promise until the official investigation began. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees, expecting to be rescued, squandered the food from the Dubuque 
quickly, eating so much the first day that many vomited, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly believe that if it weren't for that (the sailor's promise), they 
would have sailed on and they would have rationed and controlled their food," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The sailor, as well as other members of the crew, are expected to testify at 
the court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
Balian acknowledges that he was not a particularly popular commanding officer. 
He refers to himself as a "trouble-shooter" who was frequently assigned to take 
control of problem ships. Such was the case with the Dubuque, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a pretty hard-charging guy," Balian said. "When you work for me, you have 
to do the job right. You have to do it by the book. Trying doesn't count as 
much with me as getting the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Balian, 48, grew up in Los Angeles and enlisted in the Navy after graduating 
from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the world to see me for what I am," he said, "a professional naval 
officer decorated for my war experiences in Vietnam, humane enough to embark 
refugees on two previous occasions, humane enough to consider the plight of 
these refugees."

$1.5-BILLION BOND ISSUE PROPOSED FOR RAILWAY PROJECTS 
</P>

<P>
Likening the United States to a Third World country in its development of rail 
transit services, key legislators proposed a $1.5-billion bond issue Tuesday to 
finance an array of commuter and intercity rail projects in California. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), the lawmakers said the state is in 
such urgent need of a variety of solutions to its mammoth traffic problems that 
they will introduce a bill in the next few weeks that will place the general 
obligation bond issue on the June, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to attract widespread support for the measure, Costa said it would 
specify the projects that would be eligible for funds. Among the projects, he 
said, would be an expansion of the Orange County-Los Angeles lines and creation 
of new commuter services between San Bernardino and Los Angeles, between San 
Bernardino-Riverside and Orange County, and along the congested Ventura-San 
Fernando Valley-Los Angeles corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys) said he envisions the bond money being used for 
expanded commuter service along the Southern Pacific main line from Simi Valley 
to Union Station in Los Angeles, with stops in Chatsworth, Panorama City, 
Burbank and Glendale. Amtrak already runs intercity trains along the line. 
</P>
<P>
"That will allow commuter service at rush hour between Chatsworth and downtown 
Los Angeles in less than 30 minutes and between Van Nuys and downtown Los 
Angeles in less than 20 minutes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Costa said intercity projects would include extensive upgrading of facilities 
to provide hourly service between Los Angeles and San Diego and expanded 
service between the Bay Area and Sacramento and through the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which would be called the Clean Air and Transportation Improvement 
Act of 1990, would distribute the $1.5 billion to passenger rail capital 
projects throughout the state on a population basis. Before any funds could be 
allocated by the state Transportation Commission, local transit agencies would 
have to present plans identifying all funding sources for projects and 
demonstrating their ability to cover operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds and interest would be repaid from state tax dollars over a 20-year 
period. Funds could be used for, among other things, the purchase of rail cars 
and locomotives, acquisition of rights of way, improvements to track, stations 
and grade crossings and construction of stations.

A city bus plunged over the side of a 60-foot cliff, leaving 19 people dead and 
22 injured, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Enrique Hernandez de Jesus, was among those killed in the accident 
Monday, which occurred on the outskirts of this Baja California town as the bus 
traveled a winding and steep stretch of road. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez and 13 passengers died at the scene. Five more passengers died at 
hospitals on Monday and Tuesday, Ensenada Fire Department spokesman Jose Luis 
Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 22 injured being treated at local hospitals, several were said to be in 
critical condition, said Miroslava Cuellar, a spokeswoman for the city of 
Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
The bus, owned by Transportes Rojo y Blanco (Red and White bus line), had not 
had a mechanical inspection in five years and had no insurance as required by 
state law, Cuellar said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Clear There Is Corruption' 
</P>
<P>
"It is well-known that there is corruption between the transport companies and 
state transit officials," she said. "Considering that these vehicles are 
allowed to operate without inspections and without insurance and that drivers 
are paid not a salary but by the number of passengers they can cram into their 
buses, it is clear there is corruption." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said he hoped that the tragedy would bring an investigation of bus 
transit practices in Ensenada.

FAULTY BRAKES HINTED IN BUS DEATHS OF 19

Mexican authorities said Tuesday that mechanical failure -- possibly faulty 
brakes -- was the likely cause of a bus crash in Ensenada that left at least 19 
people dead and 22 others injured, many seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the driver couldn't stop the vehicle," said Elias Padilla 
Gonzalez, who heads the Ensenada branch of the Baja California transit 
department, which is investigating Monday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla and others described the accident in telephone interviews Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bus -- reportedly more than 20 years old -- was filled to capacity when it 
veered off a sharp curve on an unpaved road northeast of downtown Ensenada and 
plunged more than 50 yards down an embankment, officials said. The vehicle 
rolled over numerous times before coming to rest at the bottom of a hill 
shortly after 11:30 a.m. Monday. Driving conditions, already hazardous on the 
steep, rocky roadway, were rendered even more perilous by recent rain, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police interview with one witness, the driver warned passengers, 
"Hang On! We have no brakes!" shortly before going over the side. 
</P>
<P>
The bus was owned by a cooperative known as Rojo y Blanco (Red and White). The 
driver, identified as Martin Rosales, was among 15 people reported dead at the 
scene, authorities said. Four others succumbed at hospitals on Tuesday.

DEREGULATION HAUNTING HOME BUYERS, THRIFTS

<P>
President Bush's proposal to strip federal savings and loan regulators of their 
independence is a vivid symbol of how government deregulation and inflation 
have ripped apart the once comfortable order of home mortgage lending in the 
past decade. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, you had established financial institutions that took in money 
at low rates and lent it out at low rates," said David Maxwell, chief executive 
of the Federal National Mortgage Assn. "And all of that has changed, and this 
is another step in that change." 
</P>
<P>
What Bush wants to do is place the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the principal 
regulatory agency for the nation's 3,000 federally insured thrifts, under the 
control of the U.S. Treasury as part of a $90-billion effort to clean up 
massive, expensive failures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stands for Problems 
</P>
<P>
For several decades, the bank board has served as a symbol of the government's 
commitment to housing. The U.S. agency was formed during the Depression to 
regulate and foster an industry that was to provide consumers a steady source 
of mortgage money. 
</P>
<P>
Today, though, lax oversight by the bank board stands for much of the problems 
that now haunt the thrift industry. Though most thrifts do make money, several 
hundred are insolvent due to bad loans and must now be bailed out with taxpayer 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Home ownership in the United States has long been an integral part of the 
American dream -- a key symbol of family well-being, not to mention the 
generous deductions at tax time. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bank board's supervision, thrifts played a major role in financing 
the housing boom that followed World War II and transformed urban areas across 
the country. Thrifts in California grew to dominate the industry by financing 
huge housing booms in counties around Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1980s began, American homeowners were largely a pampered lot, 
accustomed to receiving cheap mortgage loans that were fairly easy to get and 
had fixed-payments over the life of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts had gained an all-American reputation from "It's a Wonderful Life," the 
1946 Frank Capra classic in which Jimmy Stewart plays a squeaky-clean character 
who heads off a panic at his family's savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything about this film gets the blood pumping in the right direction, 
straight to the heart," said a review by Motion Picture Guide. "(The film) 
deals with middle-class values and around the edges of every problem, and joy 
is Capra's personal stamp of sentimentality, or perhaps American 
sentimentality." 
</P>
<P>
Those days are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
More typical today is an American public disgusted with the thought of having 
to bail out the industry. And homeowners today -- those who can even afford to 
buy a house -- pay market rates for home loans and often reel each time rising 
interest rates drive up the mortgage payments on their adjustable-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Old Days Ended 
</P>
<P>
How housing finance has changed so fast in just one decade is directly related 
to deregulation, much of which has been poorly timed and badly handled. As John 
Tuccillo, chief economist at the National Assn. of Realtors, put it: "People 
wanted deregulation in the worst way, and they got in in the worst way." 
</P>
<P>
The good old days of government succor for American housing really ended the 
day that Regulation Q was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Regulation Q limited interest rates on savings accounts to 5.5% at thrifts and 
5.25% at commercial banks -- below-market rates that allowed financial 
institutions to make low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
But on March 31, 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed a law that phased out 
Regulation Q, raised the maximum deposit insurance from $40,000 to $100,000 and 
expanded thrift investment powers. It was to be the first phase of federal and 
state deregulation legislation that was to badly disrupt the industry in the 
years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
For consumers, the news was both good and bad -- good because savers could earn 
higher interest rates on savings and bad because borrowers had to pay higher 
rates on home loans. Lenders had to boost loan rates to offset the rising 
deposit costs. 
</P>
<P>
The rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
As the decade wore on, the industry's health was gradually undermined by a 
combination of factors, including the bank board's lax supervision and 
poor-quality lending outside the area of home loans. 
</P>
<P>
The present problems aside, many experts do not believe that housing needs 
special government attention any more, arguing that the huge demand for homes 
that followed World War II and continued for several decades has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand for housing is not as great it used to be," said Robert B. O'Brien 
Jr., chief executive of Carteret Savings Bank in Morristown, N.J. "I don't know 
that we need a special housing finance industry anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Government figures show that housing construction fell from 2.02 million units 
at the end of 1978 to 1.62 million units at the end of 1987, the latest year 
for which annual figures were available. 
</P>
<P>
Others argue that the old system of favoritism toward housing was simply 
unfair. "Since (former President Ronald) Reagan got in, there has been a 
feeling that housing is a spoiled brat that has gotten special attention for 
far too long," said Sanford Goodkin, a real estate consultant in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the nation's housing market is vast, complex and very much dominated by 
the competitive market forces. Lenders often sell their loans into the 
secondary market to quasi-government agencies such as the Federal National 
Mortgage Assn., and customers may go to commercial banks or mortgage bankers if 
they do not want to get a home loan from a thrift. Thrifts today make only 
about one-half the nation's home loans. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, housing markets in urban areas such as Los Angeles 
and San Francisco have become all but unaffordable for most first-time home 
buyers because of rising interest rates and soaring real estate values. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the problem is getting worse, not better, according to figures 
just published by the California Assn. of Realtors, an industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, only 26% of the state's households could afford a 
median priced home of $165,605. To qualify for that loan, the borrower would 
have to make more than $51,000 a year, the trade group said. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook is worse in Southern California, where real estate values were 
white hot in 1988. In Orange County, it took a family income of $65,672 to 
afford a median priced home of $211,402, while it took an income of $55,942 to 
buy a median priced home of $180,081 in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Housing for the middle-class does exist, but it is far from the traditional 
city centers.

In fact, Gray held that Intel had forfeited its copyrights for the 8066/88 by 
allowing the distribution of copies without copyright notice. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tremendous victory for NEC," said company spokesman Hank Josefczyk. 
"The real winners, though, are the customers. This decision means that they can 
take advantage of the superior benefits of these V Series microprocessors 
without any concern about the outcome of the trial." 
</P>
<P>
The case had been keenly monitored in Silicon Valley because of its potential 
precedent-setting implications for the computer industry. The ruling giving 
copyright protection to microcodes meant that some of the most sensitive 
secrets of U.S. high-technology companies could be protected, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
Intel alleged that NEC infringed on the copyrights of its microcodes with the 
introduction of its so-called V-Series chips and sought a court order to stop 
the Japanese chipmaker from continuing to market the product. 
</P>
<P>
NEC countered with two arguments: That Intel failed to take the necessary steps 
to ensure the copyright of its microcodes and that, in any case, the NEC 
product was not a duplication of the Intel technology. 
</P>
<P>
Gray was the second judge to enter the case, having taken over from U.S. 
Northern District Judge William Ingram, who disqualified himself in December 
1987 because he owned about $80 in Intel stock through an investment club.

DUCHESNE HAS COME A LONG WAY QUICKLY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, Steve Duchesne was snubbed by all 21 National Hockey League 
teams for all 12 rounds of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Duchesne was marooned in New Haven, Conn., a million miles 
away from the guy sitting next to him. He couldn't speak a syllable of English. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I got enough votes from people to start in this All-Star Game, I 
know there still will be some people in the East who will look and say, 'Steve 
who?' " the Los Angeles Kings defenseman said Monday. "That's OK. I've come a 
long way. And it's hard for me to explain how happy I really am. This is a 
dream." 
</P>
<P>
The hype for Tuesday night's 40th NHL All-Star Game at Northlands Coliseum is a 
double scoop of Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, there's the continuing drama of The Great One vs. Mario "The Greater 
One" Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there's the tale of Gretzky returning to Edmonton to dress at 
his old locker, again center a line for Jari Kurri and play once more for 
Campbell Conference Coach Glen Sather. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says that he's eager for this one. The greatest attribute of No. 99, 
however, is that he raises all his teammates' emotional commitment a notch as 
well. And judging by press conference exuberance, no one's emotional commitment 
is higher than Duchesne's. 
</P>
<P>
With 17 goals and 58 points in 54 games, Duchesne is second only to 
Pittsburgh's Paul Coffey in NHL defenseman scoring. He has earned his starting 
berth alongside Edmonton's Kevin Lowe on the Campbell defense. He is the first 
Kings defenseman to make the All-Star Game in 14 years and has an outside shot 
of joining Coffey, Bobby Orr and Denis Potvin as the only defenseman in NHL 
history to score 100 points in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Duchesne also knows that -- in political terms -- he rode Gretzky's coattails 
in gaining 138,685 fan votes to edge Calgary's better-known Gary Suter for the 
second starting defense berth. Gretzky's linemate Luc Robitaille, in fact, used 
the new-found prominence of the Kings and the fact that there is less 
competition at left wing than center to beat Gretzky in the overall Campbell 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Luc is a little embarrassed about that," said Duchesne, who is making 
only $130,000 this season, according to the Los Angeles Times, and is looking 
for a new, lucrative four-year deal. "You know, the first thing when you see 
Wayne coming and you don't know a person is you're afraid he's all for his 
points and himself. Then, you get to know him. He's such a nice person. And he 
pushes you. He wants to win so badly. You want to win for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Before Wayne came, you didn't get much attention in L.A. Now, we do. The fact 
that we're winning more helps. And because of Robbie Ftorek (and his alleged 
dictatorial coaching ways), too." 
</P>
<P>
That last line was a joke. Duchesne, 23, is comfortable enough with the 
language now to launch a zinger or two. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always that way. Raised in Sept-Isles, Quebec, 10 hours north of 
Montreal near Labrador, Duchesne never left his home province until after he 
was signed in 1984 as a free agent by the Kings (on the advice of Alex Smart, 
the same scout who pushed for Robitaille). 
</P>
<P>
Duchesne, who was named to NHL All-Rookie Team in 1987, carries a plus-27 on 
the ice this season. Off the ice in New Haven 1985-86, however, Duchesne carted 
around a big minus. He was the only French kid on the Nighthawks and couldn't 
understand what people in Connecticut were saying. He was scared. 
</P>
<P>
He used to close his eyes and point to anything on a menu at a restaurant. He 
almost got into fights with teammates whom he sensed were making fun of him. A 
frightened Duchesne lost 17 pounds at one point and ended up in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Ftorek, then coaching the Nighthawks, got Duchesne started with an English 
tutor. Each day before hockey practice, he would practice his verbs, nouns and 
adjective. By last season, he was taking a class in sports medicine at Cal 
State Northridge and this season he's close to completing a business class at 
Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
His goal? To be just like his hero and fellow All-Star Larry Robinson of the 
Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
"As great as he is on the ice, he's such a gentleman off it," Duchesne said. 
"He handles himself so well. You know, only two years ago, I'd be afraid to 
talk to you. I was embarrassed of making mistakes. But, I wanted to learn 
English so badly. I love to talk. I'm still learning. Just like I'm learning on 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"With Wayne on our team, it's great. He teaches me how to play better and be 
confident. He's taught me how to be patient with the puck. Not to rush." 
</P>
<P>
Patience paid off. Picked as the last player in the Quebec junior draft, 
Duchesne had his number retired by his Drummondville junior team. Unselected in 
the NHL draft, he has been voted as an All-Star by the fans. He has gone from 
overlooked to NHL All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope all those scouts are watching," Duchesne said.

AS SCHNEIDER, MCKINNEY DUEL, SVET STEALS SLALOM 
</P>

<P>
This was supposed to have been another showdown between Tamara McKinney of the 
home team and Vreni Schneider of the Swiss visitors. One of them surely would 
win the women's slalom in the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
It was an easy race to figure. No Svet. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider had won all five World Cup slaloms this winter and finished second in 
the combined last week -- to none other than McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's first run more or less confirmed the prerace consensus as McKinney 
took the lead with a time of 43.98 seconds. Schneider was in eighth place, 1.47 
seconds back, but she usually skis a slow first run, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The only jarring note was the presence of Yugoslavia's Mateja Svet in second 
place, just .04 behind McKinney. But, come on, her country had never won an 
Alpine gold medal in World Championship or Olympic competition. The second run 
was going to be Vreni trying to catch Tamara. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider did indeed overhaul McKinney with the fastest time in the second run, 
46.04, but Svet beat them both and grabbed the gold. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a dream last night that I would win this race," said the 20-year-old 
Svet, who finished second to Schneider in the 1988 Olympic women's slalom. 
"Maybe my wish was so strong that nobody could stop me." 
</P>
<P>
The second-run drama began with Schneider, starting eighth, moving into first 
place with a total time of 1:31.49 and staying there until Svet, the 14th 
racer, came down in 46.86 for a 1:30.88 and the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Vreni was fastest before I began my run," Svet said. "But I did not 
want to think about her or Tamara. I just wanted to concentrate on skiing the 
best I possibly could. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw my name on top of the scoreboard at the finish, I was very happy 
because I knew I would at least be second." 
</P>
<P>
Then it was time for McKinney to take her best shot at winning her second gold 
medal in five days. At the timing interval, she was .01 ahead of Svet's pace. 
</P>
<P>
But then, she said, "I got too conservative at the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
Her time of 47.58 gave her a total of 1:31.56, good only for the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
"The first course was really good," McKinney said. "It was set by my coach, 
Martin (Rufener), and I was very comfortable with the long, straight line. The 
second (set by Sweden's Lars Hjalmars) was more turny. I tried to ski a strong 
race, but a smart one, too. I'm happy with the way it came out. I wanted to 
win, but third place is pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what she had done in the three hours between runs, McKinney, 26, said, "I 
just tried to thaw out my frozen feet. They've been frostbitten for the last 
three days, and it was 25 below during the first run." Whereupon she pulled off 
a boot and socks to reveal a rather bluish left foot. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother, Steve, and three sisters -- Sheila, Laura and Ouisha -- are all 
here, along with a whole gang of other people, including my adopted daddy, Hans 
Standteiner (of Squaw Valley), and we all went back to the lodge, where I tried 
to find a quiet place." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, 24, said she wasn't too surprised by her slow start. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just not aggressive enough in my first runs," she said in German. "I'm too 
cautious. But I'm not a machine. I've won five slaloms this season, and I 
thought I could make up the time in the second run because it was my kind of 
course. I tried hard, but it was just too big a difference to make up. 
</P>
<P>
"I said last week, everybody has a chance to beat me once. Unfortunately, it 
had to happen here. I'm pleased with my silver medal, and I know I can still 
win a gold medal in the giant slalom (on Saturday)." 
</P>
<P>
In that race, she will again race both McKinney and Svet, who took the silver 
medal behind Schneider in the giant slalom at the 1987 World Championships, 
besides earning a bronze in the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
At both Calgary last February and at Crans-Montana, Switzerland, the year 
before, Svet had her own rooting section, about 20 men clad in furry folk 
costumes, banging drums, ringing bells and chanting, "Ma-te-ja, Ma-te-ja," then 
carrying her on their shoulders after each race. 
</P>
<P>
They're not here, yet, but Toni Vogrinec, the Yugoslav team captain, expects a 
group of them to arrive before the giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in Slovenia will be celebrating tonight," Ogrinec said. "All 1.8 
million people. This is the peak of carnival time, and there will be some 
violent beer-drinking and a lot of wine consumed. We have been having economic 
problems and needed something like this -- a gold medal." 
</P>
<P>
Svet, from Ljubljana in the Yugoslav republic of Slovenia, is no longer the shy 
girl of two years ago. She is an outspoken young woman whose English is also 
much improved. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it here in the United States," she said. "People are so kind. The first 
time I came to this country, I didn't like it, but then I got to meet some of 
the people and saw how great everything is. I think I prefer to be here, rather 
than in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Then, noting the frowns of some European reporters, she quickly added with a 
laugh: "Oh, but please don't write that in the European newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
John McMurtry, the new U.S. Alpine program director, was almost as happy with 
Eva Twardokens' eighth place as he was with Tamara McKinney's bronze medal. 
"She is coming back after being out for a year because of major knee surgery," 
he said. "And now it looks like she is six months ahead of schedule." . . . 
McKinney and Twardokens are roommates, and they joined their coaches for a 
champagne toast at Beaver Creek after the race. Said McKinney: "The rules say 
that if you're over 21, you can drink at your own discretion." . . . Only 32 
racers finished both runs, as 25 went out in the first run and 10 more in the 
second. . . . Both super-G races will be held today on Vail Mountain, the women 
competing in the morning and the men in the afternoon.

MIKE DOWNEY: IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH SEASON FOR CARSON

The great Reveen, magician extraordinaire, called for a volunteer to stick his 
head beneath the blade of the guillotine. Peter Pocklington obliged. The owner 
of the Edmonton Oilers placed his skull inside the wooden collar, which then 
was locked into place around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
"Comfortable?" the magician asked. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Pocklington would have nodded -- if he could have. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh huh," he grunted. 
</P>
<P>
The great Reveen asked for silence from the audience. With a grand wave of the 
hand, he addressed the subject whose head was on the chopping block. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a magician," Reveen told the spectators, "could have created this man." 
</P>
<P>
They laughed. Off with his head, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ready?" asked Reveen. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh huh." 
</P>
<P>
Down came the blade. 
</P>
<P>
Ta-da. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Pocklington, as an old joke goes, did not lose 20 pounds of ugly fat. He 
was not beheaded. He did not get the old Sir Thomas More "just a trim, leave 
the sideburns alone" treatment. He walked away, cranium intact, from Monday's 
party at Jubilee Auditorium, just one of several soirees sponsored by the city 
of Edmonton before the 40th National Hockey League All-Star game, played 
Tuesday night at the Northlands Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The man on the guillotine was the man who traded Wayne Gretzky. He traded 
Gretzky and a couple of other lesser players for a whole bunch of money and a 
couple of lesser players . . . . . . and Jimmy Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Good old Jimmy Carson. It was a tough loss for Los Angeles -- so tough a loss 
that the man who owns the Kings, Bruce McNall, dangled $5 million in front of 
Peter Pocklington and said, "This is yours. Just let us keep Jimmy." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Pocklington did what he couldn't do in the guillotine: He shook his head 
from side to side. Sorry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And so, the trade was made. And they all lived happily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost all. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is certainly making people happy. He has been the key to a King 
revival, and Tuesday night, in front of a sellout crowd of 17,503 that cheered 
his every move, Gretzky won the most valuable player prize in the Campbell 
Conference's 9-5 victory over the men representing the Prince of Wales. 
</P>
<P>
And Jimmy Carson? 
</P>
<P>
Well, he did just fine. Not only did Carson play with Gretzky and former King 
teammates Luc Robitaille, Bernie Nicholls and Steve Duchesne on the winning 
side. He bagged an assist on Gary Leeman's goal in the second period and scored 
the first All-Star goal of his career 5 1/2 minutes from the game's finish, 
rebounding a Leeman shot and flipping the puck past Wales goalie Rejean 
Lemelin. 
</P>
<P>
A nice night for everybody concerned, one would think. 
</P>
<P>
McNall, the wheeler-dealer himself, was pleased both for the man he got and the 
man who got away. Regarding Gretzky, McNall said: "I don't think he had one bad 
shift out there. I'm glad to see that the best player in the world played that 
way for all the world to see." 
</P>
<P>
And for Carson, McNall added: "I was thrilled to death that he got the goal, 
just as he probably was." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Carson was pleased. Ten minutes earlier, his slap shot had struck the 
post, denying him a goal. He was happy to put one in for the "home" fans. 
</P>
<P>
McNall said: "When he hit that post, I thought, 'Poor Jimmy.' But he stormed 
right back." 
</P>
<P>
Carson has done OK by Edmonton, no doubt about it. Already he has 41 goals this 
season, to Gretzky's 38. Carson is among the NHL's top 10 scorers. Carson, 20, 
also is considerably younger than Gretzky, 28 -- a real catch for the Oilers, 
one would think. 
</P>
<P>
Except, rumors are flying up here -- and Carson has heard them -- that he is 
about to be traded. The hot one right now is that he is headed for his hometown 
of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder that when a guy from Los Angeles stopped by Carson's locker after the 
game to ask if everything was all right, Jimmy knuckled the chair next to him 
and said: "Knock on wood. So far." 
</P>
<P>
He is braced to be traded. "The rumors really heated up last week, although 
they've cooled a little the last couple of days," Carson said. "If it happens, 
it happens. I'm ready. It's been a roller-coaster ride this year -- all the 
hoopla of the trade and everything -- and now all these trade rumors. I was 
glad to have this All-Star game come along to take my mind off it. Nice to play 
with my old buddies again . . . like this guy here." 
</P>
<P>
He slapped Robitaille on the thigh. 
</P>
<P>
"Wasn't it?" Carson asked. 
</P>
<P>
"What?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nice to play together again," Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," Robitaille lied. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good friend. I miss him," Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Me?" Robitaille asked. "What was your name again?" 
</P>
<P>
Carson laughed -- which hasn't been easy this season. Edmonton has struggled. 
Gretzky has not been easily forgotten. Following in his skate trails has been 
difficult. Even Tuesday, when somebody else -- Joey Mullen, maybe -- might have 
been named MVP, Gretzky was. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I think it's Wayne's big return, so give him the car," Carson said. "He 
needs it." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Robitaille said. "He's only got 10." 
</P>
<P>
Carson said beforehand that the only thing he wanted to do on All-Star night 
was not embarrass himself. That was not his attitude going into the season 
itself -- but one could hardly blame him if it had been. The Man Who Replaced 
Gretzky does not want to flop. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly Peter Pocklington could remove that stigma from Carson -- and help 
ease the transition of Gretzky's being gone -- by trading him. Others have 
suggested that Carson might even consider playing out his contract with 
Edmonton and eventually trying to work his way back to Los Angeles. He has even 
kept the house he bought in Redondo Beach. "Nice investment," Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
A trade to Detroit? Hey, Carson said, rumors are part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"And, remember," he said, "if Wayne Gretzky can be traded, anybody can be 
traded." 
</P>
<P>
One of Carson's best friends on the Edmonton squad was Keith Acton. The Oilers 
traded him Tuesday. One more reason not to be ecstatic here. 
</P>
<P>
"Come back to L.A.," the man from L.A. said to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, talk to the man in there," Carson said, pointing. 
</P>
<P>
He was pointing to the office of Glen Sather, Edmonton's coach and general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
But he might as well have been pointing to Peter Pocklington, the head man 
himself.

Wayne Gretzky was nervous before the National Hockey League All-Star game 
Tuesday night. It was his ninth All-Star game, but it was special. Not like 
those games of the past, the games he played for fun. 
</P>
<P>
This game was being played in the Northlands Coliseum, on the ice that was his 
during 10 years with the Edmonton Oilers. This game was being played before a 
sellout crowd of 17,503 that rocked the building with a stirring ovation when 
he was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
This game gave him a rare chance to play on the same line again with his old 
Oiler teammate Jari Kurri. With Oiler goalie Grant Fuhr in the net. With Oiler 
defenseman Kevin Lowe on the team. With Oiler Coach Glen Sather behind the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky really wanted to win this game. 
</P>
<P>
So he did. He charged the Campbell Conference team with the same kind of spark 
he has used to jolt the Kings to life this season. 
</P>
<P>
Just like old times, he and Kurri raced down the ice to combine for a goal with 
a little over a minute played in the game. And the Campbell Conference was on 
its way to a 9-5 victory over the Wales Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd went wild when Gretzky skated up the right side and slid the puck 
across to Kurri on the left side, and Kurri put the puck in behind goalie Sean 
Burke of the New Jersey Devils. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky scored the second goal himself at 4:33, picking up the puck that fellow 
King Steve Duchesne had floated in front of the goal for him. Gretzky put his 
stick down to stop the puck in his path to the left of the goal, then quickly 
scooped it around to the right of Burke. 
</P>
<P>
There was no mistaking the pure joy Gretzky felt at pleasing this crowd again. 
</P>
<P>
And when he was named most valuable player of the game, he was moved. It had 
not been an automatic choice. As Gretzky pointed out: "No one player dominated 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had a goal and two assists. Joe Mullen of Calgary had two goals and an 
assist. Jimmy Carson of the Oilers had a goal and an assist. Mark Messier of 
the Oilers had a goal and an assist. Luc Robitaille of the Kings had a goal and 
an assist. Kurri had a goal and an assist. Gary Leeman of Toronto had a goal 
and an assist. Duchesne had two assists. 
</P>
<P>
For the Wales Conference, Walt Poddubny had two goals. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Lemieux, the NHL's leading scorer and the man who stole this show a year 
ago with six points for the Wales Conference, had just one assist and really 
wasn't a factor. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he will be next year, when the game is played on his home ice at 
Pittsburgh. This night belonged to Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky figures that having the crowd behind him was worth a couple of votes, 
at least, for the MVP honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great time tonight," he said. "I don't think I stopped smiling all 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining that it felt just like old times, he said: "I don't think it really 
hit me that I'd been traded until after the first period tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he admitted, he said that with a touch of longing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never denied that I miss Edmonton," Gretzky said. "I've never denied that 
I miss my teammates. I won't ever deny that. We won four championships in five 
years. We grew up from being a bunch of kids to being the best in the league. I 
miss them a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm in a situation now with an owner (Bruce McNall) who is just 
outstanding, and I'm with a fine organization. Maybe we can build something 
there. I'd like to do that for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been easy to sit back here, maybe even win another two or three 
Stanley Cups. But I'm also enjoying the pressure and the challenge that I have 
now." 
</P>
<P>
On this night, though, he relived some of the old glory and allowed himself to 
show the emotion he feels for the players he misses. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten or 20 years from now, when I look back on my career, there will be times 
that stand out," Gretzky said. "The first time that I was back here with the 
Kings is a time I'll always remember. Tonight will be extra special. . . . I 
think I'll go home and watch the tape." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Campbell Conference's locker room, there were a lot of other 
guys who didn't stop smiling all night. 
</P>
<P>
Sather was, of course, very pleased to coach his first All-Star victory. He was 
0-4 before Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Duchesne was happy for Gretzky and thrilled with the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Ecstatic," said the French-Canadian defenseman. "I'm ecstatic. Ecstatic. 
That's a new word I learned today. That means very, very happy. That's what I 
am. Ecstatic. I learned it from watching TV today. I'm ecstatic and everyone in 
this room is ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
Getting a little more specific, Duchesne said that he was ecstatic to get the 
assist on Gretzky's goal. 
</P>
<P>
The game wasn't wrapped up at that point, though. The Wales Conference tied it 
on goals by Cam Neely of Boston and Poddubny of Quebec before the end of the 
first period. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Wales Conference went up, 3-2, just 1:16 into the second period on a 
goal by Glen Wesley of Boston. But the Campbell Conference scored three 
straight for a 5-3 lead at the end of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
It was 3-3 when both teams changed goalies at the game's midpoint (Rejean 
Lemelin of Boston relieving Burke and Mike Vernon of Calgary relieving Fuhr), 
and then Steve Yzerman of Detroit and Leeman scored just 14 seconds apart. 
</P>
<P>
Poddubny scored his second goal of the night early in the third period to cut 
the lead to 5-4, and Mullen answered with his second to make it 6-4. Then Mike 
Ridley of Washington scored the last goal for the Wales Conference before 
Robitaille, Carson and Messier ran up the score. 
</P>
<P>
NHL All-Star Notes 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky said that he would give the car he won for being named most 
valuable player of the game to a former Oiler teammate, Dave Semenko. "I think 
the car should stay here in Edmonton," he said. "Dave was one of the guys who 
really helped me in my career." . . . With his goal in the first period, 
Gretzky tied Gordie Howe's All-Star career record of 10 goals. Howe scored his 
10 in 23 games. Gretzky has scored 10 in nine games. . . . The Campbell 
Conference's nine goals tied the All-Star record for most goals by one team in 
a game, set by the Campbell Conference in a 9-3 victory in 1983. And the 14 
goals set a record for most goals by both teams, breaking the record of 13 set 
in the Wales Conference's 7-6 victory in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Edmonton Oilers announced Tuesday night that they have acquired right 
winger Dave Brown from the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for center Keith 
Acton and a future draft pick. Brown, 26, has played all five years with the 
Flyers. He has three assists and 100 penalty minutes in 50 games this season.

Bobby Dye, former Cal State Fullerton basketball coach, and John MacLeod, coach 
of the Dallas Mavericks, testified on behalf of Michael Niles in the sentencing 
phase of Niles' murder-for-hire trial. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors watched taped game highlights of Niles, formerly of the Phoenix Suns, in 
a defense attempt to spare him from the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury Jan. 24 convicted Niles, 33, of Corona, of hiring a man 
to kill his wife to collect $100,000 in life insurance. Sonja Rose Niles, 29, 
was killed by a shotgun blast Dec. 13, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
MacLeod was coach of the Phoenix Suns when Niles played third-string forward 
for the team in 1980-81. Niles was part of Dye's Cal State Fullerton team that 
advanced to the West Regional final before losing to Arkansas in 1977-78.

Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders would neither confirm nor deny a report in 
his hometown newspaper that he has decided to return to Oklahoma State for his 
senior season. The school recently was put on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, in Philadelphia to receive the Maxwell Football Club trophy as the 
outstanding collegiate player of the year, was quoted in Tuesday editions of 
the Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon: "I'm planning on returning (to Oklahoma 
State). Right now I'm in school getting ready for next season and some exams." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, who could make himself available to the National Football League, said 
he doesn't remember making those statements.

KATELLA SURVIVES A DREADFUL START; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERLY LEADS SECOND-HALF COMEBACK OVER LOARA, 50-37 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The first half of Katella High School's Empire League girls' basketball game 
against Loara Tuesday night was about as bad a half as the Knights have 
suffered through this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights scored only 15 points and trailed by 7 at halftime. They couldn't 
hold on to the ball, much less put it in the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"We played like a JV team," Katella Coach Barb Bausch said. 
</P>
<P>
"The first half was just awful," Katella guard Joni Easterly added. 
</P>
<P>
Katella managed to straighten itself out in the second half, however, and 
recorded a 50-37 victory at Loara. 
</P>
<P>
Katella, ranked third in the Orange County Sportswriters' Assn. poll, is 21-3 
overall, 9-0 and in first place in the Empire League. Loara falls to 15-11, 
5-4. 
</P>
<P>
A victory over Cypress (9-1 and in second place) Thursday at Katella would give 
the Knights the Empire League championship. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly, the team's leading scorer with a 22-point average, scored the first 
basket of the game, but was held scoreless for the rest of the half. She sat 
out the final 3 minutes 57 seconds after picking up her third foul. 
</P>
<P>
That was just one reason the Knights trailed, 22-15, at the half. Another was 
that Loara outscored the Knights, 13-3, in the second quarter as Katella's 
offense suddenly went silent. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had played good in the second quarter we could have put the game out of 
reach," Loara Coach Gary Blate said. "I don't think we played all that well in 
the second quarter, Katella just didn't play well either." 
</P>
<P>
But Katella rallied after intermission. The Knights outscored Loara, 12-2, in 
the third quarter, taking the lead for good on a follow shot by Easterly with 
2:01 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sorour, a guard, had 18 points, 12 in the first half, to lead Loara. But the 
Saxons were never able to mount a rally and trailed by as many as 15 points 
late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly had a game-high 22 points and forward Karen Jensen added 10 for 
Katella. 
</P>
<P>
"(It seems like) we never play well against Loara," Bausch said. "We acted like 
it was the CIF (Southern Section) finals and we had no business being in the 
gym in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
And with Easterly on the bench, there seemed to be no one willing to take over 
as the team's leader. 
</P>
<P>
"When she's out we've got to find someone to pick up the slack," Bausch said. 
"No one was looking to shoot. It was like, 'Who wants the ball? Not me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 61, Los Alamitos 43 -- Frances Oda scored 18 points and had 10 assists 
to lead host Cypress (18-6, 8-1). Sheryl Murakoshi scored 14 and Erika Manning 
added 10 for Cypress. Melinda Armstrong scored 14 and Allison Arredondo 13 for 
Los Alamitos (4-16, 2-7). 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 50, El Dorado 23 -- Kim Kordik scored 20 points to lead visiting 
Esperanza (3-3 in league play). Chrissy Nieman had 12 points for El Dorado (0-6 
in league play).

SADDLEBACK HOLDS BACK TUSTIN, 56-48

Saddleback High School, the top-ranked boys' basketball team in the county, had 
its second scare in a week Tuesday, holding off Tustin in the final minute to 
secure a 56-48 victory in a Sea View League game at Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Roadrunners pulled out a victory over Corona del Mar in the 
final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Against Tustin, Saddleback (23-1 overall, 9-0 in league play) had its lead cut 
to two points in the final minute before sinking six consecutive free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been suffering from a loss of intensity lately," Saddleback Coach Pat 
Quinn said. "This time of the year there's no real goal. We've got to get back 
in line. 
</P>
<P>
"Give them credit. They played real well and hustled a lot. They were after 
every loose ball." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (12-11, 3-6) moved within one point of the Roadrunners twice in the 
fourth quarter, the second time with 3:10 left when Jason Moore hit two free 
throws to make the score 46-45. 
</P>
<P>
But then Saddleback went on a 10-2 run, including eight free throws by center 
Malru Dottin, to put away the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin had one more chance after Dylan Stieler's three-point play brought the 
Tillers within two, 50-48, with 47 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
But Sean Simon made both ends of a one-and-one and Dottin sank four free throws 
within the final 11 seconds to close out the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Dottin led all scorers with 27 points, including 13 of 14 free throws. 
Saddleback made 19 of 25 from the line. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin, behind three three-pointers by Cheavly Ly, built a six-point 
second-quarter lead before Saddleback ran off 10 straight points on the way to 
a 27-24 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers rallied to tie the score, 35-35, with 2:20 left in the third 
quarter and then moved to within 44-43 with 4:48 left in the game. LARRY NISTA

TUSTIN HAS TOO MUCH DEPTH FOR DEPLETED SADDLEBACK IN 52-19 VICTORY

Tustin High School's girls' basketball team remained tied with University for 
first place in the Sea View League with a 52-19 victory Tuesday at Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (15-10, 7-2) led, 6-4, after one period, then used its superior depth to 
outscore the Roadrunners, 15-4, in the second period and 15-1 in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback (13-11, 4-5) played without three starters -- leading scorer and 
rebounder Melody Mayfield, Melody's sister, Angela, and Priscilla Sarmiento -- 
who were declared ineligible this week because of grades. 
</P>
<P>
"Not having the three girls in the lineup really hurt us," Saddleback Coach 
Rosalind Robbins said. "Melody was averaging 20 points and 12 rebounds per 
game, and Angela and Priscilla brought a lot of heart to the team. We stayed 
close to them in the first quarter, but their defense shut us down in the 
second quarter and we just fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rick Falk, Tustin coach: "They beat us by 32 (63-31) the last time we 
played them, and I was expecting a 70-60-type game the way both our teams 
played. 
</P>
<P>
"When the kids saw that they were playing without the three starters, they let 
down a little. But we started controlling the offensive boards in the second 
quarter and they just couldn't come back. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to feel sorry for Rosalind losing three starters the way she did." 
</P>
<P>
DeeDee Anderson then scored six of her team-high 13 points in the second 
quarter as Tustin outscored Saddleback, 11-2, in the last five minutes of the 
period and finished the first half with a 21-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon, who scored six first-half points before missing the last five minutes 
of the second quarter after she picked up her third foul, finished the game 
with 14 points to lead Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
University 54, Newport Harbor 38 -- Trailing, 15-10, late in the first quarter 
at Newport Harbor, University ran off an 18-0 streak that ended when Newport 
Harbor scored a basket just before the half ended. Shelley Davis scored 17 
points and had eight rebounds for University (18-6, 7-2). Stacey Giem scored 15 
points for Newport Harbor (3-6 in league play). University is tied with Tustin 
for first place in league with one regular-season game remaining.

MUSICALLY, STILLS BACK IN SHAPE

"Reports of my obesity have been greatly exaggerated," Stephen Stills announced 
near the beginning of his performance at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano 
on Monday night. And, sure enough, even if the 44-year-old singer is not down 
to the fighting weight of his Buffalo Springfield days, neither is he still on 
his way to becoming a bookend for CS&amp;N partner David Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
What's more pertinent is that Stills well may have shed a pound or two during 
his set. Unlike the smug, self-absorbed performances that have become a 
hallmark of the Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash experience, Stills' 70-minute show 
found him playing his still-sizable butt off. His singing and guitar playing 
packed an immediacy that shook the dust from the Stills standards that 
dominated. 
</P>
<P>
His vocals on the opening "Love the One You're With" and the following few 
songs sounded mushy and uncontrolled, partly because of a miserable sound mix 
but chiefly, he explained, because he'd had a root canal done that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The novocaine apparently wore off by the fifth song, a charged R&amp;B 
arrangement of "Bluebird." Since it first appeared on the "Buffalo Springfield 
Again" album 21 years ago, Stills has treated the number to every form of 
overblown abuse in concert. But the terse, propulsive treatment he gave it 
Monday made him seem like a reformed man. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by an able if sometimes overbearing trio of keyboards, bass and drums 
(the last played by Ian Wallace, once the "human locomotive" with David 
Lindley), Stills applied similar focus to the bouncy current CSN&amp;Y pop hit 
"Got It Made," as well as "Dark Star," "Southern Cross" and a soul-revue encore 
rave-up of "For What It's Worth," with Stills and the audience shouting the 
"Stop! Hey!" chorus back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief acoustic portion, Stills accompanied himself on the smuggling 
tale "Treetop Flier" and the dark, post-Kent State anthem "Find the Cost of 
Freedom," with the audience supplying the harmony parts on the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from this acoustic segment, it was often hard to discern Stills' 
six-string work because the backing instruments were inexplicably mixed much 
louder than his instrument in the sound system. 
</P>
<P>
When his six-string did cut through -- as on the gospel blues "Old Man 
Trouble," which also featured strong backup vocals from bassist Lenny McDaniel 
-- his stinging, choked lines seemed a perfect counterpoint to his grainy, 
Texas-raised voice.

UCI'S ROWLAND WINS TOP PRIZE FOR OZONE STUDY

UC Irvine chemistry Prof. F. Sherwood Rowland has been awarded the 
internationally prestigious Japan Prize by the Science and Technology 
Foundation of Japan for his documentation of the destruction of the Earth's 
ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-million-yen award in environmental sciences and technology goes to 
Rowland for his theoretical analysis of the depletion of Earth's protective 
ozone layer and his prediction of the rate of depletion. At current exchange 
rates, the prize is worth about $387,600. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland, 62, discovered in 1974 that substances used in common aerosol sprays, 
air-conditioning systems and cleaning solvents were responsible for damaging 
the ozone layer, which he predicted would cause increased skin cancer rates and 
catastrophic climactic change. His work to publicize the findings resulted in a 
1978 congressional ban on the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in aerosol 
sprays. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation also awarded a prize in the field of medical sciences to E.J. 
Corey, the Sheldon Emery professor of chemistry at Harvard University. Corey 
was honored for 40 years of research in the field of organic chemistry, his 
work in the synthesis of Eicosanoidis and publication of 660 papers. Corey also 
receives a prize of 50 million yen. 
</P>
<P>
The award recipients were named today at a 2 p.m. news conference in Tokyo (9 
p.m. Pacific Standard Time on Tuesday). The Japan Prize, awarded in two 
categories each year, rewards scientific and technological achievements that 
contribute to world peace. The prize was established in 1983 by the Japanese 
appliance manufacturer Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and endorsed by the 
Japanese government the same year. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland and Corey, who were selected from among 407 nominees, will receive 
their awards at a presentation April 12. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Moore, dean of physical sciences at UCI, said that Rowland's selection 
represents "a recognition by the scientific community that he was right." 
</P>
<P>
"There are three prizes that are the pinnacles of honor in science: the Nobel 
Prize, the Japan Prize and the Welch Award (presented annually by the Welch 
Foundation in Texas). Sherry (Sherwood) deserves all three. This is probably 
the most prestigious award that anyone at UCI has ever received." 
</P>
<P>
"It is very gratifying," Rowland said Tuesday night from his home in Corona del 
Mar. "It simply means that there is international recognition of the efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Rowland, the Daniel G. Aldrich professor of chemistry at UC Irvine, said he has 
no immediate plans for the cash prize, which is given with no strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
"It means that we can look forward to the end of the month with equanimity 
instead of concern," he said, referring to himself and wife, Joanne. "It will 
probably benefit our younger relatives." 
</P>
<P>
The recognition was especially sweet for Rowland, who suffered years of attacks 
by manufacturers of CFCs and disparagement at congressional hearings and 
academic meetings where he was labled a publicity seeker and "some kind of nut" 
in connection with his work on the ozone layer. In a pioneering research with 
post-doctoral researcher Mario Molina, Rowland wrote that the CFCs splinter 
when exposed to ultraviolet light at high altitudes, setting off chain 
reactions responsible for rapid destruction of the ozone. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland's research was corroborated in a March, 1988, study by the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, which showed that CFCs were destroying 
the ozone more rapidly than previously believed. The ozone layer is a 
protective band of gas that blocks much of the sun's ultraviolet rays, 
protecting animals and plants. 
</P>
<P>
The Science and Technology award is the latest of many honors bestowed on 
Rowland. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and has won the 
Tyler Prize in Ecology and Energy, the Leo Szilard Award for Physics in the 
Public Interest, the Gordon Y. Billard Award for Research and a distinguished 
research award from the UC system's Academic Senate and Academic Council.

GATES ACCUSED OF MISUSING ROLE AS RIGHTS TRIAL BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates was accused of misusing his office for 
political gain Tuesday as a trial began in a lawsuit alleging that the 
perennially popular sheriff violated the civil rights of his political foes. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, in his fourth term and 14th year as sheriff, is accused of conspiring to 
deprive private investigator Preston Guillory of his rights by arranging to 
prosecute him after he began work for two men who unsuccessfully challenged 
Gates for office. 
</P>
<P>
In the federal lawsuit, Guillory has demanded $5 million in damages. He was 
charged, and subsequently acquitted, of illegally carrying a firearm and 
impersonating an officer in a 1985 case investigated by a special police unit 
directly under Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory was harassed and spied upon because he chose to oppose Gates, 
according to Michael Cisarik, the detective's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"They attempted to punish and deter him and dissuade him from exercising his 
rights," Cisarik told jurors in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. "His rights 
to criticize Mr. Gates and law enforcement. His right to complain about 
government abuses and wrongdoing or what he feels is wrongdoing. And his right 
to associate with anyone he feels like associating with." 
</P>
<P>
As the trial opened, lawyers for Gates contended that neither he nor several 
other public officials had done anything wrong in the prosecution of Guillory. 
</P>
<P>
"What the (defendants) did was reasonable, it was lawful, and it was not 
improperly motivated, and they had probable cause to believe that Mr. Guillory 
had committed some offense," said Eric Dobberteen, Gates' lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time that Gates has been accused of illegal surveillance 
and harassment. Three would-be political rivals, including former Orange County 
Municipal Court Judge Bobby D. Youngblood, won $375,000 in a settlement of 
police-spying claims against Gates' office in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The county denied those claims in making the deal, but it was reached shortly 
after a tape recording of one of Gates' rivals turned up in investigative files 
maintained by his office. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory also sued Gates in 1978, alleging that he had been unfairly denied a 
permit to carry a concealed weapon by the sheriff. That case, in which Gates 
also was accused of using the permits to help friends and punish enemies, still 
is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's proceedings mark the first case alleging misuse of government 
resources by Gates to reach trial, and the first in which Gates will have to 
answer direct questions from the witness stand about his actions. Gates, along 
with his top subordinate, Undersheriff Raul Ramos, is scheduled to testify 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The shadow of the Youngblood case hung over proceedings Tuesday as lawyers 
clashed over how much reference to it may be made. At one point, U.S. District 
Judge Richard A. Gadbois, rebuking lawyers for both sides, insisted: "I have no 
intention of trying the Youngblood case here." 
</P>
<P>
Although Guillory is claiming that he suffered emotional distress and damage to 
his business and income, the key demands are for so-called punitive damages 
against the county, Gates and other defendants. Cisarik asked jurors to 
"penalize and punish" Gates "for the reckless disregard he had for Mr. 
Guillory's constitutional rights." 
</P>
<P>
The trial will revolve around the investigation and arrest of Guillory in 1985. 
The charges were based on actions that Guillory allegedly took 6 months 
earlier, while working for Youngblood. Guillory was attempting to find Richard 
Wilder, a defendant in the Youngblood case and an acknowledged informant for 
Gates' elite criminal activities section, which reported directly to the 
sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory contends that he found Wilder and legally served him with papers 
notifying him of the pending Youngblood case. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Gates contend that Guillory posed as a police officer and 
misrepresented himself in other ways while trying to find Wilder, and that he 
carried a concealed firearm on Oct. 21, 1984, the night Wilder was served a 
notice of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory's later acquittal of all the misdemeanor charges does not mean the 
charges were not properly brought, Dobberteen insisted on Gates' behalf. 
Guillory had been investigated both by sheriff's deputies and police in 
Anaheim, where the incident took place. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our position that all of the evidence together will show one basic thing: 
It can be dangerous to be a police officer in today's society. Not in a 
physical sense, everybody knows that," Dobberteen told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
"The county and Anaheim investigated Mr. Guillory properly, reasonably, and 
within the law," Dobberteen said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder was living in the Oakwood Garden apartments in Anaheim in 1984. For a 
week, Guillory interviewed neighbors and employees until he established that 
Wilder was living there. He then hired an off-duty officer of the Los Angeles 
Police Department, Doug Haskins, to accompany him. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory also learned that Wilder was wanted for a traffic offense. He 
requested that Anaheim police send an officer along to make the arrest. 
Guillory carried a firearm, but insisted he wore it on his hip in plain view -- 
a claim that Cisarik told jurors the Anaheim police officer confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
When Wilder was arrested, he insisted that Guillory be arrested on a weapons 
charge. He also called Orange County Deputy Sheriff Randy Blair, who was 
working for Gates, to report his arrest and his claims against Guillory. 
</P>
<P>
Blair, who also was a defendant in the then-pending Youngblood case, 
investigated, along with another deputy, with Gates' approval, according to 
Cisarik. The case was referred to Anaheim city prosecutors, but not through 
normal channels, Cisarik contended. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cisarik, Gates' aide, Raul Ramos, called now-retired Anaheim 
Police Chief Jimmie Kennedy directly, then hand-carried Guillory's file to the 
chief. Kennedy recognized the sensitivity of the case, involving Gates and 
Blair, both defendants in the Youngblood case, the city's lawyer, Paul 
Paquette, told jurors Tuesday. Kennedy told Ramos to submit the case through 
normal channels, and then called Mark Logan, the municipal prosecutor who would 
receive the case for evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Kennedy) could see the specter of impropriety arising," Paquette said. "He 
calls Logan, and makes the statement, 'Be careful.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Logan twice pressed Kennedy for details, the chief advised him of 
Guillory's lawsuit against Gates and the Sheriff's Department's role in the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Logan realized that any prosecution of Guillory could be viewed as 
"retaliation" by the sheriff's office, Paquette said. So Logan arranged for an 
Anaheim police detective to re-investigate the case and, 6 months later, 
decided to charge Guillory with nine misdemeanors. Guillory was acquitted of 
all counts on Dec. 27, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the charges were reasonable at the time they were filed is central to 
the case, and at least six employees and residents of Wilder's apartment 
building will testify about Guillory's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
They include: 
</P>
<P>
* Apartment security guard Radford Mayes, who Dobberteen said will testify that 
Guillory first identified himself as a "detective." 
</P>
<P>
* Retired California Highway Patrol Officer Abelardo Armenta, a resident, who 
claimed Guillory "showed a badge" when questioning him, according to 
Dobberteen. Cisarik contends that Armenta confused Guillory with the LAPD 
officer who accompanied him. 
</P>
<P>
* Security guard Mike Pintos, who thought Guillory was a policeman, according 
to Dobberteen. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's police reinvestigated the key elements of the investigation by the 
Sheriff's Department, and that was why Guillory was prosecuted, according to 
Paquette. 
</P>
<P>
"What did they (the witnesses) say except exactly what the county's report said 
they did," Paquette told jurors. "Mr. Guillory's criminal prosecution and the 
investigation by the city of Anaheim Police Department grew out of the fact 
that there were witnesses who heard and saw what Mr. Guillory did. That's why 
he was charged and for no other reason." 
</P>
<P>
But Cisarik contends that both the Anaheim and the county investigations were 
suspect. He suggested that the investigating officers pressured the witnesses 
to come up with the story that would fit into a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins, the 18-year veteran LAPD officer, was not interviewed at all, Cisarik 
said. And Guillory was not questioned until after the charges were filed, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the case estimated the trial will take at least 2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Gates was reelected to a fourth term in 1986, in which he outpolled two 
opponents combined by 100,000 votes.

HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
PIER TO BE REBUILT WITH PLASTIC-COATED PILINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 77-year-old Huntington Beach Pier, closed last summer after officials 
deemed it unsafe, will be rebuilt out of plastic-coated steel pilings that 
resist corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted, 7 to 0, Monday night to adopt the recommendation of a 
citizens committee to use the polyethylene-covered steel, a relatively new 
alternative for rebuilding concrete and wood piers. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers told the committee last month that using concrete would add as much 
as a year to reconstruction of the pier, perhaps crippling the city's ambitious 
downtown redevelopment plans. 
</P>
<P>
Moffatt &amp; Nichol Engineers of Long Beach told the committee that the pier 
could be rebuilt with wood at about one-third the cost of concrete, but that 
wood also has only a third the life span of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
The committee -- made up of citizens, development representatives, merchants 
and two council members -- has not yet made a recommendation on what material 
should be used to rebuild the pier's deck. However, members said, steel has 
been ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
High seas that pounded the coast a year ago this month ripped off 250 feet of 
the pier's seaward end, including a restaurant. Engineers told city officials 
in July that the steel skeleton of the 1,800-foot pier and its cross beams had 
eroded so severely that it was no longer safe. 
</P>
<P>
Once the roughly $10 million to pay for rebuilding the pier is secured, 
reconstruction should take about a year, engineers say. City officials say they 
hope to reopen the pier by late spring, 1991.

PLANT FIRE TRIGGERS SPILL OF CONTAMINATED WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 2,500 gallons of water that was mixed with potentially hazardous 
chemicals flooded a city street Tuesday morning after a fire in a metal plating 
firm triggered an automatic sprinkler system that failed to shut off, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out about 6 a.m. at Omni Metal Finishing Inc., a metal plating 
firm in an industrial complex at 11665 Coley River Circle, according to Fire 
Capt. John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze started in a tank of nickel sulfate, William said, and then spread to 
a nearby nitric acid tank. The sprinkler system doused the flames but did not 
shut off, causing the tanks to overflow and sending contaminated water out onto 
Coley River Circle and then Newhope Street. 
</P>
<P>
Several businesses in the area were closed for about an hour as hazardous 
materials response teams cleaned up the spill. The area was cleared by 1:30 
p.m. No one was injured in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the spill was "relatively harmless" as long as no one walked in 
or ingested the chemicals. Williams said damage was estimated at $45,000 to the 
building and $20,000 in cleanup costs.

LULAC DINNER TO HONOR EZELL ANGERS SANTA ANA CHAPTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Harold Ezell, the top immigration official in the West, may have gained scores 
of new Latino friends with his sombrero-toting support of the amnesty program 
last year. But he probably could not find too many amigos within the League of 
United Latin American Citizens -- or LULAC -- some of whose members have been 
calling for Ezell's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, that is, the western regional commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service happens to be in Bellflower, whose local LULAC council 
is hosting a reception honoring him for "outstanding service in 'bridging the 
gap' between the Hispanic community and the INS," according to a council 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Location Sparks Anger 
</P>
<P>
The Bellflower LULAC council's hosting of the event would be enough to rankle 
Orange County LULAC leaders, who are still incensed over the INS's apprehension 
last year of several undocumented aliens inside a church in the city of Orange, 
and by continued roundups of casual laborers on street corners. 
</P>
<P>
But what has them even more outraged is that the event honoring Ezell will be 
held in a restaurant in Costa Mesa, on the fringe of territory covered by the 
Santa Ana LULAC council, the most outspokenly hostile to Ezell of the nine 
LULAC councils in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Zeke Hernandez, president of the Santa Ana council, fired off a letter to state 
LULAC leaders, asking that they coordinate action against the reception and the 
Bellflower group. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community cannot be led to believe that LULAC has jumped into bed with 
Ezell and his 'tigers,' " Hernandez said in the letter. "Have we not learned 
our lessons from previous experiences that the INS has mistreated many of our 
respectable Hispanic brothers and sisters?" 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Pacheco, president of the Bellflower LULAC council, has a different 
view of the group's relationship with Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been very helpful and instrumental in helping the undocumented to become 
legal," Pacheco said. "I believe he's gone beyond the call of duty in 
disseminating information and encouraging the people to apply and stay in the 
process until they become permanent residents." 
</P>
<P>
Ezell was traveling Tuesday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked With INS 
</P>
<P>
The Bellflower LULAC council worked with the immigration agency in publicizing 
the amnesty program, conducting weekend fairs where applicants could get help 
in filling out their papers and receiving low-cost medical examinations, 
Pacheco said. And while other LULAC councils may have been critical of the 
Bellflower group for cooperating so closely with the INS, Pacheco said, her 
group now wants to show its thanks to Ezell and his staff for their help. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, the head man gets bypassed," Pacheco said. "Harold Ezell is 
the man who did work with us." 
</P>
<P>
So why not hold the honorary reception in Bellflower and avoid ruffling the 
feathers of other LULAC members? 
</P>
<P>
"There is not very much around here where we could hold it," Pacheco said. So 
the $25-per-person reception is scheduled for Feb. 16 at the El Torito Grill on 
Anton Boulevard in Costa Mesa. Actor John Gavin, former U.S. ambassador to 
Mexico, will be guest speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Jacques, a member of the Bellflower council, said the event is 
co-sponsored by the LULAC Community Education Group, an organization of LULAC 
members statewide that is offering English classes to amnesty applicants under 
Phase 2 of the amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
The group charges $250 for the course, and it obtained certification from the 
INS to offer the classes, Jacques said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing this to promote a positive working relationship with the INS," he 
said. "I would just ask the people in LULAC, those other people out there, what 
did they do to . . . bring these people into the mainstream? It's easy to throw 
stones." 
</P>
<P>
But Hernandez and other Santa Ana council members are not the only LULAC 
members angered by the Bellflower group's initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Del Rio, LULAC's vice president for the Far West region, has recommended 
that the group's national leadership expel former national vice president Jose 
Pacheco -- Margaret Pacheco's husband and the Bellflower council's liaison to 
the INS -- from the League for improper conduct. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Sanctioned' 
</P>
<P>
"The function is not a sanctioned league activity," Del Rio said, referring to 
the action of the Bellflower council. "It (the invitation) says the league is 
honoring him, and it's not." 
</P>
<P>
LULAC's national president, Jose Garcia de Lara, said the executive committee 
has not yet formally considered its response to the Bellflower council's 
action. But he said: "We have condemned Harold Ezell, and we're asking for him 
to be fired, certainly not reappointed. . . . Certainly we don't endorse this 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
Rose Jurado, LULAC's Orange County district director, said she sent a letter on 
Monday to the Bellflower group, asking them to change their plans. But Margaret 
Pacheco said that no other LULAC leaders had contacted her so far about 
canceling or moving the event to another location. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect that (opposition) . . . but we haven't heard anything at all," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana council president Hernandez said his group, along with other 
community members, would picket the event if it goes ahead as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to air your laundry out in public, but you've got to air it out if 
you want clean laundry," he said.

OFFICER INJURED IN CRASH; 1 ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana man was arrested Tuesday night on suspicion of felony hit-and-run 
after he allegedly crashed broadside into a Santa Ana police car, then ran from 
the scene, leaving the officer trapped, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Ramirez, 19, was being held at UCI Medical Center in Orange while 
doctors determined whether facial cuts reportedly suffered in the crash were 
serious enough that he should be held in the jail ward of the hospital, Santa 
Ana Police Lt. Hugh Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Donald Fox was admitted to an unidentified local hospital for 
observation of chest injuries. He was reported in stable condition, Mooney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox was headed west on McFadden Avenue in response to a report of a man with a 
gun when the Mazda that Ramirez was driving hit the patrol car broadside at the 
Mohawk Drive intersection at 5:43 p.m., Mooney said. Ramirez had continued past 
a stop sign on Mohawk, but it was not immediately known whether he stopped, 
Mooney said. Fox had not turned on lights or sirens on the patrol car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy just drove right into him. He said he didn't see him and he drove 
right into his door," Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox lost control of the patrol car, spun into a block wall and struck a 
telephone pole. It took firefighters 30 minutes to cut him out of the vehicle, 
Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez and a passenger fled the accident on foot, but Ramirez was found when 
he called paramedics later for his injuries, Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers who followed up on the original call did not make an arrest or recover 
a gun, Mooney said.

MANSLAUGHTER VERDICT GIVEN IN BABY'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CICCHESE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County Superior Court judge found Gregory Trent Wall guilty of 
involuntary manslaughter Tuesday for his part in the death of a 13-month-old 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that the 31-year-old defendant had shown remorse, Judge Leonard H. 
McBride said he did not believe that Wall showed a total disregard for human 
life and that, therefore, Wall was not guilty of second degree murder, the 
original charge against him. Wall had pleaded not guilty in the case and was 
tried before the judge. 
</P>
<P>
As McBride announced his decision, Wall sat crying, holding his left hand over 
his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who had been free on bail, was not taken into custody. He is to return 
March 31 for sentencing. He could face up to 4 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Wall was arrested in September, 1987, after the death of Shantana Speake, who 
was the daughter of Annette Chrisinger, his girlfriend at the time. 
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Dist. Atty. Melvin L. Jensen, Chrisinger had left her baby 
in Wall's care at her home in Brea when she went to work Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen said Wall's version of what happened that day was that he put Shantana 
in her crib in an upstairs bedroom sometime after 5 p.m., then began vacuuming 
downstairs; he heard the baby scream, and ran and found her at the bottom of 
the stairs; he then put the baby back in her crib and telephoned Chrisinger's 
brother, then Chrisinger, to tell them what had happened but saying that the 
baby appeared to be fine. 
</P>
<P>
When Chrisinger came home, Jensen said, she questioned Wall, who told her that 
the baby had vomited after falling. 
</P>
<P>
Chrisinger went to check the baby and noticed that the she was having 
difficulty breathing, Jensen said. She immediately took the child to a 
hospital, but the child was declared brain dead soon after her arrival. She was 
removed from life support equipment the next day and died. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors and nurses at the hospital had noticed bruises on the baby's head and 
notified police of possible child abuse, and Wall was arrested, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slapping Admitted 
</P>
<P>
During questioning by police, Wall admitted that he had slapped Shantana after 
the fall because she seemed hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
During the weeklong trial, Jensen argued that Wall lied when he said the child 
had fallen down the stairs. Jensen pointed out that the steps were covered with 
padding and carpeting and therefore Shantana could not have sustained the 
injuries that she had in a fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he beat the child up at the crib," Jensen said. "She didn't fall down 
the stairs. . . . It appears the child didn't like him, was jealous of him. She 
had been crying and he had a tough time handling it." 
</P>
<P>
McBride noted in his decision that he was not convinced that Shantana had 
fallen down the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Santa Ana courtroom, Wall's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Tim B. 
Severin, said he was satisfied with the judge's decision to find Wall guilty of 
a lesser charge. He said he believes Wall's version of the story, that the girl 
fell down the stairs, was slapped and went into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testimony From Wife 
</P>
<P>
Severin said that Wall, who came to Orange County from the Sacramento area, has 
no previous criminal record. He also said that Wall's wife, from whom he has 
been separated since 1986, testified that he never abused their own two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Chrisinger, who was not in the courtroom Tuesday, said in a phone interview 
that she felt justice was not done, that Wall should have been convicted of 
second degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is that my little girl lies in the ground," Chrisinger said. "I 
think they should do more about this. It's not necessary to hit babies. There 
is always some easier way to take care of the situation -- putting them in a 
playpen or just stepping away to calm down."

SHELTER FOR HOMELESS, MENTALLY ILL WOMEN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fullerton City Council on Tuesday night approved the opening of a downtown 
shelter that will offer overnight housing to homeless, mentally ill women. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter, which is located in the basement of the First United Methodist 
Church of Fullerton in the 200 block of East Amerige Street, will open "as soon 
as possible" with room for 20 women, according to Eldon Baber, administrative 
director for Western Youth Services. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people now on the streets who are cold and hungry," Baber said in an 
interview before the vote. "And there are very, very few shelter programs in 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Western Youth is a 16-year-old, nonprofit agency that offers mental health, 
shelter and drug-abuse prevention services, Baber said. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 to approve a conditional-use permit for the facility 
but ordered operators to return for a 6-month review. Councilman Richard C. 
Ackerman cast the lone dissenting vote, saying that such a facility was 
inappropriate for the downtown redevelopment area, which city officials have 
been trying to restore economically. 
</P>
<P>
The council majority did attach three conditions to operation of the facility 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
First, the operator was ordered to return in 6 months with a written commitment 
stating how transportation of the women from the Fullerton shelter to day-time 
facilities in Santa Ana would be handled. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the council asked the operator to return in 6 months with a copy of 
eligibility requirements for admission to the program -- an effort aimed at 
ensuring that only truly mentally impaired homeless women are served. 
</P>
<P>
Third, the council asked the operator to return in 6 months with plans for 
providing showers for the women. Currently, the shelter has only sinks and 
toilets on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman A.B. (Buck) Catlin had said earlier that he feared a shelter might 
attract more homeless people to downtown Fullerton. He had wanted assurances 
that women staying at the shelter would be transported elsewhere during the day 
to participate in social programs. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Chamber of Commerce officials also had sent a letter to the Planning 
Commission opposing such a shelter in the downtown area. Their letter was the 
only dissent at the Jan. 11 meeting at which commissioners voted unanimously to 
recommend council approval of the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Baber said that all of the women staying at the shelter would be recommended to 
Western Youth by various government and private social services agencies. Each 
woman would have to be receiving help already from a social worker, he added, 
although some exceptions would be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, if someone shows up at the doorstep and asks for shelter that 
night, they're not going to be thrown out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only homeless women can stay at the shelter, he added, no men or children. 
</P>
<P>
The women will probably be bused to the shelter each day from a homeless 
drop-in center in Santa Ana run by the Orange County Mental Health Assn., Baber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Evening check-in will be around 5 p.m., followed by a hot dinner. The women 
will have to be out of the shelter by 9 every morning for therapy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers will be available in the evening at the shelter to play cards, watch 
television and chat with the women to help them readjust to society, Baber 
said.

HAMAMOTO TAKES HIS TIME WHILE REBUILDING RANCHO ALAMITOS GIRLS' BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Eric Hamamoto became the girls' basketball coach at Rancho Alamitos High 
School in 1986, one of the first things he did was refurbish the team's meeting 
room. 
</P>
<P>
The small, windowless chamber just off the Vaqueros' gym was a shambles with a 
sickening variety of paint and a dingy odor. 
</P>
<P>
So the new coach stripped down the room he had inherited and started from 
scratch. 
</P>
<P>
He did much the same with the shambles of a team he had inherited, one that had 
never had a winning season and had not won a game in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros (17-2 overall, 9-2 in the Garden Grove League) are not ranked in 
any polls, but it's possible they could finish second in the league and reach 
the Southern Section playoffs for the first time in 16 years of girls' 
basketball at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos' only losses came to league rival La Quinta, the seventh-ranked 
team in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"My first year, I just went around the school and asked the teachers to give me 
any girls who could walk straight," Hamamoto said. "I tried to keep all the 
girls I recruited together rather than putting some of the better players on 
varsity. I'd rather have them come into varsity with some confidence. That 
first year, I said, 'Let's just get through this.' " 
</P>
<P>
So with three returning players, and about 20 recruits, Hamamoto created two 
teams. The varsity team went 0-17 in 1986-87, but the program was on its way. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a look at what we had and said, 'Let's try to instill a tradition of 
hard work and a tradition of taking pride in ourselves.' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1987-88, the core of this year's team moved to the varsity, which finished 
10-10, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
This season's team doesn't have the shooting ability of Brea-Olinda or the 
height of La Habra. The Vaqueros rely on a fast-paced offense built around 
small, quick guard Christy Kalbhenn and steady shooting forward Jenny Newsome. 
</P>
<P>
"We run the ball much of the game," said Kalbhenn, a 5-foot senior who averages 
17 points a game. "We win because we are in better shape than the other teams." 
</P>
<P>
Newsome, a 5-8 junior, leads Rancho Alamitos in nearly every offensive 
category, including scoring average (19) and rebounds per game (17). 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have great athletes at our school," Hamamoto said. "There's no 
tradition of any kind of program here, so we just have to work hard to be 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Hamamoto not only emphasizes hard work on the court, but also in the classroom. 
This year's team has a 3.4 grade-point average, Hamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides holding practice six days a week, Hamamoto also holds a study hall for 
anyone getting a grade lower than a B. 
</P>
<P>
"When they have problems in the classroom, they not only deal with the teacher 
but they have to deal with me," Hamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
But all the time and hard work is worth it to the players. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had any respect whatsoever," said Frances Barba, a senior guard. "The 
only good part was that you didn't have to be scared because you knew you were 
going to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't have to be technical. We just had fun. Now it's fun because it's 
scary because people are always after you. That's a wonderful feeling." 
</P>
<P>
It seems no team will catch Rancho Alamitos for second place. Kennedy is in 
third, two games behind with two to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros have not been mathematically eliminated from the league 
championship either. La Quinta, led by Amy Jalewalia, the county's leading 
scorer, is two games ahead with three to play. 
</P>
<P>
"Our girls have a thing about La Quinta," Hamamoto said. "The closest we have 
come to beating them (before this season) was 42 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes it tough when that is the tradition. Mentally, the stigma is very 
hard to get over. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first game this season, we made 22 turnovers which led directly to 39 
of their points. In the second game, we had fewer turnovers than them, we had 
more rebounds than they did, we took more shots but the ball didn't go in the 
basket." La Quinta beat Rancho Alamitos, 66-47 and 68-51. 
</P>
<P>
But Rancho Alamitos is through with La Quinta for the regular season and is 
more concerned about the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally, the girls are ready for any challenge right now," Hamamoto said. 
"I'm very optimistic of us going into CIF (Southern Section playoffs) and doing 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"If the ball doesn't go into the basket or someone gets hurt, that's something 
I have no control over. But I know the intensity will be there. If we play our 
game, we should be there."

<P>
TITANS ALLOW ELDERS TO RUN WITH HIS DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbie Ludovise 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Elders had that queasy feeling as he walked into the office of Ed Carroll, 
Cal State Fullerton athletic director, last July. Elders, the Titans' 
cross-country coach, couldn't imagine why Carroll had asked to see him. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was in trouble or something," Elders said. 
</P>
<P>
No trouble. Carroll told Elders that the university had decided to revive the 
men's track and field program, which had been virtually nonexistent since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
And the head coaching job was Elders', if he wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
The offer was a dream come true for Elders, a Fullerton graduate and a former 
distance runner at Villa Park High School and Rancho Santiago College. 
Something in the realm of a sub-4-minute mile -- a great challenge, but worth 
fighting for. 
</P>
<P>
"I vowed to make it a successful program," he said. "And I'll work as hard as I 
can to make it happen." 
</P>
<P>
If Elders, at 26 one of the youngest Division I coaches in the country, manages 
to make the Titans' track and field program a big success, he would be the 
first. Although Fullerton once had a strong men's cross-country program, 
winning the Division II title in 1972, track has been an on-and-off operation 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, the men's track program was dropped when Fullerton became a Division I 
school. Hurdles were sold and long jump and pole vault pits were torn out to 
make room for a football field. 
</P>
<P>
(Women's track and men's and women's cross-country have always remained, though 
none of these programs have had much success in recent years). 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, men's track was reinstated when Jim Crumpton, a Corona del Mar High 
School track coach, offered to do some fund raising. After two years, Crumpton 
left. Since then, men's track has operated basically as a club sport at 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Messina, coach of the UCLA women's distance programs, spent the 1983 and 
1984 seasons coaching at Fullerton. Messina said he has many fond memories of 
Fullerton, though financial support for the program was always a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me when I went there that there was a $500 budget," Messina said. 
"What they didn't tell me was I was the one who had to raise it." 
</P>
<P>
For Elders, Fullerton's future in men's track appears brighter. Fullerton has 
granted Elders a $5,000 budget for the 1989 season, a substantial increase from 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we got $236 for men's cross-country," Elders said. "That was the 
exact amount to pay our phone bill." 
</P>
<P>
Elders, who teaches part time at Fullerton High School, said his coaching 
salary will increase from $12,000 to $25,000 next year. 
</P>
<P>
But the brightest spot in the Titan track future would have to be the $6.7 
million on-campus sports complex. Construction is scheduled to begin this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a 10,000-seat football stadium, the complex will include a 
1,500-seat baseball pavilion and a soccer field, an eight-lane, all-weather, 
lighted track with surrounding bleacher seating for 3,000. The track portion is 
scheduled to be competed by the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
There are only five all-weather track facilities in Orange County: at UC 
Irvine, Irvine High School, and Rancho Santiago, Saddleback, Golden West and 
Fullerton community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The new Fullerton track should be a great boost to recruiting. As should the 
ever-enthusiastic Elders and his assistants, Ben Brown and Jim Stuart. Mark 
O'Brien, a graduate assistant, helps with the distance program. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a gold medalist in the 1976 Olympics in the 1,600-meter relay and a 
former NCAA 400-meter champion for UCLA, helped Messina coach the Fullerton 
program in 1983. He returned when he heard the program was restarting. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart was the Titans' cross-country coach from 1986-88, and Elders was his 
assistant. But family commitments forced Stuart to give up the position last 
year, so Elders took over. 
</P>
<P>
Elders said he has about 40 athletes -- 20 men, 20 women -- signed up for the 
men's and women's track and field teams. Although most of the men are distance 
runners from the cross-country team, Fullerton will field some quality 
sprinters, including football players Mike Pringle, Mark Hill and Chip Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, a junior, was All-City Section in track for Kennedy High School in 
Granada Hills. Hill, who has 4.6 speed in the 40, was the Bay League 400-meter 
champion at Santa Monica High. And Grant, a freshman, is said to have the best 
speed of the three -- his 40 speed is listed as "4.5 or less" in the Titan 
football guide. 
</P>
<P>
But what does Fullerton football Coach Gene Murphy think of his players taking 
to the track? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it's fine with me, as long as they know where their priorities are," 
Murphy said. "First is books, second is football, and third is track. If they 
can take care of No. 1 and 2 then 3's OK. 
</P>
<P>
"But if it comes between football and track, it has to be football. They're on 
football scholarships here." 
</P>
<P>
At UC Irvine, track and field Coach Vince O'Boyle is welcoming the Fullerton 
track and field revival with encouraging words -- despite the fact that 
Fullerton will compete against Irvine in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great for track and field in all aspects," O'Boyle said. "I'm 
excited about it. It'll help all of our programs around here to have more 
competition. I'm happy for them, especially that they have somebody there 
trying to put it in right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps coincidentally, Elders said he hopes to emulate O'Boyle in building the 
Titan program. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has yet to name a search committee for the basketball coaching job. 
However, some indication of the qualities athletic director Ed Carroll is 
seeking in a coach can be drawn from the job description that has been posted. 
The qualifications listed make it clear that a commitment to academics and 
"desire and ability" to raise funds will be important. Those are two areas in 
which former Coach George McQuarn was criticized by the athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Mayne is a year older and 20 pounds heavier this season, and baseball 
Coach Larry Cochell is expecting a fine season from the junior catcher. He's 
also expecting it to be Mayne's last. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't have him next year. We know that," Cochell said. He predicts Mayne 
will go very high in the June amateur draft, probably in the first round. Mayne 
hit .393 last season and had a 38-game hitting streak.

REGULATORS TAKE NEW LOOK AT PACIFIC SAVINGS' FUTURE

<P>
Except for a 3 p.m. staff meeting at Pacific Savings Bank headquarters, there 
was little evidence Tuesday that a joint task force of federal regulators had 
just moved in to assume oversight of the insolvent Costa Mesa institution. 
</P>
<P>
Customers continued to come and go, employees went about their business as 
usual, and managers of the troubled thrift kept operating the same way they 
have for months. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the flurry of attention focused on Pacific Savings, little actually 
changed as the S&amp;L became one of the first targets in the Bush 
Administration's intensive effort to clean up the nation's savings and loan 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific, which was put into a conservatorship Tuesday, is one of more than 500 
savings and loans across the country that have lost billions of dollars as a 
result of industry deregulation, economic downturns, mismanagement and, in some 
cases, outright fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The change in supervision is expected to have no noticeable effect on Pacific 
Savings' customers, whose deposits continue to be insured up to $100,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Through much of last year, regulators and industry leaders viewed the S&amp;L 
as "salvageable" and a likely candidate for a merger with a healthy 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, anyone who wants to buy Pacific Savings may have to wait. 
Members of the joint task force, composed of banking and S&amp;L regulators, 
said they aren't sure exactly who would be authorized to approve a sale. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, "it's business as usual" for the S&amp;L and consumers, one regulator 
said. The same managers hired 20 months ago from Glendale Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan will continue to operate Pacific Savings under the same business plan as 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel it's a positive process, and we intend to cooperate," said Harvey A. 
Lynch, a GlenFed executive acting as president of Pacific Savings. "We've been 
told that the business plan is consistent with what the banking and savings and 
loan regulators believe is prudent." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the blame for the savings industry debacle has been pinned on 
deregulation in 1982, which ushered in an entrepreneurial management spirit 
and, some say, a lax regulatory attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Many S&amp;Ls jumped at the opportunity to make nontraditional investments, 
such as direct ownership in real estate ventures. And many of those investments 
eventually turned sour, leaving the federal S&amp;L deposit insurance fund all 
but bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Savings lost a total of more than $262 million in the last 6 years as 
it pursued a strategy of selling off many of its branches while favoring 
commercial lending in California and speculative investments in Texas and other 
Southwest states. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the joint task force at the S&amp;L and Pacific Savings personnel 
viewed Tuesday's action as little more than a "regulatory shift of power." 
</P>
<P>
"Liquidation is not an option for us," one Pacific executive said. "As far as 
we know, we're still being considered for sale." 
</P>
<P>
But banking regulators, particularly the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., are 
known for acting quickly and, often, for liquidating ailing institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this means that the chances Pacific could be prepared for liquidation 
are greater now than ever before," said Edward Carpenter, a Costa Mesa banking 
consultant. "The goal now is to accomplish quick reviews and quick actions." 
</P>
<P>
FDIC officials acknowledged that their aggressive approach will speed up the 
handling of failed S&amp;Ls once Congress approves the funds for the program 
laid out Monday by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
All insolvent S&amp;Ls in Southern California will likely be put into 
conservatorships similar to that of Pacific Savings within a month, said 
Stephen Katsanos, an FDIC spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC and other banking regulators -- the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency and the Federal Reserve Board -- were pulled into service under 
President Bush's proposal to help resolve the mess in the ailing S&amp;L 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Some 350 S&amp;Ls nationwide are still insolvent, and the seizure of Pacific 
Savings and three other S&amp;Ls on Tuesday was the first step in Bush's plan 
to take control of all insolvent savings institutions and quickly merge or 
close them. The joint task force plans to seize 224 S&amp;Ls in the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Other likely Southern California targets for seizure include the following 
institutions, with regulatory net worth figures as of Sept. 30: 
</P>
<P>
Westwood Savings &amp; Loan of Los Angeles, minus $222.7 million; First 
California Savings of Orange, minus $71.4 million; Founders Savings &amp; Loan 
of Los Angeles, minus $36 million; Arrowhead Pacific Savings Bank of San 
Bernardino, minus $23.4 million; Signal Savings &amp; Loan of Signal Hill, 
minus $7.8 million; Perpetual Savings of Santa Ana, minus $11.5 million; 
Unified Savings of Northridge, minus $15.8 million, and Manhattan Beach Savings 
&amp; Loan of Manhattan Beach, minus $18.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Another insolvent S&amp;L, Carver Savings &amp; Loan of Escondido, was closed 
Jan. 27 by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Carver had reported a negative net 
worth of nearly $10 million on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators estimated that the Carver closing would cost the bank board 
about $58 million. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators from the bank board and its deposit insurance arm, the Federal 
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., also are part of the joint task force. 
</P>
<P>
"What we'll be doing is in many respects the same thing FSLIC has been doing," 
said Stephen Katsanos, an FDIC spokesman. "But we will be bringing interagency 
personnel to it, and bringing in considerably more people resources." 
</P>
<P>
The task force will use about six examiners to review the loans and other 
assets on the books of Pacific Savings and try to determine what options they 
have to resolve the problems, said Keith Seibold, an FDIC employee at the 
S&amp;L Tuesday. The FDIC, which is spearheading the task force, is acting as 
conservator for Pacific Savings. 
</P>
<P>
After the first nine months of last year, Pacific Savings had a negative 
regulatory net worth of $200.3 million, which means its liabilities exceeded is 
$1.1 billion in assets by that much. 
</P>
<P>
In its current form, Pacific Savings was created in 1981 with the three-way 
merger of Santa Fe Federal S&amp;L of Riverside, Oceanside Federal S&amp;L and 
Pacific Federal S&amp;L of Hollywood. But Pacific Savings traces it roots to 
1890 when the S&amp;L in Riverside was founded. 
</P>
<P>
It moved its headquarters from Hollywood to Costa Mesa in 1982 specifically to 
take part in the Costa Mesa downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Savings built its own corporate headquarters and a branch office in a 
Spanish-style complex on Newport Boulevard and financed a matching project, the 
$22-million Courtyards retail and commercial complex that opened just a block 
away in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
By then, however, the S&amp;L already was beginning to falter. It began selling 
its well-regarded branch offices as it aggressively entered the market of 
commercial and industrial lending and real estate investing. In 1983, it posted 
a $7.2-million annual loss, largely from loans and investments that went bad. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L invested millions of dollars in the then-booming states of Texas, 
Colorado and Louisiana in the early 1980s, and lost it all when oil prices 
fell, plunging those three states' economies into depression. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, regulators stepped in and replaced all of Pacific's top management, 
contracting with GlenFed to take over the job of operating the S&amp;L -- the 
state's 29th largest with more than $1.2 billion in assets at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lynch, the acting president, has revived the S&amp;L's moribund 
branch operations, now down to 11 branches, and steered it more toward 
traditional mortgages and safer investments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A HISTORY OF PACIFIC SAVINGS BANK 
</P>
<P>
1981 
</P>
<P>
* Pacific Savings Bank, a mutual association owned by depositors rather than 
outside shareholders, is created through the three-way merger of Pacific 
Federal S&amp;L of Hollywood, Oceanside Federal S&amp;L and 81-year-old Santa 
Fe Federal S&amp;L of Riverside. The new association begins selling many of its 
60 branch offices to raise capital. 
</P>
<P>
1982 
</P>
<P>
* Moves headquarters from Hollywood to Costa Mesa to participate in that city's 
new redevelopment activity. 
</P>
<P>
1983 
</P>
<P>
* Begins commercial and industrial real estate lending and real estate 
syndication activities. 
</P>
<P>
* Posts annual loss of $7.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
1984 
</P>
<P>
* Converts from a federal charter to a state charter to take advantage of more 
liberal California laws governing investment activities by S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
* Reports annual loss of $9.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
1985 
</P>
<P>
* Announces its first commercial development, the $22-million Courtyard 
commercial and retail complex in downtown Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
* Agrees to sell 13 of its 25 remaining branches to American S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
* Reports annual profit of $4.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
1986 
</P>
<P>
* Retained by Federal Home Loan Bank in February to manage insolvent American 
Diversified S&amp;L, also in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
* Relinquishes American Diversified management contract in August. 
</P>
<P>
* Regulators in September begin pressuring Pacific to shore up its own wobbly 
finances. Pacific begins discussing merger with HF Holdings Inc., headed by 
William E. Simon, the former Treasury secretary, and Preston Martin, former 
vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
* Reports $109.5-million loss for the year, largely from soured real estate 
investments in Colorado, Louisiana and Texas. Net worth falls to negative $69.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* HF Holdings says it no longer is interested in purchasing Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
1987 
</P>
<P>
* Required by regulators to write down the value of real estate assets in 
economically depressed Texas and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
* Top management replaced by regulators in June. Glendale Federal Savings hired 
to take over management. Despite this action, Pacific is not placed in 
receivership or under conservatorship, a normal step when an S&amp;L's 
financial condition has deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
* Posts $113-million annual loss. 
</P>
<P>
1988 
</P>
<P>
* Sells its 50% stake in a data processing subsidiary in Covina to raise cash. 
</P>
<P>
* Begins marketing insurance, through a subsidiary, at its 11 remaining branch 
offices. Also begins offering consumer and adjustable mortgage loans. 
</P>
<P>
* Executives trumpet "signs of recovery" as first quarter net loss drops to 
$6.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Pacific's president announces the S&amp;L is "ready for sale" and says an 
operating profit in the second quarter cut first 6 months' loss to $17.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* Pacific's third-quarter financial report, the most recent available, brings 
loss for the first 9 months to $26.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
* New federal regulatory group made up of S&amp;L and banking regulators places 
Pacific into conservatorship under President Bush's day-old S&amp;L bailout 
program.

JUDGE AGAIN THWARTS MAI'S BID FOR PRIME COMPUTER TAKEOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a ruling that will buy time for Prime Computer Inc., a federal judge in 
Boston said Tuesday that he will continue to block MAI Basic Four Inc.'s 
$970-million takeover offer because of incomplete disclosures by Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Inc., MAI's financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone rejected a motion by Tustin-based MAI to 
discontinue an injunction blocking its bid. Mazzone said Drexel's failure to 
provide certain financial information was "inexcusable and inexplicable." 
</P>
<P>
In December, Mazzone blocked MAI's hostile bid for Prime Computer, a Natick, 
Mass., minicomputer maker, saying MAI had failed to adequately disclose its 
relationship with Drexel. Mazzone had also said MAI's proposed financing may 
violate Federal Reserve Board margin requirements on loans used to finance 
stock purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Mazzone said at Tuesday's hearing that he had been ready to grant MAI's motion 
on Monday, believing that Drexel had provided all the information at its 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
But, Mazzone said, he then discovered that Drexel, a New York investment firm, 
had provided far more detailed information in Securities and Exchange 
Commission filings for an unrelated, failed bid for Interco Inc., a St. Louis 
apparel manufacturer and retailer. 
</P>
<P>
He asked whether Drexel was too distracted by its negotiations with the federal 
government to make full disclosures to him, referring to the firm's agreement 
to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650 million in a proposed settlement 
for securities law violations. 
</P>
<P>
William McGuiness, an attorney for MAI, said "in all likelihood, my client will 
do whatever is necessary to pursue its legal right." But he did not say what 
steps MAI would take. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruling comes at a crucial time for Prime Computer, which is trying to 
thwart the $20-per-share bid by MAI, a computer maker controlled by New York 
investor Bennett S. LeBow. 
</P>
<P>
As of Jan. 30, 72.6% of Prime's common shares had been tendered to MAI. The 
offer, which MAI launched nearly 3 months ago, is scheduled to expire Feb. 15.

ART CONTEST TO PUBLICIZE 'FREE TUESDAYS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'Free Tuesday" at the Newport Harbor Art Museum means exactly that: no 
admission charges every Tuesday throughout 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Underwritten by a $50,000 grant by Jack Shea, a museum trustee and president of 
Beacon Bay Enterprises Inc. in Newport Beach, the program is intended to 
introduce more people to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
To inaugurate "Free Tuesday," the museum is sponsoring an art contest for 75 
second-graders at Bonita Canyon Elementary School in Irvine. On Feb. 21, the 
students will be bused to the museum for a talk by Shea, and they will be asked 
to draw poster-size pastels on paper. 
</P>
<P>
The drawings will be judged by a seven-member panel drawn mainly from the 
Orange County media, including Narda Zacchino, deputy managing editor of the 
Los Angeles Times and editor of The Times Orange County Edition; Tim Kelly, 
managing editor of the Orange County Register, and Janet Eastman, editor of 
Orange Coast magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The winning child will receive a free family pass to Disneyland, and his or her 
art will be reproduced on a poster advertising the free Tuesdays at the museum. 
The poster will read "Today's Artist," with a reproduction of Ron Davis' 
painting "No. 573 -- Vent Duo and Invert," donated by Shea to the museum, and 
"Tomorrow's Artist," with a reproduction of the winning child's work. 
</P>
<P>
Several corporations (or their foundations) finance free or reduced-admission 
days or evenings at major United States museums. Among them are Pacific Telesis 
Foundation and The Gap Inc. at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Shell 
Oil Co. Foundation at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, and Mobil Oil Corp. 
at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art, 
both in New York. 
</P>
<P>
This is the only such program in Orange County.

MUSIC AND DANCE/CHRIS PASLES: U.S. DEBUT FOR SOVIET BASSO GEORGI SELEZNEEV 
FULFILLS HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Basso Georgi Selezneev has leapfrogged from the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow to 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa for his American debut 
in Opera Pacific's new production of Bellini's "Norma," which begins Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been a hope and a dream that I could come" to America, Selezneev 
said recently, speaking through an interpreter. However, he does not feel that 
his appearances in "Norma" (he plays Oroveso) are resulting from recent thaws 
in the relationship between the United States and the U.S.S.R. The obstacles 
have been more professional than political, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even during the coldest times," he said, "there has been an exchange of 
artists. That seems to be something that transcends (political) things. . . . I 
don't feel that my coming here has anything to do with glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is that impresarios and theaters like Opera Pacific and others 
are very careful about a new name. Different performers have different fates. 
Some of them are like a star and are immediately recognized. I probably fall 
into the category where people recognize you a little at a time, slowly." 
</P>
<P>
Selezneev, who has been singing with the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow for 10 
years, did not grow up expecting to be an opera singer. "I wanted," he said "to 
be an aviator," like his father who was a military officer. Even when he 
decided to get involved with music, it was in a totally different direction 
from the one he eventually took. 
</P>
<P>
"After the war, in 1953, there was a real boom in (American) music, Harry 
Belafonte, boogie-woogie, rock 'n' roll," he recalls. "So I thought that that 
was the kind of singing I was going to do. (But) when I said that to my first 
music teacher, she just kind of smiled knowingly. She didn't think it was going 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, he found himself steered toward roles of kings and generals and 
distraught fathers -- the staples of the basso repertory. An exception was the 
most famous cripple of Catfish Row: the male lead in Gershwin's "Porgy and 
Bess," which Selezneev sang in Leningrad in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my first professional part in a theater," he said. "We did it in 
blackface and wigs. First, they had the idea of just having white people. It 
just didn't work. The music is so colorful, it just didn't 'jive.' We felt it 
was really necessary to do that other way. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, Gershwin is quite popular in Russia. They play his music on the 
radio quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Among Selezneev's favorite roles are Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, Philip in 
Verdi's "Don Carlos" and Don Basilio in Rossini's "Il Barbiere di Siviglia." 
</P>
<P>
One role he covets, but has not had the chance to sing, is Mephistopheles in 
Gounod's "Faust." 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, he has disappeared in Europe," he said. "They do not do it." 
And time may be working against him. "I am already aged, I'm 50," he said with 
a self-deprecating smile. "It is becoming more difficult every time to sing the 
higher repertoires. 
</P>
<P>
"The part that has always excited me, frightened me, worried me, was (Verdi's) 
Rigoletto. It's got a lot of highs and also is a long part. The physical thing 
(of playing a hunchback) is no problem. Holding the higher (vocal) range is 
more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
He feels that Oroveso in "Norma," a comparatively small part, "doesn't give me 
an opportunity to show myself in a good way." 
</P>
<P>
"Norma is the (main) character," he said. "Everybody else is secondary." 
</P>
<P>
But he feels "very honored" to be working with Dame Joan Sutherland. "When they 
knew in the (Bolshoi) theater that I was going to be working with Joan 
Sutherland, I could see a little envy in people's eyes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, his first trip to the United states has been rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I walked into the choral group, they all tried to have at least 
one Russian word for me," he said. "It was very pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
He muses upon similarities between the opera chorus here and at home in the 
Soviet Union. "They all work so hard, they all have these wonderful eyes, they 
all are very intent on what they are doing and they are all such nice people," 
he said. "And I say to myself, I know we have a lot of people at home like 
them, and can it be possible they can ever have anything against each other? 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it a shame that such wonderful young people, imbued with a love for 
their art or for what they are doing musically, should ever have anything other 
than friendship for a group just like them, who also are young and also are 
imbued with their love for music?" 
</P>
<P>
Georgi Selezneev will sing Oroveso in Opera Pacific's presentation of Bellini's 
"Norma," with Joan Sutherland and conductor Richard Bonynge Saturday at 8 p.m.

IT'S SNOW! -- FROM MALIBU TO STREETS OF PALM SPRINGS; 
</P>
<P>
5 INCHES PILE UP IN AREAS OF VALLEY; 
</P>

SCHOOLS AND HIGHWAYS SHUT DOWN; STORM TO CONTINUE

Snow fell across Southern California from the hillsides of Malibu to the 
streets at Palm Springs this morning as another powerful Arctic storm swept 
down from the north, closing schools, sealing off mountain highways and 
creating mammoth traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the snow should continue to fall sporadically in scattered 
foothill areas for the rest of today and into tonight, with accumulations of up 
to 2 feet expected at mountain resorts. Rain was expected at lower elevations 
throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Ames, 33, a visitor from Toronto who found herself stuck below heavy 
snow on Cajon Pass, said she had come to the Southland with "visions of orange 
trees, sunshine and heat. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"My visions of sunny California are shot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Melted in the Desert 
</P>
<P>
The snow that fell early this morning didn't stick for long in Malibu and Palm 
Springs, but as much as 5 inches piled up in the Westlake, Porter Ranch, 
Calabasas, Simi Valley, Tarzana and Granada Hills areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked out a window at about 2 a.m. and everything was white, floating and 
swirling, absolutely gorgeous," said Glenda Lubas of Granada Hills. "I went out 
and took photographs of our dogs romping in the snow. My daughter built a 
snowman. It all looks like a Christmas card." 
</P>
<P>
In the hills above the Lubas home, children grabbed cardboard boxes and trash 
can lids to slide down the hillsides denuded by last December's devastating 
brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all black and ugly and horrible, now it's all white and glistening and 
beautiful," said Mary Ellen Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Santa Clarita Valley said the community was "basically sealed 
off" at mid-morning by 3 to 5 inches of snow, with more continuing to fall. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Norlemann, a deputy at the sheriff's station there, said the community 
was paralyzed by ice and more snow was falling. 
</P>
<P>
"Our schools are closed -- everything's closed," he said. "When people call in, 
we tell them to take the day off." 
</P>
<P>
Schools also were closed in the Antelope Valley, where officials said it was 
still snowing heavily at mid-day. 
</P>
<P>
The principal highways into the Southland from the north and east -- Interstate 
5 over the Tejon Pass, California 14 between Newhall and Palmdale, Interstate 
15 over the Cajon Pass and Interstate 10 through San Gorgonio Pass -- were all 
closed by snow and ice. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 traffic alerts were issued throughout the area during the morning 
rush hour as cars spun, skidded and caromed on pavement made slick by ice, snow 
and rain. However there were no reports of fatal accidents this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's chaotic, the worst I've seen in years," said Officer Ernie Garcia, a 
spokesman for the main California Highway Patrol dispatch center in Los 
Angeles. "People are even driving the wrong way on the freeways, trying to 
avoid the closures. . . . There are traffic jams everywhere. It's a mess."

ALL 144 FEARED DEAD IN AZORES CRASH OF U.S. JET

An American charter jet filled with Italian tourists slammed into a fog-covered 
mountain in the Azores today and exploded, and all 144 people on board were 
believed dead, officials and news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Della Versesi, a spokeswoman at the Italian Embassy in Lisbon, said all 
137 passengers were Italian and the seven crew members American. She did not 
release any names. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft belonged to the U.S. airline Independent Air Corp., based in 
Smyrna, Tenn. The flight originated in Bergamo, Italy, and was to have 
proceeded to Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic and Montego Bay in Jamaica 
after a refueling stop in the Azores. 
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese news agency LUSA quoted an official from the Azores Civil 
Protection Service as saying that about 50 bodies had been recovered and that 
it appeared all on board died. 
</P>
<P>
Afonso Pimentel, a LUSA reporter based in the Azores, said the Boeing 707 was 
preparing to land at Santa Maria airport when it crashed into Pico Alto, a 
fog-covered, 1,794-foot-high mountain, and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
The civil protection official told LUSA that the pilot had asked the airport to 
clear a runway for an emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there were any other radio messages or warnings before the plane went 
down, Gualder Cordero, the Santa Maria Airport dispatcher, replied, "No, no, no 
no." 
</P>
<P>
A. L. Pittman, president of Independent Air Corp., said the 15-year-old company 
makes 400 to 500 charter flights a year, mostly in the Caribbean and Europe. 
Pittman, who declined to identify the seven American crew members, said the 
20-year-old jetliner that crashed had a relatively low number of flight hours 
and no history of trouble.

NUNN SAYS HE WOULDN'T VOTE FOR TOWER AT PRESENT; NOMINEE GOES TO WHITE HOUSE

Embattled Defense Secretary-designate John Tower visited the White House this 
morning as senior Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee said the 
nomination was beset with new allegations on Tower's finances and drinking 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the committee's chairman, said today he met with 
President Bush at the White House on Tuesday night and the Administration now 
agrees that the panel should put off a vote on the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the President frankly that I have serious concerns, and I also stated 
that if a vote was held immediately as some have urged, I would vote no because 
of these concerns," Nunn told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration had been pushing for a vote this week, but delayed the 
request after Nunn and the ranking Republican on the Armed Services panel, Sen. 
John W. Warner of Virginia, met with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The second-ranking Democrat on the committee, Sen. J. James Exon of Nebraska, 
said the latest FBI report on Tower could not be complete by Friday, when the 
Senate is scheduled to begin a weeklong recess, meaning a confirmation vote 
will be delayed at least 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
"As a practical matter, they can't draw it out too long," Exon said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest allegations concern Tower's drinking and financial affairs, Exon 
said, but he added he would not know the specifics until the FBI report is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflict of Interest 
</P>
<P>
He said the allegations also concerned Tower's ability to avoid a conflict of 
interest with defense contractors from whom he collected more than $1 million 
as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But at the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the only new 
allegation "relates to Sen. Tower's activities while he was in the Senate." He 
refused to elaborate but said Bush still stands by Tower and expects that he 
will be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Nunn's assertion that he would vote against Tower if a vote were 
held now was "disappointing, very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters whether Tower's alcohol consumption was his chief concern, 
Nunn said: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to categorize it like that. That's one of my primary concerns. 
The question there is whether there has been an alcohol abuse problem. If there 
has been a problem in the past, is there a point where it has been recognized 
by the nominee and dealt with effectively? That is to say, is it a continuing 
problem? I do not have an answer to that yet." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "It's not a matter of one or two episodes, it's a question of whether 
there's a continuing pattern. . . . It's a matter of a person in the chain of 
command that has control over the arsenal of the United States of America. . . 
. The secretary of defense has to, in my view, have clarity of thought at all 
times." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Questions 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said there were new allegations "of a financial nature." ABC News said 
they involved the ongoing Pentagon procurement investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Tower went to the White House this morning for a regularly scheduled breakfast 
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft in Scowcroft's office, Fitzwater said. Bush did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, at about 7:30 a.m., continued a tradition set during the Reagan 
Administration when then-National Security Adviser Colin L. Powell met for 
regular breakfasts with the secretary of state and defense secretary, Fitzwater 
said.

Two former top executives of Regina Co. pleaded guilty today to defrauding 
investors in the vacuum cleaner company of more than $100 million by issuing 
inflated earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
Former Regina Chairman Donald D. Sheelen, 42, and former chief financial 
officer Vincent P. Golden, 48, admitted misleading stockholders and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission in 1987 and 1988. U.S. Atty. Samuel A. Alito 
Jr. said Sheelen instructed Golden to falsify sales by not subtracting returned 
appliances from company income. The two men could receive up to five years in 
prison and $250,000 in fines at sentencing April 14.

In another roadblock to Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial, the Justice 
Department today asked the judge to implement new safeguards to prevent North 
from making surprise disclosures of classified information. 
</P>
<P>
North "has made no effort to assist the court in dealing responsibly with 
classified information," the department said in a court filing. 
</P>
<P>
Charging that North has provided "totally useless or at best minimally 
informative" notices of the documents he wants to disclose, the department 
urged U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to institute greater protections to 
prevent unwarranted disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
The request came as jury selection in the case drew near a close. 
</P>
<P>
A department source said that if Gesell ruled against the government it would 
appeal. Such an appeal could delay the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, whose office is prosecuting North, 
opposed the filing. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell scheduled an afternoon hearing to discuss the dispute.

Adriano Casardo, 47, and Michele Novello, 42, were accused of arranging 
appointments, either in private homes or secret brothels, for several girls 
ranging in age from 14 to 17 whom they sometimes also "loaned" to other pimps.

Four Palestinians were killed by army gunfire today and a Jewish settler was 
burned to death when Palestinians hurled a firebomb at his car in the West 
Bank. The death toll was the highest in one day for two months. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Palestinians was killed when army guards fired tear gas, plastic 
bullets and other ammunition to quell a riot in a military prison, army sources 
said. Fourteen other prisoners were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinian teen-agers were reported shot to death today in the occupied 
lands, and a Palestinian died of injuries suffered earlier in the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources said an Israeli settler died after his car was set ablaze by 
Palestinians near the settlement of Alfei Menashe. Troops rushed to the scene 
of the attack, set up roadblocks and hunted for suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli government and military officials, meanwhile, rejected the conclusions 
of a U.S. State Department report alleging substantial human rights violations 
and said the report ignored the context of the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. report, released Tuesday, says methods used by the army to halt the 
14-month revolt have resulted in "many avoidable deaths and injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Kuttab, co-founder of a human rights monitoring group, said he hopes 
the U.S. government will reassess its $3-billion annual aid to Israel in light 
of the findings. 
</P>
<P>
Army sources said the unrest at the military prison in Megiddo, in northern 
Israel, began outside when visiting relatives went on a rampage, raising 
Palestinian flags and stoning soldiers' parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
When guards suspended visiting hours, inmates began rioting, the sources said. 
"As prisoners returned to cells, they stirred up others and a serious riot 
started inside the cells," the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
They said military guards fired tear gas and plastic bullets to try to end the 
rioting. When that failed, the guards opened fire with conventional ammunition, 
they said, resulting in the death and injuries.

and tore up plants on city sidewalks to protest a raise they regarded as 
insufficient.

Witnesses also said the approximately 600 soldiers assaulted bystanders and

session, the government approved a 72% pay hike, to be phased in over three 
years. An average soldier currently earns the equivalent of $50 a week.

Expanding its presence in the U.S. computer industry, Italy's Ing C. Olivetti 
&amp; C. SpA today said it agreed to acquire a U.S. supplier of branch 
automation systems to financial institutions for about $174 million. 
</P>
<P>
ISC Systems Corp., based in Spokane, Wash., has agreed to be acquired by the 
Italian business systems firm for about $12.25 per common share, Olivetti said. 
</P>
<P>
Olivetti said it will merge ISC with Bunker Ramo Corp., Olivetti's Shelton, 
Conn.-based subsidiary that also makes computer systems for banking firms. 
Bunker Ramo said the merger will create one of the largest companies in the 
U.S. branch automation market, with revenues of about $250 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The merged Bunker Ramo/ISC will go head to head against such computer industry 
forces as International Business Machines Corp., NCR Corp. and Unisys Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Olivetti acquired Bunker Ramo from Allied-Signal Inc. in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Vittorio Cassoni, managing director of Olivetti, said the 
acquisition "greatly expands our market share in North America, complementing 
our leading role in Europe and Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Olivetti sells personal computers and office systems in the United States 
through Olivetti USA, a subsidiary based in Somerville, N.J. A Bunker Ramo 
spokesman said the as-yet-unnamed new firm will operate separately from that 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
Olivetti also sells its personal computers in the United States under an 
agreement with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. Cassoni had joined 
AT&amp;T in 1986, heading its computer systems group until he left last May to 
return to Olivetti, his old employer.

PIZZA HUT SUED BY FRANCHISER

National Pizza Co. has filed suit in Sedgwick County District Court against 
Pizza Hut, which is trying to block National Pizza's attempt to acquire a chain 
of fast-seafood restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
National Pizza, based in Pittsburg, Kan., is the largest U.S. franchiser of 
Pepsico Inc.'s Pizza Hut restaurants. Its sole business has been operating 
Pizza Hut franchises. 
</P>
<P>
The company last month made an unsolicited offer to buy Skipper's Inc. for 
$9.25 a share, or approximately $27 million. Skipper's, which operates 213 
restaurants in the western United States and British Columbia, has rejected the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Pizza Hut officials advised National Pizza in a letter that the 
acquisition of Skipper's would violate its franchise agreement with Pizza Hut, 
said J. J. Fitzsimmons, chief financial officer for National Pizza, which 
operates more than 225 restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"We responded asking for specifics on how it would violate the agreement, and 
they declined to provide details," Fitzsimmons said. Rather than wait for Pizza 
Hut to respond, National Pizza went to court on Tuesday in an effort to resolve 
the matter, Fitzsimmons said.

EUROPEANS MAY REJECT TEXAS BEEF PROPOSAL

Texas plan for exporting hormone-free beef to the European Community is 
acceptable to the Bush Administration but might be rejected by the Europeans, a 
senior Agriculture Department official said today. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be identified, said that U.S. negotiators had 
proposed a plan similar to one unveiled Tuesday by Texas Agriculture 
Commissioner Jim Hightower but that the community had dismissed it because it 
would not require testing for naturally occurring growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
Hightower's plan was "among the options explored with the EC that they 
rejected," the official said, adding that the community would retreat from its 
earlier negotiating position if it accepted Hightower's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they did not know whether the community would accept the 
Hightower plan, aimed at breaking a trade deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to pour cold water on it," the official said. "If he can figure 
out some partial solution, we will not pour cold water on it." 
</P>
<P>
Community agricultural counselor Derwent Renshaw disputed the American 
official's claim that Washington had already put forward the same plan and that 
the community had rejected it. "I must say I don't recall their making a 
proposal broadly along those lines," he said, adding that the community has not 
yet decided whether the Texas plan complies with community rules. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans, responding to consumers' concerns, banned on Jan. 1 imports of 
beef from cattle treated with hormones that promote growth. Washington, which 
maintains that the hormones pose no health risk if used correctly, retaliated 
by slapping 100% duties on $100 million worth of community imports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4 Synthetic Hormones 
</P>
<P>
Under the Texas proposal, which Hightower implied was acceptable to the 
Europeans, the U.S. Agriculture Department would have to conduct tests to 
identify the presence of four synthetic hormones. Agriculture Department 
inspectors already sample and test for the synthetic hormones at 
slaughterhouses, he said. Under the Texas plan, U.S. inspectors would have to 
start live-animal tests. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, no testing for such natural hormones as estrogen, progesterone 
and testosterone, banned in the European Community but legal in the United 
States, would be required, Hightower said. Producers would simply have to 
pledge not to treat their livestock with growth hormones.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed stiff new rules to 
protect small investors from high-pressure sales tactics often used in the sale 
of so-called penny stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted 5 to 0 to propose requiring stockbrokers to obtain written 
customer agreement and make a documented "suitability" determination before 
completing the sale of such stocks in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
Penny stocks are inexpensive securities sold over-the-counter. They are not 
listed on any major stock exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ over-the-counter 
system. 
</P>
<P>
SEC staff members said the rule was deliberately crafted in a narrow way to 
avoid hurting the ability of small companies to use the markets to raise 
capital.

ORLANDO JOINS BIDDING FOR MAJOR LEAGUE FRANCHISE

Orlando joined an anxious, crowded lineup of hopeful cities today when a 
financial group headed by William du Pont III announced a formal bid for a 
major-league baseball franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont, an heir to a family industrial-chemical fortune and principal owner of 
the new Orlando franchise of the National Basketball Assn., said the key to his 
proposal is a plan for $65-million baseball stadium, to be financed by a 1% 
increase in the resort tax. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is ripe for Orlando to make its push," Du Pont said. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando joins about a dozen American and Canadian cities already seeking an 
expansion franchise, including Tampa, St. Petersburg and Miami in this state. 
Also making serious bids are Denver, Phoenix, Indianapolis, Buffalo, N.Y., 
Washington and Vancouver, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth has projected a six-team expansion, with 
the designation of two new teams possibly by 1990, to begin play no earlier 
than 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando-area government officials, politicians and tourist industry leaders are 
enthusiastic about the Du Pont proposal, including an increase in the resort 
tax, which is now at 3%.

The Sparta High School boys' basketball team broke a two-year, 51-game losing 
streak by defeating the same visiting team that had provided their last 
victory, and by the same seven-point margin. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-58 win Tuesday was the Spartans' first since Dec. 16, 1986, when they 
beat Newaygo High 66-59. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big relief," Sparta coach Paul Owens said. "The streak had a lot of 
pressure in and of itself." 
</P>
<P>
Newaygo coach Mike Pumford said he had had a premonition that the Spartans 
would beat the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
"The cards were stacked against us when we came in," Pumford said. "They've 
been pointing to this game. It was parents' night. They had the little kids 
play basketball at halftime." 
</P>
<P>
"It was in the air. We wanted to call and say we were snowed in," he said.

Sebastian Coe abandoned his comeback bid today by withdrawing from the 800 
meters at next week's European indoor championships, apparently because of an 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
A British track official said Coe, who holds the world indoor and outdoor 
record for the distance, still was concerned about a calf injury that caused 
him to pull out of a recent meeting in Genoa, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Coe has not competed since the national Olympic trials last August when he 
flopped and was left off the British roster for Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
He was selected for the European indoor championships at The Hague, 
Netherlands, on Feb. 18 because selectors believed that there was no one else 
of his caliber challenging for a place in the team at that distance.

Switzerland II and Austria II led the second day of qualifying in the four-man 
competition of the World Bobsled Championships. 
</P>
<P>
In the first run Tuesday night, Hubert Schoesser drove Austria II to a 
first-place time of 54.13 seconds on the 1,288-meter course. That mark only was 
two-hundredths of a second slower than the track record set by Switzerland's 
Gustav Weder during two-man competition last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Weder, who was edged out by Olympic champion Wolfgang Hoppe of East Germany for 
the two-man crown, led Switzerland II to a second-place tie with Britain I in 
Tuesday's first qualifying run. Both teams posted times of 54.34. 
</P>
<P>
In the second run, Weder drove Switzerland II to a first-place finish with a 
time of 54.21. Austria I followed with a time of 54.25 while Switzerland I 
finished third at 54.38. Austria II finished fifth at 54.48.
