HAROLD AMBRO; DISNEY ANIMATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold (Hal) Ambro, an animator who worked on dozens of the classic Walt Disney 
films in the 1940s, '50s and '60s, has died. 
</P>
<P>
He was 76 when he died Feb. 1 of an undisclosed illness at the Motion Picture 
and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Ambro's work at the Charles Mintz studio in Hollywood caught the eye of the 
Disney Studios, where he was hired in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to work on such animated films as "Song of the South," "Make Mine 
Music," "Alice in Wonderland," "Peter Pan," "Lady and the Tramp," "Sleeping 
Beauty," "One Hundred and One Dalmatians" and "Gay Purr-ee." 
</P>
<P>
Born in St. Louis, Ambro moved to California in 1932 to study drawing. He left 
Disney in 1966 after drawing for "The Sword and the Stone." He then worked on 
television specials and Hanna-Barbera's production of "Charlotte's Web." 
</P>
<P>
Ambro became Hanna-Barbera's supervising animator for "Heidi's Song" before he 
left in 1982. The next year, Ambro began teaching character animation at the 
California Institute of the Arts in Valencia.

FORMER WYOMING GOV. ED HERSCHLER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Herschler, 71, a country lawyer who became Wyoming's only three-term 
governor, died of cancer in Cheyenne on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
A Democrat in a predominantly Republican state, Herschler remained popular 
after leaving office in 1986 but declined to seek a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
Herschler, who guided Wyoming through a boom in the energy industry, entered 
state politics in 1961 when he won a term in the House of Representatives after 
eight years as a county prosecutor. In 1970, Herschler lost his House seat, but 
returned to claim a surprising victory for governor four years later.

THEY HEAR IT THROUGH THE GRIPEVINE IN SAN MARCOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Complaining to the San Marcos City Council has become easier than ever, thanks 
to a computer link between City Hall and residents. 
</P>
<P>
The link, which was established in December but is not yet fully operational, 
allows people with a computer and modem to connect with the city's computer 
bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
The board gives access to City Council agendas and minutes, and allows people 
to send messages to individual City Council members and express their views by 
writing articles that appear on the board. 
</P>
<P>
The link is the brainchild of Chris Preston, 17, the son of San Marcos 
Councilman Mike Preston, who modeled the computer bulletin board after a much 
larger operation in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to open up government to more people," the senior Preston said. 
"For instance, our bulletin board will be open from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m., so people 
who would like to but are not able to attend City Council meetings can call in 
when they get off work." 
</P>
<P>
Private messages may be sent to City Council members or anyone with a "mailbox" 
in the system, to be read when that person links up to the system later on. 
</P>
<P>
Public messages may also be written on the computerized bulletin board for 
anyone with a computer and a modem to read. 
</P>
<P>
Computer bulletin boards are information exchange networks designed to connect 
people with similar interests, using computer links. Bulletin boards have long 
been used in educational and corporate settings. 
</P>
<P>
The San Marcos service is still too new to have a list of users, Preston said, 
because the city has yet to be listed in the computer bulletin-board 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 10 users -- who have heard about the city's bulletin board through 
the grapevine -- have connected with it so far, according to Chris Preston. The 
younger Preston hopes that about 50 people will be regular users of the 
bulletin board when it becomes fully operational Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Preston said the total cost of the project, which began in September, came to 
just under $200, which includes bulletin board software and software to convert 
city hall programs to the bulletin board. The bulletin board uses existing city 
hardware. 
</P>
<P>
The service is free to any resident with a computer and a modem. The bulletin 
board's modem number is 744-0511.

BEVY OF TAX, FEE HIKES IN OFFERING FOR SAN DIEGANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diegans face the prospect of sizable tax and fee increases as the San Diego 
City Council today considers $119.7 million in new revenue-generating proposals 
that City Manager John Lockwood says are needed for fiscal year 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Imposition of property tax increases totaling $156 a year for a $150,000 home, 
a new 5% utility users' tax on businesses, and a new $90 annual trash 
collection fee for homeowners are some of the ways that Lockwood is proposing 
to cover just part of a large budget deficit and the council's demand for 
several new expensive projects and programs. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood described the city's budget plight as the worst in 56 years, since the 
1933-34 fiscal year, and significantly more difficult than the budget cutting 
necessitated by the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978. Because of population 
growth, it will take an additional $66 million in fiscal 1991 just to keep city 
services operating at present levels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Without new revenue sources, budgets will "get progressively worse, 
unfortunately," said Pat Frazier, the city's director of financial management. 
"The base upon which our revenues are built is not sufficient to keep up with 
our growth." 
</P>
<P>
But some council members said they are not ready to start loading the June 
ballot with tax increases at such an early date in the city's budget process, 
especially without reviewing possible budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not willing to put those things on until such time as we've taken a look 
at the budget," Councilman Ron Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy McCarty said that she is willing to ask voters to repeal a 
1919 city ordinance mandating free trash collection because the move will 
promote trash recycling, but "other than that, I don't know what I'm going to 
do tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood also wants the council to ask the public to waive the Gann spending 
limit to allow as much $700 million more in spending during fiscal years 1991 
through 1994. The city's current Gann waiver runs out July 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the revenue proposals require only the council's approval, while others 
need either majority or two-thirds support of the public on the June ballot for 
enactment, according to a report from Lockwood to the council. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Maureen O'Connor wants to place all of the proposals on the ballot, 
regardless of whether the council has the authority to enact them itself, said 
her spokesman, Paul Downey. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything where taxes are going to go up, she wants to give (voters) a menu 
kind of a format where people are able to pick and choose what they're willing 
to pay for," Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Lockwood's total package is approved, about $99 million in identified 
city needs will be unfunded next year, and one controversial new program will 
be far short of the funding approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
That program is the Housing Trust Fund for the poor, which the council 
conceptually approved in December at $54 million annually. Lockwood is 
suggesting that the program, designed to generate housing and housing subsidies 
for low-income city residents, be financed at $13 million next year via 
imposition of new development fees. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood also is looking for a state grant to provide the $4 million needed to 
build a new city jail for people arrested on misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
The report includes several other potentially sizable tax and fee increases not 
currently being recommended, some because they require further study. Among 
them are fees for parking at city beaches, a utility users' tax for residential 
customers, an increase in the city hotel tax and a new assessment district to 
pay for citywide lighting and landscaping needs. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood's proposal includes: 
</P>
<P>
* A special tax to beef up the city's police force to two officers per thousand 
residents. The measure would raise property taxes by $54 per every $100,000 of 
assessed valuation in fiscal 1991, $100 in 1992, $152 in 1993, and $155 in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
The $23.7 million proposal for 1991, which includes $6.2 million that would go 
to the county to pay for probation officers and other costs, requires approval 
of two-thirds of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
* A $44 per $100,000 of assessed valuation tax increase to generate $20 million 
annually for the city employees' pension fund. The tax could be enacted by 
council vote. 
</P>
<P>
* A $6 per $100,000 valuation property tax increase to generate $25 million 
needed to expand the Police and Fire Departments' communication system. 
Two-thirds of the voters would have to approve the general obligation 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
* Repeal of the People's Ordinance of 1919, which mandates free trash pickup 
for anyone who brings their trash to the curb, and imposition of a $7.50 per 
month trash pickup fee that would generate $25 million annually. Single-family 
homeowners, who make up about half of the city's 435,000 dwelling units, 
receive the free trash pickup, but residents of most apartment and condominium 
complexes, where trash is thrown in dumpsters, already are paying a fee. 
</P>
<P>
* $13 million in new commercial development fees for the Housing Trust Fund. 
</P>
<P>
* A new $5 million gross receipts tax on business that could be enacted with 
council approval. 
</P>
<P>
* A new 5% tax on commercial and industrial users of electric, gas, telephone, 
cable TV, water and sewer utilities. The council could enact the measure.

AL MARTINEZ: HEEDING DISTANT TRUMPETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who recall the 1950s, or who know anything of that uneasy decade beyond 
its doo-wop music, are no doubt aware of the Anti-Fluoride Marchers. 
</P>
<P>
They were generally perceived to be a group of slightly skewed right-wingers or 
religious zealots who, for reasons of their own, were opposed to the dental 
health and dazzling smiles of our little children. 
</P>
<P>
They picketed, pamphleteered and generally caused havoc at civic meetings 
called to discuss whether or not fluoride ought to be added to our water and 
toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Fluoride Army was convinced the stuff was dangerous and should be 
banned, not unlike those fighting malathion today. 
</P>
<P>
It was an era during which All the People We Trusted were telling us that 
fluoride was not only harmless, but good for us, the way apple pie and T-bone 
steak are good for us. 
</P>
<P>
One of those who thought they were all damned liars and wasn't afraid to say so 
was a bright, noisy woman named Lorraine Escobar. 
</P>
<P>
She and others of her persuasion were especially active in Los Angeles, to the 
extent that in 1966 they persuaded the City Council to vote against 
fluoridation. 
</P>
<P>
We all thought the nuts had finally won, but now we're not so sure. Maybe they 
weren't nuts after all. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thought we were John Birchers or Ku Klux Klanners or some damned 
thing," Escobar said the other day as she led me to a corner of her dining room 
through a maze formed by stacks of files six feet high. 
</P>
<P>
Her red barn of a house sits on a hilltop in the Silver Lake district. She's 
lived there for 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
The files are in varying degrees of order in and on top of cabinets, shelves, 
boxes, bags, drawers and baskets. All deal with fluoride. 
</P>
<P>
They form a kind of alcove in which Escobar, a sturdy 67, keeps a desk, a red 
typewriter, a bouquet of artificial flowers and a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an old lady in tennis shoes," she said, pointing to the sneakers on her 
feet. They completed an outfit that also included a print blouse and the kind 
of pleated black skirt schoolgirls wore in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
Her gray-brown hair was pulled back in a pony tail. Thick-lensed glasses gave 
her a slightly myopic expression. 
</P>
<P>
She sat behind a desk in the alcove and motioned me to a small, wooden chair 
meant for a 2-year-old. Then she began savoring a triumph she had waited 30 
years for. 
</P>
<P>
A week earlier, researchers for the National Toxicological Program reported 
that fluoride caused cancer in rats. 
</P>
<P>
They were quick to add that it was only a preliminary study and the rats were 
given a lot more fluoride than humans get in toothpaste and water, but still . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Escobar was delighted. The nation was learning who the real nuts were. 
</P>
<P>
"Fluoride is the most negative element on earth," she began, in a style of 
confrontation honed over three decades. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an accumulative protoplasmic poison, like arsenic. It causes cancer and 
mongolism, wrecks your DNA and does more damned harm than anything imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst scandal in human history. Government has been deliberately 
poisoning this nation since 1945. Who do they think they are?" 
</P>
<P>
A cum laude graduate of USC, Escobar was a fighter long before the feminist 
movement made it generally acceptable for women to raise hell anywhere outside 
of the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Her anti-fluoride radicalization came about listening to a radio show and then 
studying on her own. Once she was hooked, she says, she was hooked forever. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar remains, all these years later, as breathlessly outspoken and 
opinionated as ever, and probably knows more about fluoride than anyone would 
ever want to hear. 
</P>
<P>
Her head is jammed with data she fires in explosive bursts of knowledge that 
blast by your ear like volleys of artillery shells. They all say fluoride is 
poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone dies," she said, "whether we're a dog or an apple tree. In small 
amounts in nature, fluoride helps us die when we should." Her voice rose. "But 
we're getting it in megadoses and that's killing us off faster than it ought 
to." 
</P>
<P>
I listened for an hour, not so much to learn about fluoride or even to allow 
Escobar to glory in the vindication of her cause. There's another reason. Faint 
echoes of distant trumpets apply here. 
</P>
<P>
If final studies do conclude that fluoride is as dangerous as Escobar always 
knew it was, shouldn't we be listening a little harder to those who are saying 
the same thing about malathion?

ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This being Southern California, the L.A. Marathon has always offered more 
world-class eccentrics than world-class runners: Usually two or three 
basketball-dribblers, a juggler, a snooty French waiter with tray and champagne 
bottle, a couple of guys in doctor's smocks transporting a dummy on a 
stretcher, and the inevitable character in the gorilla suit. 
</P>
<P>
Marathon V, set for March 4, will offer something unique even for L.A.: A 
runner dressed as a human bean. 
</P>
<P>
He's Barry Kirk of Port Talbot, Wales, who naturally goes by the name of 
Captain Beany. (Oddly enough, Beany has never competed in the Boston Marathon.) 
</P>
<P>
Aside from his running feats, the 35-year-old legume sent along several 
newspaper clippings recounting another type of marathon experience: He lay in a 
vat of baked beans for more than 100 hours to raise funds for charity. 
Contributors were allowed to pour beans on his head. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by telephone how spectators reacted, Beany said: 
</P>
<P>
"Some laughed. Others said, 'My God, what an awful sight.' " 
</P>
<P>
Time stands still at the corner of Collis Avenue and Hill Drive in South 
Pasadena, where a sign still points the way to the "Arroyo Seco Parkway." 
</P>
<P>
The parkway hasn't gone by that name since 1954, when it was renamed the 
Pasadena Freeway. (You know, the one where have you have to slow from 75 m.p.h. 
to 5 m.p.h. at some hairpin-curve off-ramps.) 
</P>
<P>
The sign, one of many that the Auto Club installed before turning the job over 
to the state in 1956, could date back as far as 1941, when the parkway opened. 
No one's quite sure. 
</P>
<P>
Like our local celebrities, many freeways started out with different names, at 
least in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
Cahuenga Parkway, for instance, became the Hollywood Freeway. The Ramona 
Parkway is now the San Bernardino. And the Santa Monica Freeway was listed as 
the Olympic Parkway on early maps. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. River, which never gets any respect, originally had its name on the 
Long Beach Freeway. After Richard M. Nixon's fall from grace, his name was 
impeached from what is now the Marina Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
And, in 1987, the Century Freeway was renamed the Glenn M. Anderson by the 
state Legislature in honor of the Long Beach congressman. It'll be an even 
bigger honor if the project's ever completed. 
</P>
<P>
The 88-year-old Walk of a Thousand Lights is growing dimmer and dimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Better known as the Pike, the Long Beach amusement park was once the site of 
such wondrous curiosities as the Jackrabbit Racer, Painless Parker, Reckless 
Ross and a fake Al Capone car. 
</P>
<P>
They've long since disappeared to make way for a planned development of office 
towers and hotels, whose only rides will be of the elevator variety. 
</P>
<P>
One holdout is Nick Frudakis, a 36-year-old attorney whose grandfather bought 
the Checker Board Cafe in 1951. The city says it will soon begin condemnation 
proceedings if Frudakis doesn't sell. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he's inviting the public to attend a "Remember the Pike Day" rally 
from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. at the still-operating tavern, which also houses 
artifacts of the area's past. 
</P>
<P>
Frudakis considers the Checker Board an artifact and wants it incorporated into 
the new project. 
</P>
<P>
"The city says it wants to get rid of the old Navy bars," Frudakis said. "Well, 
my grandfather was proud to serve the Navy. But if they want, I'll make it into 
an espresso place, or a flower shop."

FLURRY OF NUMBERS;

<P>
SAN DIEGO FACILITY READIES TO SORT, COUNT 16 MILLION CENSUS FORMS FROM 4 STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps it is inevitable that a man who is preparing for the arrival of 16 
million census questionnaires at a Sorrento Valley warehouse would have numbers 
on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
So it was altogether fitting that Greg Nowakowski -- who in less than two 
months will be surrounded by an avalanche of data on what people earn, spend on 
housing, their number of children and myriad other details that chronicle life 
in America -- heralded Wednesday's open house at the San Diego census 
processing center by spewing out a torrent of statistics not unlike those that 
will race through his high-speed computers this spring. 
</P>
<P>
To succinctly -- if, perhaps, somewhat confusingly -- summarize what 
Nowakowski, the center's manager, had to say: 16 million census forms from four 
states will be counted by 1,200 San Diego workers who will use 300 computer 
terminals, 11 high-speed cameras -- each capable of microfilming up to 2,400 
questionnaires an hour -- and an estimated 4.6 million feet of film to prepare 
the data for the FOSDIC (Film Optical Sensing Device for Input to Computer). 
</P>
<P>
All of this will take place in a 128,500-square-foot building longer than two 
football fields (or, to put it another way, more ground than the Chargers 
typically cover in a game), after which the forms -- most Americans will 
receive a 14-question short form, while one in six households will get the 
59-question long version -- will be stored in a secure facility in Kansas for 
72 years to protect confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
And that was only a small portion of the statistical flurry that Nowakowski -- 
a man of few words but of many numbers -- unleashed Wednesday to describe the 
massive counting task that will begin in April. 
</P>
<P>
One of only seven census processing offices in the country, the San Diego 
facility will handle census questionnaires from residents of California, 
Washington, Alaska and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Selected because of its availability of relatively inexpensive office space and 
ready labor pool for the 1,200 temporary jobs needed for the decennial 
population count, San Diego, like the other processing offices, will oversee 
the five-step high-tech process -- human hands do little other than feed the 
material into computers or other equipment -- in which the information on the 
paper questionnaires is transferred onto microfilm and, later, computer tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Due to security considerations, Wednesday's open house likely will be the only 
time that either the public or the press will have access to the processing 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Marked by rah-rah enthusiasm with a patriotic twist -- red, white and blue 
balloons were much in evidence, and a bureau handout noted that the census is 
"a small patriotic duty to perform once every 10 years" -- the event also was 
used by census officials both to allay apprehensions, particularly among 
minorities, about the process and to try to attract applicants for the local 
census jobs. 
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the 1980 census concluded that about 1.4% of the American 
population was not counted, with that so-called "undercount" distributed among 
various minority groups, according to John Reeder Jr., the Census Bureau's 
regional director. While 100% of the white population was counted, officials 
estimate that 5.9% of both the black and Latino populations were missed in the 
last census. 
</P>
<P>
This year, officials hope to reduce that undercount through an aggressive 
advertising campaign involving minority firms, combined with a persistent 
emphasis on the confidentiality of the census information. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that some people's reluctance to return census questionnaires stems 
from skepticism over the government's need for such detailed information about 
their personal lives, officials constantly stress that, as San Diego census 
spokesman Dan Conway put it, the material is "not used for taxation, regulation 
or investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Although the statistical data is used to reapportion the U.S. House of 
Representatives, to redraw state and local legislative districts and to 
allocate more than $37 billion in federal funds annually, individuals' specific 
questionnaires will be available only to their families until the year 2062. 
</P>
<P>
"No one -- not the INS or the FBI or the IRS -- gets that information," 
Nowakowski said. "We take the confidentiality very, very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,200 temporary census jobs available here, most are for clerical and 
data entry positions that pay between $5.50 and $8.60 an hour. Most of the jobs 
will last for about four months, though some will be filled for up to a year, 
according to recruiting director John Ramirez Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Estimating that nearly two-thirds of the 16 million questionnaires will be 
returned within three weeks of being mailed out on March 23, census officials 
believe that the San Diego office's peak period will be in late April and May. 
If individuals do not return their census forms by May 1, their homes will be 
visited by "street counters," whose job is to ensure that the final count comes 
as close to measuring 100% of the population as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like for them to have no work," Reeder said, only half-joking. 
</P>
<P>
There will be plenty of work, however, for the employees inside the census 
processing plant once the questionnaires begin arriving. Just how big is that 
job? Let Nowakowski -- with yet another statistic -- answer that question. 
</P>
<P>
If the 16 million paper questionnaires were laid end to end, Nowakowski 
explained, they would stretch from San Diego to Washington, D.C., and back. 
</P>
<P>
You can count on it.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RULING THAT PIER MUST BE REBUILT TO BE 
APPEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redondo Beach City Council has voted to appeal a recent Los Angeles 
Superior Court ruling that the city must rebuild its landmark pier. 
</P>
<P>
The horseshoe-shaped pier, a promenade of shops and restaurants, was devastated 
by a fire and two storms in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate it will cost up to $4.6 million to rebuild the structure. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted to place an advisory question on the June ballot, asking 
voters whether the city should reconstruct the pier even if it is not legally 
obligated to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Grossman, an attorney for Pier Properties Ltd., the pier's major lease 
holder, said that if the city appeals the Jan. 24 ruling, he would seek damages 
against the city for failure to act promptly in rebuilding the pier.

REDONDO TRUSTEES REJECT PLEA TO SHELVE 'IMPRESSIONS' TEXTS; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF A CONSERVATIVE CHURCH GROUP, BOARD RETAINS THE 
CONTROVERSIAL BOOK SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Buttressed by the support of numerous parents and teachers and a national 
anti-censorship group, the Redondo Beach school trustees Tuesday unanimously 
rejected efforts by a conservative Christian organization to ban the 
controversial "Impressions" series of grade-school readers. 
</P>
<P>
The decision -- which the board had indicated was likely almost from the moment 
the first protests about the series emerged in Redondo Beach -- was hailed by 
the books' proponents, who see the vote as a turning point. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision will resound around the state of California and the nation and 
give hope to other school districts facing this kind of intimidation," said 
Michael Hudson, vice president of People for the American Way, a Washington, 
D.C.-based group that monitors First Amendment issues. 
</P>
<P>
Although the school district allows parents to choose an alternate text to any 
school material they find objectionable, the opponents of the "Impressions" 
series said it was so morbid and frightening to children that it should be 
shelved. They said they were disappointed by the decision and that they will 
remember it when election time rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't support a school district that will allow this kind of garbage to be 
taught," said Diane Ryan, who, like most of the Redondo Beach parents 
protesting the series, is a member of the fundamentalist Hope Chapel-Hermosa 
Beach. Ryan and her husband formed the Coalition of Concerned Parents to oppose 
the books after they saw stories about sorcery in her fourth-grader's reading 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan and her husband, John, said they plan to take their two children out of 
the Redondo Beach schools and enroll them in private school because of the 
decision. John Ryan said he knows of "10 or 15" parents in his coalition who 
plan to ask school officials to assign their children an alternative reading 
text so they won't have to use the "Impressions" books. 
</P>
<P>
John Ryan said he had gathered 550 signatures on a petition opposing the books, 
but board members said that was a small percentage of the more than 7,000 
parents who have children enrolled in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The series, which was approved after a lengthy review last year as the basic 
reading text for fourth- and fifth-graders and kindergartners in Redondo Beach, 
has generated criticism nationwide and stirred dispute in a number of the more 
than 40 California school districts using the texts, Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hacienda La Puente Unified and East Whittier City school districts dropped 
the books late last year, and a number of local districts, including Redondo 
Beach and Lawndale, have been targeted by opponents of the series since then. 
</P>
<P>
The series is published by Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston of Canada Ltd., a 
subsidiary of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. The books are available in the 
Canadian version, which Redondo Beach is using, and in a toned-down U.S. 
version. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach school officials told the standing-room-only crowd of about 300 
at the meeting Tuesday night that the Canadian text had been the district 
textbook selection committee's unanimous choice because of its emphasis on 
cultural diversity, imagination and literature. 
</P>
<P>
But parents -- citing one poem about excreta-eating pigs and other spooky 
stories and poems about monsters, witches and magical spells -- said the books 
were giving their children bad dreams, teaching them to disrespect adults and 
promoting witchcraft, which some fundamentalist Christians view as a satanic 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
"What's at stake here is our children's hearts and minds -- their inner 
beings," said Gregory Allen, a Redondo Beach parent and psychologist who asked 
the board to shelve the books. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving our kids fear (in these books), but we're not showing them ways 
they can overcome it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Countering that view were other parents who said the books, which also contain 
selections by such authors as C.S. Lewis and Laura Ingalls Wilder, were of high 
literary quality and so interesting that many of their children were excited 
for the first time about reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
"This series has exposed our children to only good," argued Redondo Beach 
parent Kate Griffin. "It has opened their eyes to how the rest of the world's 
cultures developed. It has given them the joy for literature and the desire to 
read." 
</P>
<P>
The board vote, which followed an hour of pro-and-con testimony from the 
audience, was a carry-over from a meeting two months ago, when the Ryans first 
outlined the argument against "Impressions" and asked that it be shelved. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees took the matter under advisement. However, in interviews 
afterward, they said they had no intention of revoking their approval of the 
books and that they perceived the request as an attempt at censorship. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the matter was slated for a vote, which took place with no board 
discussion, except for a statement read by board President Rebecca Sargent, who 
said the criticisms "contained a clear lack of knowledge and, in some cases, 
untruths and innuendo." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, board member Valerie Dombrowski said she was elated that proponents 
of the books turned out for the vote, and board Vice President Bart Swanson 
called the movement against the texts "overkill." 
</P>
<P>
"They're just going out of their way to look for evil," Swanson said. "There 
are maybe four or five stories (about witchcraft) out of the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
The two also downplayed the potential impact the vote might have on their 
campaigns. Both are up for reelection in 1991, as is trustee Sylvia Zellers, 
who characterized the Ryans and their group as "a very small and narrow 
minority."

VAN DE KAMP CALLS UTILITY MERGER 'A BAD DEAL'; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES: PLAN ALSO WOULD WORSEN AIR POLLUTION IN LOS ANGELES, VIOLATES 
ANTITRUST LAWS, ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Southern California Edison's proposal to create the nation's largest electric 
utility by merging with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric violates antitrust laws 
and would damage air quality in the Los Angeles Basin, state Atty. Gen. John 
Van de Kamp said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
At press conferences in San Diego and Los Angeles, Van de Kamp described the 
$2.5-billion stock-swap merger as "not in the public interest . . . . From what 
I've seen thus far, this corporate marriage appears to be a bad deal for 
everyone except" Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, who questioned whether the proposed merger would generate lower 
rates for current Edison customers, also expressed doubt that state regulators 
would allow Edison to fulfill a pledge to cut electric rates in San Diego and 
southern Orange counties by 10% after the merger is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp will oppose the proposed merger during regulatory reviews under way 
by the state Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
However, Van de Kamp said it was premature to consider a court challenge 
because state and federal regulators have not yet completed their reviews. He 
said he will not consider court action until regulators have "played through 
the entire administrative proceedings . . . that's the only appropriate thing 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC, which begins public hearings in April, hopes to deliver a ruling early 
in 1991. Federal regulators, who begin merger-related hearings on Monday in 
Washington, expect to complete their review by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
In reply to Van de Kamp's charges, Edison vice president Louis Phelps said 
Wednesday that they were "100% wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"The merger will benefit consumers by providing $1.7 million in lower rates and 
improved service," Phelps said in a prepared statement. The merger would 
"result in cleaner air . . . (and) economic benefits to all of Southern 
California. . . . And it does not result in adverse competitive impacts," 
Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp denied that his opposition to the merger was linked to his bid to 
be the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in November. He maintained that his 
decision to oppose the merger was driven "by the evidence, which stands for 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the leading Republican candidate in the 
governor's race, "has some amount of discretion" as to whether he should oppose 
the merger. However, as a U.S. senator, Wilson will not play a "controlling" 
role in whether the merger succeeds, Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry O'Donnell, chairman of San Diegans for the Merger, said Van de Kamp was 
"carrying his gubernatorial campaign to Pete Wilson's back yard. . . . He's 
read the polls (that show opposition to the merger) and is trying to 
essentially run a . . . campaign . . . (on) the merger." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp acknowledged that the merger has drawn strong opposition from many 
civic leaders in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego does not want to become an energy suburb of Los Angeles County," Van 
de Kamp said. "The loss of regional independence and local control are 
legitimate concerns, precisely the kinds of concerns that prompted the passage 
of antitrust laws in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Los Angeles are less interested in this merger than the people 
of San Diego (because) it touches them less directly. (But) there are certainly 
interests way beyond San Diego that are affected by this." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp charged that the merger could cause a dramatic increase in air 
pollution in the Los Angeles Basin because Edison intends to use its excess 
plant capacity there to generate power for use in San Diego. Edison has 
maintained that air quality will not suffer because it is fitting its plants 
with state-of-the-art pollution controls. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for smaller, municipal utilities, which operate in areas not served 
by Edison, on Wednesday welcomed Van de Kamp's decision to oppose the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased that the attorney general has recognized the very real concern 
of the municipal utilities regarding transmission access if a merger takes 
place," said Jerry Jordan, executive director of the California Municipal 
Utilities Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp supported the municipal utilities' contention that the proposed 
merger would cause antitrust problems because Edison would extend its already 
impressive web of transmission lines leading in and out of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Edison in the past has been sued by publicly owned utilities -- including 
municipal systems owned by Anaheim, Azusa and Riverside -- for not granting 
wider access to its electric transmission lines. Most of Southern California's 
municipal utilities meet their customers' demand by using Edison's transmission 
lines to import electric power generated by out-of-state utilities. 
</P>
<P>
A merger with SDG&amp;E would give Edison "near-monopoly control of bulk power 
production and transmission into and out of the entire Southern California 
region," Van de Kamp said. "History teaches us that, over time, such power is 
almost always used to enrich those who wield it at the expense of those who do 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp told Edison officials of his planned opposition last week during a 
three-hour meeting. SDG&amp;E spokesman Tom Murnane said SDG&amp;E officials 
were not invited to that meeting.

SIGNS INTO LAW A MEASURE PROHIBITING COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN WARNER RIDGE.

<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus outflanked a developer and possibly 
Mayor Tom Bradley by getting a measure killing commercial development at Warner 
Ridge signed into law by the city's acting mayor Wednesday only hours after 
Bradley left town. 
</P>
<P>
At Picus' request, City Council President John Ferraro -- who acts as mayor in 
Bradley's absence -- signed the measure zoning the 21.5-acre Warner Ridge 
property to permit only single-family homes. The measure had received final 
approval from the council only the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Albert Spound had urged Bradley to veto it. Spound and his partner, 
Johnson Wax Development Co., want to build a half-dozen low-rise office 
structures on the Woodland Hills site, while Picus has been trying for the past 
year to block the development. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be determined whether Ferraro's action reversed what Bradley would 
have done or simply did it earlier. Bradley, who was in Washington, D.C., could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley aides said Tuesday that the mayor had not made up his mind on the issue 
but intended to review it carefully. Until Ferraro acted, Bradley had until 
next week to do so. 
</P>
<P>
But a livid Spound said the mayor's planning deputy, Jane Blumenfeld, had 
signaled him that Bradley intended to veto the single-family plan. Blumenfeld 
and other Bradley aides, including Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani, did not return 
phone calls about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the veto," Spound said. "We were completely robbed." 
</P>
<P>
The measure passed the council by a vote of 12 to 1. Even if Bradley had vetoed 
the measure, Picus could have overridden the veto if she held onto those votes. 
</P>
<P>
Spound said he intended to sue the city to overturn the single-family zoning. 
"We're putting the finishing touches on our lawsuit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Picus asked Ferraro on Tuesday evening to sign the single-family zoning measure 
into law after learning Bradley was scheduled to leave town Wednesday -- the 
first day the measure would be on the mayor's desk. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, who sided with Picus on the Warner Ridge council votes, automatically 
becomes acting mayor when Bradley leaves the city. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley left Wednesday for Washington on an 8:45 a.m. flight from Los Angeles 
International Airport to attend an illiteracy conference and is due to return 
Friday afternoon. Ferraro said he signed the measure at 10:15 a.m., less than 
two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew John would sign it, but I had no idea what Tom would do," Picus said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some city officials speculated that Ferraro tackled the Warner Ridge 
measure in part to demonstrate the council's displeasure with recent Bradley 
efforts to intervene in planning matters. Council members traditionally regard 
as one of their prerogatives virtual sole say-so on planning issues in their 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro denied such speculation, saying he acted only to help Picus. "She's one 
of my constituents. She votes for president of the council," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ferraro, who as the council's leader is also champion of the lawmaking 
body's prerogatives, also told a reporter that he had noticed the mayor "has 
gotten very involved in planning matters recently." 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro then cited several cases in which Bradley had been at loggerheads with 
council members on planning issues in their districts. Among those cases were 
Bradley's criticism last December of Councilman Hal Bernson's plans for the 
huge Porter Ranch project above Chatsworth and the mayor's recent efforts to 
help devise a development plan for Farmers Market, an area of the Fairfax 
district represented by Ferraro.

CARLSBAD CONSIDERING MIGRANT HIRING HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following the lead of Encinitas, the Carlsbad City Council voted unanimously 
Tuesday to study the possibility of opening a hiring hall for migrant workers, 
to help alleviate growing unrest between residents and migrants looking for 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bud Lewis' proposal, which will be studied by the city staff, would 
establish a temporary employment hall for migrants who have legal status in the 
United States. The staff report, which is due in two months, also will delve 
into the possibility of establishing a regional hiring center. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis suggested county-owned land at El Camino Real and Palomar Airport Road as 
a possible hiring hall site, which is only 4 miles from the Encinitas hiring 
hall. Lewis also proposed that a busing program be instituted to make the hall 
more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis said the proposal is not the entire solution. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the workers are illegal, and this will not solve that problem," Lewis 
said. "The idea is to get those that are (legally) here to become part of the 
community and be employed and find housing." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the city has little latitude in dealing with undocumented workers, 
adding that only federal officials have that authority. 
</P>
<P>
"This plan does not even make a dent in the problem, but if other cities feel 
that this is beneficial, maybe we could put some dents throughout the area," 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe there's some cooperative efforts with other agencies that would make 
sense," Assistant City Manager Frank Mannen said. Mannen said employment 
services have traditionally been a state responsibility, but cooperation with 
other cities and the county are also being considered. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal comes on the heels of recent confrontations between migrant 
laborers and residents in areas where the laborers gather and wait for offers 
of work. Two men are accused of kidnaping a migrant worker outside a store on 
Jan. 3, handcuffing him and gagging him with duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
The Encinitas hiring hall opened in late November has had moderate success in 
dealing with tensions between residents and migrants. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 workers have registered at the temporary hiring hall, with more 
than half of them placed in jobs since Nov. 29, said Gloria Carranza, the 
city's transients' issues coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
But the city continues to have a problem with undocumented workers, Encinitas 
Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of providing a place for people who are legally residents here to 
find work, and for those who are seeking day labor to hire people, it is doing 
quite well," Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
The hiring hall also supplies potential employers with a pool of workers with 
legal U.S. residency. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that has not happened is that it has not eliminated the problem that 
we have of the people who are here illegally seeking jobs on the streets," 
Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
Carranza said 60 people a day arrive at the hall, about half of whom are placed 
in jobs. About a third of the jobs are permanent, Carranza said. 
</P>
<P>
Carranza said Latino migrants are not the only ones served by the center, and 
that non-Latinos have also received help at the hiring hall, temporarily 
located in a motor home at El Camino Real and Olivenhain Road. 
</P>
<P>
People have been placed in the agriculture industry, as well as in construction 
and landscaping, Carranza said.

Carranza said about 200 companies use the hiring hall, but many employers still 
choose to hire migrants on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Some are paying below minimum wage and there are a lot of abuses out there -- 
and this segment of the population falls victim to that abuse," Carranza said.

SPECIAL TRAFFIC SIGNAL HELPS EQUESTRIANS CROSS RIVER OF CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

There was a time when about the only obstacle a lone horseman faced on the 
mountain slopes of the northeastern San Fernando Valley were the sudden rivers 
that cascaded down the normally dry gullies after a heavy rain. Those rushing 
streams are gone now, replaced by concrete flood control channels, but they've 
been replaced by rivers of cars that are even more difficult to cross. 
</P>
<P>
Horse-riding residents of the Sun Valley area have been trying for eight years 
to find a safer way of fording busy Sunland Boulevard, which cuts through two 
popular riding areas. 
</P>
<P>
They found it this week, in the form of a new crossing signal at Sunland Park 
Drive that gives the green light to both two- and four-legged pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
The signal, which went into operation Tuesday, is like any other, except it has 
two control buttons: one at the standard 42-inch height, the other at six feet 
for those on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
The signal is one of a handful spread throughout the San Fernando Valley. There 
are "four or five, at most," said Al Albaisa, district engineer for the 
department of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The first four-legged users were Foxy the mare and Red the mule, ridden by 
Darlene Keeble and her 4-year-old son, Kurtis. It was the first time Keeble, 
who lives in La Tuna Canyon, had crossed the street on horseback since her 
first child was born nine years ago. She said she formerly used the crossing 
frequently on her way to riding trails at the Hansen Dam Recreation Area, but 
stopped because she feared for the safety of her four children. 
</P>
<P>
The new light changes things. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to actually try it," she said with resolve. "I'm going to go out and 
try going over to the dam." 
</P>
<P>
Keeble's story is typical of other riders in the area. Equestrians on the La 
Tuna Canyon side of the boulevard say they would have loved to poke along the 
trail network at Hansen Dam, but they've been corralled by the boulevard. The 
same goes for residents on the other side, who want to explore the canyon's 
dusty trails. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never come over here to explore because it's too dangerous to cross the 
street," said Jean Riesen, who lives in Shadow Hills and generally rides around 
Hansen Dam. "Now that this light is open, it makes it much safer. We'll come 
over here and utilize all the trails on this side."

GANG-STYLE ATTIRE BANNED AT ANTELOPE VALLEY SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of wrangling, the governing board of the Antelope Valley Union 
High School District on Wednesday night adopted a sweeping ban on gang-related 
attire by students at the district's six campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy, which school district officials have been debating since the 
start of the school year, takes effect immediately in the nearly 10,000-student 
district, which covers the entire Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said banning gang attire, a growing trend among Southern 
California school districts, should reduce fighting and other problems on the 
district's campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The ban does not single out specific types of clothing, accessories or other 
items, but empowers principals to ban items they believe will provoke violence. 
District officials said it will be up to principals to decide, based on advice 
from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, on gang fashions. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial aspect of the policy, opposed by many students, is a 
complete ban on all baseball-style caps except official school caps. School 
officials said baseball caps, including the kind bearing emblems of 
professional sports teams, have become a common part of gang attire. 
</P>
<P>
The policy provides for warning students for first offenses, and suspension or 
expulsion for subsequent infractions. 
</P>
<P>
School board President Larry Rucker said he hoped the policy would improve 
safety on the district's campuses, but he warned it will not cure the problem. 
"I haven't seen one policy that has eliminated gangs from campuses," he said. 
"It may help." 
</P>
<P>
The board adopted the overall policy by a 5-0 vote after a final debate of more 
than an hour over its wording. But the board split 3 to 2 on the baseball cap 
ban, which was opposed by board members Rucker and Jarold Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and teachers had been pushing the board to impose the ban, especially 
after the early January fatal shooting of Antelope Valley High School student 
Chris Sanford, who was shot to death at a party, allegedly by a gang member. 
Sheriff's deputies are still seeking a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy states that "No gang-related jewelry, insignia, colors, 
paraphernalia, materials, apparel, clothing or attire may be worn or carried on 
campus or at school activities." 
</P>
<P>
The policy also outlaws items "including, but not limited to, gloves, 
bandannas, shoestrings, wristbands, jewelry which are likely to provoke others 
to acts of violence or which are likely to cause others to be intimidated by 
fear of violence."

PRIVATE COALITION FOR THE HOMELESS MAY SOON BE WITHOUT A HOME ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marlon Thomas, 34, is homeless. He came to San Diego from Kansas City, Mo., 11 
months ago in search of what he calls the California dream. Instead, he is 
living "the California nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is penniless and without work and probably in need of cataract surgery. 
He says he is also "bone tired for a man my age." 
</P>
<P>
He says he can look forward to a cup of coffee, glasses of water and an 
occasional sandwich at the headquarters of the Coalition for the Homeless at 
Market and 14th streets in the shadow of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
But by the end of the month, the coalition itself may be without a home. 
Director Norma Rossi said its loss may take away the few crumbs -- literally -- 
that 800 to 1,000 clients a week look forward to getting. 
</P>
<P>
Rossi, a registered nurse who founded the coalition four years ago, said she 
received an eviction notice this week. She said she and everyone else on the 
block were told to vacate by Feb. 28. She said the $400 a month she pays in 
rent has been deposited in an escrow account for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't know what's happening with the property," Rossi said. "And 
when they evicted us, someone just put it through the mailbox. We didn't even 
get to see the person, face to face." 
</P>
<P>
County records show the building was sold six months ago by Mark XIV Associates 
Ltd. to Ann Greenberg. Rossi said that Greenberg is the co-owner of Jerome's 
Furniture Warehouse, but neither Greenberg nor her brother, Jerry Navarro, was 
available for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rossi said the coalition has occupied the crumbling, one-story site since 
October, 1988, and since then, much of her efforts have involved mothers and 
babies. She said that of the women who come to the building, the size of a 
small home, 9 to 10 a month deliver babies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have water," Rossi said. "We have coffee when it's cold. We have blankets 
and Pampers, toys and crayons. We have baby food and formula, bottles and 
clothing. We have infants' shoes and a job bank. We even give haircuts and help 
with resumes." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Landerville, project director for Mayor Maureen O'Connor's Regional Task 
Force on the Homeless, said he knew little about Rossi and even less about the 
work she does. He said the coalition operates outside the rubric of established 
social service agencies. He said it maintains close ties to the street, far 
more than any conventional agency. 
</P>
<P>
Rossi prides herself on being in tune with the needs of the people. She 
admitted that not all babies born to mothers who use the cluttered building are 
drug-free; she said about a third of the infants belonging to such moms are 
"strung," meaning they, too, suffer the symptoms of addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Rossi said the hours and the tension of working at the shelter have taken a 
toll, even scarred her, and at times, the homeless show little gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I had given a layette to a pregnant mother who was strung," Rossi said. "After 
the baby was born, Child Protective Services took (the baby) away. I took the 
layette back and the woman came here to throw a pie in my face. It was an apple 
pie, which she was eating right outside. I said, 'I'm not going to give a 
layette to a woman who's going to sell it to buy rock cocaine.' 
</P>
<P>
Rossi said that if a new building fails to surface, if she can't find the 
funding to continue -- and most of her money comes from a nine-member board 
made up largely of attorneys -- the coalition may cease to exist. She said the 
tragedy of that would be anguished mothers and babies "without diapers and baby 
food . . . without hope." 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Thomas said he came to the coalition looking for help for himself and 
his family. He said he injured his eye on a welding job in Northern California 
"and just haven't gotten it together since." 
</P>
<P>
He said he gets clothes at the coalition (on Wednesdays and Fridays), as well 
as coffee, food and occasional part-time work. On Wednesday afternoon, he and 
about a dozen others were sharing a loaf of bread dropped off by a donor. 
</P>
<P>
Rossi said she grieves for the mothers who find themselves on the street.

GRAVES GETS 3-YEAR PORT TERM, SCHENK DRAWS SHORTER STINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newly appointed Port Commissioner Clifford Graves was assigned the longer of 
two unexpired terms on the powerful agency that controls state tidelands around 
San Diego Bay, in a decision by a San Diego City Council committee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Graves will serve until Jan. 2, 1993, while colleague Lynn Schenk will serve 
until Jan. 2, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-2 vote of the council's Rules Committee settled the last remaining issue 
in the appointment of replacements for retiring Port Commissioners William Rick 
and Louis Wolfsheimer, who step down today. 
</P>
<P>
Graves and Schenk were appointed Jan. 23 to fill the remaining portions of the 
two commissioners' terms, following a brief power struggle over when Rick and 
Wolfsheimer would step down. 
</P>
<P>
But the council had left open the question of which appointee would be assigned 
to the nearly three years remaining in Rick's term and the 11 months left in 
Wolfsheimer's spot. 
</P>
<P>
The council waived its policy of limiting port appointees to two terms when it 
reappointed Rick and Wolfsheimer to third four-year terms to allow them to 
complete the task of overseeing construction of the city's new bayfront 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Graves won the longer term with the support of Mayor Maureen O'Connor and City 
Council members Ron Roberts, Wes Pratt and Linda Bernhardt, over the dissent of 
council members Abbe Wolfsheimer and Bob Filner. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members also criticized a Jan. 19 legal opinion by City Atty. 
John Witt -- which states that the council lacks the authority to remove any 
port commissioner without demonstrating malfeasance by the commissioner -- and 
promised to ignore it if the issue is ever taken up by the full council. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy stems from the desire of some council members to remove W. 
Daniel Larsen, the city's third appointee on the seven-member Board of Port 
Commissioners, for allegedly failing to represent the council's interests. Only 
four council members -- Wolfsheimer, Hartley, Pratt and Filner -- appear ready 
to vote to remove Larsen, leaving the group one vote short of the majority 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt, who called Witt's opinion "the very best in legal gymnastics," said that 
Larsen's ouster may be brought to the full council even if it lacks the support 
needed for passage.

ELECTION SECRETARY OF STATE; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCILWOMAN FLORES PLEDGES TO CAMPAIGN FOR POLITICAL REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who recently helped sink a key 
provision in the city's proposed ethics-in-government code, said Wednesday that 
she is running for secretary of state to promote election and political reform. 
</P>
<P>
"The secretary of state is our state's chief elections officer, and because of 
a lack of state leadership, California has the most confusing patchwork of 
campaign election laws anywhere in the nation," Flores said at a news 
conference outside City Hall. The three-term councilwoman repeated the message 
later in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, a Republican who represents the city's 15th Council District extending 
from Watts to the Port of Los Angeles, said she decided early this week to run 
after receiving phone calls of encouragement from various supporters, including 
Republican gubernatorial candidate Sen. Pete Wilson. She accused Secretary of 
State March Fong Eu, a four-term Democratic incumbent, of having created "a 
vacuum of leadership in this office." 
</P>
<P>
Flores, 53, helped bring cable television coverage of council meetings to Los 
Angeles and was the author of legislation requiring objective titles and 
summaries on city ballot initiatives. But she lost favor among some reformers 
last month when she led a successful assault on a proposal designed to reduce 
the influence of campaign contributors by providing taxpayer-financed campaigns 
in city elections. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was part of a broad ethics-in-government package drafted by a 
citizens commission that was appointed last year amid revelations about Mayor 
Tom Bradley's financial affairs. The City Council has debated, amended and 
revised the package several times, and it is expected to vote next week to 
place a hybrid version on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Flores defended her stance on the ethics reforms Wednesday, saying that she 
voted for most of the commission's recommendations and actually strengthened 
them by adding restrictions on city commissioners. She said she voted against 
public financing of campaigns because voters have never given "a clear signal" 
that they want to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
But Flores indicated for the first time that she may be willing to compromise. 
She said that she would support the placing of a public financing proposal on 
the ballot if it were separated from the rest of the ethics package so that 
voters could reject one without rejecting the other. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the ethics reforms said next week's council vote on the package 
will be a test of Flores' commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a terrific chance to demonstrate leadership on these issues," said 
Geoffrey Cowan, who heads the citizens commission. 
</P>
<P>
Flores will face Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Gordon Levy in the June 
primary. The winner will run against Peace and Freedom candidate Julie Fausto 
and the winner of the Democratic primary, which pits incumbent Eu against South 
Los Angeles business consult Mervin Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 36, said he will focus his campaign in black and Latino neighborhoods, 
stressing economic development issues and the preservation of social services. 
He has previously run unsuccessfully for Congress three times and Los Angeles 
City Council twice. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office said officials will not know 
until today whether other candidates filed before Wednesday's 5 p.m. deadline.

TIMES' COVERAGE OF MCMARTIN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in reference to David Shaw's recent news analysis that suggests The 
Times' coverage of the McMartin case was biased (Part A, Jan. 19-22). I have 
followed the case and its coverage closely, especially the articles by Lois 
Timnick. Her coverage was not at all biased. In my view her work was an 
outstanding example of the very best in objective journalism, performed under 
extremely difficult conditions. In fact, it was in a class by itself compared 
with most of the other coverage of this case by the media. 
</P>
<P>
Many of us in the local medical community have been familiar with Timnick's 
work ever since she came here from St. Louis with an excellent reputation as a 
science writer for the Globe Democrat. In a welcome bit of creativity, The 
Times assigned Timnick to an unusual beat: human behavior. As your human 
behavior reporter, Timnick's work was so excellent that she gained great 
credibility and respect among psychiatrists, psychologists and behavioral 
scientists nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Timnick researched her topics in depth, quoted people with absolute accuracy, 
and on controversial topics was implacably objective and even-handed. One 
result was that she was given the coveted Robert T. Morse Award in 1981 by the 
American Psychiatric Assn. This honor goes annually to a journalist for 
outstanding work in reporting developments in our field. 
</P>
<P>
Those who, in search of scapegoats, include Timnick on any list of biased 
journalists, have failed to do their own homework. And those representing the 
McMartin defense who are now lashing out in all directions, trying to make the 
climate more favorable to the defendants, should hardly be given credibility as 
authorities on journalistic standards. As for those Monday-morning quarterbacks 
from far-off newspapers who now criticize The Times (thereby suggesting that 
they could have done a better job), I would say, stow it. Day in, day out, year 
in, year out, you weren't there in the McMartin case. Timnick was. 
</P>
<P>
In Scotland, a jury can deliver one of three possible verdicts: guilty, not 
guilty, and not proved. The McMartin jury, lacking the last choice, did its 
duty as best it could. The aftermath of frustration and outrage has led to a 
frenzy of blaming on both sides. This will run its course. Meanwhile, set the 
record straight. Timnick is a distinguished journalist and one of your star 
reporters. She deserves great credit for the job she did in the McMartin case. 
What she really deserves is the Pulitzer Prize.

LUNCHTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the '80s, we heard there was no such thing as a free lunch. In the '90s, in 
the Los Angeles Unified schools, for many there's no such thing as lunch. 
</P>
<P>
In some schools across the district, the last kid in the cafeteria line ends up 
with less than 5 minutes to eat. So, despite federally funded lunch programs 
and health education classes about the basic food groups, kids in many of our 
schools are still hungry. 
</P>
<P>
Why? In some schools, it's a systems issue: too many kids in line, too few 
lines. In others, lunch has been shortened to 20 minutes to facilitate shorter 
workdays for teachers, bus schedules, etc. And in some schools, it's simply the 
attitude of those scheduling the school day. At our school's council recently, 
a teacher suggested we didn't have a problem. "The same kid doesn't end up at 
the end of the line every day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Chew on this: Most prisoners in the state get 30 minutes to eat lunch. Dogs in 
the animal shelters get 30 minutes with their bowls. Adults who work 6 hours 
get at least 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for our school board -- and maybe the state -- to guarantee our 
children time to eat so they can be physically prepared to learn.

THE LOADED GUN TO THEIR HEADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When lawmakers vote against a proposal supported by 84% of the electorate, 
they're usually driven to it by one of three things. Sometimes they do it out 
of principle. Sometimes they do it for personal gain. Most of the time they do 
it because they're afraid of something more vindictive than a spurned voter -- 
a special interest. 
</P>
<P>
There is no clearer recent example of legislation by fear than the California 
Senate's treatment of AB 497, a common-sense public-safety proposal that has 
been approved by the Assembly and today will receive reconsideration in the 
other chamber. The measure, which was introduced by Sacramento Democrat Lloyd 
G. Connelly, simply proposes to extend to all firearms the current 15-day wait 
between the purchase of a handgun and its delivery. That brief interval would 
allow the state's Department of Justice to check on whether the buyer is a 
person prohibited from owning a gun. These would include individuals found 
mentally infirm under law, convicted felons, those found guilty of specified 
violent misdemeanors within the previous 10 years and people forbidden to 
possess a weapon as a condition of probation. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's advantages are self-evident. The waiting period has been tested with 
handguns for years, and has worked no hardship on ordinary people and 
legitimate sportsmen. Since so many killings really are crimes of passion, 
there are obvious advantages to imposing a legal "cooling- off" period on 
unstable or distraught individuals in search of a gun. These common-sense facts 
have been enough to win AB 497 bipartisan backing in both legislative chambers, 
the support of every major law-enforcement official in the state and the 
approval of more than two-thirds of the Californians surveyed in a recent Times 
Poll. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, they have not been enough to overcome the fears of a handful of senators 
intimidated by the well-financed, single-issue lobbyists of the National Rifle 
Assn. Those fearful lawmakers helped the pro-gun ideologues defeat AB 497 on 
its first Senate vote. When the measure comes up for another vote today, it 
deserves the support of every senator with a decent respect for the public's 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the violence in our streets begins with a little courage in the 
Statehouse.

"All men are created equal," is stated in the Declaration of Independence. In 
the McMartin trial, the children were not treated equal to adults. Children are

Our justice system has come a long way to be more fair and just, but it still

HANDICAP PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently in Sherman Oaks I returned to my car after doing some shopping and 
found a printed piece of paper stuck to the outside of my windshield. This is 
what it said: "This parking is reserved for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
You are in violation!" The paper wouldn't come off, so I had no choice but to 
drive with it there. It hindered and endangered my driving; it clearly had been 
placed directly in front of a driver's eyes for the purpose of doing just that. 
When I got home I confirmed that it had been glued to the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, whoever stuck that note in place must have more malice in his heart 
than sense in his head. Had his eyes been open he could scarcely have avoided 
seeing the conspicuous hand control just under the steering wheel. Or the 
fender sticker that says "Paralyzed Veterans of America." Or, most important of 
all, the special license plates. 
</P>
<P>
Plates bearing the prefix "DV" (disabled veteran) or "DP" (disabled person) 
entitle the driver to the same parking privileges as does the more familiar 
windshield card. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, any person who himself has a disability has little excuse for not 
knowing about them. And would, in any event, be well advised to just leave a 
note under the wiper blade of an offending car. Or call the police and let them 
handle the matter. Malicious vigilantism is scarcely becoming to those of us 
who enjoy special parking privileges only through the admirable generosity of 
the general public.

SHALL WE CLONE THE GLOBE, AMERICAN-STYLE?; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: BY CUTTING OUR ARMED STRENGTH SLOWLY, CAUTIOUSLY, WE CAN BE WHAT WE 
WANT TO BE -- NO. 1 MILITARILY AND IN EVERYTHING ELSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEN WATTENBERG, Ben Wattenberg is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise 
Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because Americans want America to be No. 1, we won't -- and we shouldn't -- 
make big, quick cuts in the defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
From 1945 to the mid-'60s, our leaders told us that we were the most powerful 
military force -- first in the world -- and we loved to hear it. Then, Soviet 
military power grew and politicians began saying America was "second to none." 
By 1980, hard-liners were saying what we did not like to hear -- that we were 
"second," or "unless we rebuilt militarily, we would become second." Hmm. 
First. Second to none. Second. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, America rebuilt. Partly as a result, some argue, the Soviets 
began self-destructing. 
</P>
<P>
Now we must decide what to do about defense. The doves have an answer: Cut it 
back and reap a big peace dividend. At last, the dove case makes some sense. It 
is, after all, rooted in the ancient hawk precept: "The American military 
budget is set in the Kremlin." With the Soviets weaker, say the doves, we can 
cut big and fast. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? How could a hawk oppose such logic? There are some rational reasons. 
And there is another reason that is mystical, yet known to almost all. 
</P>
<P>
Rational reasons: Big Soviet defense cuts haven't happened yet. It's hard to 
cut budgets quickly -- contracts have been let. Research and development take a 
long time. We have other military responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is that other reason: If we play our cards right, we will be able to 
wave our forefinger, as Americans do when their team wins a football game, and 
yell: "We're No. 1 militarily!" Partly because of that, we'll probably be first 
in everything else, too. 
</P>
<P>
But is it good to be No. 1? It costs money, and it can periodically get you 
into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
On balance, it's fine. Throughout history, nations that had a chance at it, 
tried for it. When you're No. 1, other folks don't usually mess with you in a 
serious way. 
</P>
<P>
Since Colonial times, Americans have wanted to be first. John Winthrop said 
America would be "a city upon a hill . . . the eyes of all people are upon us." 
Later, Andrew Jackson said America is "a country manifestly called by the 
Almighty to a destiny." It soon got a little out of hand. James Gordon Bennett 
wrote that "it is our manifest destiny to lead and rule all other nations." 
President William McKinley used "manifest destiny" to justify annexing Hawaii. 
President Ronald Reagan quoted Winthrop. 
</P>
<P>
What do you do with it, if you're No. 1? Invade the world? Clone the globe, 
American-style? 
</P>
<P>
Of course not. If you have to ask the question, you don't understand it. But, 
if we're lucky, we'll find out what being No. 1. The Judeo-Christian God, 
remember, is a God that reveals himself as history unfolds. That's one reason 
the West has always been oriented to the future. 
</P>
<P>
Ask 100 Americans whether they want to be No. 1, and 90 will say yes. Why? 
Because we peddle the American idea. Americans today want to offer the world a 
kinder, gentler, optional manifest destiny. When you're No. 1, people pay more 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
We have an opportunity now to be first -- and on the cheap. (Just when they 
were saying America was in decline!) The Soviet empire is unilaterally engaged 
in a going-out-of-business sale. So we can all agree to cut back our military. 
But by how much? How fast? We can do it in a spasm, increasing chances that 
there will be a world with no leader. Or, by cutting our military only slowly 
and cautiously, we can make it more likely that we will be what we want to be 
-- No. 1.

CHARGE MORE TRAGEDY TO MARXISM; 
</P>
<P>
DICTATORSHIP: THE SOVIETS HAVE BURIED COMMUNISM. BUT ONE-PARTY RULE BASED ON 
MARXIST DOCTRINE LIVES ON ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM PFAFF, William Pfaff is a Los Angeles Times syndicated columnist 
based in Paris. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most pernicious influence of Marxism has been to provide an intellectual 
rationale for dictatorship. The disastrous consequence of this for modern 
Russia has now implicitly been acknowledged by the Central Committee of the 
Soviet Communist Party. The doctrine of single-party rule, of party 
dictatorship, has been abandoned -- 72 years too late for Russia, 46 years too 
late for all the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
Marx himself, when he spoke of "the dictatorship of the proletariat," seems to 
have had Roman dictatorship in mind: constitutional dictatorship, initially 
limited in duration. 
</P>
<P>
Under Lenin's leadership, a theory of government by the working class became in 
practice rule by the Communist Party. Further elaborated in the doctrine of 
"democratic centralism," the supposed dictatorship of the proletariat became 
arbitrary and absolute dictatorship by the self-nominating and 
self-perpetuating apparatus controlling that party. 
</P>
<P>
When Mikhail Gorbachev launched perestroika, he did not intend to become the 
gravedigger of communism. He meant to save it by reforming it. But he is now, 
in essential respects, terminating it. Two years ago, his Extraordinary 
Communist Party Congress to reform the Soviet political system took for granted 
the Communist Party's continued monopoly of power. That is now is reversed. 
</P>
<P>
The single-party question has been at the center of the political turmoil in 
Romania since the revolution in December. Silviu Brucan, the veteran Communist 
who played probably the most important individual role in preparing the 
Ceausescus' overthrow and bringing the National Salvation Front to power -- who 
usually is described as the front's theorist -- has said that "it will take 20 
years for Romania to become a democracy." His implication is that Romania will 
need 20 more years of direction by an elite. 
</P>
<P>
He argues that the old-fashioned political party system has broken down 
everywhere because of the rise to power of intellectual workers who refuse to 
accept the rigid structures of traditional parties. He says that the ecological 
movements in Europe, the Green parties, Solidarity in Poland, the "New Forums" 
that have emerged in Hungary, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia, all are new 
political phenomena produced by the failure of the old party system. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks this new class of intellectual workers must be the leading class in 
the future, but told a French interviewer in January that the difference 
between West and East today is that in the West another class still is in 
control over the intellectual workers, the capitalist class -- "what you in 
France call the 200 families. In the East that class does not exist." He 
doesn't want it to exist in the new Romania, which is the reason the National 
Salvation Front has been hostile to Romanian exiles coming back from the West. 
</P>
<P>
It is a demonstration of the extent to which the reformers in the East still 
think in categories of the 1930s. Brucan, in certain ways correct in his 
analysis, still does not understand that whatever capitalism in the West has 
become, it certainly is not today dominated by the "200 families" of France -- 
or by Rockefellers, Vanderbilts and Mellons in America. 
</P>
<P>
He also fails to understand that Communists, even Communist reformers, are no 
longer acceptable as leaders of a revolution against communism. Things have 
gone much too far for that, as the Soviet abandonment of the one-party system 
demonstrates. Brucan's associate, Petre Roman, currently the prime minister, 
has repeatedly spoken of the need for "a new kind of democracy," as has Brucan. 
A Romanian journalist, Octavian Paler, replies, "What don't they like about 
Western democracy? I'm very afraid of new kinds of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Romania and the Soviet Union have been the last places where the single-party 
idea survived -- in the Eastern Bloc, that is. One-party government has already 
formally been renounced in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria and 
Poland. It survives outside the bloc, in Yugoslavia (where the Communist 
parties of Slovenia and Croatia nevertheless advocate multi-partyism), and in 
isolated Albania. 
</P>
<P>
It survives in a great many places outside Europe, and Marxism bears a 
responsibility for that, too. Every sub-Saharan African government except South 
Africa's, Senegal's and that of the island of Mauritius is a one-party 
dictatorship -- nearly all of them claiming to be "socialist." (Nigeria is a 
doubtful case: There are two parties, both under army domination.) 
</P>
<P>
One-party rule is the practice in most of Asia and the Middle East, and in 
several Latin American countries. Marxism nearly always provides the rationale. 
Today, some African leaders pay increasing attention to North Korea. As the 
Soviet model falters, Kim Il Sung's dynastic Communist totalitarianism seems a 
useful replacement -- a surviving mutation of Marxism able to justify a 
dictator's quest for total control, as well as his need to believe that Marxism 
has proved progress and science to be on dictatorship's side. 
</P>
<P>
Africa's tragedy is just another charge on the account owed history by Marx and 
Lenin. Had their beliefs not fused, so as to assign virtue to despotism, 
promising that out of this could come the general happiness of mankind, the 
20th Century would have been spared much grief. It all began in good 
intentions. It ended, for all intents and purposes, in Moscow on Wednesday at 
that meeting of the Communist Party's Central Committee which abandoned the 
principle of Communist Party dictatorship.

A spokesman for the San Diego Police Department said the unidentified man was 
shot about 7:25 p.m. The wounded man told police that the car was brown and was 
occupied by more than one person, police said.

JAPANESE PRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why can't America catch up (Part A, Jan. 14)? We could if we were given the 
same business opportunities in Japan as we give the Japanese here in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
We could if Japan would let American businessmen have Japanese lobbyists 
pounding on the doors of their politicians in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
We could if American patents would protect the American manufacturer in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
We could if American businesses would get full government support for plant 
improvements to beat the foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
I am tired of our media putting Japanese products on a pedestal and constantly 
knocking not only American products and businessmen, but the worker as well. 
We, too, could be producing better products if we did not spend millions on 
research and development on a product to have it stolen from us as soon as we 
are in production. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese used to walk through our plants with their cameras clicking, and 
we let them. But when I, as an American businessman, visited their plants, I 
was prohibited from even taking a camera on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
And with the profits made from all these years of copying, the Japanese are now 
buying this country's best businesses and brains to teach their American 
creativity to their young. Worse, they are buying the best lobbyists in 
Washington to be sure they can continue to rape America.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S TIME FOR AN AIRING OF ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The special election to replace William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) in the 
state's 31st Senate District has given new meaning to the phrase quick and 
dirty. The six-week contest -- which thankfully ended Tuesday -- included 
little discussion of issues to help voters make an intelligent choice. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the campaign, Republican candidate Ron Isles was censured by the 
Orange County Republican Party for a campaign brochure that chided two of his 
Republican opponents with the title, "Meet the Two Best Legislators Money Can 
Buy." But what brought the election to new depths were remarks made last 
weekend by one of the Republican candidates, Assemblyman Gil Ferguson of 
Newport Beach, who called a group of gay-rights activists "faggots." He was 
reacting to their militant protest against his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson is an elected official, so a little dignity could be expected from 
him. Instead, his response was: "I don't care about them. I'm a retired Marine. 
. . . A couple of faggots out there aren't going to scare me." He later refused 
to back down. "I could have called them sodomites," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This type of gay-bashing by a public official is inappropriate. Ferguson 
demeaned not only gays but himself by stooping to this level. We hope that in 
the April runoff election campaign, the candidates will sling less mud and talk 
more about issues of import to the voters.

WOMAN KILLED IN CRASH AS CAR FLIPS, HITS HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman in her early 20s was killed Wednesday afternoon when the car she was 
driving veered out of control at high speed and flipped over, crashing into the 
back yard of a house in La Mesa, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the victim was being withheld Wednesday night, pending notification 
of next of kin. She was the lone occupant of a 1980 Buick Regal that witnesses 
said became airborne and cleared a 6-foot chain-link fence after hurtling out 
of control on a curving section of Bancroft Drive, said Lt. Michael Wolfe of 
the La Mesa Police Department.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was something new in the brew. 
</P>
<P>
A dash of Branko Segota, a pinch of magical footwork and a touch of spark. 
</P>
<P>
And suddenly the recipe appeared to be just right. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers (13-15) clubbed the Baltimore Blast, 4-1, Wednesday night at the 
San Diego Sports Arena before 5,985, a season low. 
</P>
<P>
So today they take to the road with a few more answers, fewer questions, a 
two-game winning streak and caution in their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're what, 13 and 15?" midfielder Brian Quinn said. "We should be 17 and 11. 
I'm still cautious. Now it's a process of continuing the level of intensity." 
</P>
<P>
This was Segota's return from a six-game rest with a strained right calf, and 
he took pressure off the Sockers' other striking threat, forward Zoran Karic. 
Segota also got in the kick that pushed the Blast off the edge of a four-game 
winning streak, scoring with 45 seconds remaining in the third quarter to give 
the Sockers a comfortable 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of a 6-2 victory over Dallas Sunday, the Sockers by and 
large have been punchless offensively during Segota's absence. Segota could 
only watch and think: "Poor Zoran." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt sorry for him," Segota said. "He was the only forward out there who the 
other teams respect. He got manhandled." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore (18-11), which leads Wichita by 2 1/2 games in the Eastern Division 
of the Major Indoor Soccer League, made a few attempts to manhandle the Sockers 
(third, 3 1/2 games behind Dallas in the West). Early in the second quarter, 
Blast defender Rusty Troy pushed midfielder Waad Hirmez into the boards. Hirmez 
trotted back out holding his hands apart and directing a didn't-you-see-that? 
look toward the referees. 
</P>
<P>
The ref saw and assessed Troy a two-minute penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
Forty seconds later, Socker midfielder Brian Quinn performed a marvelous 
juggling act that resulted in a power play goal, gave the Sockers a 1-0 lead 
and sent them on their way. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn took a rebound off the boards, juggled it to himself with his right foot 
and hit it with the outside of his right foot into the goal. Goalie Scott 
Manning watched helplessly. 
</P>
<P>
Socker midfielder Jacques Ladouceur made it 2-0 5:18 into the third, taking an 
off-target shot by forward Jim Gabarra on the rebound and scoring with his left 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
Segota's goal was quite a thing to witness also. He swerved around a puzzled 
Freddie Thompson and sent it past Manning with his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
Led by goalie Zoltan Toth (6-7), who made a host of diving saves throughout the 
game, the Sockers foiled the Blasts' sixth-attacker offense for 4:26 in the 
fourth quarter. Quinn, who notched the 100th regular-season goal of his career 
earlier in the evening, also scored with 56 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Defender Mike Stankovic spoiled the shutout, scoring off a corner kick from 
Carl Valentine with three seconds remaining following an unsportsmanlike 
conduct call on defender George Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Ever the perfectionist, defender Kevin Crow wasn't completely satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, we didn't play as well as we did in the last two games," he said. 
"Zollie made too many saves tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Many of them were on acrobatic dives. Toth said he was more focused than in his 
previous start last Friday, when he only made one save in a 3-2 overtime loss 
to Tacoma. This time he saved 16 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The only sour moment came in the second quarter when Hirmez went down with a 
right hamstring pull. He will miss the upcoming trip. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, things are looking much brighter. 
</P>
<P>
"We played very disciplined," Segota said. "We were running, and we were 
fighting. I always said it just takes a little something to ignite us." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Paul Dougherty made his second appearance in San Diego as a member of the 
Baltimore Blast Wednesday night. A midfielder, Dougherty opted to sign with 
Baltimore during the off-season after the Sockers failed to match the Blasts' 
offer. Dougherty, a native of England who played 2 1/2 seasons with the 
Sockers, said he feels right at home in Baltimore. "It's totally different from 
San Diego," he said. "It's very similar to England." Of the Sockers' struggles, 
Dougherty said: "I still think San Diego has got what it takes. Come playoff 
time, Ron (Newman) will get them clicking together. He has so much experience 
in those situations." . . . Socker defender George Fernandez extended his 
consecutive-games streak to 108. . . . Friday's game at Kansas City begins a 
four-game trip, which will continue through Cleveland, Baltimore and Tacoma.

BRETT HULL FIGURED TO HAVE A 50-50 CHANCE

A famous name isn't the only thing 50-goal scorer Brett Hull inherited. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one more milestone in what's going to be a long career," said Hall 
of Famer Bobby Hull, the other half of the NHL's only father-and-son 50-goal 
duo, after his son reached the milestone Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He's better than I ever was and he'll do a lot more than I ever did. I've 
always told him he isn't a 30- or 40-goal scorer, he's a 50- or 60-goal 
scorer." 
</P>
<P>
Or more. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull, after getting his NHL-leading 50th in a 6-4 victory over the 
Toronto Maple Leafs, has 26 games to build on his totals. With 50 goals in 54 
games, he's 12th on the all-time list of the "NHL's Fastest 50." In only his 
third season -- and in the option year of his contract -- Hull, 25, has joined 
some pretty exclusive company. 
</P>
<P>
But what comes next? Even Hull isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty goals is what you aim for when you first start playing hockey," Hull 
said. "Not being a checker or a penalty killer or anything like that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to play hard and see what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto defenseman Al Iafrate says Hull, who has seven goals in seven games 
against the Maple Leafs, is hard to stop because he's not greedy. "He's smart," 
Iafrate said. "Most wingers, you don't have to spread apart with your partner 
because it's like the puck is a magnet. He stays on the boards and out of 
traffic and always gets his chances." 
</P>
<P>
One of the few names ahead of Brett on the "fastest 50" list is his father, who 
got 50 goals in 52 games in 1966. Bobby Hull topped 50 goals five times, the 
first time at age 23 in 1962, and amassed 610 NHL goals in 16 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Hull, who watched from a private box in the St. Louis Arena when Brett 
beat Toronto goaltender Jeff Reese on a third-period breakaway, said he always 
had high hopes for his son -- even last season, when Brett was an out-of-shape, 
one-dimensional player, who scored 41 goals but finished with a minus-17 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
After attending an offseason conditioning camp at the Blues' request, he came 
to training camp in top shape and has developed into a complete player, good 
enough to be voted the starting right wing for the Campbell Conference All-Star 
Team. 
</P>
<P>
He learned to pass when the shot's not there and can score on a backhander as 
easily as with his well-respected slap shot. He's also more effective 
defensively and has a plus-11 rating, third on the Blues. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept harping on it," Bobby Hull said of the need for his son to improve. "I 
made him realize what he had to do -- dare to be different. He's made me very 
proud. I'm living it all again. It's a great, great thrill." 
</P>
<P>
Brett is getting even better as the season goes on. He's riding a 17-game 
point-scoring streak, in which he has 19 goals and 13 assists. 
</P>
<P>
He's also first in the league with 18 power-play goals, tied for first with 10 
game-winning goals and four goals away from the Blues' season record of 54 set 
by Wayne Babych in 1980-81.

LAKERS HANDLE 'JORDANAIRES' IN 121-103 VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: CHICAGO STAR GETS 32 POINTS, BUT HIS SUPPORTING CAST IS 
OVERWHELMED BY L. A. DEPTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Clear the court and leave Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson alone and, sure, you 
have a show of individual skills worth paying a few dollars to see. 
</P>
<P>
What would be lost, however, are the virtues of team play, rarely better 
exemplified than in the Lakers' 121-103 victory over the Chicago Bulls 
Wednesday night in the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
In their final game before the All-Star break, the Lakers (35-11) increased 
their Pacific Division lead to two games over Portland. 
</P>
<P>
And, although attention naturally focused on the duel between Jordan and 
Johnson, the Lakers' depth and versatility won out. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Jordan had big nights. Johnson scored 22 points -- nine coming on 
three-point baskets -- and had 17 assists. And Jordan led all scorers with 32 
points, a shade under his 33.3 average. 
</P>
<P>
Their matchup was only one of several story lines, if not a subplot. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers set out to limit the rest of the Bulls -- sometimes called the 
"Jordanaires," as if they were merely backup singers. Except for Craig Hodges, 
who made four three-point shots and had 18 points, and Horace Grant's 12 points 
and 18 rebounds, the Lakers pretty much controlled the other Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, several Lakers contributed. Six players finished in double figures 
and their floating "help" defense could serve as a model for teams wanting to 
contain -- not stop -- Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Laker forward James Worthy scored 30 points and, Jordan notwithstanding, had 
the most acrobatic basket of the night when he sank a no-look two-hand scoop 
shot in the first half -- while being fouled. Worthy made 11 of 19 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed that from James," Johnson said. "He always comes forward in the big 
games. When he's scoring, it opens things up for everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cooper guarded Jordan about 15 1/2 minutes and gave up only 10 points, 
four on free throws. Cooper, on a possession in the first half, remained 
airborne and blocked Jordan's shot even through Jordan double-pumped before 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"He has always been a good defender," Jordan said of Cooper. "He has good foot 
movement and is very good when it comes to denying the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Other Laker contributors included center Mychal Thompson, who had 12 points and 
10 rebounds and outplayed Bull center Bill Cartwright; guard Byron Scott, who 
guarded Jordan most of the game but still managed 13 points; and reserves 
Orlando Woolridge (14 points) and Cooper (11). 
</P>
<P>
Against Jordan, strength in numbers is valuable. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to win as a team, play as a team," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "We 
had to do things that we hadn't done, as a team, against Chicago before. We 
didn't want to pay so much attention on Jordan that we let everyone else go off 
on us. That's what happened the last few times." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had lost four consecutive games to the Bulls over three seasons. 
Included was a 93-83 setback at Chicago in December. In that game, both Jordan 
and his backup group had big games. 
</P>
<P>
"We played well, we moved the ball well," Johnson said. "What we wanted to do 
is try to contain some of those other guys. We knew what Michael could do. We 
didn't want the other guys to have big games." 
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen, the Bulls' All-Star forward averaging 16.7 points, was held to 
14, attempting only seven shots in 34 minutes. Grant also was held slightly 
below his season average, and, although Cartwright scored 10 points and had 11 
rebounds, he was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan was a factor, but not the determining one. He made 12 of 21 shots, but 
made only one field goal and four of five free throws in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy nearly matched Jordan point for point. Jordan had 18 points at halftime; 
Worthy 17. Jordan had 26 points entering the fourth quarter; Worthy 25. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael put on a good show," Thompson said. "He might have won the battle. He 
may have gotten more 'oohs' and 'aahs.' But James doesn't care about that. 
James just keeps playing." 
</P>
<P>
It was the Bulls' third consecutive loss, and Coach Phil Jackson blamed it on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not like our defense tonight," he said. "We had many lapses in the 
second half, which made it extremely difficult to get back in the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers opened a significant lead early in the third quarter, when Johnson 
sank consecutive three-point shots for a 73-59 lead. The Lakers would lead by 
as many as 14 points in both the third and fourth quarters and would not let 
the Bulls get closer than six points in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bulls had been in Los Angeles since Sunday waiting for Wednesday's 
game, and the Lakers had won in overtime at Portland on Tuesday, the Lakers 
came out more aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just good," Hodges said. "They play at a very high level and have a 
high level of concentration. When they do that, they're even better." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, as instructed by Riley, paid attention to Jordan but did not let 
him consume their thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
He scored six of the Bulls' first 10 points, also drawing two fouls on Scott. 
That prompted Riley to insert Cooper earlier than planned. 
</P>
<P>
In Cooper's 11 minutes guarding Jordan in the first half, the Bulls guard 
scored eight points. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan did not have to carry the offensive load in the first half. Hodges, a 
long-distance shooting specialist who will challenge Jordan in Sunday's 
three-point shooting contest, scored 12 points -- including two three-pointers 
-- in a substitute's role. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two guys (Cooper and Scott) did a good job on Michael (Jordan)," Riley 
said. "But we wanted to stop the other guys. Hodges hurt us a little in the 
first half, but we stopped him better in the second half, too." 
</P>
<P>
As entertaining as Jordan was, Worthy's second-quarter no-look basket was the 
most crowd-stirring. Setting up in the low post with his back to the basket, 
Worthy took a pass from Johnson in the air. Still airborne, Worthy flipped the 
ball with both hands over his head and into the basket. He was fouled on the 
play and made the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a super play," Johnson said, "especially with his back to the basket."

<P>
The disclosure of NHL players' salaries prompted Dave Molinari of the 
Pittsburgh Press to do some comparative shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Molinari's best-buy team:

</P>
<P>
Left wing: Todd Krygier, Hartford Whalers, $110,000. 
</P>
<P>
Defense: Glen Wesley, Boston Bruins, $130,000; Paul Cavallini, St. Louis, 
$135,000. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie: Daren Puppa, Buffalo, $130,000. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Right wing: Vladimir Krutov, Vancouver Canucks, $375,000. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Defense: Borje Salming, Detroit, $435,000; Reijo Ruotsalainen, New Jersey 
Devils, $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie: Pete Peeters, Philadelphia Flyers, $275,000. 
</P>
<P>
Add NHL: Jack Ferreira, general manager of the Minnesota North Stars, on New 
York Ranger counterpart Neil Smith's acquisition of Bernie Nicholls from the 
Kings: "I know 19 other general managers who wish they would have made the deal 
that Neil made." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Feb. 8, 1964, who won the first men's Alpine skiing medals for 
the United States in Olympic competition? 
</P>
<P>
Say good night, Dick: Dick Steinberg, new general manager of the New York Jets, 
traveled incognito during the closing stages of his six-week search for a new 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
What was Steinberg's nom de GM during the search that ended Tuesday with the 
selection of Bruce Coslet, offensive coordinator for the Cincinnati Bengals? 
</P>
<P>
"Dick Martin," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
What name did Coslet use? 
</P>
<P>
"Dan Rowan," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Double indemnity: Former Utah Jazz coach Frank Layden on the selection of the 
Lakers' A.C. Green to the Western Conference All-Star team instead of the 
Jazz's Karl Malone: "An injustice was done when Malone was left off. An even 
bigger injustice was done because a player who didn't deserve to be on the team 
takes the place of someone who deserves to be on it -- a Buck Williams, an 
Xavier McDaniel." 
</P>
<P>
Without a clue: Coach Don DeVoe's University of Florida basketball team has 
lost seven consecutive games since center Dwayne Schintzius was suspended and 
then quit in a dispute over his hair style. 
</P>
<P>
Said DeVoe of chants of "DeVoe must go" during the Gators' 83-63 loss to 
Mississippi at home Saturday: "I would have gone, but they didn't give me a 
destination." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Billy Kidd, silver, and Jimmy Heuga, bronze, in the slalom. 
</P>

Roy Williams hopes his second-ranked Kansas Jayhawks learned something, like 
how a 24-point lead can sometimes be a mirage. 
</P>
<P>
The Jayhawks' lead dwindled to six points before they put away Oklahoma State, 
83-76, Wednesday night in a Big Eight Conference game at Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very positive person," Williams said. "I'm not happy about it, I don't 
like it, but maybe it's good for us." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (23-1 overall, 6-1 in the Big Eight) had a 60-36 lead with 10:21 left, 
but Oklahoma State (13-8, 4-5) rallied to make it 75-69 with 2:16 remaining 
before the Jayhawks escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Mattias Sahlstrom and Byron Houston scored 17 points each for Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Arkansas 100, Texas Tech 77 -- Todd Day scored 22 points as the 
Razorbacks rolled past the Red Raiders for their 12th consecutive win in a 
Southwest Conference game at Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Huery and Lee Mayberry each scored 15 points for Arkansas (20-2, 11-0), 
which took control with 12 consecutive points for a 30-19 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Will Flemons had 16 points and 13 rebounds for Texas Tech (5-15, 0-10), which 
lost a school-record 11th consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
No. 5 Georgetown 97, Pittsburgh 81 -- Dikembe Mutombo scored 17 points, grabbed 
15 rebounds and blocked eight shots and the Hoyas took over the Big East 
Conference lead by defeating the Panthers at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo Mourning added 20 points and Mark Tillmon had 17 for Georgetown (18-2, 
8-2), which led by 18 at halftime and moved a half-game ahead of second-place 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Martin scored 27 points for the Panthers (9-11, 3-6), who had a 
three-game winning streak snapped. Pitt is 0-8 against Georgetown at the 
Capital Centre. 
</P>
<P>
No. 11 Louisiana State 82, Auburn 71 -- Chris Jackson scored a career-low nine 
points but big men Shaquille O'Neal and Stanley Roberts took over to lead the 
Tigers to a Southeastern Conference victory at Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-foot-1 O'Neal had 19 points and 10 rebounds for LSU (18-4, 8-3), while 
the 7-foot Roberts had 15 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Battle scored 29 points for Auburn (8-14, 4-7). 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Oklahoma 86, Iowa State 81 -- Skeeter Henry scored 25 points, including 
the go-ahead basket with 2:14 left, and the Sooners got past the Cyclones in a 
Big Eight game at Ames, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State (7-12, 2-5) had a chance to tie the game with five seconds left, but 
Doug Collins made only one of two free throws and the Sooners sank four free 
throws in the closing seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Victory Alexander scored 20 points for Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
No. 16 Georgia Tech 79, Wake Forest 70 -- Brian Oliver scored 31 points, 
including seven three-pointers, and the Yellow Jackets got an Atlantic Coast 
Conference victory at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Scott had 17 points for Georgia Tech (15-4, 5-4) despite a bruised 
shoulder, but he didn't hit a three-pointer for the first time in 70 games. 
</P>
<P>
Chris King scored 25 points for Wake Forest (8-12, 0-8), which lost its 10th 
consecutive ACC regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky 100, Vanderbilt 73 -- Derrick Miller scored 40 points, becoming the 
36th player in Kentucky history to reach the 1,000-point mark, as the Wildcats 
snapped a three-game losing streak against the Commodores in an SEC game at 
Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Miller sparked a 28-10 run with 16 points in the first eight minutes of the 
second half to give Kentucky (11-10, 7-5) a 74-46 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Wilcox scored 16 points for Vanderbilt (12-8, 5-6).

Clemson 75, Maryland 73 -- Elden Campbell scored 18 of his 20 points in the 
second half and the Tigers got an ACC victory over the Terrapins at College 
Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the third victory for Clemson (17-5, 5-3) in 21 years at Maryland's 
Cole Field House. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Martin scored 18 points for Maryland ( 13-9, 4-4). 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State 88, North Carolina 77 -- Rodney Monroe scored 22 points 
and the Wolfpack beat the Tar Heels at Chapel Hill, N.C., for the first time in 
14 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfpack (16-6, 5-3) broke the game open with a 13-3 burst that gave them a 
73-61 lead.

Laguna Beach (18-5, 7-2 in the league) trailed by two at the half, then went on 
a 15-4 run in the third quarter and led, 39-30, with less than half of the 
quarter remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But Trabuco Hills (15-8, 9-0) came back, using a half-court trap defense. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Tim Manning, who scored all six of his points in the fourth quarter, made 
a three-point shot with 3:30 remaining to give Trabuco Hills a 45-44 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach trailed by two with 15 seconds remaining, but Trabuco Hills' Khoa 
Tran made three of four foul shots when technical fouls were called on Dain 
Blanton for hanging on the Trabuco Hills rim and Laguna Beach Coach Ed Bowen 
for arguing the call. MARTIN BECK

Canyon High School played one solid half of basketball Wednesday night, but it 
was enough to take over sole possession of second place in the Century League. 
</P>
<P>
After playing to near perfection in the first half, Canyon turned its big lead 
into a 57-52 victory over Santa Ana at Canyon. The victory moved the Comanches 
a game ahead of the Saints with one regular-season game remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big, big win for us," Canyon Coach Steve Sabins said. "I thought we 
played an excellent game." 
</P>
<P>
For one half, anyway. The Comanches (13-10 overall, 6-3 in league) disrupted 
the Saints' offense early on by denying forward Chauncey Woolridge the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge came into the game averaging 17 points a game, but was scoreless in 
the first half Wednesday. He finished with 13 points, but made only four of 12 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Without Woolridge, the Saints appeared confused on offense. Octavio Medina was 
the only consistent player. He scored eight points in the first half and 
finished with 21. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana remained close until early in the second quarter, but was held 
scoreless for the final 6 minutes 5 seconds of the half. Canyon scored 11 
consecutive points during that span to take a 30-15 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We took Woolridge out of the game and held them to 15 points," Sabins said. 
"We can't play any better. That's as good of a half as anyone can play." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints, who had won four consecutive league titles entering the season, 
opened the game in a box-and-one defense in an effort to control Canyon's Kevin 
Wilborn. For the most part it worked. Wilborn, who averages 16 points a game, 
had only four at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
However, Eric Oliver picked up the slack. He scored 11 points in the first half 
and finished with 19. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill 61, Santa Ana Valley 43 -- Center Fred Amos scored 22 points and 
forward Mark Wilkinson added 20 points as Foothill won its ninth consecutive 
game. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena 46, Villa Park 45 (OT) -- El Modena's Gregg Gottlieb made a 
three-point field goal with less than 10 seconds remaining in regulation to 
send the game into overtime. He also scored four of the Vanguards' six points 
in overtime.

OCEAN VIEW REUNION TOO MUCH FOR EDISON

<P>
The starting five that some predicted would carry Ocean View High School to the 
Sunset League title was finally intact Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The reunion came too late for a league title bid -- Marina clinched a tie for 
the championship last week -- but Ocean View showed it will be a force in the 
5-A Division playoffs with a 67-56 victory over Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Center Marcel TenBerge played his best game since breaking a knuckle on his 
right hand prior to the opening of league play, scoring 14 points and grabbing 
nine rebounds. TenBerge had been ineffective since the injury but showed signs 
of a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (14-9, 6-3) had lost three of its past four games but made 11 of 14 
free throw attempts in the last quarter to hold off an Edison rally. Ocean View 
guard Greg Evans led all scorers with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
"This game was a revisitation to the lineup that we haven't seen since the 
beginning of the year," said Jim Harris, Ocean View coach. "I was very 
encouraged the last two days in practice and again tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Marina deserves the plaudits . . . they've done the job. But I think we could 
have been right there challenging for the title if Marcel hadn't gotten hurt. 
The playoffs will hopefully show what we could have been or should have been." 
</P>
<P>
Edison (16-8, 5-4) has been another disappointment in the six-team league 
despite an imposing front line that features center Bill Martineau, who has 
signed with UC Santa Barbara for next season. 
</P>
<P>
Martineau had 19 points and sophomore Brandon Jessie added 15 points, but point 
guard Tom Tyler fouled out without scoring and killed Edison's comeback bid 
when he received a technical foul following his fifth personal foul with 5:31 
remaining that turned the game around. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster 70, Huntington Beach 65 -- Westminster snapped a 17-game league 
losing streak with a good start and a strong finish. Guard Duy Nguyen scored 
all 11 of his points in the first quarter and teammate Mark Murphy scored all 
eight of his points in the last quarter to give the Lions (7-15, 1-8) the 
victory. Mustapha Abdi scored 17 to lead Huntington Beach, which fell to 9-14, 
2-7. 
</P>
<P>
Marina 65, Fountain Valley 63 -- Center Cherokee Parks scored 31 points and had 
12 rebounds as Marina (16-8, 8-1) clinched the league title. Parks made 10 of 
20 field goal attempts and 11 of 12 free throws. Mike Merli scored 23 points 
for Fountain Valley (11-12), which fell into a tie for third place with Edison 
at 5-4.

After 139 minutes of scoreless soccer, Ocean View High School broke through for 
a goal against Edison in a Sunset League boys' match Wednesday at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
Edison, the second-ranked team in the county, and No. 7 Ocean View had played 
100 minutes without a goal in their first league match. 
</P>
<P>
So when Peter Lak headed in a direct free kick by Greg Biggins in the final 
minute of the first half Wednesday, it seemed that that might be the winning 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
But Edison's Mike Hawks tied the score early in the second half on a pass from 
Brian Higgins and each team scored once in overtime. The final result was a 2-2 
tie that left the teams tied for second place with 5-1-3 records behind Marina 
(7-2 in league) with one match remaining, on Friday. Marina was a 2-0 winner 
over Fountain Valley Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (13-5-5 overall) scored first in overtime when Higgins set up Hawks with 
another assist. Ocean View (13-4-5 overall) tied it with near the end of the 
first 10-minute period, when Scott Bauer threw a pass from the sideline that 
Andrew Wind headed into the goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Was that a great game or what?" said Ocean View Coach Paul Kollar. "Back and 
forth, up and down the field. That was an outstanding game." MARTIN BECK

Gil Orta went two for three with two runs scored and two runs batted in to lead 
St. Mary's to a 7-4 victory over host UC Irvine in a nonconference baseball 
game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Orta had a two-run single to key St. Mary's three-run second inning and Randy 
Cooper and Mike Zanski had run-scoring singles in the seventh inning to lead 
St. Mary's (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
Cooper went three for five with two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Osmar DeChavez went two for four with one run scored and Brian Young homered in 
the fifth for host UC Irvine (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
Tom Shildemeyer was the winning pitcher and Bill Christ had the save. David 
Bladow (1-1) took the loss.

<P>
In nonconference men's volleyball:

LATTIMORE SAVES GRANADA HILLS ON A COLD NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Step right up, Aaron Lattimore, and try your luck. This is a cast-off carnival 
and it's your turn to throw the dart. Nobody else on the Granada Hills High 
team can hit a darn thing, so why not give it a shot? 
</P>
<P>
Off-guard Osiris Nalls? Off night. Point guard Jermoine Brantley? Pointedly 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
"When those guys aren't on, somebody has to step in," Lattimore said with a 
shrug. "I happened to be the one tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Lattimore was the one for the Valley's top-ranked Highlanders, scoring a 
career-high 29 points as Granada Hills rallied from a 10-point third-quarter 
deficit to defeat Taft, 73-69, in a North Valley League game Wednesday at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
Lattimore was inside. He was outside. He was everywhere. "He killed us," Taft 
Coach Jim Woodard said. 
</P>
<P>
Brantley, who had 19 points, made four of 18 shots from the field. Nalls was 
equally iced, making four of 12. Lattimore saved the day -- not to mention 
Granada Hills' share of first place in the league standings -- by connecting on 
12 of 17. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way it's been all year," said Granada Hills Coach Bob Johnson, 
whose team improved to 17-7, 8-1 in league play. "It seems like we have five or 
six guys who can step forward if someone else has trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Taft (13-10, 3-6) was trouble aplenty. James Yoakum -- who had 20 points, 10 
rebounds and eight assists -- made a three-point shot to give Taft a 51-41 lead 
with 5 minutes 35 seconds left in the third quarter. However, Granada Hills 
outscored Taft, 18-3, the rest of the quarter to take a 59-57 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Highlanders went cold as quickly as they had heated up. Brantley missed 
his first five shots of the fourth quarter -- in all, Granada Hills missed its 
first eight from the field -- before Lattimore knocked down a jump shot with 
5:30 left to tie the score, 61-61. 
</P>
<P>
With Granada Hills leading, 66-65, Lattimore stole the ball at halfcourt and 
converted the layup. Taft answered when Jason Deyoe (18 points) made a pair of 
free throws with 2:06 left to again trim the lead to one. 
</P>
<P>
With the Highlanders in a spread offense, Lattimore hooked up with Nalls on a 
give-and-go for a 70-67 lead with 1:40 remaining. Casey Sheahan's three-point 
attempt on Taft's next trip down the floor was blocked and Brantley made both 
ends of a one-and-one with 52 seconds left to clinch it.

HUNTER CLOSES IN ON HIS PREY; 
</P>
<P>
UNDEFEATED WESTLAKE SENIOR AIMS TO TAKE DOWN STATE WRESTLING TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Hunter couldn't endure much more of the torture. He sat helplessly, 
unable to lend a hand to his inexperienced Westlake High wrestling teammates as 
they twisted, squirmed, and struggled futilely. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter folded his arms, leaned back and glanced at the crowd sitting in the 
dim, stuffy Channel Islands gymnasium and enjoying a huge Raider lead. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he'd seen enough. Hunter stood, then paced behind Westlake's bench. He 
removed his sweats and stretched. Gradually, his pace became a stalk and his 
glance became a cold, bitter stare. His mind churned. Gotta drive. Ride. Take 
it to him. 
</P>
<P>
He slapped his face and arms repeatedly, until the skin turned red and numb. He 
looked at the scoreboard. Home 45, Visitor 6. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter stormed onto the mat, circled and continued to slap himself repeatedly. 
He stared into his opponent's eyes. The match was as good as over. 
</P>
<P>
Takedown, pin. Thirty-five seconds. As Hunter's hand was raised in victory, the 
public-address announcer cleared his throat: "The winner, Billy Hunter, 
Westlake." After a pause, he added, almost apologetically, "Hunter finished 
second in the state last year." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd exhaled as Hunter, with as many muscles as moves, returned to 
Westlake's bench. Channel Islands had secured the team victory but, once again, 
Hunter -- who developed his outstanding skills while growing up in Oklahoma, 
the wrestling capital of the nation -- provided the most outstanding individual 
performance. He had pinned his 17th opponent in 21 matches. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good one," Channel Islands Coach Rob Vieira said. Vieira, usually the 
raving, sideline-stomping sort, sat speechless as he watched Hunter. "He's good 
on his feet, he's a tough rider, he has a lot of experience. It's tough to 
adjust to him in six minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Even tougher in 35 seconds. But such is a day on the mat with Billy Hunter, 
considered one of California's finest wrestling prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Since the meet at Channel Islands, Hunter, a senior, has improved to 26-0 with 
22 pins. He was the most valuable upper-weight wrestler in tournaments at 
Newbury Park, Rosemead and Oxnard and in the El Camino Real Tournament of 
Champions, one of the biggest high school wrestling tournaments in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best I've ever had, and one of the best I've ever seen," Westlake 
Coach Larry Stonebreaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Stonebreaker has seen plenty of Hunter the past four years, he is 
tireless in his admiration for the wrestler who was ranked first in the state 
in the 175-pound division by a poll of coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real easy to do a lot of watching," Stonebreaker said. "You don't have to 
worry about him. You can just sit back and relax." 
</P>
<P>
Stonebreaker can justify his straw-hat, lounge-in-the-hammock attitude with one 
quick glance at Hunter's career record at Westlake: 113-17. Hunter was 40-3 
last season and lost, 1-0, to Katella's Joe Pastorello in the state final in 
the 175-pound division. Pastorello, who was 46-0 last season, was responsible 
for all three blemishes on Hunter's record. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was disappointing but not discouraging. Hunter's mere presence in the 
title match surpassed his expectations as a junior and left him ambitious for 
Westlake's first individual state title. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people might relax, knowing they can probably cruise the next year, but 
it pushed me harder," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter began his drive with a three-month freestyle season that led to the 
Junior Nationals at the University of Northern Iowa and the Cadet Nationals at 
Central Missouri State. He didn't place in the Junior Nationals but he beat 
state champions from Virginia, Minnesota and Texas and won the 165-pound title 
at the Cadet Nationals. He pinned five of six opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a great moment for me," Hunter said, looking at the picture that 
shows him atop the winner's podium. Hunter's bedroom is filled with nearly 50 
dusty plaques and trophies and more than 100 medals tucked away in drawers. Yet 
he quickly directs attention to the Cadet National memorabilia: the trophy, the 
picture, and the cardboard bracket of the 165-pound division that is affixed to 
the back of his bedroom door. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of great wrestlers there from all around the nation. It's a 
real big deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet not half as big as the hand Hunter was preparing to deal 175-pound 
wrestlers across California. 
</P>
<P>
His work last fall led to his rise to the top of recruiting lists across the 
nation. He lifted weights for at least an hour every night in his garage. He 
ran as many as six miles around the lake in Westlake Village. He even ran with 
Westlake's cross-country team for two weeks but left when his knees began to 
ache. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the hardest-working guys I've ever had," Stonebreaker said. 
"Sometimes we have to tell him to take it easy on guys in practice. He can hurt 
some of them." 
</P>
<P>
That strength also follows Hunter into a classroom. He carries a 3.33 
grade-point average and scored 1,120 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. His 
parents, Carolyn and Howard, expect nothing less. Once, when Billy wanted a 
part-time job, his parents informed him he already was employed. 
</P>
<P>
"His job was to get good grades and do well in sports," Carolyn said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter has completed the task and then some, and he will fulfill a family dream 
when he signs his name to a letter of intent at the conclusion of the season. 
He is interested in North Carolina State, North Carolina, William &amp; Mary, 
Lehigh, and Pennsylvania. William &amp; Mary Coach Bill Pincus, whose team is 
ranked among the country's top 25 teams by a poll of coaches, says Hunter is 
his program's top prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"He's good enough to wrestle anywhere in the country," Pincus said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the skills, the size, the athleticism, and he is very bright." 
</P>
<P>
That marquee billing developed shortly after Hunter won two Oklahoma state 
youth wrestling titles. He was a protege of a wrestling family that included 
Mike Brown (cousin) and John Savage (uncle), who both wrestled for the 
University of Oklahoma -- an NCAA power. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's success merited the purchase of a video camera that since has provided 
the family with a 30-tape library. It was one of the initial investments in a 
career that has cost thousands of dollars in camps, travel and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The Hunters sacrificed their summer vacation last year to invest nearly $2,500 
in Billy's freestyle season. They purchased a big-screen television at 
Christmas, in part to watch Billy's videotapes. The silver plate from the El 
Camino Real Tournament of Champions sits atop the set. 
</P>
<P>
"The TV was pretty much everybody's present," Carolyn said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Billy has visited three schools on trips financed in part by the 
frequent-flier mileage his father earns as a businessman with Occidental 
Petroleum Co. Despite Howard's busy travel schedule, he and Carolyn have missed 
only three high school matches between them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a wrestling family," Carolyn said. "We've invested more money than a 
scholarship will provide, but we look at this as more than a scholarship. It's 
been good entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter was equally thrilling on a football field, where he was part of the 
restructuring of Westlake's football program, but injuries limited his playing 
time and threatened his opportunity for a wrestling scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
He was co-captain of the freshman football team and started both ways as a 
sophomore and junior. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, his left pinky was nearly ripped from his hand when it was 
caught in another player's jersey during practice. After Hunter failed to put 
the finger back into its joint himself, he underwent surgery the next day and 
had pins inserted to keep the finger together. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he is a knuckle short. 
</P>
<P>
"That was like losing five players in one," said then-sophomore Coach Dan 
Houghton, now at Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Next season, as Hunter characteristically twisted and struggled for extra 
yardage against Buena, he was blind-sided and suffered an injured disk in his 
lower back. He never played again. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real hard sitting in the stands," Hunter said. "I kept thinking of what 
success I could have had out there, but I had to choose one and stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter has not looked back, nor has he been forced to. He has enjoyed enough 
success to please his family, which has difficulty awaiting Billy's next mat 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
"We do our best to take our time going to the matches," Carolyn said with a 
smile. "But we definitely can't wait too long." 
</P>
<P>
That's because Billy's matches usually are over before they begin. He stalks, 
gets those Roger Craig eyes -- and that's it. Call it a pin. Send the natives 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at it as a battle," Hunter said. "It's either you or the other guy, and 
the best man wins." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter has had that upper hand in all 26 matches this season. And he will take 
his burly chest and powerful legs back to Channel Islands on Saturday to defend 
his 175-pound title in the Marmonte League championships. 
</P>
<P>
Beware of The Look; it may be as fierce as ever. He's weary of these 35-second 
affairs and has state-title visions. 
</P>

ROYAL CLINCHES SHARE OF LEAGUE TITLE, 55-52

<P>
Royal High used clutch baskets from Chad Smith and Jared Byrne to cap a wild 
fourth quarter that featured five lead changes and hand host Westlake a 55-52 
loss in a battle for the Marmonte League title Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The win gave Royal (20-5, 9-2), which trailed by 11 points early in the third 
quarter, at least a share of its first league title since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake (13-9, 7-4), in the hunt for its first league title, fell to third 
place behind Simi Valley (16-8, 8-3). 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley, which defeated Thousand Oaks, 63-56, will travel to Royal on 
Friday in the final game of the regular season. Simi Valley must win to forge a 
tie and give the Pioneers a share of their fifth consecutive title. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 6-foot-5 senior who was hampered by foul trouble, hit a 15-foot jump 
shot to give Royal a 53-52 lead with two minutes left. After Westlake's B. J. 
Sena (15 points) blocked a shot and gave the Warriors possession with 19 
seconds left, Byrne immediately stole the ball underneath Westlake's basket and 
scored to give Royal a 55-52 lead with 17 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake called a timeout with 15 seconds left to set up a game-tying basket, 
but Dave Monheim's three-point attempt twice bounced from the rim with four 
seconds left. JEFF RILEY

CLEVELAND STAYS INSIDE TO ROUT KENNEDY, 82-56 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Kennedy High players will attest, there are but two things in the school gym 
that offer less give than the diamond-hard basketball court. But those objects 
are suspended 10 feet above the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy rims are a tad less forgiving than a drill sergeant with a 
migraine. 
</P>
<P>
Taking this into account, Cleveland brought its attack to point-blank range in 
a North Valley League game Wednesday night and used its frontcourt to blow the 
Golden Cougars away, 82-56. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything had to be precise. Bank shots were falling in and out," said 
forward Pat McCook, who came off the bench to lead the Cavaliers with 18 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland forwards Bobby McRae, Kayheed Murray and Brandon Martin contributed 
12, 12, and 13 points, most of which came in the paint. 
</P>
<P>
While the Cavaliers were crashing the boards, Kennedy was just plain crashing. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Cougars fell behind, 19-8, after the first quarter and 39-22 at 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got out of our game plan," Golden Cougar forward Garret Anderson said. 
"We don't have the team to run with them. Our plan was to slow them down." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was the one player Cleveland couldn't slow. He scored 33 points, 19 in 
the first half. Things must have gotten lonely for Anderson -- he was the only 
Kennedy player to score until Alan Johnson made a free throw four minutes into 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson hit three consecutive three-point shots within a minute in the third 
quarter to cut the lead to 47-36. The rally stalled, however, with 3 minutes 21 
seconds to play in the period when he picked up his fourth foul and was pulled. 
</P>
<P>
The performance was a vast improvement over Cleveland's last two -- a loss to 
Granada Hills and a one-point victory over Taft. Still, Coach Marc Paez wasn't 
beaming. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our rebounding was spotty," Paez said. "I'd say it was an 
improvement, but we're not where we need to be." 
</P>
<P>
The victory sets up a showdown between the Cavaliers and Granada Hills for the 
league title Friday at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Battle, who started for Cleveland last season but was ruled 
academically ineligible, returned and scored a point.

KENNEDY WINS SOCCER TITLE IN MATCH HALTED BY OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials stopped a soccer match at Kennedy High on Wednesday when the ejection 
of a San Fernando player caused teammates and spectators to rush onto the 
field. Kennedy won, 2-1, to clinch the Mid-Valley League title. 
</P>
<P>
Problems began after a disputed penalty kick by Brian Singer provided Kennedy 
with its winning margin with less than 10 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando's Jose Ochoa was given a yellow card for arguing the call. Minutes 
later, teammate Enrique Moreno was ejected. San Fernando players and spectators 
then came onto the field and the game was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
An official was kicked but was not injured. There were no confrontations 
between opposing players. 
</P>
<P>
"Bad officiating let the game get out of hand," San Fernando Coach Arturo 
Vasquez said. "The referee didn't let the kids express themselves. He ejected 
(Moreno) for no reason at all." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (12-2-1, 8-2) opened the scoring in the early minutes on a breakaway 
goal by Jeff Abrams. San Fernando tied the score late in the first half on 
Ricardo Coyt's penalty kick from 15 yards.

THE COLLEGES; 
</P>
<P>
TABLES HAVE TURNED AGAINST NORTHRIDGE SHOOTERS DURING LOSING STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes statistics can be misleading, but not those of the Cal State 
Northridge men's basketball team, which has lost four consecutive California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. games. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (9-12, 4-4) opened conference action with four wins and during that 
streak shot 56.3%, 32.3% from three-point range. Opponents shot 45.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, however, those numbers have turned around. In its past four games, 
Northridge has shot 39.2% -- only 19.4% from three-point range -- and the 
opposition has made 58.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The team's overall shooting slump pales in comparison to the problems of 
Derrick Gathers, the Matadors' leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who averaged 20.3 points a game on 41.1% shooting -- 36.7% from 
three-point range -- in nonconference play, made 52.2% of his shots and 
averaged 17.2 points in the first five CCAA games. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three, Gathers has averaged eight points while shooting 17.8% 
(eight of 45) from the field and 10% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no mystery why we're losing," Coach Pete Cassidy said after CSUN's 59-54 
loss to Cal State L. A. on Saturday night. "We're not hitting the open shots 
and we're not playing very good defense. . . . It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
CLU to CFL? Ken Whitney, an offensive guard on the Cal Lutheran football team, 
was not invited to the National Football League's scouting combine in 
Indianapolis last month, but he did attend a Canadian Football League 
evaluation camp in Toronto on Feb. 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Montreal and raised in Calgary, Whitney, 6-foot-4, 300 pounds, is an 
attractive player for Canadian teams because of his size and also because his 
status as a Canadian citizen would enable a CFL team to sign a U. S.-trained 
collegian without exceeding its quota of 16 U. S. players. 
</P>
<P>
At the camp, Whitney said he ran a 4.85-second 40-yard dash and did 30 
repetitions of a 225-pound bench press. 
</P>
<P>
While he still hopes to be selected in April's NFL draft, Whitney expects to be 
chosen when the CFL holds its draft Feb. 23 in Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
"They (scouts) just said the draft should go pretty well," said Whitney, who 
added that he nonetheless would wait until he knew of his NFL status before 
signing a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Hot uniforms: Antelope Valley's men's basketball game against College of the 
Desert on Saturday at Paraclete High was supposed to be a Marauder home game, 
but Desert came dressed in its home uniforms instead of its road colors. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley, which won, 128-105, was forced to return to the college to 
retrieve its road uniforms. It wasn't a mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Thomas, Desert's coach, blamed the launderer. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any road uniforms for about two weeks now," Thomas said. "We 
left them in the dryer too long and they melted into a ball." 
</P>
<P>
Spirited effort: With a 15-0 win over Antelope Valley, Mission, which has never 
made the state baseball playoffs, improved to 3-0. The Free Spirit has 
outscored opponents, 36-7. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good winter and are playing really well," said Mission College Coach 
John Klitsner, whose team finished 10-23 in his first season as coach. "But 
there is still a long way to go. We still have a lot of tests coming up." 
</P>
<P>
Mission will take its next exam, against Pasadena, today. 
</P>
<P>
No place like home: The Antelope Valley women's basketball team (17-6), seeking 
its first conference title in the school's 51-year history, is 6-0 in 
conference play at home. With a 66-60 victory over Desert on Saturday, Antelope 
Valley moved into a first-place tie with Desert for the Foothill Conference 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Still in contention: The Cal Lutheran men's basketball team is 5-17 overall, 
3-4 in NAIA District 3 play after a 78-72 loss at Biola on Tuesday night, but 
the Kingsmen still have a chance to make the seven-team district playoffs 
because of their ranking in the Dunkel Ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran was ranked ninth (30.4 points) in the district Dunkels -- a system 
that factors in strength of schedule, results against highly ranked opponents, 
win-loss records, and point differentials -- when the week started. 
</P>
<P>
With a game left against top-ranked Westmont (48.1), third-ranked Southern 
California College (45.2) and two against sixth-ranked Master's (40.3), the 
Kingsmen control their own destiny.

MT. CARMEL CONVINCES FALCONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrey Pines guard Bart Brandenburg didn't really know how to explain Wednesday 
night's 70-60 loss to Mt. Carmel, which may have ended the Falcons' two-year 
reign as Palomar League boys' basketball champs. 
</P>
<P>
But his coach, John Farrell, did. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a very good team," Farrell said. "The better team won. They're the 
class of the division." 
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked Mt. Carmel (17-4, 10-1) was better in almost every phase of the 
game, but especially in the first half, when it jumped to a 37-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel guards Mike Graves and Dana Pope and forward Bill Wootton did much 
of the damage. They forced Torrey Pines' guards, Brandenburg and Kyle 
Armstrong, into a handful of turnovers, most of which were turned into layups 
by the Sundevils. 
</P>
<P>
And when they weren't stepping into passing lanes, Graves, Pope and Wootton, 
and even center Shane Knight (two first-half points), were blocking or 
affecting many shots attempted by Brandenburg and Armstrong, who were just one 
for 10 from the field in the first half and scored but two points. 
</P>
<P>
In the teams' first meeting, they combined for 33. 
</P>
<P>
As a team, the Falcons were just six of 24 in the first half to Mt. Carmel's 15 
for 26. 
</P>
<P>
"Our man-to-man defense took them out of their three-point shot," said Pope, 
who finished with 13 points, five rebounds, five steals and a block." 
</P>
<P>
"Brandenburg, Armstrong and Carter Brown hurt us last time by penetrating and 
dishing off for the three," Mt. Carmel Coach John Marincovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Last time, Torrey Pines lost by two. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Torrey Pines (21-3, 9-2) never saw anything as good as a two-point 
deficit after the first two minutes. Mt. Carmel took a 5-4 lead, then ran off 
nine consecutive points and was never seriously challenged. A 24-point 
second-half lead was sliced to 58-49 with 6:10 left in the fourth quarter 
because of some sloppy passing against Torrey Pines' press. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, I don't know if we were getting some deja vu or what," 
said Marincovich, referring to the fourth-quarter fold in a 70-68 loss to Poway 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Wootton led Mt. Carmel, which last won the Palomar League in 1987, with 20 
points. Graves had 11, and Knight finished with 10 and five blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg led Torrey Pines with 15 points, and Bill Scheibe had 14. Armstrong 
finished with five on one-for-10 shooting. DAVE McKIBBEN

USD, winner of three in a row and seven of 10, is tied with Pepperdine for 
second in the WCC heading into two critical games in the Pacific Northwest. The 
Toreros defeated both opponents in San Diego last week: Gonzaga, 68-58, on 
Saturday and Portland, 76-55, on Thursday. John Jerome leads the Toreros in 
scoring (19.3) and rebounding (7.0). In WCC games, he is averaging 20 points, 
Pat Holbert 14 and Craig Cottrell 10.1. Holbert is second in the nation in 
three-point percentage at .559, behind Arkansas' Lee Mayberry (.563), and has 
made 27 of 31 free throws. Guard Gylan Dottin (broken nose) will be able to 
play for the first time in three games. Center Brooks Barnhard (ankle) is 
questionable. Gonzaga, loser of six in a row, is led by senior guard Jim McPhee 
(23.2 average), who had 26 against USD Saturday.

Ashton-Tate Corp.: The Torrance firm reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $1 
million, contrasted with net income of $13.4 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue fell 29% to $62.1 million. The maker of microcomputer software products 
attributed the results for the quarter and for fiscal 1989 to reduced revenues, 
and said a gain on the sale of its interest in Sybase Inc. was offset by 
writeoffs. For the year ended Dec. 31, the maker of microcomputer software 
products lost $28.6 million, contrasted with net income of $47.7 million in 
fiscal 1988, which ended Jan. 31, 1989. Revenue for the year fell 14% to $265.3 
million.

Liberty National Bank: The Huntington Beach bank posted record net earnings of 
$1.6 million for 1989, a 43% jump from the $1.1 million reported for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, net income dipped 1% to $424,897 from $429,546. The 
decline was the result of a one-time expense of $78,000 associated with the 
company's capital offering. Total assets rose 19%, to $137.2 million at the end 
of 1989, from $114.9 million a year earlier.

reported in the like quarter in 1988. Assets at the end of 1989 were $84.5 
million, up from $82 million in 1988.

<P>
Career change, like many other things, is something more people talk about than 
act on. 
</P>
<P>
Marguerite Eliasson, however, didn't just leave a career, she leaped from it. 
She went from a lifelong big-city environment of pollution and congestion to 
the pristine tranquility of the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't an easy job. 
</P>
<P>
E. A. Ranches is a large but little-known thoroughbred farm near Ramona, and 
Eliasson runs the place, a million-dollar spread in the original sense of the 
term. 
</P>
<P>
You could say she led the horse to water and made him not only drink, but enjoy 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Eliasson, who was born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in Reseda in the San 
Fernando Valley, had always been around horses. Still, except for those moments 
in the saddle, her life was pretty much citified. 
</P>
<P>
"I did solid secretarial work," she said one recent winter morning while 
helping ranch owner Ernest Auerbach conduct a tour. "I was 16 years at an 
electronics company in Van Nuys, then went to San Diego as executive secretary 
to the vice president of corporate development for Oak Industries in 1979. I 
quit to come here." 
</P>
<P>
A friend in Ramona, where Eliasson had a saddle horse stabled, told her about 
the job. She was happily employed and had not been looking for other work, but 
such an adventure must have been in the recesses of her mind. "I never 
hesitated. And my boss said I was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
But Eliasson never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1980. The job opening was for office work on this 1,000-acre farm that 
focuses on the training, boarding and breeding of racehorses. 
</P>
<P>
Auerbach, 73, of Pacific Palisades, is a developer in real estate and 
construction. "When she came here to apply, I told her she was overqualified 
and would have to work for practically nothing," he said. "Marguerite said, 
'Well, how much?' I told her. It was about half what she was making." 
</P>
<P>
Smell that fresh air. Hear that silence. 
</P>
<P>
She took the job. In June, 1985, the manager left. Auerbach named Eliasson to 
replace him. 
</P>
<P>
"Now she makes more than I do," Auerbach said. 
</P>
<P>
Eliasson had management experience from her two principal jobs before moving to 
E. A. Ranches, and she had taken classes in animal husbandry in college, but 
her promotion still lifted eyebrows and evoked more than an occasional caustic 
comment within the fraternity that is the thoroughbred industry. Said Auerbach: 
"When I told some people in the business that I was hiring a woman for ranch 
manager, they said I was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't flinch. 
</P>
<P>
"Marguerite's working out well. She is clear-thinking and conscientious. Women 
have a good feeling for horses. Marguerite can look across the pasture a 
quarter of a mile away and know if something's wrong with a horse. If a 
person's good, they're good." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged, however, that women as managers of thoroughbred farms in the 
West "are absolutely in the minority." The combination is anathema in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"You read about women running a nice farm," Auerbach said, "but usually they 
own the place." 
</P>
<P>
Eliasson knows all that. But she keeps a tight rein on her goals and gallops 
ahead grittily. Besides, she said, she has not encountered any face-to-face 
resentment, and "the possibility of it doesn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
If a male manager wanted to, however, he could be jealous of three of 
Eliasson's innovations. 
</P>
<P>
When she took over, yearlings were broken and sent elsewhere for the next step 
in their training. 
</P>
<P>
"But they'd return with sore shins," Eliasson said. "So Sherri (Songer, an 
exercise rider) and I would jog them on the trails every day for 30 to 40 
days." 
</P>
<P>
The ranch has nearly three miles of trails, both level and hilly. This workout, 
Eliasson said, gives a young horse stamina and experience at being around new 
sights. It also develops bones and soft tissue. Now all yearlings get their 
trail rides with Songer, an Escondido native, and with trainer Dan Southworth, 
who was born in Chula Vista. Eliasson and Songer, whom Eliasson hired, help 
give the ranch a strong 1-2 female combination. Dan was hired away from the 
prestigious San Luis Rey Downs complex. 
</P>
<P>
Another innovation was bringing in a nutritionist, something Eliasson did 
within weeks of becoming manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I had liked the looks of the weanlings and yearlings at Anvil Ranch in the 
Santa Ynez Valley," she said. "I found out about their nutritionist and brought 
him in." 
</P>
<P>
He was Gordon Wooden of Santa Ynez. He changed grain rations and added 
supplements, such as mineral blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the improvement the very next year," Eliasson said. "Each year the 
(weanlings and yearlings) look better." 
</P>
<P>
Next, with one dry winter following another and the water bill for the pastures 
spiraling ever upward, she contacted Walter Graves, a farm adviser with the UC 
San Diego Extension. 
</P>
<P>
Eliasson wanted to know what to plant in the pasture that would require little 
water. Graves recommended a mix of annual rye and three types of clover. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a conservation award as a result," Eliasson said. "He's great. This 
year has been a problem because of wind and lack of rain." 
</P>
<P>
Another big change was the installation of an oval training track -- 
five-eighths of a mile of dark, rich running surface consisting of a mix of 6 
inches of sand, 6 of topsoil and 3 of fine bark. Rick Fontana, who found out 
about the Auerbach spread when he installed the rails for the track, liked the 
ranch so much he has sent several of his thoroughbreds to board there. 
</P>
<P>
"Some trainers call this ranch the best-kept secret around," said Auerbach, who 
started slowly and has not done much trumpeting. He hopes to soon, however, in 
races at the Santa Anita race track and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Auerbach bought the ranch in 1977 and brought in four Kentucky-bred broodmares, 
his first venture into racing except as a longtime fan and spectator. He now 
owns several thoroughbreds in Kentucky, plus breeding shares in the stallions 
Greinton, holder of the third-fastest mile run in history, and Green Dancer. 
</P>
<P>
He planted 1,000 trees at the Ramona spread -- alders, cedars, peppers, 
redwoods, birch and camphor -- on property already wealthy in live oaks and in 
one of the grandest stands of manzanita in San Diego County. He had it fenced, 
put in the pastures, expanded its lake and constructed several buildings, 
including a huge barn that houses his numerous antique cars and 100-year-old 
horse-drawn wagons and carriages, a collection for which he plans to build a 
museum so he can donate the entry fees to charity. 
</P>
<P>
"This was like the Old West when I bought it," Auerbach said. "The trees keep 
it rustic, as natural as possible. I love it. It's my Utopia." 
</P>
<P>
He owns cattle ranches at nearby Santa Ysabel and Sutherland Dam, plus others 
in Hemet and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Lisa, live in the main house for two weeks each month. The 
view from the front porch is of sleek young thoroughbreds grazing and 
caracoling in well-kept, beautifully fenced pastures. The broodmare barn across 
the way resembles a Moorish mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Counting weanlings, yearlings, runners and broodmares -- some owned, some 
boarded -- plus Stancharry, a home-owned stallion and multiple-graded stakes 
winner, the ranch is home to 175 thoroughbreds, and growing. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of personal satisfaction out of seeing the horses broken and 
trained," not to mention living in the country, said Eliasson. The addition of 
the training track made the operation complete. Now she and the others can hope 
for some big winners, perhaps even realize every horseman's dream: a runner in 
the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Auerbach said. "That's my big dream -- everyone's big dream -- in this 
business." 
</P>
<P>
He knows, of course, how long the odds are. "Man makes plans and God laughs," 
he will tell you. But he is having fun trying, and he is trying assiduously. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have everything going here," he said, "and expect to have a very good 
year. I'm very happy with the way Marguerite and the staff are running the 
place."

ARCHITECTURE: DESIGN OF BRANCH LIBRARIES ADDS PAGES TO CITY'S HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During 10 years as city librarian, Bill Sannwald has quietly helped the city 
build a small architectural legacy in the form of its branch libraries. As 
director of the San Diego city library system, he has worked on the remodeling 
or construction of 11 branches, and designs for five new branches look 
promising. 
</P>
<P>
Architects who have worked with Sannwald uniformly praise his open-minded 
attitude towards design. They say he hires good architects and trusts their 
judgment, admirable behavior in a client. 
</P>
<P>
In an age when so many diversions compete for the public's attention, Sannwald 
realizes that distinctive libraries may be the best advertisement of all for 
books and reading. He has helped elevate libraries to admirable neighborhood 
symbols in many San Diego neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really got a lot of drive. He's given us free reign," said architect 
Wally Gordon of Bradshaw/Bundy &amp; Thompson, designers of the Otay Mesa 
branch, completed in 1986. It won an Honor Award, the highest recognition, from 
the local American Institute of Architects chapter last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He understands architecture," added architect Manuel Oncina, who's designing a 
new branch for Pacific Beach. "Some of the buildings he's initiated are very 
nice. San Diego is sort of conservative, and architects have a hard time 
getting interesting buildings built, but he has initiated a program that has 
tapped some of the more controversial or avant garde-types." 
</P>
<P>
Among them is architect Rob Quigley, whose Linda Vista branch library design 
has given the heart of a low- and middle-income community an optimistic new 
focus. Not only did the branch receive a Merit Award from the local AIA chapter 
in 1988, but it was one of a very few San Diego projects published in recent 
years in the national trade journal Progressive Architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between Quigley's design and the Otay Mesa project illustrates 
the broad-mindedness of the library's construction program under Sannwald. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Vista's new branch is unashamedly avant garde, an aggressive, angular 
building of unusual materials. Two large metal frames fly from one end of the 
building to support a perforated metal screen (missing due to a windstorm), 
designed to filter light before it passes through a large bank of windows into 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
Sannwald especially likes the interior, where a ramp rises gradually through 
the stacks towards a reading area, a children's reading room features windows 
at a height only children can appreciate, and wood beams sprout like branches 
from round, trunk-like concrete columns to support the roof. 
</P>
<P>
The Otay Mesa branch is unusual in a different way. Its sawtooth forms serve 
both as a strong visual presence and a practical way to bring in natural light 
while preserving privacy. Glass panels on the back sides of these teeth face 
north; the roof is a light color to help bounce light inside. 
</P>
<P>
Aisles radiate from a round circulation desk, giving librarians clear view 
between the stacks, a key to good security. Sawtooth forms used on the street 
side of the building make it a visual magnet compared with the mundane 
condominiums and shopping center nearby. 
</P>
<P>
From the start of his career, Sannwald seemed destined to influence the 
architecture of libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"The first job I had out of library school was building a library in 
Libertyville, Ill.," he said. He has chaired the Architecture for Public 
Libraries Committee for the American Library Assn. and spent five years as a 
pipe fitter. 
</P>
<P>
As city librarian, his involvement with architecture ranges from having a 
prominent voice in the city's selection of architects to working with community 
groups to determine what sort of building residents want. 
</P>
<P>
Sannwald has helped the library system develop a 70-page "program" for a 
standard 10,000-square-foot branch, which tells architects much of what they 
need to know to begin design work. 
</P>
<P>
Additional information comes from the community. On some projects, the 
architects find themselves working within narrow tastes. Many communities want 
to stick with the status quo; they want buildings which blend in rather than 
stand out. 
</P>
<P>
In La Jolla, for example, community planning group members requested a building 
that would fit in with the existing neighborhood in both appearance and scale. 
The resulting new branch, designed by architect Roy Drew and opened last year, 
isn't as striking as some of the more progressive branches. 
</P>
<P>
For residents of Scripps Ranch, Gordon and his associates from Bradshaw/Bundy 
&amp; Thompson recently completed design work on a mission revival building, 
based on community sentiment toward the 19th-Century Meanley ranch house, an 
important piece of local history. A clay tile roof, walls of light-colored 
stucco and arched arcades are in keeping with this style. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Penasquitos wants a Spanish-inspired branch, so architect Gene Cipparone 
of CLEO Architecture worked with what he calls modified mission style: smooth 
stucco walls with deep-set windows, a flat roof instead of clay tile. Cipparone 
hopes to use a dark rose sandstone color on the exterior to set the branch 
apart from the light-colored shopping center buildings next door. 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Penasquitos and Scripps Ranch libraries are among five branches up 
for state construction funding this year, Sannwald said. Other communities 
hoping for new libraries are Point Loma, North City West and Pacific Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Beach's branch, designed by Oncina for the site of Farnum Elementary 
School, could be one of the city's most interesting. The school buildings will 
be replaced with a branch library in a park setting. 
</P>
<P>
The design might be described as modern Mediterranean with organic overtones. 
The roof of the half-round main building fans out from a central tower, like 
petals of a flower. At ground level, the different sides of the building will 
have simple, forceful geometries. A wedge-shaped public plaza will link the 
building with the park. 
</P>
<P>
If there's a lesson to be learned from Sannwald, it is that good architects are 
both artists and capable professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of hiring a bunch of "yes" men and women, clients in both the private 
and public sector could get more interesting, functional buildings by turning 
such original thinkers loose on their projects. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring first-rate architects instead of "design-build" contractors is the only 
way corporate clients like the Radisson and Ramada hotel chains will improve on 
the mediocre architecture they've recently foisted on downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
As for Sannwald, his greatest challenge might be just ahead. He expects San 
Diegans to vote next fall on a proposed bond issue for a new 
375,000-square-foot downtown main library. This would replace the existing 
144,000-square-foot building that Sannwald acknowledged as the city's "biggest 
. . . and ugliest."

SOCIETY: SOMETHING NEW ADDS A TWIST TO SOMETHING OLD

<P>
Radical sentiments and the Charity Ball are as uneasy in one another's company 
as herring and chocolate mousse, and many of the 980 guests at "Swing Into the 
'90s" may have been surprised and even scandalized by the revolutionary changes 
they encountered upon entering the Hotel del Coronado Grand Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
Among the radical innovations at Saturday's version of San Diego's 
longest-running and most traditional event were the introduction of dance cards 
and boutonnieres, which may have been taken for granted at the ball's inception 
in the first year of the Taft Administration (1909), but vanished as the event 
evolved through wars, the Great Depression and ensuing societal changes. 
</P>
<P>
Even more startling was chairwoman Barbara Brown's decision to replace the 
playing of "The Blue Danube," the official "chairman's dance" that has always 
marked the formal opening of the ball, with "Serenade in Blue." 
</P>
<P>
Brown stoutly defended this departure from tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made a lot of changes tonight; this is a new Charity Ball for the '90s," 
she said. "I changed the chairman's dance because a lot of the young people 
don't know how to waltz." 
</P>
<P>
Brown may have challenged some of the bedrock foundations of the Charity Ball, 
but she said her intention was to focus the event on its beneficiary, 
Children's Hospital and Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
"My theme this year emphasizes that this ball is for Children's Hospital, and I 
think that's been lost sometimes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her theme was expressed rather literally by the two bands, Columbus and the 
Bill Green Orchestra, which played a lot of "swing" music and even offered rock 
'n' roll and Hank Williams. The decor celebrated youth through a life-size 
reproduction of the ball's logo, a swing-borne child heading for the stars, and 
the entertainment featured the Music Machine from Bonita Vista High School, 
which burst into the room in a flash of sapphire sequins and raw energy. 
</P>
<P>
The spotlight focused most tightly on the hospital when Ernest Rady, chairman 
of the board of trustees, took the stage to inform the audience of a major 
capital campaign that will be formally introduced to the public in several 
months. The hospital intends to build a new emergency room and a 114-bed wing, 
and, in addition to seeking $35 million from federal and state sources, it 
hopes to raise $20 million in contributions from the residents of San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such innovations as dance cards (annotated to allow engagements to 
waltz, fox trot or rock 'n roll), various Charity Ball constants prevailed. The 
most important of these was the guest list, replete with the names of the 
city's oldest families and very representative of the San Diego Establishment. 
Many of these individuals occupied the ringside "boxes," or wedge-shaped 
seating arrangements that replace the round tables used at most events and are 
a Charity Ball institution, in many cases having been held for generations. 
</P>
<P>
This audience makes the Charity Ball unique among San Diego fund-raisers for 
more than the apparent reasons. The ball is one of the larger annual earners, 
but the relationship it maintains between the community and Children's Hospital 
is far more important than the funds it raises. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people stay involved with Children's because of the Charity Ball," said 
hospital President Blair Sadler. "The ball has a longstanding commitment to 
Children's, and every year it reminds leading San Diegans about the hospital's 
role in the community." Sadler emphasized the event's relationship to the newly 
announced capital campaign by adding, "Tonight, we're alerting the leadership 
of San Diego to our needs." 
</P>
<P>
The Charity Ball program remains a classic of its kind, and many of those who 
called time out from the dance floor turned eagerly through its 222 pages. A 
sort of yearbook that keeps track of growing families through full-page 
photographs, the program also is thick with words of encouragement from 
prominent businesses. A reminder of the Navy's role in San Diego appeared on 
Page 49 in the form of a photograph of the amphibious transport dock Cleveland, 
whose officers and crew raised $5,000 for the ball and were represented on the 
scene by Capt. Richard Cloward. Page 41 carried a message that read "Best 
wishes from the shareholders of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric." However, 
Southern California Edison, which has maintained a conspicuous presence at many 
San Diego bashes since it instituted its bid to acquire SDG&amp;E, was 
conspicuously absent from this most Establishment of events and did not 
advertise in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Anne Marquis co-chaired the ball, and the committee list, as always, ran 
to the greatest length of any in the year. Among its principal members were 
Joanne Stevenson, Marie Collura, Pam Palisoul, Nancy Bayer, Chrissie Brannen, 
Debbie Daley, Marilyn Cleator, Grace Cherashore, Carolyn Waggoner, Richel 
Khoury, Christine Friel, Jo Murphy, Vangie Burt, Allison Tibbitts, Carol 
Dickinson, Grace Allen and Ruth Mulvaney. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included the Robert Adelizzis, the Craig Starkeys, the James 
Robinsons, the Douglas McColls, the Dean Blacks, the Steven Porters, the Edgar 
Herveys, the Michael Alessios, the Howard Busbys, Georgia Borthwick with Tom 
Fleming, Justine Fenton, the Hugh Carters, the Judson Grosvenors, the Dallas 
Clarks, the George Gildreds, the William Newberns, the Robert Sedlocks, the 
Daniel Larsens, the Philip Whites, the Frederick Links, the Philip Gildreds, 
the Milton Chevertons, the Robert Callicotts and the Charles Bielers. 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO -- At least a few of the 2,500 attendees at the "1990 Chocolate 
Festival," given Friday at the Sheraton Harbor Island as a benefit for the 
Voices for Children Auxiliary, must have gained an insight into what it feels 
like to be a chocolate truffle. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly intoxicating scent of chocolate so pervaded the Champagne and Grand 
ballrooms that purveyor Michel Malecot said: "After a while, the smell of all 
this chocolate goes to your head. It's a kind of osmosis." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, few took breaks while making the rounds of the dozens of booths set up 
by local chocolatiers and pastry shops and by major national concerns. KyXy 
Radio and Big Bear Markets co-sponsored the fund-raiser; proceeds will support 
the Voices for Children program, which recruits and trains volunteers to serve 
as special advocates for children who have been made wards of the court system. 
</P>
<P>
The mounds of candies, cookies and pastries provided all the visual stimulation 
that seemed necessary, but the committee aided the project by decorating the 
rooms in a "Victorian Valentine" theme. "We wanted people to feel relaxed while 
they overdosed on chocolate," explained co-chair Pam Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
General chairwoman Karen Nugent kept her distance from the booths. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on a really strict exercise and diet regimen, and I'm not about to 
blow it," she said, though she admitted to having sampled one sweet. "That one 
was to die for," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Munak oversaw a related, higher-ticket event in a partitioned corner of 
one ballroom that was provided with a pianist, champagne and tables laden with 
the extravagant efforts of some of the city's best pastry cooks. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight is sweet because it's helping my kids," said Munak, who added that 
boxes of pastries would be taken later that evening to the Food Bank and the 
Hillcrest Receiving Home. 
</P>
<P>
The committee included Betty Mabee, Karen Cohn, Jadzia Goulet, Lynn Mabee, Mag 
White, Judith Harris, Julie Sarno, Virginia Napierskie, Ann Martinet, Pat 
Cunningham, Charlotte Roberts and Julie Maiorano.

JACK SMITH: GOING STARRY-EYED IN THE PRESENCE OF LUMINARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People never seem to forget their chance encounters with celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
As a journalist, I have met more celebrities than chance would have put in my 
path. I know the feeling one has of being in the presence of someone who seems 
bigger than life. 
</P>
<P>
Most celebrities today are celebrities because we see their images on the 
screen, large or small. Before TV, they were indeed larger than life, and when 
we saw them reduced to life size, and three-dimensional, they suddenly seemed 
magical. 
</P>
<P>
Actually we know very little about celebrities as real people. Unless they take 
their politics public, as have Jane Fonda, Ed Asner and Martin Sheen, we know 
nothing of them beyond the characters they play. 
</P>
<P>
The supposedly true stories about them in celebrity magazines do little to make 
them real. 
</P>
<P>
Only when their posthumous biographies appear do we learn that they abused 
their children, or were promiscuous, or were tightwads, or neurotics or 
monsters on the set. 
</P>
<P>
But when we meet them we are tongue-tied. We can only stammer out how much we 
love their work, which may or may not be true. I have never heard anyone boast 
that he has told a celebrity, "You're a lousy actor and a worse person." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps we miss our gods. The Greeks and other ancient peoples had gods who 
were indeed bigger than life. Because they intervened in human affairs, people 
were obliged to placate them. 
</P>
<P>
Some people have failed to exploit their chance meetings with celebrities and 
forever regret their lost opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Charles T. Fisch of Redondo Beach regrets that he passed up a chance to shake 
hands with John F. Kennedy at Anchorage Airport in the summer of 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Fisch thinks he might have been inhibited by a story he had heard about a 
grocery clerk's chance encounter with Woodrow Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
While traveling through a small Midwestern town, Wilson dropped into a shop to 
buy some fruit. The clerk did not let on that he had recognized the President, 
explaining later that the President had not introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that's class," Fisch says. 
</P>
<P>
Today, of course, if the President expresses an urge to drop into a shop, the 
Secret Service goes apoplectic. Standard procedure would be clear the shop of 
shoppers, sweep it for infernal devices, subject the clerk to a security 
clearance and depopulate the sidewalk outside. 
</P>
<P>
Gladwin Hill, who must have met many celebrities as a correspondent for the New 
York Times, recalls that he not only encountered Katharine Hepburn in a hotel 
elevator in Washington, but she may have saved his life, or at least kept him 
from being bruised. 
</P>
<P>
Hill says he tried to get into the elevator when the door was closing. A 
passenger inside grabbed the door and forced it back. 
</P>
<P>
"Only then did I discern that my rescuer was Miss H." Hill breathed his thanks. 
"Anything more seemed presumptuous. However, I have reflected on that old 
Chinese maxim that if you save a man's life, you are forever indebted to him. 
I've never tried to collect." 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Spear Merles of Costa Mesa recalls that she was painting a landscape in 
the Hidden Hills when a man rode up on horseback. She knew he was Ronald 
Reagan, but she didn't let on. 
</P>
<P>
The man told her they were going to turn Mulholland into a four-lane highway. 
</P>
<P>
"This from the man who later said that if you saw one redwood you had seen them 
all!" 
</P>
<P>
Novelist Dan Brennan says that during World War II he met the cynical British 
novelist Evelyn Waugh in a London GI club and asked him why he always treated 
the lower classes as a subspecies. Waugh walked away (treating Brennan as what 
he evidently thought he was). 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Furth says her encounter with Cary Grant will last her a lifetime. It was 
in the Magic Castle in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
There were not enough seats and Grant suggested she sit on his lap. She did. 
She does not say how old she was at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me," she reflects, "that true 'stars' like Cary Grant have a 
higher energy, a faster vibration, and are able to cast a glow at no expense 
while still maintaining their distance in the galaxy." 
</P>
<P>
I might feel that way, too, if I'd ever sat in Katharine Hepburn's lap.

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: GRANNY'S TOASTER MAY BE HOT ITEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I inherited my grandmother's General Electric toaster, which I think 
goes back about 80 years. It's kind of weird looking, with exposed heating 
coils and wires. Does it have much value? -- P.B. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: If it's a GE toaster with a removable warming rack, it could be worth 
in excess of $100 to a collector. 
</P>
<P>
For that price, however, most collectors want the appliance to work and to be 
in top condition. Your particular toaster model was patented by GE in 1908. 
</P>
<P>
Other toasters marketed by GE and its competitors in subsequent years may be 
worth upward of $50, again depending on condition, according to dealers and 
collectors. 
</P>
<P>
But don't let these prices scare you away. This is still a great area for the 
collector searching for a nostalgic piece of American history at 
bargain-basement prices. Collectible appliances frequently turn up at garage 
sales and flea markets. After you've removed the dirt, you may often discover 
that, for just a few dollars, you've acquired a valuable collectible. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, electric appliances were not immediate hits with the American 
consumer. Although such appliances were widely publicized as a result of their 
display at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, they didn't appear to catch on with 
the public until a few years after the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, years after the Chicago fair, all-electric kitchens began to 
proliferate in urban areas. But the nation's rural regions kept to the old ways 
and didn't seek electric appliances in any great quantity until after World War 
I. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the early electric appliances -- hot plates, irons, coffee makers and 
the like -- were simply constructed, which meant that they were relatively easy 
to keep in good repair. 
</P>
<P>
That's why collectors usually insist that to be considered valuable 
collectibles, electric appliances should be in working condition. 
</P>
<P>
An exception to this rule occurs when collectors need spare parts and, 
therefore, purchase non-working appliances for repair purposes. As far as 
replacing worn-out electric cords, most old appliances used a standard-sized 
cord that can still be bought in hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
Much in demand by collectors of electric appliances are the original boxes in 
which they were packaged and, if they survived, instructions and manufacturer's 
guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
Congratulations to Ada Fitzsimmons on the 10th anniversary of her always 
informative and interesting Paper Pile Quarterly (Box 337, San Anselmo, Calif. 
94950; $10 a year). 
</P>
<P>
In her winter (January) issue, Fitzsimmons printed her 1990 list of paper 
collectible items that appear to have appreciation potential: 
</P>
<P>
* Older magazine and newspaper articles on the subject of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
* Women's sporting events (1920s and later). 
</P>
<P>
* Advertising posters for magazines (starting with the year 1900). 
</P>
<P>
* Rapid transit pass stubs (dated between the 1920s and 1960s). 
</P>
<P>
* Wedding and bridal memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
* Women's image as portrayed in magazine advertising (between 1870 and 1960).

YOUR COINS: ARTS GOLD MEDALLIONS LAY AN EGG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have a number of Grant Wood and Marian Anderson medallions. How do 
I determine their value? These medallions are not mentioned in any of the coin 
magazines. -- W.N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You've brought up a very interesting -- and in some ways mysterious -- 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
When the U.S. government decided to dabble in bullion coinage, it did so with 
the ill-fated American Arts Gold Medallions series. This well-intentioned 
project was designed to honor outstanding Americans in the arts. The first year 
of issue, 1980, honored the artist Grant Wood with a one-ounce gold medal and 
the singer Marian Anderson with a half-ounce gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Acceptance was only moderate. The public bought 312,709 Grant Wood medals and 
281,624 Marian Anderson medals. The program limped along the next year with 
one-ounce medals for Mark Twain (116,371) and half-ounce medals for Willa 
Cather (97,331). In 1982, Louis Armstrong was honored with the one-ounce medal, 
which sold 409,098 copies, the highest in this series. There were 348,305 Frank 
Lloyd Wright half-ounce medals sold. 
</P>
<P>
Poet Robert Frost (390,669) and artist Alexander Calder (74,571) were honored 
in 1983. The program ended ungloriously in 1984 with actress Helen Hayes 
(33,546 one-ounce medals) and author John Steinbeck (32,572). 
</P>
<P>
I don't know why this worthy series didn't gain public acceptance. Undoubtedly, 
some of the lower mintages will eventually be worth a premium. Your medals are 
from the first year of issue and basically trade as bullion pieces. You can 
find price quotes occasionally in the classified advertising section of Coin 
World. You might also be able to locate some interested dealers at some of the 
larger coin shows. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a Japanese 1 yen silver coin. People who read Japanese told me it is 
of the Meiji Dynasty. How do I know whether it is genuine? How much is it 
worth? How do I find a buyer? -- U.K.W. 
</P>
<P>
A: You'll probably be able to identify your coin in the Standard Catalogue of 
World Coins by Krause and Mishler. Also, many dealers handle such pieces. A few 
phone calls should put you in touch with an interested dealer. From your 
description, your coin is probably worth about $50. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am curious as to the value of my coin. It's about 3/16 of an inch thick 
and looks like it's made out of copper. On one side is the name Britannia, 
1797, and on the other side is the name Georgius III D:G Rex. -- R.U. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your coin is British. Depending upon the denomination, it's in the $10 to 
$25 range. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coin Calendar 
</P>
<P>

LEGAL VIEW: HEARING SET ON ATTORNEY DISCIPLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Bar Assn. is holding a hearing in downtown Los Angeles Saturday to 
find out what the public thinks about attorney discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers have taken a lot of heat in the past couple of years. One of the 
biggest complaints from consumers has been the way in which lawyers are -- or 
are not -- disciplined when they do something incompetent or unethical. 
</P>
<P>
In California, only the Supreme Court can order the disbarment of a licensed 
attorney. The court makes its decisions based on the recommendations of the 
State Bar of California, which investigates complaints against lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics have complained that lawyers should not judge other lawyers, and 
the State Bar has been under pressure to improve its disciplinary procedures. 
Recently, for example, a State Bar Court was created. Staffed by full-time 
professionals, it hears disciplinary and regulatory issues involving lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
So if you've had a bad experience with a lawyer, Saturday will be your chance 
to complain publicly and ask for changes in the disciplinary process. 
</P>
<P>
But if you have never had a bad experience with a lawyer, or even if you've 
never had any experience with a lawyer, there are always things you can do to 
improve the chances that any future lawyer-client experience will be a valuable 
one -- for both of you. 
</P>
<P>
First, select an experienced, trustworthy, decent, hard-working, ethical, 
reasonable, intelligent attorney. Sound easy? Sure it does. Actually, there are 
plenty of them. That first decision, if done correctly, could save you a lot of 
headaches. I've written in the past about how to find a good lawyer, so I won't 
belabor the issue this week. 
</P>
<P>
Next, understand the relationship with your lawyer. And get it in writing. 
</P>
<P>
"Lawyers sell legal services," explains HALT, a Washington legal reform group, 
in its manual "Using a Lawyer." "It is your money, your property and your 
rights that are at stake. It is your responsibility to choose a lawyer 
carefully (and) to keep yourself informed about your case. As with any 
purchase, you would have the right to expect value for your dollar and to hold 
the seller to the terms of the purchase contract." 
</P>
<P>
The most common disputes between a lawyer and a client involve fees. What do 
you do if your fee is too high? The State Bar publishes a pamphlet by that very 
title. (For a free copy, write State Bar Pamphlets, 555 Franklin St., San 
Francisco, Calif. 94102.) One thing you can do is take your dispute to 
arbitration. Most local county bar associations sponsor special fee arbitration 
panels to decide disputes. 
</P>
<P>
It is also best to be an informed client and understand clearly the type of fee 
that the lawyer is charging. There are basically three types of fee structures: 
hourly, flat, and contingent. 
</P>
<P>
The first one is simply an amount billed per hour of work performed. Not too 
different from a plumber. A flat fee is usually charged for relatively routine 
matters such as a simple will, an uncontested divorce, or a bankruptcy filing. 
Make sure you understand precisely what is included in the price. 
(Legal-service plans usually charge a basic fee and include certain designated 
services, but charge for further consultation.) 
</P>
<P>
The contingency fee can be the most complicated and is probably the most common 
fee consumers encounter, because it is often used in personal-injury lawsuits. 
You pay the fee out of what you win. If you win nothing, you pay nothing. If 
you win something, you pay an agreed-upon percentage. Some lawyers offer a 
sliding scale and charge a lower fee if they settle the case out of court. 
</P>
<P>
If you decide to hire a lawyer and are considering a contingency arrangement, 
estimate your costs. If the lawyer would wind up receiving substantially more 
than he would with an hourly rate, try to negotiate a lower percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, before you even talk to a lawyer, there are certain things you can 
do to save yourself some money. HALT, the legal reform group, advises that you 
first contact the other person involved or the insurance company to see how 
much you will be offered directly, without a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Then ask several lawyers to estimate how much you might win, and how many hours 
it will take. Figure out how much you'll take home after paying the lawyer, and 
if the offer without a lawyer is better, settle on your own. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like good advice to me. And, by the way, if you want to attend the ABA 
hearings Saturday, they will be held from 1-4 p.m. at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, 
711 S. Hope St., Los Angeles.

YOUR WHEELS: NEARLY EMPTY TANK IS A DIRTY DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: The carburetor on my Toyota recently became plugged up with dirt. The 
mechanic asked if I was driving with my gas tank nearly empty. I was astounded, 
because I had in fact been driving almost on empty. He claimed that it is much 
easier to draw up dirt into the fuel system when the tank is nearly empty. Do 
you agree? -- M.M. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: After a number of years, almost every fuel tank becomes a repository 
for a certain amount of dirt. It usually settles down to the bottom and stays 
there. What little contamination is disturbed is usually filtered out by one of 
several filters inside the fuel tank or just before the carburetor. 
</P>
<P>
But if fuel filters were infallible, then nobody would ever get a plugged 
carburetor or a fouled fuel injector. When a gas tank is near low, there is a 
greater chance for the dirt on the bottom of the tank to be disturbed. The gas 
tends to slosh around the tank more. And with less gas in the tank, the amount 
of suspended contaminants is greater in concentration. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts suggest it is a good practice to not allow the tank to go below a 
quarter full. It makes some sense. On the other hand, if you have badly 
contaminated gas or a contaminated tank, you are going to have problems even if 
you keep the tank full at all times. So, it might help a little bit to keep the 
tank from going nearly empty. 
</P>
<P>
Another benefit is that you'll be less likely to run out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a 1980 Chevrolet Malibu with a problem in the speedometer cable. 
There is an intermittent clicking sound that causes the speedometer needle to 
vibrate. Removing the entire dashboard is quite a job. Would it be feasible to 
drill a very small hole in the cable close to the fire wall and take a 
hypodermic needle and inject light oil into the cable? 
</P>
<P>
A: I bet it will not work, but if you fail, what have you lost? The problem is 
that even the smallest drills will leave you with a fairly large hole, and 
drilling the hole on the round cable will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
The other problem is that speedometer cables are lubricated with grease and a 
light oil is not going to do the job well or for very long. It's likely that 
your speedometer is going to become addicted to regular injections of light 
oil, not a pleasant way to spend Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I drive a lot of miles, but mostly on the freeway. I have over 100,000 miles 
on my 1981 Honda Accord, and my mechanic has been pestering me to replace the 
struts. But I think they're just fine. Is it possible for struts to last that 
long? -- N.A. 
</P>
<P>
A: It is unlikely for struts to last that long, the experts will tell you, but 
you have to make the decision based on an inspection and the performance of the 
struts on your car. Struts are essentially shock absorbers mounted on a spring, 
performing the same job as old-fashioned shock absorbers. 
</P>
<P>
You can determine if your struts are shot by looking for oil leakage on the 
strut cylinders, excessive bounce in the car's suspension, a rolling sway on 
turns and by unusual-wear patterns on your tires. It is best not to wait until 
you have ruined a set of tires with bad struts, but with careful observation 
you should know the proper time to replace the struts. 
</P>
<P>
If most of your miles are put on in highway driving in a warm climate, you are 
exerting the minimum amount of wear and tear on all types of mechanical systems 
on your car, including the struts. The mechanic may want to sell you struts 
before you really need them.

'PERFECT PARTY' DOESN'T QUITE FIT THE BILLING

<P>
Tony wants to give a perfect party, and nothing will stop him. 
</P>
<P>
He'll forget the protestations of his wife and two friends who feel pressured 
by the need to be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
He'll spurn the threat of losing his career as a professor. He will gird 
against the slings and arrows of the vampish New York critic who will judge 
just how perfect this party is for millions of poison-pen-loving readers. 
</P>
<P>
Tony is not just another society column statistic. He is the driving force in 
A. R. Gurney's wickedly satirical "The Perfect Party," produced by the San 
Diego Actors Theatre at the Elizabeth North Theatre through Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Tony's determination to party memorably is reminiscent of Gurney's playwright 
alter ego, who wanted to write memorably in "The Cocktail Hour," the Old Globe 
premiere that concluded a successful off-Broadway run last year and is now 
headed to London. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Actors Theatre, one of San Diego's talented homeless companies, 
throws its all into trying for a perfect production of "The Perfect Party." 
It's not quite that, but it does star one near-perfect performance by Brian 
Salmon as Tony. He alone captures the core of anxiety that makes his obsession 
so comically real. The rest of the five-member ensemble ranges from capable to 
skillful milkers of the premise, coming off as "Saturday Night Live" performers 
in a minor Gurney skit. 
</P>
<P>
There's no shortage of laughs under Walter Schoen's direction, but the 
simplicity of its satire is less interesting for its own sake than for the way 
it provides a blueprint for Gurney's later, more sophisticated work. 
</P>
<P>
Both "The Perfect Party" and "The Cocktail Hour" are dipped in the ink of a 
playwright who has been trying for years to prove to himself and the New York 
critics that he, as an all-American WASP, actually has something to say. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Gurney has cast himself as a WASP version of Philip Roth, 
writing "Gurney's" rather than "Portnoy's Complaint." 
</P>
<P>
Just because a WASP has a trust fund doesn't mean he can't have an inferiority 
complex about his cultural importance and a sexual fixation -- which is more 
anger than lust -- for the group that tends to reject him. In Tony's case, the 
group that rejects him is represented by Lois, the New York critic he seduces 
under the guise of being his own evil twin brother. 
</P>
<P>
The New York critics were consistently unkind to him for years, Gurney said in 
an interview just before "The Cocktail Hour" opened in New York. "Sweet Sue" 
and "Another Antigone," warmly received here, closed quickly after being 
savaged by New York critics. 
</P>
<P>
While Gurney communicates a desire to please critics, he also longs to prove to 
his family that they aren't being put on stage just to be laughed at and 
embarrassed. "The Perfect Party" and the newer, more polished "Cocktail Hour" 
have this in common. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cocktail Hour" was, of course, lavishly reviewed, as was the subsequent 
"Love Letters" -- all of which makes one wonder just what sort of angst Gurney 
will write about now. 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Helton's costumes in this "Perfect Party" are lovely, but one wishes 
that the clothing for the New York critic, played by Patricia Elmore, could in 
some way reflect her predatory nature. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanly designed production -- the elegant set by Barth C. Ballard and his 
simple lighting -- enhances without distracting. It keeps the emphasis on the 
show -- which is ostensibly about the need to relax and go for imperfect 
gatherings around the old bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
But what it really seems to be about is the question Gurney never answers here: 
why he worries about what the critic will say in "The Perfect Party" just as he 
worries about what his family will say in "The Cocktail Hour." 
</P>
<P>
If Gurney's recent successes help him stop worrying about what others will say, 
that might pave the way to a different kind of Gurney play. This one ends with 
the beginning of an imperfect party. Maybe someday Gurney will show us that 
party in progress. 
</P>
<P>
This "Perfect Party" may be witty and diverting, but its shallow humor leaves 
you, like Tony's guests, wishing for the imperfect party to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"THE PERFECT PARTY" 
</P>
<P>
By A. R. Gurney. Director is Walter Schoen. Lighting and sets by Barth C. 
Ballard. Costumes by Ingrid Helton. Sound by Michael Shapiro. Stage manager is

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: A THREE-DAY JAZZ SESSION FOR 
DYED-IN-THE-WOOL FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Jazz musicians grow weary of the typical smoky night club setting, where 
clinking glasses and well-oiled voices frequently drown out clear-headed 
improvisations. So when San Diegan Bill Muchnic produced his first San Diego 
Jazz Party in 1988, modeling it after Dick Gibson's popular Denver Jazz Party, 
players were overjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
Muchnic died last November after getting the planning for this weekend's party 
at the downtown San Diego Marriott well under way. His wife, Beverly, though 
not a dedicated musician like her trumpet-playing husband was, is an equally 
enthusiastic fan. She has taken over the production of the event. 
</P>
<P>
By charging $135 for a pass to the three-day event, and limiting attendance to 
500, the party assures that audiences consist entirely of appreciative 
aficionados, on hand primarily to listen. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians jump at the chance to play. Once again, an all-star cast has been 
lured to town. This year's cast is headed by bassist Milt Hinton, who is being 
honored during his 60th year in jazz and his 80th in life. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup also includes pianists Paul Smith, Ralph Sutton and Dick Hyman; 
trombonists George Masso, Dan Barrett and Al Grey; drummers Butch Miles, Gus 
Johnson and Jackie Williams; tenor sax men Flip Phillips, Plas Johnson and 
Tommy Newsom; alto saxists Marshal Royal and Chuck Wilson; bassists Hinton, Bob 
Haggart and Jay Leonhart; guitarists Bucky Pizzarelli and Howard Alden; 
clarinetists Kenny Davern, Bob Wilber and Ken Peplowski; and trumpeters Ed 
Polcer, Randy Sandke and Spanky Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The format is a series of jam sessions led by various players. Songs are 
selected spur-of-the-moment. This can be risky business if the players aren't 
"on," but the risk often results in spontaneous combustion. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when the sparks start to fly," Pizzarelli said. "You get a group of 
guys that really hit it off and it gets very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Pizzarelli, 64, has recorded several albums, both as a leader and as a sideman 
to several jazz greats, most notably Benny Goodman, beginning in the late '60s. 
He also has a reputation as a top studio player. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges the influence of pioneering jazz guitarist Charlie Christian 
but says he's more interested in finding fresh harmonies and chord combinations 
than in Christian's sax-like strings of notes. 
</P>
<P>
Hinton has found his own fountain of youth, supplying the snappy, swinging bass 
lines on budding saxophonist Branford's Marsalis' critically acclaimed newest 
album, "Trio Jeepy." 
</P>
<P>
He believes such collaborations between jazz legends and up-and-coming players 
are essential to keeping jazz alive. 
</P>
<P>
Young musicians like Marsalis and his brothers Wynton and Delfeayo come to 
Hinton in search of jazz history. 
</P>
<P>
"They come over to my house researching Chu Berry, or Ben (Webster) or Coleman 
(Hawkins). I'm one of the few left who knew them. They call my basement the 
tap. Ben Webster used to live here in a little apartment and we used to sit 
down and jam and tape it. So I play my tapes for them." 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Hinton made his first music video with Marsalis. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it. It's nice to have good luck enough to be around to see the great 
progress being made by young musicians, especially bass players. I'm glad I'm 
going instead of coming. I wouldn't want to run into any of them. They make me 
look like I'm standing still." 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in hearing more about the life and times of Hinton can 
purchase a copy of "Bass Line: The Stories and Photographs of Milton Hinton," 
published last year by Temple University Press. 
</P>
<P>
The jazz party includes 25 different sets with various combinations of 
musicians, Friday and Saturday nights from 8 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.; and Sunday 
from noon to 6:30. The room will be set up "cabaret style," with tables and a 
floor for dancing. 
</P>
<P>
The RUSE Performance Gallery at 447 Fifth Ave., in downtown San Diego continues 
to present excellent alternative jazz, the stuff you won't hear in clubs or 
concert halls. Friday and Saturday nights at 8, Marimba (Mike) Madundamela, 
a.k.a. Bryan Jackson, will combine assorted percussion instruments including 
marimba with modern digital tape processing and slides of nature and primitive 
art to take listeners on an original musical odyssey titled "People of the 
Lake." The second half of the evening will feature a variety of music, with 
Madundamela joined by fellow musician Zopilote. A demo tape indicates 
Madundamela leans more toward natural acoustic sounds than electronic 
gamesmanship. The music is ethereal and evocative and should go well with the 
images. 
</P>
<P>
With his own band The Cradit Union, saxophonist Rod Cradit plays "country club 
music" for a living. But this Sunday night from 6 to 10 at the Salmon House 
restaurant on Mission Bay, Cradit will join fellow sax man Gary LeFebvre for 
some serious straight-ahead jazz. Cradit plans to lean heavily on baritone sax, 
especially on several of his favorite Gerry Mulligan tunes. Cradit and LeFebvre 
have an excellent rapport, with LeFebvre taking the melodies while Cradit adds 
harmonies. They'll be joined by pianist Bob Hamilton, bassist Tom Azarello and 
drummer Barry Farrar. 
</P>
<P>
RIFF: San Diego's Fattburger gets a page in the January issue of Jazziz 
magazine. About the band's newest album "TimeWill Tell," Michael Gam writes, ". 
. . on the title track (guitarist Steve) Laury displays some snappy, Eric 
Gale-type rubber bands. (Singer Carl) Evans' Wonderisms shine on the song 
"Golden Girl," which he also sings. His "Oh, Girl" is a very smooth 
urban/contemporary ballad."

Lights, Camera . . . Cue the Speaker: Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said the 
single line he speaks in Francis Ford Coppola's upcoming "Godfather III" is 
"sufficient for my (movie) debut." The San Francisco Democrat spent a long 
weekend in Rome doing a scene with Al Pacino. Brown was hired when Coppola told 
the actor originally chosen for the part of a black politician, "Why can't you 
act more like Willie Brown?" and then demanded: "Get me Willie Brown!" Asked if 
his career is following the reverse course of an actor named Ronald Reagan, 
Brown replied, "If I could be as successful, I wouldn't mind it." CLAUDIA PUIG

TWO ONE-ACT PLAYS BY LOCAL WRITERS DEBUT; BOTH FADE TO BLACK 
</P>

The Orange County Coalition of the Theatre Arts is premiering two one-acts by 
local writers -- the first centers on a woman's introspection on the eve of her 
suicide, the second attempts a little jocularity (!) on the eve of a man's 
execution in the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Mills' "The Measurement of Arbitrary Momentum," despite structural flaws 
(and a self-conscious title), is the more ambitious playlet. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Paisley Yankolovich, "Momentum" begins with 50-year-old Veronica 
(Harriet Gold) announcing that soon she will commit suicide. From there, we 
meet Veronica at two stages in her life, as an insecure but scrappy young 
intellectual (Jan Kennedy) and a disappointed middle-aged writer (Conni 
Stiegemeyer) fretting about her stalled career and stalled marriage. 
</P>
<P>
She complains and reflects and cracks wise while a small troop of her men 
(Robert Blankenship, Rudy Salazar and Wayne Sherwood) add wry comment. Everyone 
is dressed in black, so you know this is serious stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, "Momentum" does try to put Veronica's Angst before us in emotional 
and thoughtful ways. Mills stumbles, however, in making the one-act come 
together as a smooth-surfaced whole. His ideas are fuzzy and scattered -- a 
honing of the imagery and some discriminating editing, especially concerning 
the significant but vague turning points of Veronica's life, could bring it 
into focus. 
</P>
<P>
The title of Katherine Rock and W.A. Rock's "Old Sparky" (directed by Steve 
Wilber) comes from the nickname that executioner Mr. X. (Philip Seitz) has 
given his beloved electric chair. That's sort of funny, and it gives you an 
idea of where this little number is going. 
</P>
<P>
While the beer-gutted Mr. X. sloppily prepares for the execution of Eldridge 
Greenapple (Xan Martin) that evening, Greenapple himself faces the big sleep 
with punchy wit, a fair degree of blather, and a large dose of humanism. He may 
have murdered a drug dealer, but drug dealers are bad guys, so we're suppose to 
feel sympathy for him and his vigilante act. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the final moment comes and, amid some goofy sound effects and splashy 
it's-the-end-of-the-world! lighting by Felix Cisneros III and Andy Rose, we 
learn whether this well-intentioned killer cheats death . . . and the state. 
</P>
<P>
The acting in both plays was often uneasy on opening night Friday, but Paisley 
Yankolovich did make an impression with his aggressive portrayal of the 
"anarchist" in "Momentum," and Martin brought a soft humor to Greenapple in 
"Old Sparky." 
</P>
<P>
A last note: Friday's audience numbered no more than 10, which has to be 
discouraging to the coalition and other small groups thinking of staging new 
works. The encouraging thing is that Steve Wilber, one of the coalition's 
founders, says his troupe will continue to produce original material from 
regional playwrights, no matter what the community support. Up next are two 
more one-acts scheduled for April. 
</P>

Hammer Teams with HBO on Miniseries: Russian history in the 20th Century will 
be the subject of a 10-part fictional HBO miniseries set to be co-produced by 
industrialist Armand Hammer, whose interest in and influence in the Soviet 
Union has spanned several decades. 
</P>
<P>
The project, tentatively titled "Mother Russia" and set to air in 1992, will be 
based on fact. Historical events will provide the backdrop for its focus on 
individual fictional lives. It will be filmed entirely on location in the 
Soviet Union, with pre-production scheduled for this fall and shooting to start 
in February, 1991. CLAUDIA PUIG

King Doesn't Rule the Ratings: ABC's new "Elvis" series drew surprisingly low 
ratings for its debut Tuesday night. Premiering in the coveted slot behind the 
top-rated "Roseanne," the show about the King's early years in rock n' roll 
captured a 24% share of viewers. 
</P>
<P>
That left it in second place at 9:30 p.m. behind NBC's "In the Heat of the 
Night," which drew a 25% share of the audience for that half hour. The CBS 
miniseries "Family of Spies" garnered a 21 share between 9:30 and 10. Elvis' 
rating represented a significant drop from Roseanne's 33 share and was less 
than the 27 share which ABC's "Coach" averages in the same time period. "Elvis" 
will debut Sunday in its regular 8:30 p.m. slot. CLAUDIA PUIG

STAGE WIRE: WARM WASHINGTON RECEPTION FOR 'STAND-UP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Stand-Up Tragedy," Bill Cain's play about hope and despair in a Manhattan 
Catholic boys' school, follows its Mark Taper Forum premiere and its successful 
run at Hartford Stage with yet a third new setting at Washington's Arena Stage. 
The reviews are heavily weighted in favor of director Max Mayer's vision of the 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
The production, critic Bob Mondello of City Paper says, may not be as 
"emotionally affecting" as the first two stagings, but it "roars, jokes, and 
screams at the top of its lungs." He calls it "breath-catchingly theatrical," 
and says, "your body isn't likely to unclench for hours afterward." 
</P>
<P>
"Stand-Up Tragedy" is an "eminently right presentation," according to Chronicle 
Express' Lou Robinson, that is "powerful and satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
Two dissenters: B. Whitney Wyckoff of the Broadside objected to the "excessive 
foul language" and thought the play "a bit too long" and "emotionally 
draining." The Washington Times' Hap Erstein said the evening "seemed to be a 
repetitious tape loop" but liked "dazzling staging techniques and impressive 
performances," particularly the "mesmerizing young Luis Ramos" in the juvenile 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The general tone of the reviews was captured by the Washington Post's David 
Richards, who felt he'd had "an exceptional theatrical experience." Commenting 
on the play's "vitality" and "blinding energy," Richards pinpointed Mayer's 
direction -- "his restless, relentless staging suggests a Jackson Pollock 
action painting in the making." 
</P>
<P>
A FINE MESH: The networking of regional theaters goes on. Hartford Stage's 
production of Corneille's "The Illusion," which closes tonight, was directed by 
Mark Lamos, who was assisted by Los Angeles director Brian Kulick, who directed 
"Illusion" at New York's Perry Street Theatre last year and was supposed to 
direct Corneille's comedy-fantasy in the last slot of Taper, Too's last season 
until it was postponed to make room for the first production of "Stand-Up 
Tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Hartford continues the Los Angeles connection on March 30 with the East Coast 
debut of Jo Carson's "Daytrips," which premiered last fall at the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
THE MUSIC MAKERS: Creators of musical theater who have recently found 
commercial (and nonprofit) production costs an insurmountable hurdle are being 
given a running start through a new "for-profit" organization called New 
Musicals, the inspiration of director Harold Prince and producer Marty Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Based in two theaters at State University of New York at Purchase, the 
"laboratory" will provide full productions of new works by experienced musical 
theater authors, with the object of sending them on to either Broadway, the 
regional theater circuit or the international market. The project's partners 
include Capital Cities-ABC Inc., Columbia Artists Management Inc. and Jujamcyn 
Theatres; they have anted up close to $10 million for the first season. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to help the shows make money for writers and directors so they can stay 
in the theater," Bell told Variety.

OUT OF SITE: An item in Morning Report last week suggested that plans to 
reconstruct Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in South London, a safe 350 yards from 
the original site, might be halted. Not so, says Sam Wanamaker, who heads the 
Shakespeare Globe Center project. Research at the original Globe site, which is 
necessary to complete the reconstruction, has been delayed briefly because 
exposure to air might damage the original foundations (they're already under a 
historic "listed" late Georgian building). But "excavation" by either radar or 
other advanced techniques will proceed in two to three weeks to uncover the 
design specifications that are necessary for the reconstruction to continue, 
says Wanamaker.

At the top of the ad for "The Living Room," which continues at the Wilshire 
Ebell through Sunday, is a large picture of Shelly Garrett. Then the copy 
begins: "Shelly Garrett's Living Room. It's . . . Shelly Garrett's new 
comedy-drama stage play. If you saw Shelly Garrett's 'Beauty Shop,' hey! Wait . 
. . wait until you step into his living room!" 
</P>
<P>
Would you assume from this that Garrett wrote "The Living Room" -- or that he's 
in it, or even that it's about him? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong on all counts. Charles Michael Moore wrote the play that is now called 
"The Living Room." It was initially produced with the title "Love's Light in 
Flight," in Chicago and two smaller cities. Another producer brought the play 
to Los Angeles last year and changed the title -- with Moore's permission. Only 
after the Los Angeles production was underway did Garrett take over as 
producer, said Moore, talking by telephone from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not crazy about the fact that my bio is not in the program," said Moore. 
But he said he had a good business deal with Garrett, and "as long as the 
business end is taken care of, I don't have an ego problem (with the 
downplaying of his own credit)." Moore added that he has been paid for working 
as assistant director on the show, and he expects to receive an author's 
percentage (he wouldn't reveal the size of his cut), "but I won't see any real 
money until it starts recouping its investment." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investors in another Garrett production, the touring "Beauty Shop," 
have replaced Garrett as general partner in the enterprise, according to an 
attorney representing the limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
The limited partners contend they have not received an accounting of their 
investment -- and most of them maintain they have not received any return from 
it. Last year five of them filed a suit against Garrett in Los Angeles Superior 
Court, and seven others have since joined the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
According to attorney Gene Harter, 31 of the 40 limited partners met Monday and 
voted to replace Garrett with Sylvia White (who performed in "Beauty Shop" in 
1987-88 and became a limited partner in 1988) as general partner. Harter said 
the vote was unanimous, except for abstentions from Garrett's parents. The 
re-organized partnership will now attempt to gain access to the production's 
bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Garrett nor his attorney could be reached for comment. But White said 
the limited partners had received letters from Garrett last month, announcing 
that he was dissolving the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
LATC PARKING: Parking at Los Angeles Theatre Center last weekend was an ordeal. 
Two weeks ago, the lot in back of the theater was closed, as construction began 
on a new parking garage that won't open until next fall. The loss became quite 
apparent over the weekend, as all four theaters in the complex were lit up for 
the first time since the lot was closed. Cars backed up in front of the theater 
even more than usual, and curtain times were delayed. 
</P>
<P>
But "the problem will resolve itself this weekend," said LATC'S Bill Bushnell, 
as two additional lots on the east side of Spring St. between 4th and 5th, one 
block north of the theater, open for LATC business. A security guard who 
formerly was posted at the back of the theater will now be stationed at 5th and 
Spring to assist pedestrians walking from the new lots. Bushnell also pointed 
out that a little-known lot is also open across Spring St. from the theater, at 
the Alexandria Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
On another LATC matter, Bushnell and managing director Robert Lear said they 
welcome the city council's requirement that the Community Redevelopment Agency 
reports within 90 days on plans for the next five years of LATC-related 
spending. The proviso was added as an amendment to the council's approval on 
Friday of $350,000 in CRA money for LATC. Bushnell and Lear said the five-year 
plan is something that they would have to do anyway. 
</P>
<P>
SCR PLAYWRIGHTS: Mark Lee of Los Angeles is the winner of South Coast 
Repertory's second California Playwrights Competition. His winning entry: 
"Pirates," a fantasy drama about two women -- a repressed academician and a 
feminist graduate student -- who draw inspiration from swashbuckling female 
pirates in their clash with male faculty. Lee, whose "Rebel Armies Deep Into 
Chad" opens at the Old Globe in San Diego March 3, won $5000. 
</P>
<P>
Runners up -- receiving $2500 apiece -- are Shem Bitterman for "The Ramp" and 
Robert Daseler for "An Office Romance." All three plays will be presented as 
either productions or readings at the California Play Festival in May. About 
300 plays were submitted to the competition. 
</P>
<P>
AT PCPA: A translation of Ibsen's "Ghosts" by Jerry Turner, artistic director 
of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Ore., is the most noteworthy 
item in the repertory of the upcoming Theatrefest at Pacific Conservatory of 
the Performing Arts, in Santa Maria and Solvang. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's translation was introduced at Ashland in 1988. Also on the PCPA 
season: "Little Shop of Horrors," "A Chorus Line," "Much Ado About Nothing," 
"Guys and Dolls" and "The Importance of Being Earnest." 
</P>
<P>
The season begins previews on June 14 and extends until Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO REP: A new Amiri Baraka play, "The Life and Life of Bumpy Johnson," 
is the highlight of the San Diego Repertory Theatre's recently announced fifth 
season. Featuring an original score by Max Roach, "Bumpy Johnson" is the tale 
of a gangster who helped fund the Harlem Renaissance. It will open in December. 
</P>
<P>
Also coming up at the Rep, beginning in June: Latins Anonymous, Ariel Dorfman's 
"Widows" (which will first be seen at the Mark Taper Forum, opening May 31), 
Lanford Wilson's "Burn This," Joe Orton's "Loot," Tennessee Williams' "A Lovely 
Sunday in Creve Coeur," Shakespeare's "Cymbeline" and "A Christmas Carol."

Mustard is one of my favorite condiments, a romance going back to the days when 
deli clerks in my neighborhood in Manhattan smeared a spicy, semi-brown type 
similar to Gulden's on franks and hot pastrami sandwiches. I have not seen, 
smelled or tasted that particular brown spicy mustard since. Not even from a 
Gulden's jar. 
</P>
<P>
I remember the old, stooped waiters at Ratner's dairy restaurant. Their vests, 
bow-ties and white coats were covered with mustard markings, like so many 
khaki-colored pigeon droppings. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't do much for the appetite, but it reminded me to rush over to Katz' 
Delicatessen on Houston Street, where one could buy homemade mustard and the 
best pastrami sandwiches in town. 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager I was introduced to hot Chinese mustard, the kind that shoots 
quickly to the sinuses the way horseradish does. In those days, Chinese 
restaurants served tiny saucers filled with squirts of catsup and mustard for 
dipping egg rolls. The idea was to keep the catsup and mustard separated lest 
they turn a muddy red you wouldn't use for paint, much less eat. 
</P>
<P>
Then along came Dijon mustard and the world changed. By this time I had started 
cooking things from Dione Lucas' Cordon Bleu Cooking School repertoire, in 
which French mustards (Dijon, Meaux, Orleans and Bordeaux) often figured. I 
particularly remember a mustard butter Lucas often used with herring or 
mackerel; it was made with both French Dijon and English hot mustards. I used 
it with all kinds of sausages, on sandwiches and in salad dressing. I put it on 
my grilled chicken, steak, lamb chops and pork chops. Everything and anything. 
</P>
<P>
In France, the term for mustard (moutarde, from mout ardient, meaning piquant 
must) is reserved for mustard paste obtained only from brown seeds (Brassica 
juncea, of the type originating in Africa, India and China) and black seeds 
(Brassica nigra, which are also native to Europe and the Middle East). These 
seeds, unlike the white seeds (the most bitter and pungent of all), contain 
myronate and myrosin, the essences that give mustards their piquancy when 
crushed in the presence of water or vinegar. English mustard consists of a 
mixture of black and white mustard seeds ground into flour with turmeric added. 
</P>
<P>
Mustard is one of the most ancient spices known to man. Early Egyptians chewed 
on seeds as a complement to meat, and Greeks appreciated its medicinal 
properties. It has been used for thousands of years in both Africa and China, 
where the seeds are grown, and Christ immortalized mustard seeds when he spoke 
of the power of faith. 
</P>
<P>
The ancient Romans Pliny and Terence wrote that slaves crushed mustard seeds in 
mortars and turned it into a thick paste by adding wine vinegar, much as people 
do today. Roman conquests introduced mustard to Gaul in the 15th Century, where 
a mustard-making guild was instituted. Today it's manufactured around the world 
with formulas differing from manufacturer to manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Larousse Gastronomique reports that in the 18th Century a Dijon manufacturer 
called Naigeon prepared a strong, white mustard to coincide with the winter 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
In Bordeaux the mustard seed is mixed with unfermented grape must (mout); in 
Dijon, the capital of Burgundy, considered the greatest mustard-producing 
center in France, the seeds are mixed with verjuice (unriped green fruit juice) 
and white wine, and in Meaux the preparation is made with vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
The word Cremona was first uttered in my memory by Celestino Drago, of 
Celestino Ristorante, who explained what mostarda di Cremona was all about. 
Italians translate mostarda di Cremona (named after the place in Lombardy where 
this mustard product derives) as mustard, but it looks more like chutney. 
Cremona is actually made from candied fruits macerated in a sauce that contains 
mustard and is generally served with grilled or roasted meats. Drago uses the 
mustard as a flavoring for pumpkin-filled tortellini. The Italian mustard can 
be purchased at most well-stocked Italian grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
Dutch and German mustards are a novelty not to be passed up. They need easing 
into, especially if you're not accustomed to the bitter taste and drab color of 
some types. But eating Dutch Marne brand mustard, for instance, with 
jerooktewurst, a traditional Dutch sausage, was a treat of treats, introduced 
to me as a child by a neighbor who would bring over a care package of Dutch 
goodies, including smoked wurst with mustard, dark rye rojjeberood (a dense 
brown bread), and potato-meat croquettes called kroquette -- a full meal in a 
deli basket. 
</P>
<P>
Mustards come not only from jars. People actually concoct their own flavors and 
types to go with all manner of hot and cold meats, sandwiches, salad dressings 
and the like. One such mustard is Champagne mustard, now an old Dosti family 
standby thanks to a friend who once served it with baked ham at a Christmas 
party. She makes the mustard herself and often gives jars of it as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
If you are thinking of making your own mustard, here is a rundown of 
characteristics of mustard, courtesy of the American Spice Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Powdered mustard is often called flour, which is an FDA designation standard. 
The husk of the seed is removed by milling and the heat is finely ground. 
Mustard flour is usually a blend of Oriental brown and yellow seeds. Ground 
mustard is the product of ground seeds, husks and all. It is primarily used by 
the sausage industry because the husks contain a mucilaginous substance that 
acts as a good binding agent. 
</P>
<P>
Pungency can only be released when triggered by enzyme action when water is 
added. Low acid liquids, such as milk and beer, also work well to trigger the 
enzyme. Acidic liquids, such as wine, vinegar and lemon juice are poor triggers 
but good preservatives; heat can also impede the flavor release. It's best to 
let moistened mustard powder stand 10 minutes before adding it to any food 
preparation, including salad dressing. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, any powdered mustard will produce the fire of a Chinese mustard 
if it is moistened to a thin paste then left to stand 10 minutes. However, it 
should be used immediately because pungency dissipates within a few hours 
unless vinegar or other acidic liquid is added. You can extend life of the 
product by keeping the mixture cold. A tablespoon of vinegar may be added per 
cup of mixed mustard to further lengthen the flavor life. Mustard will remain 
hot to the taste for several days if kept refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
Mustard also has the unique ability to emulsify liquids. Powdered mustard added 
sufficiently to salad dressing will hold the oil and vinegar together. 
</P>
<P>
Whole seeds are used primarily in pickles, relishes and condiments where the 
appearance of whole seeds is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
There are numerous uses for mustard, whether to enhance the taste of sausages, 
charcuterie, grilled meats, fish or poultry. It can be served as a dip for 
steak or can be addded to salad dressings for a flavor fillip. Macaroni and 
potato salads are especially palatable with the addition of mustard. 
</P>
<P>
Organ meats such as liver and kidneys are enhanced by a touch of mustard in the 
cooking sauce. Vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli, cabbage and other 
cruciferous vegetables also take to mustard, especially when the mustard is the 
creamy type. Breaded meats and vegetables also are compatible with mustard. 
</P>
<P>
Following are recipes for making your own mustards. Included are standbys such 
as picnic mustard, English mustard and fiery Chinese mustard. Among the 
Oriental mustards is a recipe from Benihana, a Japanese teppan restaurant 
chain. It's ideal with grilled Japanese-style steaks and other meats, chicken 
or fish.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: EVEN CALORIE-CONSCIOUS SWEETHEARTS CAN ENJOY THESE 
VALENTINE DESSERTS 
</P>

<P>
There's no reason to abolish desserts this Valentine's Day just because of a 
weight control plan. Simply enjoy one of these lighter versions of special 
occasion treats then resume your diet the following day. 
</P>
<P>
With desserts that are lower in fat it is possible to have a romantic ending to 
a favorite meal with a lot less guilt. Modifying desserts to reduce their fat 
content makes it possible for treats to fit into a sensible calorie-controlled 
plan. And experts agree that people who have an occasional treat have far 
better diet success because they reduce feelings of deprivation that can lead 
to over-indulgence of a forbidden food later. 
</P>
<P>
Choose from among desserts like Almond Meringue Hearts With Raspberry Poached 
Pears. Here, richly flavored raspberry-cinnamon poached pears are topped with a 
raspberry sauce and used to fill light and airy heart-shaped meringue shells. 
The meringue shells are made with egg whites that have been piped onto a baking 
sheet and baked. Toasted almonds add nutty flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Ginger-Peach Cheesecake Tart is another sweet treat that keeps fat under 
control. The creamy rich texture of the filling comes from Neufchatel cheese 
(low-fat cream cheese) and low-fat evaporated milk. Folding cling peaches into 
the mixture eliminates the need for high-calorie toppings such as sweetened 
sour cream or sweet, thickened fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Scones, a favorite tea-time treat from the United Kingdom, is updated for 
health-conscious Valentines in this version of Apricot Scones. Canned apricots 
add tangy-sweet flavor, fiber, Vitamin A, potassium, iron and Vitamin C. Oat 
bran and low-fat milk also are included. 
</P>
<P>
A light biscuit topped with a succulent raspberry topping, angel food cake 
featuring a skinny blueberry-yogurt sauce, and Pineapple Noodle Pudding are 
some other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
ALMOND MERINGUE HEARTS WITH RASPBERRY POACHED PEARS 
</P>
<P>
3 egg whites 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sliced almonds 
</P>
<P>
1 (12-ounce) package whole frozen raspberries, thawed 
</P>
<P>
8 cloves 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
2 ripe pears 
</P>
<P>
Line baking sheet with parchment or brown paper. Lightly trace 4 hearts, about 
4 inches long and 5 inches wide on paper. 
</P>
<P>
Combine egg whites, 3/4 cup sugar and cream of tartar in electric mixer. Beat 
on high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, 15 to 20 minutes. Spoon meringue 
into large pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch tip. Pipe approximately 3 
tablespoons meringue into center of each heart outline. Spread evenly to edges

COOK IT LIGHT: REVISED CHICKEN ENTREE RETAINS ITS VERY RITZY FLAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE JONES, Jones is a food consultant and a cookbook author. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR JEANNE: Is there a way to revise this recipe so it is both low in salt as 
well as cholesterol and fat? 
</P>
<P>
 -- JUDY, Park Forest, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
VERY RITZY CHICKEN 
</P>
<P>
3 whole chicken breasts or 6 halves, skinned and boned 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
1 cup seasoned bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
6 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese 
</P>
<P>
1 pint whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Dip chicken breasts into beaten eggs, then coat with bread crumbs. Heat oil in 
skillet over medium heat. Add coated chicken and brown lightly on both sides. 
Remove from pan and place in baking dish, topping with slice mozzarella cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Combine whipping cream, Parmesan, parsley and salt and pepper to taste in 
saucepan. Cook until mixture gets hot and thickens. Pour over chicken and bake 
at 350 degrees 25 minutes. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JUDY: I was able to reduce the fat and cholesterol with a few simple 
substitutions. The result is just as tasty but lacking the fatty taste that 
only fat can give. Fortunately, the reduced fat allows the other wonderful 
flavors to shine and makes it possible to enjoy this rich-tasting dish without 
"putting on the Ritz." 
</P>
<P>
Egg whites coat the chicken just as well as whole eggs, but without the added 
fat and cholesterol, and evaporated skim milk works wonders in place of heavy 
cream. By frying the chicken in two batches I was able to greatly reduce the 
oil required; cutting the amounts of cheese in half also accomplished the 
desired results. 
</P>
<P>

HINTS FROM HELOISE: NEGLECTED APPLIANCES A SERIOUS THREAT TO HOME SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Here is a safety tip to share with all your readers. 
</P>
<P>
We are frequently reminded not to leave small appliances, like hair dryers and 
toaster ovens, plugged in when we are finished using them. I had become 
careless about this and left the toaster oven plugged in after making toast for 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
There must have been some problem with the electric power one day, and when I 
returned home from work I found that the roll of paper towels I had left on top 
of the oven (another careless error) was very warm. Any delay in coming home 
might have allowed a fire to begin in the kitchen. Since I live in a mobile 
home, you can readily see that, in a very brief time, I would have had no home 
to come home to. 
</P>
<P>
I have been ever alert to the danger of fire in my home. 
</P>
<P>
 -- W. M., Arden, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My family is trying to eat nutritiously, so once a week we have 
salad for a meal. I decided that I would make a mini salad bar on the table. I 
have three muffin tins and in each cup I place different salad ingredients like 
sliced mushrooms, sliced carrots, chick peas, kidney beans, sliced beets, 
sliced celery, chopped green onions, sprouts and radishes. 
</P>
<P>
Then in a large bowl in the center I place bite-size pieces of lettuce and 
other greens. I also place dressings and salad toppers there. 
</P>
<P>
Now everyone enjoys putting their own salad together and eating a healthy meal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- SALLY, Salt Lake City 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: For hard-to-open small jars and bottles I use a heavy, wide 
rubber band for a gripper. 
</P>
<P>
The bands come from the produce department where they are used in packaging 
broccoli. Just slip the band around the stubborn top, and it's so easy to open. 
</P>
<P>
 -- RUTH, Rapid City, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I bake cupcakes in flat-bottomed ice-cream cones. I place the 
cones in a muffin tin, fill them halfway with batter and then bake according to 
cupcake directions. After they have cooled, I add frosting and colored 
sprinkles. They are the hit of a party. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARGE, Carmichael, Penn. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Have you ever deviled eggs and then wanted more filling so you 
could make the halves fuller? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you can solve that by adding some low-fat cottage cheese to the yolks. I 
add about 1/3 cup to six eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Mash the egg yolks and the cheese together and season as usual. Dare anyone to 
say it's not all egg. They are delicious and no one is the wiser. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS. E. G., Fort Myers, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My mother-in-law has always told me not to store apples and 
carrots together. Why is this? 
</P>
<P>
 -- LENORA, Mount Dora, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR LENORA: Apples shouldn't be kept in the same crisper drawer as unwrapped 
carrots, since they give off ethylene gas, which can make the carrots bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: To avoid freezer burn, I double-wrap meat packages with freezer 
wrap. Then, so I don't have to hunt through the freezer for a package of meat, 
I tie a piece of red string on each package and can tell meat at a glance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LOLLY, La Crescenta 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have found a way to make setting the table easier for my 
daughter. She never could remember which side the silverware went on. I was 
constantly moving the knives, forks and spoons to the correct position. 
</P>
<P>
Then I figured this little reminder for her. I told her that the fork goes on 
the left and the words fork and left both have four letters. The knife and the 
spoon go on the right and the words knife, spoon and right all have five 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
This has made setting the table a snap for her. She simply remembers our little 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BETTY, Des Moines 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Every time I turn on my microwave, it interferes with my 
television. Also, if I am on the telephone I can hear a definite buzzing when 
the microwave is on. Is there anything I can do? 
</P>
<P>
 -- BELINDA, Marion, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR BELINDA: It's not uncommon to have microwave interference with television, 
radios and even some types of telephones. 
</P>
<P>
If you hear buzzing in the telephone when it and the microwave are being used 
at the same time, try moving the telephone closer to the microwave or the 
microwave closer to the telephone or facing it toward or away from the 
telephone. If this affects the interference, it could be related to some 
leaching, which always occurs from microwaves. 
</P>
<P>
However, not to worry. Federal standards limit the amount of leaching from 
microwave ovens, and unless the microwave was purchased more than 15 years ago, 
you are not likely to be in danger, says the Assn. of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Older microwaves have metal-to-metal contact that may allow some leakage, but 
for the past 15 years or so, microwaves have had choke doors that meet federal 
standards for leaching. 
</P>
<P>
If you have an older microwave or are concerned about excess microwave 
leaching, AHAM says some local health departments offer free checkups for 
microwave leakage. You can also have it checked by a professional repair 
service, but it won't be free.

FOOD BRIEFS: VITAMIN OVERDOSE A CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A surprising number of Americans -- particularly children -- are using 
nutritional supplements, some at dangerously high dosage levels, according to a 
recent federal survey. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Center 
for Health Statistics reported that as many as 36% of those adults surveyed 
take some kind of over-the-counter vitamin, mineral or fluoride compound. 
</P>
<P>
Women were the most likely supplement users and 41% of those females queried in 
the study reported consuming the products, compared with only 31% of the males. 
</P>
<P>
The results, published in the center's Advance Data journal last year, showed 
that an even higher percentage of children are using supplements than adults. 
For instance, 47% of those aged between three and four years old reported 
vitamin usage. This compares with 40% of the five- to six-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
The data indicated that income levels were a factor in dietary supplement 
consumption. The number of children taking vitamins or minerals rose to as many 
as 50% in those households earning $40,000 or more annually. Only 23% of the 
children in homes with yearly income of $7,000 or less reported supplement use. 
</P>
<P>
Data from the survey will be used as part of the federal government's on-going 
monitoring of the nation's nutritional status. 
</P>
<P>
A note of concern was expressed by the researchers, however. It found that many 
people are taking megadoses of these compounds, some of which can be toxic. Of 
those women consuming Vitamin E supplements, for instance, 5% reported 
ingesting levels 35 times above the recommended daily allowance. 
</P>
<P>
"Millions of Americans continue to take vitamin and mineral supplements, 
sometimes far beyond the (U.S.) Recommended Dietary Allowances," the report 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
Supplement Recall -- Despite gains in public acceptance, the dietary supplement 
industry continues to be rocked from the L-tryptophan scandal. Just days ago 
the FDA issued another warning against buying or consuming the capsules. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent action was targeted against a particular company, Nutricology 
Inc., of San Leandro, Calif. The FDA move was precipitated when the firm was 
described as "slow" to recall its line of L-tryptophan products. 
</P>
<P>
The compound has been linked with 1,143 cases of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, 
a blood and muscle disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control. 
Illnesses have been reported in all 50 states. As many as nine deaths are 
believed to have been linked to the supplements, and one of these fatalities 
has been confirmed as "clearly associated with the taking of L-tryptophan," 
according to the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
More than 330 manufacturers, repackers and distributors have cooperated with 
the government's "urgent recall." However, Nutricology has refused to furnish 
any proof that it is removing its products from sale. Several items are 
involved in the current action and some are also sold under the firm's Allergy 
Research Group label. 
</P>
<P>
The targets of the FDA's warning include: 
</P>
<P>
* Allergy Research Group 500 milligram L-tryptophan with 100 capsules to the 
bottle. 
</P>
<P>
* Nutricology and Allergy Research brands of 350 milligram Tryptophan P.R.N. 
with 30 capsules to a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
* Nutricology and Allergy Research brand of 750 milligram Free Aminos and Free 
Aminos without Cystine and Cysteine. Both are packaged in 100-capsule bottles. 
</P>
<P>
* Free Aminos powder in 50- and 100-gram bottles also under both labels. 
</P>
<P>
L-tryptophan is an essential amino acid that is normally ingested as a 
constituent of dietary protein, according to the Public Health Letter, 
published by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"(The) supplements are used for disorders such as insomnia, depression and 
premenstrual syndrome," the health letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
Public health investigators have not been able to link the outbreak of 
illnesses and deaths to any specific lot, brand, manufacturer or supplier of 
L-tryptophan, according to the FDA warning. 
</P>
<P>
"Extensive laboratory analyses of products have not been able to identify a 
specific chemical or microbial contaminant responsible for the outbreak," the 
agency announced. 
</P>
<P>
Supplements &amp; Seniors -- A different perspective on nutritional supplement 
use appeared in a recent medical journal. The focus of the study, printed in 
the Journal of Nutrition for the Elderly, was the extent of vitamin and mineral 
consumption among Southern California seniors. 
</P>
<P>
The author, Nancy Cotugna, interviewed 195 residents of senior housing 
projects. She found that 58.5% of the subjects reported using over-the-counter 
vitamins or minerals. Heavy users, or those consuming more than four different 
such products daily, accounted for 19.4% of the survey. 
</P>
<P>
On average, the seniors queried reported spending 1% of their monthly income on 
supplements. Some, in fact, spent up to 6% of the their income on these 
products. 
</P>
<P>
The National Council Against Health Fraud, a Loma Linda, Calif.-based group, in 
commenting on the study was highly critical of supplement usage among seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"Unnecessary supplement usage is one of the most widespread forms of soft-core 
quackery (i.e. that which costs only money), and the elderly are the most 
common targets of all forms of quackery," the council stated. "Misbeliefs are 
the root causes of the success (of the supplement industry)." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the reasons given for vitamin and mineral use in this age group were, 
"supplementation is necessary," "food processing destroys nutrients," and 
"health foods are healthier."

HIGH STYLE AT CALIFORNIA GIFT SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
KITCHENWARE: A 20-QUART ICE CREAM FREEZER, A LASAGNA PAN AND A PRESSURE COOKER 
ARE SOME OF THE MORE NOTEWORTHY ITEMS .

Culinary showrooms at the L.A. Mart welcomed buyers with new kitchen and 
table-top products during the recent 110th California Gift Show. As far as 
presenting something really new and different, the manufacturers' 
representatives didn't unveil anything as dramatically unusual as the Japanese 
bread-making machine introduced two years ago. However, many of the items 
displayed offered function and high style mixed with durability. Here are some 
noteworthy examples of interesting kitchenware. (Next week's article will 
feature table-top accessories.) 
</P>
<P>
A 20-quart ice cream freezer promises to be the fun solution around 
warm-weather party time to please homemade ice cream fans. Leo Neeleman, vice 
president of Kitchen Concepts, presented the monster ice-cream maker along with 
its normal smaller versions. Built by one of the first companies to construct 
wooden tub freezers, the huge hand-crank model from White Mountain Freezer Inc. 
carries a nostalgic old-fashioned appeal yet projects a modern approach with 
its bright teal tub color and electrical mode capability. 
</P>
<P>
Recognized for its patented triple motion ice cream freezer with a three-gear 
drive, White Mountain has been building quality wood tub freezers since 1853, 
around the time when the first ice cream makers were invented. 
</P>
<P>
The perfect lasagna pan has finally arrived, says Kitchen Concepts' Carolyn 
Teninty, who brought out the new Chef's Design Lasagna Pan Plus ($55 with 
cooking rack, $50 without rack). Manufactured by Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry 
Inc., the professional weight black pan is made of hand cast aluminum with a 
wide lip on each end that acts as a handle. 
</P>
<P>
What makes it perfect? The pan size, 12x10 inches with three-inch depth, is 
unusually deep to avoid those common lasagna spills and large enough to save 
trimming the long, wide pasta. The sturdy baking pan also features non-stick 
surface for easy clean-up. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the revived pressure cooker arena is the Efficient Pressure Cooker from 
Bra USA Inc., also represented by Kitchen Concepts. Made in Spain, the sleek 
18/10 grade stainless steel cooker offers even heating with its triple-layer 
diffusing base and safety features that protect against handling errors. 
</P>
<P>
An upscale new Barbecue Tool Set from Carlo Giannini ($80) was shown by Tom 
Bryckner, who represents the Italian kitchen tool company. Packaged in a long 
carrying case, the finely finished tool set consists of a fork, a spatula and a 
pair of tongs. A long barbecue brush is available separately for $25. 
</P>
<P>
Bryckner also recommended the Rialto Infuser by Italian designer Sambinelli, 
introduced by Carlo Giannini last year. Made of stainless steel and 
borosilicate glass, the French press or infuser not only works well for coffee 
but is great for herbal infusions and teas. Other interesting pieces from 
Giannini are the new espresso demitasse set ($35) with a thermal feature to 
keep that cup of espresso steaming hot and the beautifully designed stainless 
steel Rialto teapot ($90). 
</P>
<P>
Cookware Specialists of Los Angeles offered a collection of attractive looking 
18/8-grade Stainless Steel Kitchenware from Sitlax Ltd. Presented by showroom 
owner Darrel Stone, the high-polished Sitlax steel group included airtight 
canister sets, colander sets, a cocktail shaker, Champagne bucket, vases, oil 
dispenser, trays and charger plates. 
</P>
<P>
Representing Alessi, Niel Sheffield, vice president of marketing at 
Gallant-Friedman Showroom, brought out some daring spring-to-summer products 
from the Italian firm, adding them to its collection of highly successful 
architecturally designed home accessories. One futuristic gadget is the Starck 
Juicer ($75), which takes a little bit of pondering to identify. The single 
juicer, which resembles a Space-Age knight standing on three long slender legs, 
is the brainchild of French post-modern architect Philippe Starck. 
</P>
<P>
Made of polished aluminum, the reamer is shaped like a twisted cone so that 
when citrus is squeezed on its rounded top, the juice runs along the streaks of 
the spiral, flowing into the glass placed under the juicer. "It really works," 
Sheffield said, "I tested orange after orange to prove that the juice really 
flows directly into a glass." 
</P>
<P>
Another dramatic design by the same architect is the monolithic Philippe Starck 
Water Kettle ($125). A one-piece construction, the aluminum teapot consists of 
a large cone-shaped body pierced at the top by a slimmer slate blue cone, which 
serves as the handle and spout. 
</P>
<P>
Would you pay $300 for a colander? No, it's not silver- or gold-plated or 
copper. But that didn't stop buyers from choosing this product. The Starck 
Colander from Alessi is made of finely crafted stainless steel but stands tall 
and elegant on three shining brass feet. Of different sizes, the holes have a 
distinctive pattern that make this colander unique. An upscale item, it 
deserves to be handled as a decorative fruit bowl or a rare plant holder. 
</P>
<P>
In another culinary showroom, Marjorie Duncan expressed high hopes for the 
Chill-n-Go nylon picnic packs from Go Lightly Manufacturing Co. ($19.95 for a 
small snack pack to $56.95 for a gourmet pack). These food and beverage picnic 
bags are sturdy, comfortable to carry and lightweight. Another high point is 
that each is fitted with an easy-closure compartment containing a reusable 
chill-pack, which can be removed and frozen until ready to use. The frozen pack 
maintains cold temperature of beverages up to seven hours. For quantity orders, 
the bags may also be custom printed with your company logo or event. Another 
item is the Chill-n-It (from $13.95), a light table-top cooler that keeps 
Champagne cool at the table for up to two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan also recommended a new barbecue or chef apron that's made of 
machine-washable leather. Flame retardant like the original mitt products, the 
apron is manufactured by American Leather Products ($78.95) and designed by 
Sandra Asbell. Duncan said she got excellent response from buyers, the majority 
of whom ordered black aprons. The other colors were rust, mink and gray. 
</P>
<P>
One product that has received a number of rave reviews from buyers, according 
to Darrel Stone of Cookware Specialists, is Halves Inc.'s Wine Preserve 
($39.95). It displaces oxygen, the enemy of opened wine which leaches out 
flavors and aromatics in unconsumed bottles. Wine Preserve is a simple 
cartridge system that squirts nitrogen into the surface of the wine. Non-toxic 
and flavorless, the protective blanket of nitrogen prevents deterioration of 
wine up to 30 days after applying. 
</P>
<P>
One nitrogen cartridge will treat approximately 20 bottles of wine, including 
Ports and Sherries. In addition to preserving wine, the system also works 
effectively for specialty oils and vinegars, exotic teas and coffees.

WINE NOTES: WINERIES SEEK CHANGES IN REGULATIONS THEY SAY ARE CRUSHING INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Department of Alcohol Beverage Control has agreed to change its 
policy regarding a particularly bureaucratic rule that was opposed by wineries. 
</P>
<P>
This announcement may seem trivial, except that the change was made after a 
number of wineries testified at a public hearing of the Assembly Select 
Committee on California Wine Production and Economy in December. The hearing, 
called by Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose), was aimed at solving 
some of the industry's problems. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of various elements of the industry showed up to seek changes 
in ABC regulations, and Manny Espinoza, deputy director of the ABC, heard the 
requests. Within a few weeks his office announced a change in the reporting 
process for wineries participating in fund-raising wine tastings, reducing the 
paper work that had been required. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those presenting testimony at the hearing complained about restrictions 
that they said handcuffed them in their marketing of wines without apparent 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
William Kinzler, a San Francisco attorney specializing in wine law, said of the 
state's restrictive laws, "If a foreign government were to enact the same 
restrictions on the marketing of California wine abroad as we now have in 
California, everyone in the room would be denouncing them as 'trade barriers' 
and yelling bloody murder. . . . Prohibition wasn't repealed, it was just 
amended." 
</P>
<P>
Kinzler sought state legislation to correct a number of hazy issues, asking 
specifically for a resolution of the legal status of the wine broker, an 
independent sales agent. Kinzler said the wine broker was not recognized in its 
present sense by ABC and by not having a formal wine broker's license, ABC 
encourages brokers to "come up with all kinds of legal fictions and ways to 
deal with (their problems)." 
</P>
<P>
J. Patrick Dore and Mike Houlihan, wine marketers for their own brands of wines 
made under contract by wineries, complained that ABC law hampered them in their 
marketing. They said that as so-called "Type 17" licensees, they were 
restricted from doing business the way wineries do. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand these laws," said Dore. "They are truly antiquated and a 
holdover from Prohibition." He said that as a contractor for wine that he 
bottles and sells, he was restricted in how he can sell wine, and he asked for 
legislative relief. 
</P>
<P>
Houlihan said, "Let's have a new type of license for those people like us who 
are doing everything a winery does, but who don't own a winery." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco attorney John Hinman, who works primarily in wine industry law, 
added, "We need a level playing field" for the various layers of wine 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Schorske, whose consulting company helps wineries comply with regulations, 
added to the plea for a special license "for the small wholesaler who has wine 
custom crushed or blended and bottled under his own label." She said the paper 
work on such businesses is needlessly burdensome and costly. 
</P>
<P>
She also suggested that small wine suppliers have "the privilege of selling at 
retail by mail order, without having to obtain a separate retail license." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, held in San Jose, was attended by a half dozen winery owners and 
another half dozen custom-crush brand owners. Many of the winery owners 
expressed dismay that the Wine Institute, the industry's trade organization, 
did not attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Cortese said the hearing was the first of many he intended to hold on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
"We have laid the groundwork here for potential legislation, and now there is 
tremendous documentation we have to do as we go forward," said Cortese. He 
added that his assembly committee would work closely with a parallel committee 
set up by Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose) in the other house of the 
legislature to work on similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
To implement some of the suggestions made by the industry, Cortese set up two 
subcommittees to work on the problems, the Industry Drafting Subcommittee and 
the Industry Review Subcommittee. The drafting subcommittee has drafted two new 
ABC license categories, which should be submitted to the legislature before 
March 2, said G. M. Pucilowski, an aide to Cortese. 
</P>
<P>
David Heitz, wine maker and production manager for Heitz Cellars in the Napa 
Valley, and Lester Hardy, wine maker at Cain Cellars, both have filed candidacy 
papers to run for seats on the St. Helena City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Two seats on the council are on the April 10 election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Those hand-etched-and-painted wine bottles that have brought such ludicrously 
high bids at wine auctions in the last few years now may be bought at retail -- 
direct from the artist. 
</P>
<P>
Gaye Frisk, who etched and painted most of the special bottles, has opened a 
shop on Main Street in St. Helena to market wines from more than 80 Napa Valley 
wineries. 
</P>
<P>
The special bottlings run between $5 and $500, and Frisk does custom work as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The Victorian mansion at St. Clement Vineyards, originally built 100 years ago, 
has been restored and redecorated and is now open to the public on an 
appointment-only basis. The facility, which has a tasting room, is located 
north of St. Helena in the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Mirassou Vineyards in San Jose has opened a new sparkling wine facility in Los 
Gatos that once was the home of the Novitiate Winery. 
</P>
<P>
The Novitiate Winery, established in 1854, was operated by the Jesuits of 
Sacred Heart Novitiate until 1985, when the order abandoned making wine. 
</P>
<P>
The facility was vacant until late last year when Mirassou signed a long-term 
lease for the facility and converted it into a sparkling wine making plant, now 
called Mirassou Champagne Cellar.

CULINARY SOS: A GRANDSON SHARES A PRIZE LEMON PIE RECIPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I noted a recent request in this column for a recipe for Bullock's 
Lemon Meringue Pie. My grandmother, Hazel Wilson, was head baker at Bullock's 
in Pasadena through 1956. 
</P>
<P>
She used to bring pies home to me when I was going through Pasadena City 
College. Here is the recipe she used at Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JOHN 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JOHN: How good of you to share this prize recipe, which apparently has 
been modified over the years. If you don't have a double boiler, which is 
called for in the recipe, cook the filling over direct, very low heat, to avoid 
scorching the filling. 
</P>

and butter. Cool slightly, then turn into baked pie shell. 
</P>
<P>
Spoon Meringue over pie, completely covering filling. Place pie in oven at 400 
degrees to brown slightly, about 10 minutes or until tinged with brown. Makes 1 
(9-inch) pie. 
</P>
<P>
Meringue 
</P>
<P>
3 egg whites 
</P>
<P>
6 tablespoons sugar

LA CANADA COUNCIL CANDIDATES FOCUS ON GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD S. PALMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decisions late last week by La Canada Flintridge Mayor Edmund Krause and 
Councilman O. Warren Hilgren not to run for reelection in April has opened up 
the council race to a large field of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Both Krause and Hilgren have served on the council since the city's 
incorporation 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people filed nomination papers by the Tuesday deadline for the two open 
seats on the five-member council. They are incumbent Joan Feehan, former 
Councilman John Hastings, Public Safety Commissioner James Edwards, Planning 
Commissioner Judy Breitman, architect Peter Kudrave, dentist Melvin Ricks, real 
estate investor Elizabeth Blackwelder and legal secretary Barbara Parady. 
</P>
<P>
City development in general -- and the proposed Sport Chalet shopping center in 
particular -- are emerging as the most visible issues in the campaign. Urban 
growth was an issue in the election two years ago, and charges that the council 
had been too eager to approve developments dogged the incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
Views of candidates in this year's election differ widely on the Sport Chalet 
development and other growth issues. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings, a 61-year-old building contractor, was appointed to the council but 
was defeated when he ran for election in 1988. Hastings, who served as mayor 
pro tem during his tenure on the council, could not be reached this week to 
comment on his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be starting over again for the whole council," Feehan said. "I 
will have the most experience," she said, citing her four years on the council. 
"I think I can be more of a resource for the city than I have in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Feehan, 58, has been a California resident for 30 years and has lived in La 
Canada for 21. A past president of the PTA, she has been active in the 
community. Feehan was a member of the Trails Council prior to her election to 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Maintaining the community's "residential ambience" is of primary interest to 
Feehan, who said she is especially concerned about residential redevelopment 
changing the atmosphere of the neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Breitman also sees unplanned city growth as a major issue. Breitman, who has 
been on the Planning Commission for two years, said many citizens have not been 
made aware of proposed developments, which could threaten the city's rural 
atmosphere . 
</P>
<P>
"Every community was rural at one time," said Breitman. "We're as close to 
still rural as you can get. I think people's attitudes are changing." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her work with the Planning Commission, Breitman is a divisional 
vice president of special events and public relations for May Co. She has lived 
in La Canada Flintridge for 25 years and has three grown children. Breitman 
said the council should adopt a master plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a plan," she said. "We need responsive management. We could be like a 
new palate for a good urban designer." 
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive master plan to guide urban development is also a primary 
concern of candidate Kudrave. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a long-range plan," Kudrave said. "To me the real issue is 
finding a consensus and reaching for the character of what the city will be in 
the year 2000." 
</P>
<P>
An architect by profession, Kudrave, 52, moved to La Canada Flintridge 16 years 
ago and bought property on which he designed and built his own home. In 1976 he 
founded Group Arcon, a Los Angeles corporate architectural and urban planning 
firm. His credits include creating master plans for Paramount and Burbank 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed La Canada Village shopping center project has become an important 
focus in Kudrave's candidacy. The Sport Chalet's design for the complex has 
received increasing public attention. 
</P>
<P>
Many community residents have said they want the land developed, but feel the 
shopping center should be smaller than presently planned. Kudrave offers an 
alternative design that he said is more in keeping with the needs of the 
community. A flyer describing his design was sent to community residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the peripheral edge until the mailer was sent out," he said. Kudrave 
said he had questioned members of the planning commission and the City Council 
about the development after his neighbors had expressed their concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Beyond the Sport Chalet we have a bigger challenge," he said. "What is the 
vision that the people have of this city?" 
</P>
<P>
Ricks said he thinks the developer's present design is fine. Ricks, 55, said he 
wants to see the shopping center move forward because it will "spark a newness 
on Foothill Boulevard" that will enhance and stimulate other businesses in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Sport Chalet has the right to develop its property," he said. "I 
think it's been worked out very well." 
</P>
<P>
A La Canada Flintridge resident for 19 years, Ricks, has a dental practice in 
Glendale. He was involved in a legal squabble 1988 when the city alleged a 
fence he was building on his property would have obstructed an equestrian trail 
over which the city holds an easement. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwelder said maintaining the network of hillside horse trails in the area 
is very important to her. As president of the Trails Council, she works to 
ensure the recreation paths are not blocked by urban development projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Trails have been there before buildings," said Blackwelder, who owns two 
Arabian horses and is a trail rider. "I would like to see more space to walk." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Chicago, Blackwelder moved to La Canada Flintridge in 1950. She has 
four children and has worked as a clinical lab technician. She is semi-retired. 
</P>
<P>
An opponent of the proposed Sport Chalet project, Blackwelder is concerned that 
condominiums and high-rise buildings may follow if the shopping center is 
built. Instead, she would like to see a city hall on the property. 
</P>
<P>
"Since La Canada Flintridge is now a city, we definitely need a city hall," she 
said. "This huge complex cannot survive with sales of the community alone." 
</P>
<P>
Parady said she feels a vocal minority of residents may have had undue 
influence over city development. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want the special-interest groups to decide for the whole community," 
said Parady. 
</P>
<P>
Parady, 47, a part-time legal secretary in Glendale for about 20 years, was 
born and raised in Glendale. She said she has been involved in city government 
since moving to La Canada Flintridge four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Parady said her family was attracted to the city because of the excellent 
school system and the equestrian trails. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to live in a community where we could keep our horses with us," said 
Parady. She has been involved with the Trails Council, which is working to 
complete a network of equestrian trails in the surrounding mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Parady said she is in favor of the proposed Sport Chalet development, but feels 
it should be modified. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree fully that the community needs something done along Foothill 
Boulevard," said Parady. "I'm not quite in favor of Sport Chalet being as big 
as it is proposed, but I am not against the development." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said the size of the proposed Sport Chalet development should not be 
the most important issue in the election. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do with 11 acres of land at the corner of Foothill Boulevard and 
Angeles Crest is not the most important thing in our lives," Edwards said. 
"We're not going to build all over the hillside. That's not what the people 
want, and I'm definitely opposed to that." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel people have the right to develop their land, as long as they do it 
within the system," Edwards said. "So far these people have done so. I think 
they have scaled it down to a scope that seems to be acceptable. I don't think 
it's going to create a major traffic problem, and I think it is going to be a 
benefit to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, 45, has lived in La Canada Flintridge for 12 years and has served on 
the city's Public Safety Commission for four years. He is a native Californian

NORWALK ASKS U.S. FOR CLOSURE OF TANK FARM

<P>
The City Council has called for the closure of a Department of Defense facility 
where millions of gallons of jet fuel are stored in the southern area of the 
city. The council accused the government of moving too slowly to make the 
facility earthquake-safe. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also said a recent fuel leak and the discovery of contaminants 
in a well on the site indicate the tank farm poses a serious threat to ground 
water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The council on Tuesday unanimously approved a resolution calling on local and 
federal legislators to press for the tank farm to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the government) were supposed to do quite a few things and I haven't 
seen them deliver on any of it," said Councilman Luigi A. Vernola, one of the 
main opponents of the tank farm. 
</P>
<P>
But a military spokesman said design work to make the facility earthquake-safe 
already has begun. Construction is scheduled to begin in March, 1991, and be 
completed 18 to 24 months later, said Lt. Col. Pharris D. Johnson, commander of 
the Defense Department's seven-state Defense Fuel Region West. Johnson said the 
legal requirements of government contracting prevent the $1.7-million project 
from being completed sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to accelerate it at every point we can, but this is the government 
contracting process we have to work with," Johnson said. "Everything has to be 
competitively bid." 
</P>
<P>
The tank farm has 12 fuel storage tanks with a total capacity of 38 million 
gallons. It supplies bases in California, Nevada and Arizona through a series 
of government and private pipelines, and by truck, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The tank farm became a source of intense city concern last summer after results 
of a seismic safety study were released. The study by Libby Engineers of San 
Diego said a strong earthquake could cause the tanks to leak and electrical 
connections to spark, which could trigger an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Defense pledged to make $1.7 million in improvements 
suggested by the study. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake safety study added to the facility's recent problems. A 1987 
study by another consultant discovered about 3,800 cubic yards of soil 
contaminated with heavy fuel oil. Benzene, a cancer-causing agent, was 
detected. Lead was detected 27 feet below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said relatively high levels of benzene and another solvent were 
detected in water samples drawn from a test well at a depth of about 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
But the study concluded that the contamination of ground water was not a threat 
to the public because it was far above the aquifer from which the city draws 
its water. 
</P>
<P>
(The five water companies serving Norwalk draw their water from depths of 236 
feet to 1,250 feet, according to a city report.) 
</P>
<P>
The study noted that buried waste oil was discovered in 1985 in two areas in 
the southeast section of the tank farm. The report also said two spills of 
unknown amounts of jet fuel occurred in 1968 and 1969. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Defense has begun the second phase of its study, which 
includes digging additional water-monitoring wells to determine the extent of 
the contamination and how to best remedy the problem. The second phase is 
scheduled to be completed in August, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence of additional contamination at the site. In December, fuel 
was discovered in a previously clean monitoring well, according to a Defense 
Department official. The water from the well is 22 to 30 feet below the 
surface, more than 200 feet above the area from which Norwalk draws its ground 
water, said W.E. Goode, environmental quality division chief. 
</P>
<P>
Goode noted there was a fuel spill last September from a pipeline just west of 
the monitoring well, but Johnson said the fuel from the spill has not yet been 
identified as the source of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 gallons of unleaded gasoline leaked from the pipeline, which is 
privately operated by Southern Pacific Pipeline, Johnson said. The Defense 
Department ties into private pipelines, which run through the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Seven truckloads of contaminated soil were removed from the tank farm after the 
September spill, Goode said. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of that leak has heightened the fears of city officials, who 
commissioned their own study on Norwalk's water system last May. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary report made public in November indicates some of Norwalk's 
underground water is contaminated with tetrachloroethane and trichloroethane, 
two industrial solvents that are suspected of causing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, three wells have been closed in Norwalk because of ground water 
contamination. Several sites, including the tank farm, are being investigated 
as possible sources of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution approved Tuesday night was the strongest official action taken 
against the tank farm to date. Some residents have opposed the tank farm for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) also may be reconsidering his position on 
the tank farm. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, who previously supported continued operation of the farm for national 
security reasons, plans to ask the Defense Department to study whether the tank 
farm would still be needed in light of the planned closure of various military 
bases, according to an aide. 
</P>
<P>
Aide Lupe de la Cruz, who attended Tuesday night's meeting, said the 
congressman thinks the Defense Department is moving ahead as quickly as 
possible on the earthquake safety improvements. But she said the congressman is 
concerned about the new evidence of soil and ground water contamination at the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson said only two of the 15 bases served by the tank farm are 
definitely slated for closure. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that those bases are closing would not eliminate the need to those 
that are remaining open," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The tank farm that is now owned by the U.S. Department of Defense was built by 
a private firm in the 1920s on the southeast corner of Norwalk Boulevard and 
Excelsior Drive. The U.S. Air Force acquired the depot in 1951. The tank farm 
was once isolated. But in the years since, housing developments have sprung up 
around it. The heavily used Holifield Park is adjacent to the tank farm.

DOWNEY APPROVES SALE OF HOTEL

<P>
The City Council has approved the sale of the Embassy Suites Hotel, the 
centerpiece of the city's redevelopment program, to a Japanese corporation for 
$31 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sanwa Jutaku Co. Ltd. of Osaka is buying the 220-room hotel and a nearby 
restaurant from an investment group headed by Robert E. Woolley of Irving, Tex. 
The sale is scheduled to become final Friday, said lawyer Robert S. Mautner, 
who is representing Woolley's group -- Downey Hometel Limited Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
City Council approval was required because Hometel owes the Downey Community 
Development Agency $480,000 on an outstanding loan for the redevelopment 
project, which is adjacent to the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
The city on Tuesday approved the transfer of the loan, which is to be repaid in 
four years, to Sanwa Jutaku, City Atty. Peter M. Thorson said. The city and 
Sanwa Jutaku also agreed to share parking lots -- the current practice -- in 
the frequently congested Civic Center area. 
</P>
<P>
Sanwa Jutaku has guaranteed the city that it will maintain the property as a 
hotel and restaurant for at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Yoko Maeda, president of Sanwa Jutaku, said the Embassy Suites Hotel will be 
her firm's first acquisition in the United States. Sanwa Jutaku specializes in 
residential development in Japan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice hotel and the investment is very excellent," Maeda said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the hotel, which opened in 1985, is expected to generate up to 
$120,000 a year in additional property tax money for the city's redevelopment 
program, said Lee Powell, assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the property is assessed at $18.95 million, Powell said. City 
officials will push to have it reassessed this year to reflect the $31-million 
price, which would mean about $120,000 in additional revenue, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-story Embassy Suites is the most ambitious project completed since 
Downey formed its first redevelopment zone in 1978.

PARENTS ANGRY ABOUT YEAR-ROUND CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Immediately after receiving a report recommending solutions to school 
overcrowding, the Glendale Board of Education on Tuesday was admonished by a 
handful of angry parents to reject the leading option: year-round education. 
</P>
<P>
But despite receiving a petition and threats of student boycotts against the 
year-round option, board members said opposition at their bimonthly meeting was 
far more modest than had been expected. And although a solution to overcrowding 
has not yet been chosen, they said, they are confident parents would support a 
decision to put some Glendale schools on a year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The showdown came one day after the Los Angeles Unified School District Board 
of Education voted to gradually implement year-round education in more than 500 
of its schools, despite a similar but larger-scale attempt by parents to thwart 
the move. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents don't have the capacity to stop it, basically, other than pressure 
brought to bear on the board. But we still have our minds open," Jane Whitaker, 
the board's president, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In its report, a board-appointed task force recommended several short-term 
options for relieving crowded classrooms, such as installing portable trailers 
on campuses and busing new students to less-crowded schools. 
</P>
<P>
It also recommended four long-term measures, including boundary changes, 
construction of classrooms or schools and moving ninth-graders to high school 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
But district officials have acknowledged that the leading contender is 
year-round education, which can increase a school's capacity as much as 30% by 
dividing students into groups with one group on vacation at all times. Several 
district administrators, including Supt. Robert Sanchis, will attend a San 
Diego conference this weekend to find out how year-round schools have performed 
in districts statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Still, board members said the options will be given equal weight in discussions 
during public board meetings on Feb. 20 and March 6. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we're going to give everybody, parents and staff, the opportunity to 
interact with us," Whitaker said after Tuesday's meeting. "There's nothing 
carved in stone yet." 
</P>
<P>
The board will decide by March 20 which short-term and long-term solutions to 
pursue. District staff will draw up specific plans to implement the measures. A 
long-term measure most likely will not be put in place before September, 1991, 
but short-term solutions should be in place by this fall, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale schools have grown from 19,800 students in 1985 to more than 24,200 
today, with a nearly 40% jump in elementary school enrollment. Although the 
district has implemented some stopgap measures, such as busing and portable 
trailers, ongoing growth in the classrooms -- largely attributable to an influx 
of immigrants into the area -- has demanded a more radical change, officials 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent leaning toward year-round education angered parents such as Jim 
Ranshaw, who on Tuesday read members a lengthy prepared statement and submitted 
a list of 600 parents opposed to the year-round option. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone monitoring the task force's activities can see that their purpose was 
from the outset to convince everyone that the only solution is to go to 
year-round schools," Ranshaw said. "I am absolutely opposed to year-round 
schools. They might be financially good for the district, they might be good 
for the teachers, but I see nothing but harm for the children." 
</P>
<P>
Ranshaw, who after the meeting threatened to organize a one-day student boycott 
to protest the option, said he believes Glendale politicians should provide 
funds to build new schools. 
</P>
<P>
Another parent, Daniel Grant, warned board members Tuesday that year-round 
education was a "hornets' nest" and threatened legal action if it is 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Those sentiments echoed comments made two weeks ago at a public hearing 
sponsored by the task force. At that time, many parents lashed out at the 
district for allowing enrollment to boom out of control and angrily voiced 
their opposition to the year-round concept. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, several parents cautiously pledged to back the option as long 
as the quality of education in the district went unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not have any great emotional fears that year-round schools are going to 
be the detriment of Glendale," Edwin Croft told board members. "I suggest to 
you that the key thing is the quality of education." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Desetti, president of the Glendale Teachers Assn., told the board that his 
organization had not yet taken a stand on the overcrowding issue. But he urged 
them to involve teachers and staff in their deliberations.

GLENDALE GETS CONSERVATIVE WITH BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
SPENDING: REFUSING TO RAISE TAXES, THE CITY COUNCIL OUTLINES A PLAN THAT 
INCLUDES NO NEW PROGRAMS AND FREEZES CITY SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After a year of unprecedented growth in city services, the city of Glendale 
will return to fiscally conservative ways next year by adopting an almost 
zero-growth budget, officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The new budget should allow for inflation increases and additional personnel in 
the Police and Planning departments, but no new programs will be added, 
officials determined at a City Council study session in which a preliminary 
1990-91 budget proposal was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to freezing city services at current levels, council members 
instructed City Manager David Ramsay to cut a number of capital improvement 
projects that were part of a five-year plan in an attempt to make capital 
expenditure match revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they would not raise taxes and would not sign a budget 
with more than a 5% increase to keep up with inflation. That would limit the 
size of the new budget to about $255 million. 
</P>
<P>
They said they were caught by surprise with the growth of last year's spending 
program of almost three times the inflation rate. They called Monday's study 
session to make sure that city staff understood the council's priorities for 
the upcoming budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be clear about this. If we are going to run the city like a 
business, we can't pay for what we can't afford," Councilman Larry Zarian said 
after the session. "I won't sign a budget with an increase above the inflation 
level because I'm not willing to raise taxes." 
</P>
<P>
The final budget proposal will be presented to council members in mid-May for 
adoption before June 1. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary proposal introduced Monday seemed to satisfy the council's 
desire to reduce spending. The plan calls for no significant additions to the 
city bureaucracy, and Glendale would continue to operate without bond 
indebtedness. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Department would add two employees to its environmental review 
program and two more to the General Plan update program. The number of police 
officers added will be determined in upcoming weeks by a task force headed by 
Assistant City Manager Bob McFall, who is evaluating police needs. 
</P>
<P>
The city would also add a handful of employees in other departments, but that 
number will be nowhere close to this year's increase, Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
A number of projects were scrapped from the five-year capital improvement plan 
after it was determined their combined cost would exceed the $100 million in 
expected revenues by $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Among the projects postponed indefinitely were the relocation of Fire Station 
No. 26, the construction of a police helicopter hangar, the installation of 
video cameras in City Council chambers and the construction of a landscaped 
median on Foothill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly $19 million for such projects as the expansion of Brand Library, street 
resurfacing programs, traffic lights and a public art program will not be 
affected by the proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
To increase revenues, the council will consider additional fees on developers 
in high-density zones, an increase in guest taxes at hotels and motels and an 
increase in dumping fees for cities that use Glendale's Scholl Canyon Landfill, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But council members emphatically opposed the possibility of raising or imposing 
new licensing fees and other business taxes. "The businesses are what make 
Glendale successful," Zarian said. 
</P>
<P>
Electricity rates will not go up, but water rates will rise by 7% and refuse 
rates by 5% to keep up with inflation, according to the preliminary budget. 
Sewer rates would double to pay for Glendale's share of capital improvement 
costs for the Hyperion plant in Santa Monica, which receives the city's treated 
sewage before it is discharged into the bay. After next year, Butler said, 
sewage-rate increases will return to single-digit, inflation adjustment levels. 
</P>
<P>
The city departed from its customary austerity last year to meet demands from a 
rapidly growing population. City Manager David Ramsay's budget for 1989-90 was 
12% higher than the previous year's. The $243 million spending package added 64 
new employees, created several new departments and programs, and for the first 
time in at least 10 years, it showed a small deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Although the deficit of less than $1 million for a city with ample reserves was 
considered negligible by Finance Director Brian Butler, it was the first time 
in years Glendale did not increase the amount in its investment portfolio made 
up with the city's reserves. "We hope we don't start a trend," Butler said.

DEVELOPER COURTS NEIGHBORS TO GET APPROVAL FOR BUILDING; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: TO COUNTER ANTI-GROWTH SENTIMENT IN THE SAWTELLE AREA, A DEVELOPER 
HAS SUGGESTED A COMMUNITY PLAN. IT INCLUDES A NAME CHANGE TO THE 'GARDEN 
DISTRICT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given the anti-growth sentiment on the Westside, developer George I. Rosenthal 
knew that the only way he would be allowed to build high-rise offices on two 
choice parcels his company owns on Olympic Boulevard would be to join forces 
with those who would fight tooth and nail to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
That's why two years ago Rosenthal, the president of Raleigh Enterprises, began 
courting Sawtelle neighborhood groups. 
</P>
<P>
To start with, he has suggested changing the community's name from Sawtelle to 
the more descriptive Garden District, in recognition of the many nurseries in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
He put up $350,000 to sponsor an international design competition for a 
10-block stretch of Olympic Boulevard to give residents a look at the 
possibilities for the area. Residents were among jurors who judged 85 proposals 
submitted by designers and architects from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
And more recently, he surprised residents with an offer to finance the writing 
of a new community plan that could raise an estimated $35 million for 
neighborhood parks, affordable housing and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
The plan could eventually set tough new restrictions on development for their 
entire community from the San Diego Freeway to Bundy Drive, from Nebraska 
Avenue to Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The goal, Rosenthal said, was to create a community plan "carefully crafted to 
include a balance of residential, commercial, office and retail uses." 
</P>
<P>
Community reaction to Rosenthal's proposal has been warm, even though no group 
has formally endorsed it. 
</P>
<P>
The initial reaction to the plan was one of suspicion. "We wanted to know 
what's in it for him," said Jon Shaughnessy, president of the Westside 
Residents Assn., a group founded six years ago after a successful fight to 
block the construction of a 12-story office building nearby. 
</P>
<P>
What Rosenthal says he wants in return is the opportunity to build higher than 
the law now allows by bending the rules of Proposition U, the 1986 slow-growth 
initiative that cut in half the allowable density of high-rise office 
construction along Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Under the provisions of the initiative, the maximum allowable floor space of a 
building is 1 1/2 times the area of the lot it sits on. Practically speaking, 
this means that most new buildings cannot exceed three or four stories. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal, however, is seeking to get around this limit by purchasing 
"airspace" from other properties along Olympic Boulevard that are not developed 
to their full potential. By transferring these development rights to his own 
property, he would be able to erect buildings with twice the square footage 
allowed by Proposition U -- enough for a building of perhaps 10 stories. 
</P>
<P>
Under city zoning law, it is difficult to transfer such development rights 
unless the arrangement is part of a "specific plan" for an overall neighborhood 
design and is approved by the City Council. In practice, this means that the 
council member whose district includes the neighborhood in question must 
endorse the project. 
</P>
<P>
The city councilman for the Sawtelle area is Marvin Braude, a co-author of 
Proposition U, and Rosenthal says Braude is far more likely to support the 
development proposal if area residents are solidly behind it. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal has two incentives, neighbors say: a trust fund for projects in the 
community, and a specific plan that protects the area from future high-density 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said: "Ultimately, the area will be developed with or without a 
plan. . . . It's better to have one." 
</P>
<P>
The details of his plan have not been worked out, but Rosenthal estimates that 
fees paid by him and other developers who want to increase the size of their 
projects under the specific plan could raise about $35 million in the coming 
years to be used as a trust fund for projects in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to deal with the area as a whole because a well-planned area 
enhances the value of all surrounding properties," he said. "In many ways, the 
Garden District represents a clean slate. We think it is the last area on the 
Westside that is not committed to an irreversible plan. 
</P>
<P>
Raleigh Enterprises, Rosenthal's company, is headquartered at 11444 Olympic 
Blvd. in the Executive Life Center, an 11-story building that it developed 
jointly with Executive Life Insurance Co. Raleigh Enterprises and Executive 
Life also have developed the 17-story Executive Towers nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The two parcels Rosenthal would like to develop next are a 100,000-square-foot 
lot on the southeast corner of Sawtelle and Olympic boulevards and a 
150,000-square-foot parcel on the northwest corner of Barrington Avenue and 
Olympic. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who live north and south of the 10-block stretch of Olympic between 
the San Diego Freeway and Bundy Drive say they have come to distrust developers 
who, they say, have failed to keep promises. But some say there was something 
different about Rosenthal's approach.

<P>
"He was up front about the fact that he stands to make a ton of money from 
this," Shaughnessy said. "He didn't try to hide that, and he deserves respect 
for that. Neither side is looking to hurt the other. We are not looking to turn 
back the clock, and he is not looking to plow us under." 
</P>
<P>
Braude is reserving judgment on Rosenthal's proposal, but he praised the 
developer's effort to build a coalition with the residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that this is the direction we may have to go in the future, 
joint public and private ventures," Braude said. "I'm supportive of the 
proceedings with the understanding that the city has total control -- that 
rules and regulations are adhered to -- and that the citizens have complete 
participation." 
</P>
<P>
An informal survey of about 50 residents by the Westside Residents Assn. found 
that most were in favor of Rosenthal's proposal for a specific plan. The group 
is establishing a community planning council to represent the association and 
other groups like the West Los Angeles Japanese American Citizens League, an 
organization of about 1,000 members with roots in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the planning council will join a group composed of 
developers and business representatives to draft a specific plan for 
presentation to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Already the community groups have begun to discuss the merits of whether it 
should adopt the name Garden District or maintain its more traditional name 
Sawtelle, which dates back 100 years but more recently has become associated 
with the name of a local street gang, "Sotel." 
</P>
<P>
"This proposal will give the area a chance to do something about development 
without being piecemealed to death by changes," said Jean Ushijima, president 
of the Japanese American Citizens League. "It gives residents a chance to take 
an overall approach, a more cohesive approach to development in the area."

WEST HOLLYWOOD CALLS FOR END TO SPRAYING OF MALATHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The architect of West Hollywood's "cruelty free zone" for animals failed to 
persuade the City Council on Monday night to make the city a "malathion free 
zone." 
</P>
<P>
But City Councilman Paul Koretz did persuade his colleagues to unanimously 
approve a resolution calling for an end to aerial spraying of the pesticide in 
Los Angeles County until it is proven not harmful to humans. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion is the pesticide used by state agricultural officials in recent years 
to attempt to eradicate the crop-destroying Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
"They are routinely spraying this substance that can rust the paint off your 
car," said Koretz, author of the resolution. "How safe can that be for your 
lungs?" 
</P>
<P>
Koretz, who works for the California League of Conservation Voters, an 
environmental protection lobbying group, admits that the malathion resolution 
is little more than a symbolic gesture, but he said he hopes the action sends a 
message to state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess there's not much we could really do if they wanted to spray us again," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The West Hollywood City Council at times is criticized by residents of the 
1.9-square-mile city for supporting resolutions that have little concrete 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Koretz has authored resolutions banning the use of 
steel-jawed traps on animals in the heavily urban city, creating a "cruelty 
free zone" for animals, and urging a moratorium on the cutting of old-growth 
redwood trees. Koretz was not able to persuade council members and city staff 
Monday night to go further than a symbolic gesture. His original resolution 
called for the drafting of an ordinance that would have banned all malathion 
spraying within West Hollywood's borders. 
</P>
<P>
But such a ban would have been superseded by state law and would have been 
unenforceable, City Atty. Michael Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood, though not known for the agriculture that attracts Medflies, 
from time to time has endured aerial bombing of malathion -- most recently in 
October, 1988. City officials are worried about health hazards from the 
pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
"Some studies show that AIDS sufferers might be particularly susceptible to 
deleterious effects of malathion," Koretz said. A substantial number of the 
county's patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome live in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, one of the authors of a 1980 state study used to 
demonstrate the safety of malathion disavowed that report's findings. Marc A. 
Lappe, a professor of health and ethics at the University of Illinois, who was 
part of a 1980 state risk-assessment team, said the pesticide may pose a danger 
to infants, the elderly, and the sick. 
</P>
<P>
Though West Hollywood's malathion resolution is unlikely to persuade state 
officials to halt malathion spraying, the city is jumping into the fray just as 
the idea of a ban is gathering steam across the state. 
</P>
<P>
In passing the resolution, the council was responding to the most recent 
assault on the crop-destroying pests by state agriculture officials. While 
Californians in spray areas have long complained that the sticky, yellow 
pesticide ruins car paint, several residents groups in recent weeks have voiced 
concerns that the pesticide may pose greater health hazards than state 
officials admit.

LEISURE: MEMBERS OF THE POSH RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB WERE READY TO REVOLT WHEN A 
JAPANESE GROUP BOUGHT IT. NOW THEY CAN'T SAY ENOUGH NICE THINGS ABOUT THE 
OWNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was bad enough that unfamiliar Japanese investors bought the posh Riviera 
Country Club -- an exclusive Pacific Palisades establishment steeped in 
traditions dating back to the Golden Era of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But then came the announcement two months ago that the new owners would banish 
motorized carts from the sublime fairways of the Riviera's world-class golf 
course, requiring that they stay on paths. Some of the 600-plus club members, 
who include celebrities and some of Southern California's business elite, were 
up in arms. 
</P>
<P>
Coming as one of the first pronouncements by the new owners, it was a sign, 
some members feared, of more drastic measures to come. 
</P>
<P>
Some felt that the ambience they had so learned to enjoy at one of the 
Westside's premiere clubs was in jeopardy. Riviera members were abuzz about how 
the new owners of a club in Valencia had added a Japanese restaurant and sushi 
bar, Japanese bath complex and Japanese instructions to the signs on the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation was rampant. Would their club be next? Would the leisurely golf 
games and the chummy days and nights at the clubhouse be the next to go? And 
would the traditions fostered by decades of family ownership of the club give 
way to profit-minded motivations by the Japanese investors? 
</P>
<P>
Au contraire. The members now say they are happier than ever. And they admit -- 
a bit sheepishly perhaps -- that their xenophobia has been overcome by a love 
they share with the new owners, that of hitting a tiny, dimpled ball hard 
enough, and far enough to end up in a tiny hole in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the members criticized the Japanese for buying the Riviera in 
particular and investing in the United States in general. Now, members gush 
about how the Japanese' reverence for golf will return the Riviera club, the 
golf course and even the sprawling Spanish-style clubhouse to their original 
splendor. 
</P>
<P>
New owner Noboru Watanabe, senior managing director of the Marukin Corp., even 
plays a few rounds with "the boys" when he stops by from his home base in 
Japan. Watanabe is said to be beside himself with glee over the Riviera being 
the host of the 64th annual Los Angeles Open golf tournament, starting Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The change in ownership may even exemplify what is best about "the emerging 
global marketplace," according to one of the members. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, we were 100% against the sale," said member Paul Savage, who sits 
on the members' board of governors. "We didn't know who these people were." 
</P>
<P>
"But now that we know them," he adds, "there has been a great turnaround among 
the majority of members. They have been absolutely fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Just months ago, many members -- who paid as much as $25,000 to join -- were in 
an uproar over the golf cart rule. They especially feared that some of their 
elderly and infirm colleagues would have to take their golf games elsewhere, 
since they relied on the carts to help them get around the massive fairways of 
the 18-hole course. 
</P>
<P>
"There was great anger about the carts, sure," Savage recalls. "There are 
members who have been here 30 years," and they resented it. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a great apprehension by almost everyone, you know, at the time about 
the Japanese' buying of America in the first place," Savage says. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what the future would hold," recalls Joey Rosenberg, last 
year's chairman of the board. "The Japanese have bought other clubs here . . . 
and it really has negatively impacted on the membership and ambience of the 
clubs." 
</P>
<P>
With its traditions and reputation as a Los Angeles landmark, putting a sushi 
bar at the Riviera would be tantamount to sacrilege, the members say. 
</P>
<P>
Located off Sunset Boulevard below the Santa Monica Mountains, the Riviera is a 
place where legends such as Ben Hogan and Arnold Palmer tested their mettle on 
the fairways, and stars like W. C. Fields, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and 
Clark Gable teed off. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Hollywood's elite frequented the palatial clubhouse, complete 
with lavish dining room, two ballrooms and luxurious hotel suites. Legend has 
it that Errol Flynn was once arrested there after stealing the badge of an 
off-duty policeman during a dinner party. 
</P>
<P>
The Riviera has served as host of the U. S. Open and other PGA tournaments on 
occasion. Hogan has had such spectacular luck there that part of the course is 
known in golf circles as Hogan's Alley. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the club originated at the end of World War I, when members of the 
Los Angeles Athletic Club -- including the grandfather of current athletic club 
managing partners Frank and Charles Hathaway -- decided to build a club for 
returning servicemen. Since then, it has become recognized around the world not 
only as a top-flight golf course but a place where Hollywood's stars gather, an 
American icon. 
</P>
<P>
So it was not surprising that members were outraged and confused in May, 1988, 
when it was first disclosed that a mysterious group of Japanese investors 
intended to buy the Riviera for $108 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the United States was reeling from the news of Japanese purchases 
of American real estate. Japan-bashing was in vogue. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular note to the members were stories about the Japanese' obsession 
with golf, a pastime that in their native country is so exclusive that a single 
club membership costs as much as several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese had already acquired as many as a dozen courses in California and 
Hawaii, but probably none as high-profile as Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
David Shulman, director of real estate research for the Salomon Bros. 
investment banking firm, even speculated then that, "It may be cheaper for them 
to fly over to play golf at the Riviera than it is for them to play golf at 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Adding insult to injury, club owner Laaco Ltd. for a long time refused to 
identify the new purchasers. Outraged, the members rallied together and even 
established a legal defense fund to protect their rights. 
</P>
<P>
Laaco, which still owns the downtown Los Angeles Athletic Club and the 
California Yacht Club in Marina del Rey, later announced that the 
still-undisclosed buyers had decided to scale back their purchase plans and 
intended to buy only a 49% interest in the club and the adjoining Riviera 
Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
Marukin, a large Japanese real estate company, was disclosed as the mysterious 
investor in September, 1988. And last September, Marukin exercised an option to 
buy Riviera outright, and assumed full ownership of the 168-acre club. 
</P>
<P>
The initial secrecy, and the ambiguity over the deal, scared the club members. 
But Watanabe and his father, Kaneo Watanabe, immediately pledged to honor the 
club's traditions while improving the course and the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe could not be reached for comment for this article. But his on-site 
representative, Yasushi (Joe) Masaki, recalls, "There were a lot of bad, nasty 
comments and rumors, and some resistance by members." 
</P>
<P>
The new owners, however, set to work pacifying the members, telling them of 
their plans for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Of primary concern was that in recent years, the golf course had slipped a few 
notches from its place as one of the nation's 20 premiere courses, according to 
Rainer Gehres, the new general manager of the club under Marukin. 
</P>
<P>
Gehres says the strict golf cart rule was instituted as part of a comprehensive 
plan to restore the course. "It had dwindled a bit in the past. . . . Drastic 
measures were necessary," he said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
The rule, implemented Dec. 15, was anything but popular at first. The members, 
Gehres said, "were not enthusiastic. A number of them were concerned." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the board of governors rejected the rule in a lopsided, but symbolic 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the new management team was dispatching crews to begin trimming the dense 
eucalyptus trees just off the fairways, and was spending time and more than 
$100,000 meticulously manicuring the course. The tender winter grass began 
looking better almost immediately. The new owners had agreed to give special 
cart privileges to members with handicapped parking permits, and the board 
voted again last month, this time to support the cart rule. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the new rule prohibiting carts on the fairways has helped conditions at 
the course so much in just a few short months that the members now swear by it. 
</P>
<P>
The owners have added employees, spruced up the 23 tennis courts at the 
adjacent tennis club, installed a new marble floor in one ballroom and brought 
in a renowned chef for the restaurant. They even froze memberships, to allow 
the club's roster to thin out by attrition and give the members more room and 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Watanabe and his company have done such a good job overall in terms of 
sprucing things up that most members are simply gushing with compliments. 
</P>
<P>
Many members now say Noboru Watanabe's devotion to the game of golf is the 
reason why improvements to the course have been so meticulous. 
</P>
<P>
"Noboru Watanabe is an avid golfer," says Rosenberg, "and he loves this 
course." 
</P>
<P>
Gehres adds that: "The owner is so proud of this. Some people love Picassos, 
others love golf courses." 
</P>
<P>
Masaki, Watanabe's on-site liaison, agrees. He says Watanabe was a leader of 
his college golf team in Tokyo, and often watched the U. S. Open and other 
televised golf tournaments held at the Riviera. Once, he even watched the Los 
Angeles Open from the sidelines at the club. 
</P>
<P>
"He has always dreamed of playing here," says Masaki. "That small dream came 
true, but also the bigger dream that he could own such a club. It was a 
personal motivation." 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe says buying the Riviera was meant to be a highly visible first move 
into the recreation field by Marukin, which is in the final stages of building 
a lavish club in Tokyo that it plans to call the Riviera Sports Club, according 
to Masaki. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg, admittedly one of the staunchest critics of the sale, concludes that 
maybe he and other members were wrong in the beginning. "We weren't happy that 
foreign investors bought the club," he says, "but the changes that are being 
made have made it not that bad. I think to be objective about it, you have to 
take each instance and each purchase individually."

APARTMENT OWNER FINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of an apartment building in West Hollywood was fined $2,350 this week 
for a misdemeanor violation of the city's rent-control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Aroon Buranaskorn, owner of an apartment building at 938 N. Spaulding Ave., 
entered a no-contest plea in Beverly Hills Municipal Court to one count of 
violating a section of the law prohibiting landlords from soliciting 
application fees from prospective tenants, a court official said. 
</P>
<P>
The case stemmed from an October, 1989, incident in which a manager at the 
apartment accepted a $2,000 "finder's fee" from the prospective tenant, 
according to Richard Dorsey Muller, West Hollywood director of rent 
stabilization. 
</P>
<P>
Muller said Buranaskorn was charged with two counts of the violation after it 
was disclosed that the apartment manager was acting on Buranaskorn's 
instruction. The second count was dropped by Municipal Court Judge Judith O. 
Stein.

SINGER FACES PERMIT WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dirt and sand are off the beach, but singer Olivia Newton-John's troubles 
with the state Coastal Commission involving a beach home she and her husband, 
Matt Lattanzi, are building in Malibu may not be over. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Coastal Commission said this week that a decision on 
whether to cite the singer for alleged Coastal Act violations will likely be 
deferred until the couple returns to the commission for after-the-fact permits 
for completion of the home. 
</P>
<P>
In December, environmentalists complained that tons of dirt and sand were piled 
on the beach illegally during construction of a sea wall on the singer's 
property in the exclusive Paradise Cove area. They also said a permit to 
complete the work had expired Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Coastal Commission has since issued an emergency permit to complete the sea 
wall, said Nancy Cave, the agency's chief enforcement officer. However, the 
commission could decide to cite the couple for violations when they seek a 
regular permit for the work, as required by law, sometime in the next few 
months, she said.

WATER SHORTAGE PROMPTS 45-DAY BAN ON NEW HOUSING STARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council dealt a blow to builders this week as it imposed an 
immediate ban on allocations for new home construction that could delay housing 
starts until next year. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided Monday night to freeze allocations for 45 days, and 
may decide on a similar freeze in late March, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The lone critic was Councilman James Monahan, who said he voted against the 
moratorium because he felt it was unfair to developers who have waited for 
years in the often lengthy process to receive allocations to build. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan said other council members wanted to impose a moratorium in the guise 
of a delay on allocations. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see the need to do that. We can halt the allocation review any time 
we want," Monahan said. "This is a de facto moratorium. You've got to call it 
what it is." 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was adopted to give the city a temporary reprieve to review a 
population growth plan in the face of growth that is already outstripping 
projections and straining city services. 
</P>
<P>
With the city facing its most critical water shortage in 25 years, council 
members said, they also wanted to avoid depleting water supplies by permitting 
more homes to be built. 
</P>
<P>
"The thinly veiled suggestion is that we're trying to put a limit on growth, 
and this is the device," Councilman Donald Villeneuve said. "But we can't just 
sit here like Alfred E. Newman -- 'What me worry?' " 
</P>
<P>
Before the freeze is lifted, the city will have to significantly revise its 
allocation program, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The housing allocation plan must pass environmental muster before it reaches 
the City Council, which could delay allocations another 45 days or more, said 
Everett Millais, community development director. Another hearing to extend the 
45-day freeze is likely, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Planning officials are already three months behind in the housing review 
process after the City Council last October delayed a decision on a city 
housing allocation plan. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the moratorium is lifted, developers will have to vie for fewer 
permits than were available in the past. According to a proposal presented to 
the City Council last October, the number of building permits could be cut by 
almost two-thirds and they could be issued every other year, Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1989, the city issued 5,198 permits, an average of 520 a year. 
A major revision in the growth plan is to limit the number of units available 
for residential projects to 1,850 up to the year 2000, or to 185 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Population in the city has grown by 18,700 since 1980, and projections indicate 
it is already exceeding forecasts for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
There are already 92,500 people living within city limits, but officials also 
have to plan for people who live in unincorporated areas served by city 
services, which would bring the population up to 97,400, Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
Population can increase only by about 4,600 in the next 10 years if growth is 
to be limited to 102,000 people. If more water supplies are provided, the city 
can reach 105,000. 
</P>
<P>
Developers say the moratorium has had a chilling effect on their businesses, 
and coupled with a proposed temporary ban on water hookups, projects they 
assumed were already blessed with allocations face an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
In the first delay of a housing project since the freeze was ordered, City 
Council members Monday night put a 98-unit project on hold pending a proposed 
measure to limit water hookups. 
</P>
<P>
A representative for Weston Development of Los Angeles said the project 
received permits to build last July, but city officials put off a zoning 
decision until this year when the water shortage was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Until the building ban is lifted, another 200 units in the project will have to 
be put on hold, Weston representative Chuck Cohan said. Delays in building mean 
construction crews may have to be laid off temporarily, then rehired later at 
higher cost. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes for discontinuous construction, and it means higher-priced homes" for 
buyers, Cohan said.

PARK LABREA GATES CLOSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gates of Park Labrea will begin closing Feb. 20, according to the general 
manager of the 10,000-resident apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Once open to the public, Park Labrea's labyrinthine streets will only be 
accessible to residents, guests, workers and emergency vehicles once the 
security system is functioning. 
</P>
<P>
Guards at three staffed gates will start monitoring visitors at 11 a.m. on 
Tuesday, Feb. 20, but 11 automatic gates will not close until 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to see how it functions," General Manager Francis Heavey said. "Of 
course, we'll practice with them during the day, to make sure they work. For 
the first 30 days it will be very loose, to see what the problems are. 
Hopefully, it'll work out fine."

Forest City Enterprises Inc., which owns half-interest in Park Labrea and 
manages the property, has applied to pass on the cost of more than $3 million 
under the city's rent stabilization rules, but the Park Labrea Tenants Assn. 
filed a protest. The city has yet to rule on the matter.

CITY TO SEEK FUNDS FOR FREEWAY SOUND BARRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bellflower City Council has voted to look for money to build a freeway 
sound wall near a parochial school, because the city does not want to wait 10 
years for the state Department of Transportation to do it. 
</P>
<P>
The city wants a sound wall along a five-block stretch of the Artesia (91) 
Freeway between Woodruff and Clark avenues to buffer traffic noise for St. 
Bernard Catholic Church and the 305 students who attend its school. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans already has agreed to pay for and build the wall, but there is a 
10-year waiting list of projects with higher priority. The city approved a 
resolution predicting that the $2.3-million project could be built within two 
years with financial help from the county and the state. Caltrans said it will 
reimburse the city for building the wall when state money becomes available in 
about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a promise for a wall. It's a promise that they will seek funding for 
a wall," said parent Melissa Mosley, who has led the campaign for a sound wall 
the last three months. "But it's the best thing we've heard. At least the city 
is working on it." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials have determined that the noise levels in St. Bernard 
classrooms exceed limits set by law and are now working with the archdiocese to 
begin soundproofing.

TAX HEARING DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After hours of late-night testimony from dozens of residents, the West 
Hollywood City Council delayed a public hearing on a proposed business-license 
tax until Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 small-business owners and residents appeared at the meeting 
Monday night to oppose the long-expected tax. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed tax would be levied annually based on business classification and 
estimated gross receipts. Under a proposed gross revenue structure, businesses 
earning $100,000 a year would pay $48. The tax would be determined on a 
graduated scale, and businesses with gross receipts of more than $10 million 
would pay as much as $14,000. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the proposed tax would be used for capital improvement projects, 
such as parking structures and a new fire station, said City Manager Paul 
Brotzman. 
</P>
<P>
The West Hollywood Chamber of Commerce is opposing the tax, and has marshaled 
neighborhood groups to fight it.

<P>
Five candidates, including two incumbents, will vie for three seats on the 
Huntington Park City Council in the April 10 municipal election, a city 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents William P. Cunningham and Jim Roberts, and challengers Raul Perez, 
Luis Hernandez and Alan Kartsman entered the race before the initial filing 
deadline on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
That deadline was extended for five days -- until last Tuesday -- when 
Councilman Herbert A. Hennes Jr. decided not to seek reelection. No new 
candidates came forward during the five-day extension period.

Gov. George Deukmejian has signed a bill that will allow the city to change the 
date of its City Council election to avoid conflicting with the Jewish festival 
of Passover. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was authored by state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), in 
response to complaints from constituents and city officials that the normal 
Election Day, April 10, was the first day of Passover. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills City Clerk Jean M. Ushijima said her office was unable to obtain

COUNCIL STUDIES LEGAL STEPS TO DETER MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Long Beach has been largely spared from aerial spraying to fight the 
recent Medfly infestation in Los Angeles County, the City Council has asked the 
city attorney's office to investigate possible legal action to keep Long Beach 
off limits to malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was raised by Councilman Les Robbins, whose office has received about 
100 calls from residents concerned about spraying in the Lakewood Village area, 
according to one of Robbins' aides. 
</P>
<P>
The council will consider the issue Feb. 20 when it will ask state and county 
agricultural representatives as well as opponents of the malathion spraying to 
discuss the pesticide use. The city attorney also will report on possible 
courses of legal action.

ABSENTEE VOTERS HELP HILL TO WIN GOP NOMINATION FOR STATE SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Frank Hill put together his victory in Tuesday's Senate election 
with the help of absentee ballots and hard-core Los Angeles County Republicans 
unwilling to believe attacks on his ethics, according to political consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier Republican, who since 1988 has been the target of an FBI political 
corruption investigation, led a field of eight candidates. Because Hill failed 
to win 50% of the vote, he will face Janice Graham of Laguna Hills, the top 
Democratic vote-getter, in an April 10 runoff to fill the vacancy created by 
the decision of state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) to leave 
office. 
</P>
<P>
With Republicans holding an edge of 54% to 36% among registered voters, Hill is 
widely believed to have the inside track at winning the runoff in the sprawling 
31st Senate District, which stretches from West Covina and Whittier in the 
north to Laguna Beach in the south. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of a Hill victory in April, seven candidates already have lined 
up to run for his 52nd Assembly District seat in the June 5 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
Sal Russo, Hill's campaign consultant, said attacks against Hill "lacked 
credibility." Voters in the Whittier area, which Hill has represented in the 
Assembly for eight years, "knew him too well" for the criticism to undermine 
his reputation, Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial results were: Hill, 15,043 votes, or 22.8%; Gil Ferguson, 
14,123, or 21.4%; Ron Isles, 11,827, or 18%; Gary Miller, 10,310, or 15.6%; 
Graham, 9,357, or 14.2%; Bradley McFadden, 3,056, or 4.6%; Thomas Whaling, 
1,489, or 2.3%; and Robert Lewis, 683, or 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of Hill's votes came from absentee ballots, according to election 
officials in Orange and Los Angeles counties. Orange County officials Wednesday 
said they were still counting another 500 absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Russo acknowledged that "the absentees certainly were a help." Of Hill's 
absentee ballots, 5,559 or about 70% were cast in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate campaign was the third special election in recent months where 
absentee ballots played an important role. 
</P>
<P>
Last week in Modesto, Democrat Sal Canella won a special Assembly election on a 
heavy tide of mail-in ballots. Canella was running to fill a vacancy created by 
the election of Assemblyman Gary Condit (D-Ceres) to Congress. Condit, too, 
fashioned his victory four months ago with a heavy reliance on absentee 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Englander, a campaign consultant to Republican Isles, a Brea city 
councilman, said Hill's campaign was able to get off to a faster start than 
other candidates in encouraging voters to file absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Englander cited a letter Hill mailed early in the campaign that erroneously 
implied that he had been endorsed by former Sen. Campbell. The letter included 
an absentee ballot application, which Englander and other consultants said 
could have provided a boost to Hill's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in the outcome was a last-minute mailer sent out by a 
Sacramento-based Republican group to promote Democrat Graham's candidacy, 
Englander said. Sources said the purpose had been to help Hill by heading off 
Democrats who might defect to Isles over the abortion issue. Isles was the only 
pro-choice Republican in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gouty, a consultant to Republican Miller, a Diamond Bar city councilman, 
said the low turnout of 17% and the number of hard-core Republicans who did 
vote played a pivotal role in the result. "They will generally vote for some 
sort of incumbent," Gouty said. Hill already represents "a large part of the 
district," and many Republicans in Los Angeles County treated him as the 
incumbent, Gouty said. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic legislative staffers privately have dismissed the chances of Graham 
or any other Democrat of winning the runoff because of the Republicans 
registration edge. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt at all, (Hill will) win the runoff," Englander agreed. But, he 
maintained, if Hill is indicted in the political corruption investigation "all 
bets are off," and there could be a write-in campaign mounted by another 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
American Independent Party candidate Robert Lewis will also be in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, seven Republicans, including Hill, have filed papers indicating 
their intention to run for the 52nd Assembly District. A Hill campaign official 
indicated that Hill's filing was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The other Republicans who have filed are Kenneth Manning, a member of the 
Hacienda-La Puente Unified School District who said Stuart Spencer, an adviser 
to former President Reagan, will oversee his campaign; Wil Baca and Jim Baker, 
both of Hacienda Heights; Jack Dortignac of West Covina; Phil Mautino of 
Whittier and Tony Russo, a former aide to Hill. 
</P>
<P>
One Democrat, Gary Neely of Diamond Bar, has filed papers with the county to 
run for the seat.

COUNCIL DELAYS WATER CONSERVATION LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday postponed adoption of a conservation 
ordinance that would reduce water consumption during a drought and changes 
water rates to reward low water users and increase cost on larger users. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement came after a spokeswoman for the Forest Lawn Memorial Park 
asked the council to incorporate language to exclude reclaimed water from the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Glendale is building a pipeline from its sewage treatment plant to 
the cemetery, which has agreed to purchase the treated water to irrigate its 
sprawling, manicured lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposal, the typical residential customer would see a monthly 
water bill rise by 72 cents to $45.80 for 2,000 cubic feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
But those who use 1,000 cubic feet would see a bill reduced by $2.10 to $24.50, 
Public Service Director W.E. Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
In times of drought, the council would be empowered to activate a five-step 
plan that would call for saving up to 25% of the water each customer normally 
uses. Any excess use would be penalized by a surcharge of twice the basic water 
rate.

3-YEAR BINGO LICENSE PROPOSAL FAILS;

<P>
CUDAHY: IN A FIERY TWO-HOUR SESSION, THE CITY COUNCIL FAILS TO ACT ON NINE 
CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSALS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bitterly divided City Council struggled through a two-hour session punctuated 
by shouting, table-pounding and name-calling. Some council members accused 
colleagues of lying. They accused each other of playing political games and 
ignoring the needs of the town. 
</P>
<P>
Even the audience got into the act, heckling council members. One member of the 
audience even told a councilman to "shut up." 
</P>
<P>
When it was all over Monday, nine controversial proposals being considered by 
the council -- including a plan to grant three-year bingo licenses -- failed to 
make it off the table. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, down one member after Tom Thurman resigned last week -- 
deadlocked on several controversial issues, perhaps signaling the tone of 
future council meetings through the April municipal election. 
</P>
<P>
Two proposals, which failed on 2-2 votes, would have set up a new food and 
clothing distribution program for the needy. Two other agenda proposals, which 
would have penalized city employees who get involved in political and smear 
campaigns, never reached a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Colon, without comment, withdrew a proposal to hire a new city 
manager -- a proposal described by critics as an attempt to oust acting City 
Manager Jack Joseph for denying a three-year bingo license to a business 
acquaintance of Colon. The councilman said later that he withdrew the proposal 
because he knew it would fail. 
</P>
<P>
Council members had predicted before the meeting that little would be 
accomplished, and it became clear almost immediately that their instincts were 
correct. The council couldn't even approve the minutes of the previous meeting 
-- ordinarily a routine function. Councilman Joseph Fregeau questioned why the 
minutes included a reference to a council action that the city attorney later 
said was beyond the council's authority. The four councilmen deadlocked over 
the minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The most heated debates came during consideration of the proposed three-year 
bingo license and two proposals concerning social services in Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
Colon proposed an amendment to a city ordinance to allow for three-year bingo 
licenses. Though the new ordinance would have benefited all qualified 
applicants, only Compton businessman John Mgrdichian holds a license to operate 
bingo games in Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
Mgrdichian is president of a charitable organization called the Social Service 
Foundation, which plans to use proceeds from bingo games to fund social service 
agencies. The foundation has a license to operate a 450-seat bingo parlor on 
Santa Ana Street, but the license will expire in August, before the parlor is 
expected to open. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Colon was a strong council proponent of a plan by Mgrdichian to 
set up bingo games to fund the Cudahy Social Service Agency, which provided 
food and clothing to needy residents. Colon served briefly as a director of 
Mgrdichian's foundation. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's meeting, Joseph, the acting city manager, recommended that the 
council turn down the proposal for a three-year license, contending that a 
one-year license would make it easier for the city to ensure that the Social 
Service Foundation is still meeting the terms of its license from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
Both Colon and John Robertson have argued that Mgrdichian, who did not attend 
the meeting and who was never mentioned by name, has a substantial investment 
in the bingo parlor and should have some assurance that his license would not 
be threatened by a change in City Council members in the April 10 election. 
Mayor Joseph Graffio and Colon are up for reelection. The seat vacated by 
Thurman also is on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Fregeau said he believed that "those on the council pushing (for a three-year 
license) could well be expecting to receive favors in return. One of those 
favors could be financial help in the coming election and future elections." 
</P>
<P>
He described the proposed three-year bingo license as a "manipulating tactic" 
ultimately aimed at establishing a card parlor. He said Robertson and Colon 
have spoken out several times in favor of a second card parlor in addition to 
one scheduled to open later this year. 
</P>
<P>
He was interrupted by Colon, who stood up and shouted: "You are a liar! I want 
that on the record! This man is a liar!" 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Graffio then slammed the gavel and told Robertson, who was beginning to 
speak, to "shut up." Robertson said he had a right to speak and told Graffio to 
"shut up." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal failed on a 2-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Another argument broke out when Graffio asked that a $350-a-month contract for 
distributing food to the needy be awarded to the Bell Gardens Human Services 
Assn. The food-distribution program had been operated out of a city-owned 
building by the Cudahy Social Service Agency, which last month was served with 
an eviction notice and has since stopped the distributions. 
</P>
<P>
Graffio said that if the contract were awarded, the Human Services Assn. would 
hand out food to Cudahy residents every month from the city's Leo P. Turner 
Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said he was concerned about the proposal because political material 
has been distributed at the community center, the headquarters for the senior 
citizen's club. Fregeau and Graffio, who are members of the club, denied 
Robertson's accusation. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not so, John," Fregeau said. "You are a liar." 
</P>
<P>
Graffio, who is running for reelection on the same ticket as two officers of 
the senior citizen club, denied any political material had been distributed at 
the community center. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal failed, 2-2, leaving Cudahy without a local food distribution 
program for its low-income residents. Susanne Sundberg, executive director of 
the Human Services Assn., said Cudahy residents who qualify can get an 
emergency food distribution from the Bell Gardens agency, but would not be 
eligible for a regular, monthly food distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"Until they (council members) get their own business in order, I have no idea 
where these people are going to go," Sundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also split over a Colon proposal to put the city in charge of the 
Cudahy Social Service Agency's food-distribution program, and to hire the 
agency's former director, James Graham, as manager. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents later criticized the council. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the meeting) was just like a bunch of kindergarten kids fighting over 
jacks and balls," said resident Georgia Scrivner, who last year launched a 
recall effort against Fregeau and Robertson. She has announced plans to 
withdraw the recall attempt against Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
The council did agree Monday on some agenda items. 
</P>
<P>
A list of federally funded programs for low-income city residents was approved, 
as was a proposal to set up polling locations for the April 10 elections. 
</P>
<P>
And the council proclaimed the week of March 12-18 "Camp Fire Birthday Week."

SANTA PAULA: A LAND-CONVERSION STUDY APPROVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL AND PAID FOR

<P>
Eager to preserve their predominantly rural community, nearly 200 Santa Paula 
residents packed a City Council meeting this week to oppose possible 
development of 500 acres of prime agricultural land. 
</P>
<P>
A study being performed by STA of Newport Beach will help decide the future of 
the privately owned land that lies to the west of city boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Every citizen of Santa Paula knows and recognizes that the essence and core of 
Santa Paula's quality as a community is its environmental character and every 
citizen who has any pride in the community points proudly to the beauty and 
bounty of our agriculture," said lifetime resident Tom Beach, who owns citrus 
and avocado groves on the city's east side. 
</P>
<P>
"A proposal to condemn 500 prime acres to a housing development is a gut punch 
to the environmental character of the town," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County developer Harry Tancredi, president of Circle T Corp. in Santa 
Ana, provided the City Council with a $187,000 interest-free loan for the land 
study in October. 
</P>
<P>
The deal worried some residents because Tancredi is interested in building 
between 120 and 150 upscale houses in the section. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Les Maland, who at one point threatened to clear the room, reminded 
Monday night's crowd that the city is under no obligation to annex the land or 
to permit development. 
</P>
<P>
His words did little to mollify the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Proctor, a spokesman for the recently created Citizens for Responsible 
Development, called on the council to cancel its contract with STA. 
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that the City Council had not adequately informed residents 
about Santa Paula's plans for growth. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Kay Wilson responded that citizen concern was being expressed too 
late and said residents could have learned of the plans by reading the paper. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd greeted her comments with a resounding chorus of boos. 
</P>
<P>
Another public hearing on the plan is scheduled for Feb. 27.

STUDENTS TOLD TO BEWARE OF INVITATIONS FOR LISTINGS IN HONOR ROLL-TYPE BOOKS

<P>
Officials of the Long Beach Unified School District are warning students to 
beware of invitations to be listed in honor roll-type books that cost between 
$29 and $35. 
</P>
<P>
"The implied message is that if you buy the book and you have your name in 
there, it helps you get an academic scholarship or an athletic scholarship or 
get into a college," said Richard G. Van Der Laan, the district's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Students and their parents should be leery of such offers, officials said. "Now 
is the season. It begins now and lasts through June," Van Der Laan said. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Education last fall advised all school districts to 
stop providing information about students -- such as addresses and school 
activities -- to companies that market who's who-type books. 
</P>
<P>
State officials surveyed college admission directors across the country and 
concluded that inclusion in student directories that are compiled for a profit 
do not improve a student's chance for college admission, Van Der Laan said.

HOOVER ALUMNUS HILLMAN DECIDES TO TAKE BEST SHOT IN AUSTRALIAN PRO LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER

<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Hillman is down but not out. Down Under, that is. 
</P>
<P>
After surviving the Utah Jazz's training camp until the final cut, Hillman has 
decided to pursue a career with the Melbourne Raging Giants in an Australian 
professional basketball league. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale-area players Don Bickett of Glendale High and Kevin and Brian Goorjian 
of Crescenta Valley previously played in the league. Andrew Gaze, a former 
Seton Hall standout, currently plays in it. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman, a standout in basketball and baseball at Hoover High and the 
University of Indiana, previously played baseball in the Oakland Athletics' 
organization but was not offered a contract this year. He took a hiatus from 
baseball last summer to play with the Jazz's summer-league team at Loyola 
Marymount. He had also spoken to representatives from the Cedar Rapids Bullets 
of the Continental Basketball Association. 
</P>
<P>
During his senior season at Hoover, Hillman averaged 41.3 points a game -- then 
the third-best average in Southern Section history -- and finished with 2,213 
points. 
</P>
<P>
What dry is: The Crescenta Valley High gym was packed a week ago for the 
Pasadena game. It was, so far, the most crucial Pacific League basketball game 
of the season, pitting the first-place Bulldogs against Crescenta Valley, tied 
for second with Muir. 
</P>
<P>
The joint was rocking. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley, meanwhile, was bricking. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons missed 17 of their first 18 attempts from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"They were good shots," Crescenta Valley Coach John Goffredo said. "They were 
just rimming out, rimming out, rimming out." 
</P>
<P>
Goffredo's team weathered the first-quarter drought and won in double overtime, 
60-59. 
</P>
<P>
New life: While the Occidental College men have struggled, other Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference basketball teams have made 
positive strides. No conference member has made a more impressive turnaround 
than La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Leopards were 5-21, 0-10 in conference play. They have 
improved to 15-5 this season and at 5-2 in the conference are a half-game 
behind first-place Whittier. Coach Gary Stewart says opposing coaches are just 
starting to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
Not of the turnaround, of the school. 
</P>
<P>
"We had coaches calling our office for directions to our place last year," 
Stewart said with a laugh. "They didn't know how to get here. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been here for a hundred years, but it's like, 'Hey, they started a new 
university out in La Verne.' "

TAX RULING MAY LEAD TO SMALLER COUNTY JAIL; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 13: VENTURA COUNTY OFFICIALS MAY SCALE BACK 768-BED FACILITY TO 480 BEDS 
AND TAP OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING.

<P>
A Sacramento judge's ruling that a half-cent sales tax is unconstitutional 
could force Ventura County officials to reduce the size of a planned new jail, 
Sheriff's Department officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County supervisors said Tuesday that they are not relying exclusively 
on revenues generated by the half-cent sales tax to build the $41-million jail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a setback," Supervisor Maggie Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
But law enforcement officials disagreed with that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Monday by Sacramento Superior Court Judge James T. Ford strikes down 
state legislation establishing an agency to pay off construction bonds used to 
build jails. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation introduced by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) 
affected six counties: Humboldt, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino 
and Ventura. Counties had proposed creating a jail facilities commission to 
collect and spend tax revenues. The half-cent sales tax would have generated up 
to $25 million in revenues for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
To impose the half-cent tax in Ventura County, the Board of Supervisors would 
have had to place the measure before the voters. Passage would have required a 
simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., in a lawsuit filed last October, charged 
that the creation of a special agency to impose the half-cent tax violates 
Proposition 13's requirement of two-thirds' voter approval of tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
"We were delighted with the ruling. We think it was just a sham device to 
circumvent Proposition 13," said Joel Fox, president of the taxpayers' 
association based in Los Angeles. "The courts saw that clearly." 
</P>
<P>
The association argued that local agencies already have the authority to impose 
taxes on voters. 
</P>
<P>
"What I believe is going on is they're trying to be creative to get around the 
two-thirds vote," Fox said. "They're spending their time finding loopholes 
instead of convincing the people they need these facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors said that getting voter support for a tax increase is almost 
impossible. Taxpayers have opposed measures to provide new jails to house 
increasing numbers of prisoners, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"People want law and order, but they don't think about the cost of jails and 
the cost of operating jails," Supervisor Madge Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision has not killed hope in the half-cent tax measure. 
Officials from Ventura and other counties named in the legislation are 
reviewing the judge's decision and considering what appeals can be filed, 
Ventura Asst. County Counsel Daniel Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably be in contact with the counties as to how we're going to 
proceed in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding at county jails has forced the Ventura County Sheriff's Department 
to fill cells at three times their capacity. Population at the county jail 
built for 400 inmates is running at more than 1,100, said Cmdr. Don Lanquist, 
in charge of jail planning for the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
With the elimination of the tax as a potential source of revenues, officials 
say, they may have to scale down the size of the jail project. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to build, we just won't be able to build as much as the needs 
assessment indicates," Ventura County Assistant Sheriff Richard Bryce said. 
"We'll build a 480-bed jail instead of a 768-bed jail that we need." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County supervisors have suggested other programs to reduce jail 
overcrowding, including expanding the work furlough program, introducing 
electronic surveillance devices to allow prisoners to stay at home and holding 
prisoners in tents. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John Flynn said the judge's ruling was disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
"The money for construction of a new jail is there, but we have to have money 
to operate the jails, and if you can't add money from revenues like sales taxes 
for example, there's no other place to get it except . . . to take it from 
other operations," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn said he will bring up his suggestion to add onto existing facilities as a 
way to cut jail costs.

OXNARD CITIZENS' PANEL ON FINANCES RETURNS WITHOUT SUGGESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stressing the need for a thorough investigation of Oxnard's budget practices, a 
citizens finance committee told the City Council this week it could make no 
formal recommendations for solving the current financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Ad Hoc Citizens Financial Advisory Committee was created by the City 
Council in September to study ways to generate revenue, including a special 
utility tax, and to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
But four months later, the 27 committee members said they could not make any 
suggestions without information from a management audit that is to be completed 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for all intents and purposes, the committee is done," Committee 
Chairman Ralph Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the final report includes five interim reports done by subcommittees 
throughout the fall. None of the recommendations included in those subcommittee 
reports was voted on or forwarded as a final recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ad Hoc Citizen Advisory Committee's investigation has not been finished; 
therefore, our task is still incomplete," the committee report said. "For this 
reason the committee feels it would be imprudent to present a recommendation to 
you at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this fall, the committee pushed for a thorough management audit, the 
first phase of which will include a review of revenue and expense projections 
for the next five years. It should be completed by the end of this month. The 
second phase will look at job duties and communication between city employees. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 3 to 2 Tuesday to hire Cresap Management Consultants for 
the first phase of the audit. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi and Councilman Manuel Lopez opposed awarding the contract to 
Cresap on the basis that the company's bid for both phases of the project -- 
about $250,000 -- was almost twice as much as the next lowest bid. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of formal recommendations, the finance committee did agree on 
some basic issues, including Oxnard's "very possible need for additional 
revenues," Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the 27 committee members -- including present and former City Council 
members, finance experts and interested citizens -- were split on how to 
produce those additional revenues, Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said Oxnard may need to reorganize its staff. The committee 
agreed that police and fire protection were the services most important to city 
residents and that the public must be made aware of how its money is being 
used, Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
When people were appointed to the committee, they believed they could come up 
with a unified recommendation in four months, Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
They intended to make recommendations based on three six-year budget scenarios 
prepared by Oxnard staff. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee never used those documents, losing faith in the estimates 
made by city staff as more mistakes in the budget came to light, Schumacher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council reduced department budgets and eliminated more than 16 city 
positions to slash the budget by $1 million after discovering that estimates of 
revenues for the 1988-89 fiscal year were $2 million too high. At the same 
time, it was disclosed that the city had exceeded its 1988-89 budget by 
$850,000. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard announced a surprise refund of $1.4 million from the state. And a week 
later, the council voted to oust its city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't just take the information in the book just like that and be a 
rubber stamp for it," Schumacher said. "It wasn't a rubber stamp committee." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the committee embarked on its own long and arduous fact-finding 
mission, personally questioning 11 department heads, Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot more difficult as we went along," Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendations found in the interim reports include developing a citizens 
group to funnel information between the City Council and the public, creating 
street lighting assessment districts and licensing the operation of boat 
facilities in city waters. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has no intention of meeting again, Schumacher said. However, it 
may do so at the City Council's request after the management audit is 
completed.

LA CANADA GIVES TENTATIVE OK TO LAND DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The La Canada Flintridge City Council has tentatively approved a development 
agreement with the Flintridge Estates Partnership that may enable the city to 
purchase 36.5 acres of undeveloped land for use as public open space. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 0 to approve the agreement and certify a final draft of 
an environmental impact report, prepared for the developer by an Orange County 
firm, at a public hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ed Phelps, whose former business partner is the developer's 
representative, abstained because of a potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price for the property is $1.75 million, of which the city would 
pay $750,000. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state agency, would pay 
$1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The parcel is part of a 47-acre site known locally as the Sugar Loaf 
Subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would allow the present owners to develop a nine-lot subdivision 
on the remaining portion. The subdivision proposal next goes before the 
Planning Commission for further hearings.

FISHERMEN TO PLACE SALMON IN HARBOR; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: THE GROUP PLANS TO PUT 50,000 FISH IN OCEAN WATERS. IT IS THE FIRST 
SUCH ATTEMPT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>

<P>
Ventura County fishermen are putting the finishing touches on a project to 
bring 50,000 king salmon to Oxnard's Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
In the first such attempt in Southern California, the Ventura County chapter of 
the United Anglers of California Research Institute will introduce the fish 
into ocean waters. 
</P>
<P>
If the project is successful, fishermen say, it could bring a major sport 
fishing business to Ventura County and set a trend for areas of Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
"It could become a multimillion-dollar industry," said James Donlon, chairman 
of the Ventura County chapter. "The project has the potential for establishing 
a fishery that will be mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
Such a venture would eliminate the need for people to leave Ventura County to 
fish in Oregon, Washington or Mexico, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of three rearing pens to be attached to the Cisco docks in 
Oxnard's Channel Islands Harbor is scheduled to be completed within a month. 
Each wooden pen, supported on plastic floats, will measure 16 feet by 16 feet 
and sink to a depth of 8 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The fish will be reared in the pens for about five months until they weigh 
about a quarter of a pound and are about 10 inches long. Then they will be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The salmon should return to the area in two to three years when they are mature 
fish, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
The harbor was pronounced fit for fish after being tested for the level of 
dissolved oxygen in the water.

ERRANT BULLETS ANGER OXNARD MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jody Jones was stunned last month when a bullet pierced her living room roof 
and hit the floor about a foot away from where she and her husband had been 
watching television moments before. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, another resident in Oxnard's Colony Mobile Home Park sent for 
a repairman to fix a leak in her bathroom ceiling and discovered that the hole 
had been made by a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
These may sound like freak occurrences. But Ardys Hardin, president of the 
150-unit homeowners' association at the mobile home park, told the City Council 
this week that they are becoming all too common. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really scared," Hardin said, dangling a collection of plastic bags, 
each holding a .38-caliber, copper-jacketed bullet. "We're thinking, 'Next 
year, what are we going to do -- hide under our beds?' " 
</P>
<P>
While the damage is caused mostly on New Year's Eve, when people celebrate by 
firing guns in the strawberry fields around the park near Pleasant Valley Road, 
residents have begun to worry about upcoming holidays. 
</P>
<P>
They are afraid it is only a matter of time before someone is killed. 
</P>
<P>
Ten people have reported finding bullets this month. Others have thrown the 
bullets away, believing that no one will do anything about them, Hardin said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Manuel Lopez said the city has a history of such problems. The City 
Council has asked Police Chief Robert Owens to look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Hardin said she would like to see officers patrol the nearby fields during 
holidays. She said she has a plan if her pleas go unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to issue a formal invitation to everyone in higher offices to come 
to a yard party here to celebrate the Fourth of July," she said.

UCLA/TIMES GYMNASTICS CONTEST SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Illinois, defending NCAA champion in men's gymnastics, and four other teams 
that finished in the top 10 at last year's NCAA meet, will be featured in the 
annual UCLA/Los Angeles Times invitational at 7 p.m. Saturday at Pauley 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Other teams include second-place Nebraska, No. 3 Minnesota, No. 4 UCLA, No. 8 
Arizona State and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois won the invitational last year, ending UCLA's six-year reign as 
champion, and Nebraska finished second. 
</P>
<P>
Top individuals include Patrick Kirksey of Nebraska, defending NCAA and UCLA 
invitational champion in the all-around; Minnesota's Mark McKiernan, who won 
the pommel horse in the 1989 invitational, and UCLA's Chris Waller, who tied 
for first in the pommel horse at last year's NCAA's. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked UCLA men's volleyball team (6-0 overall at the start of the 
week) will play this weekend in the George Mason University tournament at 
American University in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Bruins will open against Ball State, and George Mason will play 
Navy. Consolation and championship matches will be played Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Bruins raised their record in the Western Intercollegiate 
Volleyball Assn. to 3-0 with three-game victories over UC Irvine and Loyola 
Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Against Irvine, senior Mike Garcia had 10 kills and Trevor Schirman added six 
blocks. Against Loyola, freshman Rich Bland had a career-high 16 kills, and 
Schirman had nine kills and eight blocks.

Tuesday at Firestone Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Waves lost in Malibu to Cal State Northridge in three games, but 
defeated Penn State twice on the road, each time in four games. 
</P>
<P>
Against Northridge, junior outside hitter Geoff Hart had 22 kills, and freshman 
middle blocker Tom Sorenson had 15 kills. In the first match against Penn 
State, Brian Merrick had 17 kills and freshman outside hitter Duane Cameron 16. 
Sorenson had 20 kills in the second match against the Nittany Lions. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball team at Pepperdine (1-2) will open West Coast Conference play with 
a three-game series at home this weekend with the University of San Francisco 
and play UCLA at 1 p.m. Sunday at Jackie Robinson Stadium in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves will play host to USF at 2 p.m. Friday and in a double-header that 
starts at 11 a.m. Saturday at Eddy D. Field Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
They opened the season last week with an 8-5 victory over Westmont but lost two 
games to top-ranked USC, 6-5 in 10 innings and 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine freshman first baseman Dan Melendez hit a home run in his debut 
against Westmont and is batting a team-high .636. Senior catcher Mike Truschke 
is hitting .444, and senior third baseman Jim Doyle and junior right fielder 
Jalal Leach are each batting .385. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA men's tennis Coach Glenn Bassett became the first active coach in NCAA 
Division I ranks to reach 500 career victories last week when his No. 3 Bruins 
(7-0) defeated Washington, 5-2.

SURFACE CATCHES HAVE COOLED OFF, BUT ROCK COD IS STILL HOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Winter weather conditions have slowed surface fishing, but rock cod action 
hasn't been affected. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay anglers have been bagging cod limits in 200 to 600 feet of water 
using three-pound weights. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach anglers Tom Murphy and Bob Tyler, who fish at least once a week on 
the Southern Cal from Long Beach Sportfishing, test their angling skills in 
friendly competition with each other. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy says that when he comes up with a heavy fish and is sure it will be the 
jackpot winner, Tyler brings up a bigger one. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler, laughing, says it is his strategy. He goes down with a five-hook ganion 
and leaves it on the bottom while he baits up another ganion. After cranking up 
his catch from the deep, rather than lose time, he detaches the whole ganion 
and puts on the extra baited one to go back down quickly. 
</P>
<P>
He proceeds this way until his limit is aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler fishes next to Murphy and four out of five trips he wins the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
Several other anglers who are often on the cod trips all agree they limit out 
on most trips and easily fill their freezers with tasty bottom fish. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Kruse of Long Beach returned from a 16-day, long-range trip aboard the 
Polaris and won the jackpot with a 114-pound yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Dooley of Long Beach was also a long-range jackpot winner fishing aboard 
the Qualifier 105 when he landed a 154-pound, 7-ounce yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Pam Pena of Torrance, fishing aboard the Sea Spray while 
drifting at twin roads, caught the whopper of the week, a 31-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Tyler of Long Beach, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Southern Cal, 
won the jackpot with a 25-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Harry C. Wang of West Los Angeles caught an 18-pound yellowtail fishing at 
Catalina aboard the Outerlimits. 
</P>
<P>
Don Haynes of Lawndale, fishing from his boat Fisheret in Santa Monica Bay, 
caught a 10-pound, 4-ounce halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Weather has been a factor but when boats do go out, anglers' 
catches have been rated good. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire's anglers scored with 240 sculpin, 
one halibut and one sole. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O rock cod special worked the short banks and anglers caught 200 rock 
cod and two halibut. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray, fishing twin roads, returned with 25 
sand bass, 18 halibut and 15 sculpin. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackjack fished cherry bank and anglers sacked 160 rock cod and nine cow 
cod. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Special on a half-day trip for rock cod in shallow rocks returned 
with 300. 
</P>
<P>
At 22nd Street Landing: The Monte Carlo fished the rockpile and chalked up 87 
sculpin, 57 rockfish and seven sheepshead. 
</P>
<P>
The Diawa, on a trip to the cherry bank with live squid, sacked 375 rock cod 
and six cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
At L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Shogun worked San Clemente Island and anglers 
caught a variety -- 156 calico bass, 110 blue perch, 54 rockfish, 47 sheepshead 
and 10 yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Outerlimits checked out Catalina and returned with 145 calico bass, 110 
rockfish and 66 sheepshead. 
</P>
<P>
The Annie B barge had a weekend count of 620 jacksmelt and 430 kingfish. 
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach Sportfishing: The Southern Cal half-day trip to the horseshoe 
kelp had a catch of 46 whitefish, 41 sculpin and 39 rockfish.

CENTER LIKES BLOCKS MORE THAN SHOTS; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: LOYOLA'S TRICIA GIBSON IS TIED FOR THE LEAD IN BLOCKED SHOTS IN THE 
WCC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a hawk seeking prey, Tricia Gibson of Loyola Marymount roamed the shiny 
Gersten Pavilion court, arms high to block a three-point shot that could cost 
her team the game. 
</P>
<P>
With about two seconds left a Portland player tried to get one off. Gibson's 
right hand swatted the ball to the floor, and Loyola escaped with a 64-62 win. 
</P>
<P>
The feat was nothing unusual for the 6-foot-3 junior. It was another shot 
rejection for the co-leading shot blocker in the West Coast Conference. Gibson 
led the conference in blocked shots until last weekend when San Diego freshman 
Chris Enger tied her average. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the big kids I've seen since I've been here," said seventh-yearCoach 
Ron Fortner at rival Pepperdine, "I've never seen one that good at Loyola. She 
gives Loyola something it never had before, good strength in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Fortner, one of those who recruited Gibson out of La Mirada High, says he 
thought she'd be a solid Division I basketball player, but he never expected 
her to do this well. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she had potential to be pretty good," he said, "but to be honest with 
you, defensively she's much more effective than I thought she was going to be 
out of high school. She's definitely one of the best big kids in the 
conference." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, 20, is a consistent scorer and strong rebounder, although her specialty 
is keeping opponents' shots from going through the hoop. She's eighth in the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. with 66 blocked shots, one more than her 
total last year. 
</P>
<P>
Defense is undoubtedly Gibson's forte. Appropriately, she's featured on the 
cover of the first-ever Loyola women's basketball media guide blocking a shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more inclined to go 100% on defense than on offense," Gibson said; "I know 
that if I don't play defense we're in trouble, but if I don't play offense the 
other girls will take up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
"Scoring is not my role. I get yelled at in practice for not shooting, but I'd 
rather give the ball to Kristen (Bruich) or Lynn (Flanagan) than shoot it. It 
just doesn't bother me not to score." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Coach Todd Corman believes that's unusual for a big player. He says they 
normally want to score big numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"She really likes playing defense," Corman said, "and she's outstanding. She's 
a real presence in the middle for us. She's the most intimidating defensive 
player we have." 
</P>
<P>
She's also one of the most versatile. Gibson is Loyola's best rebounder (6.9 a 
game) and the league's most accurate shooter (56%). Her 10.0 average is third 
on the team behind guards Bruich (15.0) and Flanagan (13.0). 
</P>
<P>
Last year she was the nation's 20th leading shot blocker at 65 and third on the 
team in both scoring and rebounding. She was also an all-league selection on a 
Loyola team that posted the school's best record (17-11, 9-5), good enough to 
finish third among eight teams in the West Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad considering Gibson was hampered by a knee injury from a pickup game 
before the season started. She had arthroscopic surgery in May, 1989, and spent 
six weeks in rehabilitation with Bruich, who had the same surgery on the same 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
Both players sat through preseason conditioning workouts, but were back for the 
first official day of practice in mid-Oct. 
</P>
<P>
"I played in pain," Gibson recalled while looking at the scars on her right 
knee. "My knee would get stuck and towards the end it was real painful. I think 
I could have played about 25% better if it wasn't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
But that wasn't Gibson's only injury last season. Bruich, also her roommate, 
elbowed her while chasing a loose ball against Portland. The wound required 
seven stitches above the left eye. Shortly after that Gibson sprained two 
fingers during practice. 
</P>
<P>
"For our next game I had tape on my eye, my fingers and my knee," Gibson said 
laughing. "Someone asked me if I had been in a car accident. It looked that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
This season appears to be healthier, although flu caused Gibson to lose 13 
pounds in December and a sprained lower back muscle kept her out of practice 
three days last week. 
</P>
<P>
She is, however, prepared for this weekend's home matchups against the two best 
teams in the WCC, the University of San Francisco and St. Mary's. Both are 6-1 
in league. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, who defeated San Francisco 72-67 on the road last Saturday, are only 
1 1/2 games out of first place in the WCC with a 5-3 mark (12-10 overall). 
</P>
<P>
"I just want us to succeed as a team," Gibson said. "I don't care about 
individual stats. I want the team to do well. I guess I'm a different kind of 
player. I don't even read the sports page, and once the game is over that's it. 
I don't talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Gibson's there's-more-to-life-than-sports approach, she's always given 
athletics enough to succeed. At La Mirada she was a Times basketball all-star 
in 1987, and also was a standout in volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior she was the Suburban League Most Valuable Player in both sports. 
Gibson was also a two-time all league middle blocker and center. She averaged 
20 points a game as a senior and was recruited to play basketball by Loyola, 
Weber State, Pepperdine and Utah. She narrowed her choices to Pepperdine and 
Loyola because she didn't want to leave the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Tricia was, without any doubt, the best post player we've had here," said La 
Mirada Coach Lyle Lewinson. "And she was very coachable. She would adapt to 
whatever we told her." 
</P>
<P>
And at Loyola she adjusted, giving up the glory of scoring to become a 
defensive specialist. She says she likes change. Once she obtains a degree in 
liberal studies, Gibson plans to become a third-grade teacher, then an athletic 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Until the end of next season, however, she'll continue to feed a voracious 
appetite for blocking shots.

FITZPATRICK LEADS S. TORRANCE TO SOCCER CROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you ask Kevin Fitzpatrick, he'll tell you it really doesn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
At least not too bad. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, Fitzpatrick, playing forward for South Torrance High 
School's soccer team, went full speed after a header over midfield. 
</P>
<P>
He leaped. A Redondo defender backed away from the play. Fitzpatrick collided 
head-first with teammate Ben Thacker, who was also at full speed. 
</P>
<P>
After the crash, the laws of physics stayed true to form -- to a point. Both 
bodies came to earth, but only Fitzpatrick got up right away. 
</P>
<P>
He admits he was a little dazed. 
</P>
<P>
"The only problem was my eyesight," Fitzpatrick said. "Everything got a little 
dark. It was fine as long as I was running around. But when I stopped, the 
throbbing started." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick stayed in the game. Thacker, who was knocked cold on the play, was 
taken to the sidelines, but later returned to action. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin just shook his head and was ready to go," South Coach Roger Bryant said. 
"He's been pushed and kicked and knocked down and dumped. But he stays in there 
because he's one tough kid." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick's toughness is one major reason that South (15-6-4 overall, 10-2-1 
in the Ocean League) clinched the league title with a 2-1 victory Tuesday over 
West Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
South wraps up Ocean League play against Morningside this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick leads South with 19 goals. His 19th, the insurance goal against 
West, was a low kick that hit the left post and spun back across the net to the 
right corner past the overstretched goalie. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a slow-motion goal," Bryant said. "Kevin gets all kinds of 
goals. He can score on the run, from far away, with either foot or his head. 
He's not the kind of pure shooter who can kick the ball against the wall 20 
times and hit the same spot every time. He's a high scorer because of his 
perseverance. He never quits." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick's rude meeting with Thacker's head wasn't his first experience with 
an unidentified flying object. 
</P>
<P>
During the football season, Fitzpatrick was the quarterback in South's option 
offense. Against Redondo, he was pitching off at the line of scrimmage when he 
was spun around and a Redondo free safety buried his helmet into the back of 
Fitzpatrick's head. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick was knocked out for a few seconds, but he got up and tried to find 
the huddle. South football Coach Don Morrow had to grab Fitzpatrick and point 
him to the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick, who had suffered a concussion, didn't know that he had fumbled on 
the play and that Redondo had recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick, 5-foot-10 and 160 pounds, sat on the sideline for a while with a 
towel over his head to clear the cobwebs. 
</P>
<P>
"They got me shipshape on the sidelines," Fitzpatrick said. "I was pretty out 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the game three plays later, at free safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin did a lot of things that really impressed everyone on the team," Morrow 
said. "He's a skinny kid, but he's not afraid to fly around and mix it up with 
the bigger guys. You need a guy like that on a team." 
</P>
<P>
Morrow needed Fitzpatrick, especially after South's starting quarterback, Chris 
Castillon, was found to have a stress fracture in one of his vertebrae after 
the Spartans' second game. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick, who had exclusively played cornerback the year before, took over 
at quarterback and guided South (5-6) to second place in the Ocean League and 
the first round of the Southern Section Division VII playoffs, where the 
Spartans lost, 14-6, to San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow switched to an option offense after Castillon's injury and Fitzpatrick 
responded by passing for 695 yards and six touchdowns and rushing for 605 yards 
and 11 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
One of his TDs came on a 95-yard run against Redondo that began as a fake dive 
until Fitzpatrick cut back and turned upfield. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin's got a blend of courage and toughness," Morrow said. "You don't see 
that too often in a kid of his size." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick is a three-sport athlete. As a junior, he played center field for 
South's baseball team. In soccer, Fitzpatrick plays various spots along South's 
forward line. 
</P>
<P>
"He just kind of floats around up there," Bryant said. "People tend to lose 
track of him and then he turns quickly to beat defenders. That's when you see 
his real desire to score." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick said he'll probably give all three sports a shot in college. Most 
colleges have ignored him in football, his favorite sport, because of his size 
-- except the staff at El Camino College, which sees his potential as a 
defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
If the major colleges come calling with soccer or baseball scholarships, 
however, Fitzpatrick says he'll listen. 
</P>
<P>
"He may not be big enough or quick enough for college football," Bryant said. 
"But he's certainly tough enough." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant gets to see that side of Fitzpatrick twice a week on the soccer field. 
Because he's South's main scoring threat, Fitzpatrick often gets treated to the 
flying elbows and shoulders of fullbacks when he goes up for a ball over his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten a lot of bangs and bruises that way," Fitzpatrick said. "But I try 
not to let it wear me down and affect my play. It's nothing that hurts all 
over, at least." 
</P>
<P>
Not too bad, anyway.

CARSON'S LITTLETON IN UCLA-BOUND CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carson High linebacker Nkosi Littleton realizes the competition for playing 
time will be tough at UCLA, from strangers as well as friends. 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, the Bruins had received verbal commitments from seven highly 
regarded linebackers, including the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
Littleton is not surprised by the number of linebackers UCLA is expected to 
sign. But he was caught off guard when Dominguez High's Bruce Walker, regarded 
as the best linebacker on the West Coast, announced that he is headed to 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Littleton and Walker have been good friends since the eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised. I didn't know he was going there," Littleton said. "He was 
keeping it a secret. He called me when he committed, and I laughed. But I'm 
happy to know somebody who's going there." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Littleton doesn't consider the 6-4, 240-pound Walker as potential 
competition. Littleton is projected to play inside linebacker, while Walker is 
an outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
The two blue-chip recruits became friends in eighth grade when they played 
together on a traveling basketball team at Victoria Park in Carson. They went 
on to play football and basketball at Verbum Dei High, but they split up when 
Walker transferred to Lynwood High midway through ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Walker transferred again, to Dominguez High in Compton, and Littleton left 
Verbum Dei for Carson after his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Wallace, editor and publisher of Super Prep magazine, doesn't think 
Walker or Littleton will have trouble fitting in at UCLA. He rates Littleton as 
the second-best inside linebacker prospect on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"He's your plug," Wallace said. "He's not an outside person, but for a middle 
guy he's what you want. He's tough and he comes from a great program. He's the 
best prospect from a team that is one of the top 10 (prep) programs in the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Littleton led Carson with 145 tackles (66 unassisted) last season, helping the 
Colts to a 10-2 record, the Pacific League championship and runner-up for the 
L.A. City Section 4-A title. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, who combines extraordinary speed (4.65 seconds in the 40-yard dash) and 
strength (375-pound bench press), was considered by some recruiters as the best 
two-way football player in the nation last season. Aside from linebacker, he 
played fullback for Dominguez and rushed for 1,363 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Other linebackers who have verbally committed to UCLA are Randy Cole (6-3, 220) 
of Santa Monica College, Andrew McClave (6-5, 225) of Jesuit in Portland, Rod 
Smalley (6-3, 225) of Santa Ynez, Brian Tighe (6-3, 220) of Pflugerville, Tex., 
and London Woodfin (6-3, 235) of Sylmar.

HAWTHORNE LOSES TO LEUZINGER, 52-50, DROPS SHARE OF 1ST 
</P>

<P>
Hawthorne High School's uneasy grip on first place in the Bay League was 
suspended for a few seconds on the back of the rim Wednesday night, along with 
a basketball that had been shot by Hawthorne's Anthony King. 
</P>
<P>
The ball dropped to the floor, giving Leuzinger High a 52-50 victory at home 
and toppling Hawthorne from its first-place tie with Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
For Leuzinger (13-8 overall, 7-6 in league), the victory clinched third place 
and a berth in the Division 5-AA playoffs. It also avenged the season's first 
meeting between the teams, which Hawthorne (17-8, 10-3) won on a last-second 
shot by forward Reggie Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team led by more than five points this time around. Hawthorne set up 
for the final shot with 17 seconds left, but Leuzinger's Troy Matthews broke up 
Waymond Powell's back-court pass. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne guard Tremayne Gauthier chased down the loose ball and hit Bell with 
a baseball pass. Bell charged to the hoop, but his layup sailed long. King got 
the rebound, but his short jumper didn't have enough on it as the buzzer 
sounded. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to give up a three-pointer," Leuzinger Coach Phil Sherman said. 
"Against a team like Hawthorne, you've got to worry about everybody taking the 
last shot, especially Bell. But we've worked on our defense every day for about 
an hour and a half, and it paid off." 
</P>
<P>
The game began as a duel of fast breaks. Hawthorne ran to a 35-32 lead at the 
half. But Sherman switched to a stingy matchup zone in the second half, when 
his team held Hawthorne to only 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger was led by forward Ty Merriwether's nine points and 18 rebounds. 
Center Frank Willis also scored nine, and grabbed 10 rebounds and blocked six 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne's Gauthier led all scorers with 14 points. Powell added 13 and King 
had nine.

CRIME: DONALD TERNUS WANTED TO SLEEP. ACROSS THE STREET, ANTHONY ORTIZ'S STEREO 
WAS BOOMING. TERNUS GOT A RIFLE AND LEFT HIS APARTMENT. ORTIZ WAS KILLED; 
TERNUS IS CHARGED WITH HIS MURDER.

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost as soon as he moved last year to a cul-de-sac apartment on the east side 
of Azusa, a mostly Latino neighborhood of low-end rentals and fast-food stands, 
Donald Ternus began to wonder if he hadn't made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Every weekend, it seemed, the police were making a drug bust on his block. 
Gunfire often broke out at night. Sometimes, the 21-year-old warehouse worker 
lamented to his roommate, it felt like they were the only two white guys in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few months, Ternus had bought a 12-gauge shotgun, loaded it with 
buckshot, and left it cocked under the headboard of his bed. He never thought 
of using it to kill anybody, he said. It was just good to have a gun around the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
But late one warm summer night at the end of June, provoked by the thump of 
loud music across the street and fortified by two six-packs of beer, Ternus 
decided to take a stand. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next is at the core of a Pomona Superior Court jury's 
deliberations this week. Ternus, who has been held in Los Angeles County jail 
without bail since the June 30 incident, says he acted in self-defense. The 
district attorney contends that it was murder. 
</P>
<P>
What is undisputed is that Ternus, with his rifle, marched over to the shabby 
brown-and-tan apartment building across Glenfinnan Avenue. Anthony Ortiz, 37, a 
glass cutter, had lived in Unit C for five years with his wife, Irma, and their 
two young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"Me, myself and I . . . Me, myself and I," pumped the dance tune from Ortiz's 
stereo. Ternus, shouting obscenities, called for him to turn it down. 
Obscenities were hurled back. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the shooting was over, Ortiz lay face down in a puddle of blood, 
his stomach and skull ripped open by two blasts from Ternus' gun. Ortiz's 
cousin, Jeffrey Mora, who had ridden a bus down from Northern California for a 
family reunion the next day, was wounded in both hands, his arm and groin. A 
friend, Joe Rodriguez, who had come over to drink a beer, took a lead pellet in 
the nose. 
</P>
<P>
"I never even thought of killing a person," Ternus testified this week. "I was 
just trying to prevent a physical confrontation. . . . I didn't think they 
would mess with somebody who had a gun." 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Ingrid Uhler, who Wednesday concluded her case for 
murder, attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon, contends that Ternus 
acted more as a vigilante. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought he was doing Azusa a favor by getting rid of these . . . Mexicans," 
Uhler said in her closing arguments. "He's thinking, 'They can't run me, they 
can't run this neighborhood.' . . . He thought at that point he was king of the 
mountain." 
</P>
<P>
For Ortiz, a hulking man who weighed in at more than 300 pounds, it was a 
weekend of celebration. He had spent the afternoon in El Monte, for his 
mother's 61st birthday. Then he returned to his apartment, where he continued 
to relax on the balcony, listening to the radio and sipping a rum and Coke. 
</P>
<P>
His party days, however, were long gone, his wife said. Ever since their first 
daughter was born seven years ago, he had done everything for his family. His 
business of fitting windows in high-rise buildings was picking up. He cooked 
and cleaned around the house. And the big reunion planned for July 1, the fifth 
straight summer that all 200 members of his extended family would be getting 
together, meant the world to him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a special, special occasion for us," Mora, 22, said. "Everybody was 
happy and laughing." 
</P>
<P>
Ternus had been having a fine night too. A husky man with reddish hair parted 
in the middle, he had come home in the early afternoon from his job loading 
trucks at an electronics and appliance warehouse. He had no plans for the 
evening, until a friend dropped by and proposed they head to the Orange County 
Fairgrounds to see a motocross race. 
</P>
<P>
When he was dropped off at his apartment shortly after midnight, Ternus' ears 
were still ringing from the roar of the engines and he was pleasantly buzzed 
from what he guessed were about a dozen beers. The only problem would be 
getting up at 5 or 6 the next morning to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
Then, standing there in his driveway, he realized that it was going to be even 
harder than he thought. Loud music and shouting were pouring out of a 
neighbor's apartment across the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, cut down the noise," he remembers hollering to them. They shouted back an 
obscenity, he says, punctuated by the epithet "white boy." 
</P>
<P>
He yelled something else and walked back to his apartment. He took off his 
shoes and socks, lit a cigarette and shut the window. It didn't help. He 
thought about calling the police but said he feared that the neighbors might 
pay him back with slashed tires. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking, 'I really don't want to go over there,' " said Ternus, dressed 
in court in a dark blue blazer, white shirt and matching hankie. "The way these 
guys talked to me, it didn't seem like a smart thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
But Ternus, whose father taught him to fire a gun when he was 6, decided to go 
anyway. He grabbed the rifle, which he had used to shoot skeet the weekend 
before, and walked barefoot with the gun diagonally across his chest with the 
barrel pointed up. 
</P>
<P>
"Not intending to use it," his lawyer, Robert D. Chatterton, said, "but to 
protect himself, so he wouldn't get attacked." 
</P>
<P>
The perspective from the Ortiz balcony, however, was not the same. 
</P>
<P>
"He was cussing, saying the music was too loud -- which it wasn't," Rodriguez, 
43, said. "We were wondering what had happened. Everybody was, like, stunned." 
</P>
<P>
There was some shouting back and forth, then Rodriguez, Ortiz and his other 
cousin, David Mora, 27, left the balcony and ran down the steps to the 
sidewalk. Only Jeffrey Mora stayed up above. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kept my eye on this guy," he said. "In case something went down." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ternus, the three men split up and began to circle him, with 
Ortiz, walking slowly, his gaze transfixed on him, approaching down the middle. 
Ternus said he kept looking back and forth, convinced that at any moment one of 
them would jump at him and wrestle the gun away. 
</P>
<P>
He said he told them not to come toward him. But they continued to approach. 
Then he felt something hit the gun -- a beer bottle he thinks, possibly hurled 
from the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared," he said. "I didn't know what was happening. I couldn't imagine 
that somebody would come toward a person with a gun in his hands." 
</P>
<P>
The Mora brothers and Rodriguez, however, testified that they tried to calm 
Ternus down. He pointed the gun at David Mora, who fled. Then Ortiz approached 
him, his hands outstretched. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, put away the gun," Jeffrey Mora heard him say. "You don't need it. We can 
work this out." 
</P>
<P>
Ternus said he heard no such thing. He thought Ortiz was lunging at him. He was 
sure somebody else was sneaking up from behind. 
</P>
<P>
He squeezed the trigger and ripped a hole in Ortiz's abdomen. Ternus said he 
doesn't remember shooting him again, but a second shot, probably fired while 
Ortiz was either collapsing or already lying face down, blew away the right 
side of his head. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Mora had descended the stairs, and Ternus fired at him three times as 
Mora ran. Rodriguez was hiding behind a van on the street. Ternus said he 
thought he saw something in his hand. He aimed at the car window and fired at 
him through the glass. 
</P>
<P>
Then he went back to his apartment, lit a cigarette, opened a beer and waited. 
When police arrived, he refused to come out for more than 15 minutes, fearful 
that they would gun him down. 
</P>
<P>
"They had the gall to ruin the good evening of David Ternus, so he was going to 
take matters into his own hands," Uhler said. "He's the aggressor. He's the one 
who is seeking a fight. He doesn't have the right of self-defense." 
</P>
<P>
Chatterton, however, argued that Ortiz had a history of aggression. As a young 
man, Ortiz had been involved in a barroom brawl. A few years later, he was 
convicted of a strong-arm robbery in a tavern parking lot. And just last 
summer, he had pleaded guilty to inflicting cruel punishment on a child, after 
he had grabbed a neighbor's 3-year-old boy who had spit on his daughter and 
held him so that his little girl could spit back. She refused. 
</P>
<P>
But Ortiz's mother, Mary Dixon, said those were the unfortunate incidents that 
always seemed to befall her son. As a child, youngsters in the neighborhood 
used to beat him up. In high school, he dropped out because the principal 
wouldn't allow him to wear his shirt untucked -- a habit he had developed to 
hide his growing girth. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony was a sweet, gentle boy, but he was a big guy," she said. "I always 
wondered if that's why people picked on him. He always seemed to be in the 
wrong place at the wrong time."

ABSENTEE VOTERS HELP GIVE HILL GOP STATE SENATE NOMINATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Frank Hill put together his victory in Tuesday's Senate election 
with the help of absentee ballots and hard-core Los Angeles County Republicans 
unwilling to believe attacks on his ethics, according to political consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier Republican, who since 1988 has been the target of an FBI political 
corruption investigation, led a field of eight candidates. Because Hill failed 
to win 50% of the vote, he will face Janice Graham of Laguna Hills, the top 
Democratic vote-getter, in an April 10 runoff to fill the vacancy created by 
the decision of Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) to leave office. 
</P>
<P>
With Republicans holding an edge of 54% to 36% among registered voters, Hill is 
widely believed to have the inside track at winning the runoff in the sprawling 
31st Senate District, which stretches from West Covina and Whittier in the 
north to Laguna Beach in the south. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of a Hill victory in April, seven candidates already have lined 
up to run for his 52nd Assembly District seat in the June 5 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
Sal Russo, Hill's campaign consultant, said attacks against Hill "lacked 
credibility." Voters in the Whittier area, which Hill has represented in the 
Assembly for eight years, "knew him too well" for the criticism to undermine 
his reputation, Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial results were: Hill, 15,043 votes, or 22.8%; Gil Ferguson, 
14,123, or 21.4%; Ron Isles, 11,827, or 18%; Gary Miller, 10,310, or 15.6%; 
Graham, 9,357, or 14.2%; Bradley McFadden, 3,056, or 4.6%; Thomas Whaling, 
1,489, or 2.3%; and Robert Lewis, 683, or 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of Hill's votes came from absentee ballots, according to election 
officials in Orange and Los Angeles counties. Orange County officials Wednesday 
said they were still counting another 500 absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Russo acknowledged that "the absentees certainly were a help." Of Hill's 
absentee ballots, 5,559 or about 70% were cast in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate campaign was the third special election in recent months where 
absentee ballots played an important role. 
</P>
<P>
Last week in Modesto, Democrat Sal Canella won a special Assembly election on a 
heavy tide of mailed in ballots. Canella was running to fill a vacancy created 
by the election of Assemblyman Gary Condit (D-Ceres) to Congress. Condit, too, 
fashioned his victory four months ago with a heavy reliance on absentee 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Englander, a campaign consultant to Republican Isles, a Brea city 
councilman, said Hill's campaign was able to get off to a faster start than 
other candidates in encouraging voters to file absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Englander cited a letter Hill mailed early in the campaign that erroneously 
implied that he had been endorsed by former Sen. Campbell. The letter included 
an absentee ballot application, which Englander and other consultants said 
could have provided a boost to Hill's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in the outcome was a last-minute mailer sent out by a 
Sacramento-based Republican group to promote Democrat Graham's candidacy, 
Englander said. Sources said the purpose had been to help Hill by heading off 
Democrats who might defect to Isles over the abortion issue. Isles was the only 
pro-choice Republican in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gouty, a consultant to Republican Miller, a Diamond Bar city councilman, 
said the low turnout of 17% and the number of hard-core Republicans who did 
vote played a pivotal role in the result. "They will generally vote for some 
sort of incumbent," Gouty said. Hill already represents "a large part of the 
district," and many Republicans in Los Angeles County treated him as the 
incumbent, Gouty said. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic legislative staffers privately have dismissed the chances of Graham 
or any other Democrat of winning the runoff because of the Republicans 
registration edge.

"No doubt at all, (Hill will) win the runoff," Englander agreed. But, he 
maintained, if Hill is indicted in the political corruption investigation "all 
bets are off," and there could be a write-in campaign mounted by another 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
American Independent Party candidate Robert Lewis will also be in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, seven Republicans, including Hill, have filed papers indicating 
their intention to run for the 52nd Assembly District. A Hill campaign official 
indicated that Hill's filing was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The other Republicans who have filed are Kenneth Manning, a member of the 
Hacienda-La Puente Unified School District who said Stuart Spencer, an adviser 
to former President Reagan, will oversee his campaign; Wil Baca and Jim Baker, 
both of Hacienda Heights; Jack Dortignac of West Covina; Phil Mautino of 
Whittier and Tony Russo, a former aide to Hill. 
</P>
<P>
One Democrat, Gary Neely of Diamond Bar, has filed papers with the county to 
run for the seat.

ROSE BOWL FACE LIFT MAY BE A SUPER ATTRACTION; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: PASADENA ENTERS THE SWEEPSTAKES FOR THE 1993 SUPER BOWL BY OFFERING 
THE STADIUM TO THE NFL RENT-FREE, AND THROWING IN ALL INCOME FROM THE SALE OF 
FOOD AND NOVELTIES.

<P>
In a bid to secure Super Bowl XXVII for the Rose Bowl in 1993, the stadium will 
be offered rent-free to the National Football League, which would also receive 
all income from concessions and the sale of novelty items. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, outlined at Tuesday's Board of Directors meeting, was approved 
despite pointed questioning from some directors who asked whether Pasadena was 
giving away too much to lure football's premier event to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to think that we ask for something as supplicants," Director John 
Crowley said. "I just feel this is very close to being at a point of saying, 
'It's not worth it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Crowley's concerns were echoed by Directors Rick Cole and William Paparian. 
Cole pointed out that preliminary estimates indicate the city could receive as 
little as $300,000 in direct payments to host the event. 
</P>
<P>
"If we come out netting $300,000, I'm not real wild about this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report prepared by Deputy City Manager Ed Aghjayan, the city 
would be expected to receive a $2-million boost to the local economy, with 
$75,000 of it going to the General Fund from hotel and sales taxes. The city 
would also receive between $300,000 and $600,000 from the sale of 2,500 game 
tickets to be sold to corporations and individuals seeking hospitality 
packages. Parking fees and stadium seat taxes could generate an additional 
$130,000 for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city's bid will be submitted next week to NFL officials in New York. The 
proposal is the result of work by the Los Angeles Sports Council, an 
18-month-old nonprofit group that coordinates efforts among officials from the 
Rose Bowl, the Los Angeles Coliseum and Anaheim Stadium to secure sporting 
events for the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Sports Council lobbying, the area is a finalist for the Super 
Bowl, competing against San Diego, San Francisco and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Rose Bowl, with 102,083 seats, claims to be the largest 
professional football stadium in the United States, the council selected it as 
the prime Los Angeles-area venue. Under a joint agreement, the Coliseum and 
Anaheim Stadium did not submit competing bids but would share in the revenues 
if Pasadena hosts the game, Aghjayan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of the revenue would go to the Rose Bowl, but the idea is that we 
would share with the Coliseum and Anaheim," Aghjayan said. Details of the split 
are being negotiated. One plan calls for the Rose Bowl to receive a 75% share 
of the ticket proceeds, with the other two facilities sharing 25%. 
</P>
<P>
When Pasadena hosted the Super Bowl in 1983 and 1987, it earned $300,000 and 
$800,000 respectively from stadium rental fees, concession sales, admission 
taxes, charges for use of a hospitality tent compound and parking fees. In 
addition, the city was allowed to purchase 1,200 tickets at face value for 
local distribution by directors and other city officials. 
</P>
<P>
But as bidding for the Super Bowl has become more competitive, the NFL has 
secured more and more of the income, Aghjayan said in his report to the board. 
In most parts of the country, the stadium is offered rent-free in exchange for 
the benefits to local economies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal for the 1993 game, the city would give up most of the 
previous sources of revenue and allocate them to the NFL. It would also provide 
350,000 square feet of space for the league to build a hospitality tent 
compound for league use. The city would receive about $79,000 from seat taxes, 
$75,00 in hotel and sales taxes arising from the event and a share of parking 
fees, about $55,000.

COUNCIL AIDS HOTEL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pomona City Council has agreed to waive $243,235 in fees and spend $186,360 
on a water line to help the Shilo Inns chain build an all-suites hotel and 
restaurant at Temple Avenue and the Orange (57) Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The new Shilo Suites Hotel, with 131 rooms, would be constructed within a block 
of the existing 161-room Shilo Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Shilo Inns owner Mark Hemstreet of Portland, Ore., told the council that 
construction could be completed within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Hemstreet said the existing inn has "lost a tremendous amount of business" 
because it cannot accommodate banquets for more than 75 to 90 people. The new 
hotel would have restaurant and banquet facilities seating 500. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement given preliminary approval by the council calls for the waiver of 
fees for a building permit, sewer connection and other charges. Hemstreet said 
the city's expenses would be offset within three years by revenue from the 8% 
tax on room occupancy.

<P>
RECALL PETITIONS TARGET 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Critics of recent City Council actions say they will start collecting 
signatures next week for the recall petitions they have filed with the city 
clerk, charging Mayor Albert Perez and City Councilmen Stan Quintana and Art 
Olmos with "corrupt practices" and "immoral spending." 
</P>
<P>
Members of South El Monte Citizens Advocating Recall cited a vote for a 
controversial trash hauling contract, the approval of the sale of federal and 
county aid to other cities and support for layoffs of key middle management 
personnel in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The three elected officials denied that they were corrupt or wasteful. The 
charges are "trumped up" and "gross distortions," Perez said. He added that the 
recall effort is being financed by "a few disgruntled industrialists" who have 
been stymied by city officials in expanding "obnoxious" industrial operations, 
such as a smelter. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 3 to 0 last month to give Modern Service Co. an 
exclusive rubbish hauling franchise, despite complaints from competing haulers. 
Last year, the council approved the sale of part of its allocation of federal 
Community Development Block Grant funds to the City of West Covina, and it 
approved a 27% raise for City Manager Raul Romero after four other city 
employees had been terminated. 
</P>
<P>
If the dissidents begin the signature-gathering campaign as scheduled next 
week, they will have 90 days, until mid-May, to collect the 1,253 signatures 
necessary to put the measure on the ballot.

WATER RATE REPORT HANDLED ISSUE 'COURAGEOUSLY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an educator of public utility economics, I was following the water rate 
issue. I read the "Water Rate Committee Report" (Times, Jan. 25). 
</P>
<P>
The report has all the ingredients of a public utility rate. Simply put, the 
utility rate is based on "Cost of Service Basis." The report, through its 10 
recommendations, dealt with the rate issue courageously. 
</P>
<P>
We (the people) should thank the members of the Rate Committee for a job well 
done as the committee, not the City Council, recommended for the Covina rate 
decrease when the city of Los Angeles approved a 5.9% water rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
I do not understand why the council disliked the committee recommendation of 
investigating the market for liability insurance. The council accepted all of 
the committee recommendations except this one. Can the council member who 
proposed this resolution provide a reason for ignoring liability insurance 
issue?

Photo, Where Racing With the Wind Is a Real DragSaturday was a day for a varoom 
with a view at the Fairplex in Pomona, where qualifying sessions were held for 
the National Hot Rod Assn. Winternationals. And the weather was a lot better 
than Sunday's finals, when rain postponed the event until this Saturday. Before 
the race, drivers do a fast burn to give rear tires greater traction. And 
Adrian Dittberner, 7, of Rancho Cucamonga, and his mother, Marilyn, cover their

KING'S VILLAGES PARTNER DISCLAIMS RACIAL BIASES

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article (Times, Feb. 1) on the discussion at the Pasadena Board of 
Directors' meeting concerning King's Villages was fairly covered by reporter 
Vicki Torres. 
</P>
<P>
I only wish to correct the possible impression that we are favoring Latino 
families for occupancy. The balance of my remarks not printed in the article 
stated that "when vacancies occur we take qualified applicants meeting the HUD 
regulations right off the waiting list, and this has resulted in maybe 40 
Latino families gaining occupancy." 
</P>
<P>
No attempt has been made to give preference to any particular racial group.

NACK RAISES $10,698 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to semiannual campaign reports filed at the end of last month, only 
Pasadena City Director Kathryn Nack reported any substantial campaign 
activities during the last half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The 6th District director held a mid-September fund-raiser and collected 
$10,698 in cash contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Of that, $4,503 was spent to mail newsletters bearing her picture to all 
households in her district. Nack said newsletter restrictions under state 
Proposition 73 made the fund-raiser necessary. According to her campaign 
report, she has $6,349 on hand that she said she will use for future mailers. 
</P>
<P>
Other directors reported no fund raising and merely carried over existing 
campaign funds. Amounts reported by the other city directors were $87 for Rick 
Cole, $1,208 for Chris Holden, $3,501 for Jess Hughston, $288 for William 
Paparian and $3,700 for Mayor William Thomson. John Crowley filed no campaign 
papers because he said he had no contributions, expenditures or campaign funds.

SUIT AGAINST CITY REINSTATED

Reversing an earlier decision, a Pomona Superior Court judge ruled that a 
countersuit filed against the city by a former redevelopment consultant will be 
heard in court. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's decision by Superior Court Judge Thomas Nuss will allow Fred Lyte, who 
was fired by the City Council in December, 1988, to countersue the city for 
$1.38 million that Lyte says he is owed. 
</P>

Early last year, the city sued Lyte, charging he recommended projects from

ARCADIA, TEMPLE CITY TAKE STEPS TO CUT 'MONSTER HOMES' DOWN TO SIZE; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDING: COMPLAINTS FROM CITIZENS PROMPT ACTION TO LIMIT THE SIZE OF TWO-STORY 
HOMES IN ARCADIA TO 35% OF THE LOT SIZE, DOWN FROM 45%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ARCADIA-The City Council voted Tuesday to limit the size of two-story homes to 
35% of the lot size, rather than the current 45%. 
</P>
<P>
The move was in response to complaints about the increasing number of "monster 
homes" in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
The council also accepted the recommendation of a committee of city officials, 
real estate agents, developers and representatives of homeowner associations to 
keep the existing maximum of 45% for single-story homes. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said the 45% lot coverage ceiling is an incentive to encourage 
construction of single-level dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4-0 to approve the lot coverage reduction for two-story 
homes. Councilman Charles Gilb was absent from the meeting. The council 
instructed the city attorney to prepare amendments to the city's Zoning Code. 
If the amendments are presented in the form of an ordinance, the council will 
have to vote twice more on the matter. If they are packaged as a resolution, 
only one more vote is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The change softens an earlier proposal by the Planning Commission, which in 
November had approved dropping the 45% coverage maximum to a sliding scale of 
from 20% to 35%, depending on the size of a lot. 
</P>
<P>
James Rostron, chairman of the Rancho Santa Anita Residents Assn. Architectural 
Review Board, preferred tougher standards than those approved by the council 
Tuesday. He cited an "overpowering" two-story home being planned for his 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
With the 35% limit, builders can still put up homes "darn near approaching the 
size of a small hotel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agent and committee member Gordon Maddock countered that if 
neighborhoods want to curb the size of homes, "they should take it up with the 
people in their own area, not impose it on all of Arcadia." 
</P>
<P>
The council also instructed planning officials to study possible new 
requirements on the distance between houses and property lines. The officials 
also will look into the possibility of imposing regulations to encourage 
building toward the center of a lot, away from neighbors as much as possible.

<P>
BASKETBALL: INGRID DIXSON HAS AVERAGED 25.1 POINTS AND 18.6 REBOUNDS TO CARRY 
WEST COVINA TO A PERFECT 12-0 RECORD IN THE SIERRA LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even before she played a minute of varsity basketball in high school, Ingrid 
Dixson was receiving letters of inquiry from college recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until Dixson started playing for the varsity team as a 
10th-grader at Edgewood High in West Covina that she got an inkling of the 
potential she possessed as a basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started playing at Edgewood as a sophomore," she said, "I made 
all-tournament of one tournament and MVP of another, and it was kind of a shock 
to me because I didn't realize I had that kind of talent, but I knew I could be 
better." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-3 and 180 pounds, Dixson's potential appears to be approaching its 
fruition as a senior at West Covina High -- which merged with Edgewood after 
her sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Dixson didn't make a good impression before this season. In fact, she 
averaged 13 points ajd 12 rebounds and earned All-Valle Vista League honors as 
a sophomore before averaging 17.5 points and 11.3 rebounds and receiving 
All-CIF Southern Section Division I recognition last season. 
</P>
<P>
Only this season, the 17-year-old Dixson has truly emerged as a center of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
She has easily been the most dominant inside player in the San Gabriel Valley. 
Dixson has averaged a valley-leading 25.1 points and 18.6 rebounds to carry 
West Covina to a perfect 12-0 record in the Sierra League and 17-4 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"She just seems to be head and shoulders above most of the players around here, 
literally and figuratively," West Covina Coach Bill Torricelli said. "She's 
just way ahead of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Torricelli said Dixson's skill starts with a superior knowledge of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that probably helps her the most is that she really understands the 
game," he said. "She has already learned the things that take most people a lot 
longer to learn." 
</P>
<P>
That is not to take anything away from her natural abilities. 
</P>
<P>
"She just has good instincts for the game," Torricelli said. "A lot of 6-3 
girls have size but they don't know what to do with it. But it's amazing to see 
all the things about her that just seem so natural. It seems natural but you 
know it also comes from hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of last season, Dixson says she has worked hard to improve her 
all-around game. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensive- and defensive-wise I think I've improved and my scoring and 
rebounding averages went up, too," Dixson said. "I worked on my outside game 
and I've tried driving from the top of the key more." 
</P>
<P>
Dixson said that improving her outside shooting ability was a prime objective 
before the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played more than just the inside position," she said. "My basic position 
is in the key but I have more ability than that. Teams like to double-team me 
inside so sometimes I'll go outside and if they don't come out on me I'll just 
take the open shot." 
</P>
<P>
With her increased offensive production, she has also faced more double- and 
triple-teams from defenses than ever before this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an adjustment because last year the whole team was about equal in 
scoring," Dixson said. "This year I'm more of the person the other teams want 
to stop, so I'm double-teamed a lot." 
</P>
<P>
All the attention from opposing defenses has had a positive side, though. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way it made me work harder because I've had to fight to get the ball when 
I'm on the inside," Dixson said. 
</P>
<P>
Dixson says it is a good learning experience because she expects to face the 
same problem when she plays in college next season. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot more competition there," she said. "I've been to a couple of 
college games this year and it's a lot tougher than high school to get your 
position inside. When you come in from high school, you play with a lot more 
experienced players. It's such a big adjustment. Women's basketball in college 
is so different than high school." 
</P>
<P>
Torricelli, for one, doesn't think the adjustment from high school to college 
will be that difficult for Dixson. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've seen in college, she's the kind who can step right in as a 
freshman without much trouble -- the Tracy Murray type," the coach said, 
referring to the former Glendora High star who is starting for the UCLA men as 
a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
That is one big reason why Dixson has been one of the most heavily recruited 
seniors in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Before last season, Dixson said it was mostly a trickle of interest from 
college scouts. The attention started to increase during the summer league 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten so much attention, I can't even say how much," she said. "I 
started getting a lot of attention after I went to the BCI tournament (in 
Arizona last summer) and a tournament at UC Santa Barbara. I know that's where 
a lot of scouts saw me." 
</P>
<P>
Dixson has been recruited by many of the top programs in the nation, including 
Long Beach State, Tennessee, UCLA, UC Berkeley and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
She has taken her only recruiting trip to Berkeley and says: "I'm leaning 
toward UC Berkeley right now but I'm still looking at my options." 
</P>
<P>
Her coach said the attention picked up recently after colleges confirmed that 
Dixson's grades were in order and that she had scored higher than 700 on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little slow for a while," Torricelli said. "But as soon as they got 
her grades and test scores, interest started to pick up with her again. She's 
really getting a lot of calls now." 
</P>
<P>
So far, she says, the recruiting process has transpired with minimal 
distractions. 
</P>
<P>
"During the contact period, when the coaches wanted to call to arrange home 
visits, that's when I received the most phone calls," Dixson said. "I've 
received a lot of phone calls all along. But even then it really wasn't 
distracting. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was doing my homework I could take a few minutes off to talk to them and 
set up a home visit or just to talk, if that's what they wanted. They've never 
bugged me to the point that I didn't want to talk to them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Jimmie, has also been there to help her screen potential colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"He helps me sort it all out," Dixson said. "He has certain questions that he 
wants to ask the coaches and he keeps up on the schools that I think I might 
want to go to." 
</P>
<P>
Dixson said she would like to stay in California for college, although she has 
not ruled out schools from outside of the state. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, she has placed her recruiting dilemma on the back burner. For the 
moment, her biggest concern is that her team clinch the Sierra League title and 
do well in the playoffs. West Covina can win the league title with a win over 
Los Altos at 5:30 p.m Friday in Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
That would mark the third straight year that Dixson's team has won or shared a 
league title in her high school career. 
</P>
<P>
Dixson realizes the difficult part will be advancing far in the playoffs. As a 
sophomore at Edgewood, her team lost to St. Bernard in the second round of the 
2-A Division playoffs and last season West Covina was eliminated by Hart in 5-A 
Division quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to be in the finals of the CIF (5-A)," she said. "The farthest 
we've gone since I've been here is the quarterfinals and we want to go farther. 
If the team works hard at it I feel we can reach that goal." 
</P>
<P>
If the Bulldogs do make it, don't be surprised if Dixson is the center of 
attention.

CAL POLY POMONA WOMEN WINNING -- AS USUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. season past the midway point, it 
has been business as usual for the Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who have won or shared the conference title eight consecutive 
seasons , carry a 7-0 record into their CCAA game against visiting Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo at 6 p.m. Saturday in Poly Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, with an 18-3 overall record, is ranked No. 2 in the NCAA Division II 
behind defending champion Delta State of Mississippi. The team has surged into 
the conference lead largely behind strong inside play from seniors Niki Bracken 
(6-2) at center and Marcine Edmonds (6-1) at forward. 
</P>
<P>
Bracken, a Division II All-America selection last season, leads the conference 
with an average of 19.4 points and 9.9 rebounds. Edmonds, who missed last 
season because of a knee injury, averages 13.1 points and 7.2 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonds has been playing particularly well in recent games, having earned CCAA 
Player of the Week honors last week. She leads the conference in field-goal 
percentage at 57%. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has also received strong support from players such as reserve center 
Danielle Carter, a 6-2 freshman, and guard Stephanie Coons, a 5-11 junior. 
Carter is averaging 11.3 points and 6.9 rebounds and Coons 9.9 points and 4.4 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos swept back-to-back games against UC Riverside last week as Edmonds 
led the way with 41 points and 18 rebounds. Pomona won by scores of 86-61 and 
79-54. 
</P>
<P>
They will face a San Luis Obispo squad that they defeated 83-75 on Jan. 20 in 
San Luis Obispo. The Mustangs, 3-3 in the CCAA and 9-11 overall, are led on 
offense by senior guard Jody Hasselfield (5-6) with a 13.8-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Broncos, San Luis Obispo also has good size on its front line with 
center Aimee Gassett (6-4) and forward Russia Madden (6-0) leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
On the heels of three straight losses, the Cal Poly Pomona men's basketball 
team will attempt to get back on the winning track when it plays host to Cal 
State Bakersfield and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. games Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who have slipped to 2-6 in the CCAA and 8-13 overall, will face 
Bakersfield at 7:30 p.m. Friday and San Luis Obispo at 8 p.m. Saturday in 
Kellogg Gym. 
</P>
<P>
The game against Bakersfield figures to be especially difficult for the 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield, ranked No. 12 in the NCAA Division II last week, leads the CCAA 
with a 7-1 record and is 19-2 overall. The Roadrunners, who have reached the 
Division II playoffs the last two seasons, are paced offensively by 6-4 senior 
forward Marvin Redeemer with a 16-point average. Bakersfield also has an 
outstanding guard tandem in Ray Burris and Wade Green. 
</P>
<P>
In the first meeting between the teams, Bakersfield won easily by an 89-74 
score. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos will meet a San Luis Obispo squad that has a 13-8 overall record 
but has struggled at 3-5 in the conference. San Luis Obispo has been led by 6-8 
center Stuart Thomas, a transfer from Stanford who averages 16.1 points. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has been sparked by the offensive production of 6-6 junior forward Terry 
Ross, who averages 21.5 points and 12.5 rebounds to lead the conference in both 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Other players scoring in double figures for the Broncos are guard Chancellor 
McCobb at 16.4 points and forwards Jim Skinner at 11.1 and Ken Scalmanini at 
10.8. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's softball team, which reached the NCAA Division I 
World Series last season, will open its 1990 season by competing in the Big 
West/Pacific 10 Mini-Tournament on Saturday and Sunday at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, ranked No. 11 in Division I in a preseason poll, will face Arizona 
State at 11 a.m. and Oregon at 3 p.m. in Saturday games and meet the same teams 
at the same times Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The California Interscholastic Federation is accepting applications for its 
1990 CIF/Reebok Scholar-Athlete of the Year award that will be presented in 
June at the state track and field meet at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Applications are at high school counseling offices. One boy and one girl will 
be selected as winners of the award. 
</P>
<P>
The entry deadline is April 6 and judging will be completed by May 7.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voter Registration 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 254 to 166, the House agreed to debate a bill expanding voter 
registration under a restrictive rule that limits amendments from the floor. 
The bill (HR 2190) addresses the problem of plummeting citizen turnout on 
Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify more potential voters, it enables eligible Americans to 
automatically register when they obtain a driver's license, provides for 
registration desks at many government and private facilities and permits mail 
registration. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic and GOP sponsors thought they had secured bipartisan support of a 
debating rule limiting Republicans to a single amendment embodying all changes 
they would make in the legislation. Such limited rules are used when sponsors 
fear an onslaught of amendments will kill their measure. 
</P>
<P>
But the unity dissolved when President Bush raised last-minute objections to 
the bill, prompting GOP leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) to oppose the rule. 
Angry Democrats then questioned whether House Republicans, the minority party, 
are sincere in calling for more bipartisanship in the House. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Al Swift (D-Wash.) complained that Michel had acted to "unilaterally 
and single-handedly trash that agreement" on a debating rule. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Gerald B.H. Solomon (R-N.Y.) said: "This rule itself is an 
anti-voters' rights rule" as it relates to House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to debate the voter registration bill under a 
restrictive rule.

YORBA LINDA KEEPS PAST ALIVE

<P>
Western Yorba Linda is keeping its past alive. Among its claims to fame is the 
birthplace in 1913 of our 37th President, Richard Milhous Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
The former President's family home (until 1922, when they moved to Whittier) at 
18061 Yorba Linda Blvd., just off Eureka Avenue, has been a museum since 1959. 
Today, what stands only as a wooden skeleton immediately outside the house will 
be the Richard Milhous Nixon Library and Birth Place once construction is 
completed. The library is scheduled to open July 20 and Nixon is expected to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to documents and excerpts from the White House tapes, the library 
will feature a video-image exhibit where visitors will be able to have a few 
words with the former President. A questioner may touch a screen and trigger an 
answer (from one of 400 video clips) that appears on the former President's 
lips. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors may hear Nixon's apology for the scandal that drove him from office: 
"That the way I tried to deal with Watergate was the wrong way is a burden I 
shall have to bear for every day of the life that is left to me." The city of 
Yorba Linda isn't one to hold a grudge, however. The former President's 
birthday, Jan. 9, is a local holiday and was celebrated this year for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood still looks like an equestrian haven. South of Yorba Linda 
along Eureka Avenue stands a blue farmhouse and stables. The scent of horses 
emanates from the area. 
</P>
<P>
Even the development announced at the corner of Yorba Linda Boulevard and 
Eureka promises equestrian lots and trails. The Buena Vida Estates will one day 
grace the crest of the hill along Eureka Avenue with "4,100-4,150-square-foot 
homes on spacious equestrian lots," the sign promises, in this "quiet and 
secluded Yorba Linda setting." 
</P>
<P>
Vestiges of the old frontier are in evidence here in western Yorba Linda. 
Horses stand in a paddock along Lakeview Avenue toward Bastanchury Road and 
stables announce their offerings. Three or four pumps dredge for oil. 
</P>
<P>
The city's past is recognized with architectural landmarks. One of the original 
red railroad cars stands prominently behind a yellowish engine along Imperial 
Highway. The red railroad car, which reads MJB Pacific, once housed a 
mini-museum but has been closed for many years because of vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Oranges were once the city's big cash crop. "Fruit was shipped out by the 
carload while fertilizer, lumber, machinery and other supplies were delivered 
here," reads a historical plaque at 18132 Imperial Highway. Here stands the 
original depot built by the Pacific Electric Railroad in 1911 for the Yorba 
Linda stop. This "big, red car," representing the first means of public 
transportation, took townsfolk to Los Angeles nine times a day. The plaque even 
includes a bit of folkloric whimsy: "As passengers approached," it reads, 
"conductor Ben Foss would shout 'Yorba Linda, capital of the world!' " 
</P>
<P>
Today the building's front door announces a restaurant, "Maloney's Station." On 
the rear is a sign designating the saloon entrance. A recent fire closed the 
restaurant and its reopening is as yet undetermined -- a modern-day variation 
on the shoot-out in a saloon and other casualties of a frontier town. 
</P>
<P>
The area demonstrates a curious mix of history and new construction. At 18200 
Yorba Linda Blvd., a sign announces the site of the Yorba Linda Packing House, 
built by the Yorba Linda Citrus Assn. in 1929. Today, the building houses 
offices and a retail center. 
</P>
<P>
At 4688 Olinda Street, the first schoolhouse built in Yorba Linda (in 1911) now 
houses Pudmuckle's, A Tole-Painting Cottage. A plaque reminds visitors that the 
craftsman-style structure was a one-room school. In 46 years, this public 
building housed such public forums as the Chamber of Commerce, citrus 
association, women's club, community church and a Sunday school. At one time, 
the Yorba Linda Mutual Water Company also had its headquarters there.

REAGAN INVOKES EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE TO RETAIN DIARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan set the stage for a new constitutional challenge 
over presidential privacy Wednesday when he invoked the doctrine of executive 
privilege to avoid turning over excerpts of his White House diaries to 
Iran-Contra defendant John M. Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene has said he will hold a hearing to 
consider Reagan's claim, almost guaranteeing that Poindexter's trial will be 
delayed from its scheduled Feb. 20 start. Greene presides over Poindexter's 
trial on five felony counts of obstructing Congress, making false statements 
and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Greene has said he will apply a higher standard of confidentiality to material 
covered by a claim of executive privilege than to material for which no such 
claim is made. But he has made clear that he has not yet decided the issue, and 
could order Reagan to produce the diary excerpts despite his constitutional 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a separate brief with Greene 
supporting Reagan's position. The department said the former President "has 
validly and properly invoked executive privilege." 
</P>
<P>
The department said last week that the court was facing a "potentially serious 
constitutional confrontation" over the issue. It said the confidentiality of 
the personal papers of President Bush and all subsequent presidents was at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
Although Reagan's lawyers have cited presidential rights in trying to avoid 
turning over the papers, they had tried to avoid using the phrase "executive 
privilege." Many still associate that phrase with former President Richard M. 
Nixon's attempts to disrupt investigations of the Watergate scandal of the 
early 1970s. However, in an order issued earlier Wednesday, Greene made it 
clear that he was unwilling to play semantical games. 
</P>
<P>
He asked Reagan's lawyers if they intended to make "a formal claim . . . of 
executive privilege, as that term is referred to in United States vs. Nixon." 
If not, the judge demanded to know why the former President had failed to 
deliver the diaries, as ordered earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Responding a few hours later, Theodore B. Olson, Reagan's lawyer, said: 
"Although the privilege for confidential presidential or executive branch 
communications has been described by various courts in various ways, no court 
has declared that the protections afforded the privilege . . . may be invoked 
only by reciting the phrase 'executive privilege.' However, if this court 
intended . . . that the privilege may only be invoked in that fashion, the 
former President reaffirms that that was, indeed (his) intention." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Reagan has claimed executive privilege only for his diaries. However, 
Greene on Monday ordered Reagan to give videotaped testimony for use by the 
defense in the Poindexter trial. 
</P>
<P>
The judge gave Reagan's lawyers until Friday to decide if they wish to invoke 
executive privilege concerning the testimony as well. It seems probable that 
the former President will broaden his claim to cover his testimony, although 
Olson declined to comment on his plans. Last week, Greene ordered Reagan to 
surrender about 30 diary entries which the judge said were potentially useful 
to Poindexter's defense. Poindexter's lawyers hope to use the papers to bolster 
their claim that the retired rear admiral's actions were authorized by the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Greene said he would reexamine the issue if Reagan claimed 
executive privilege. The judge said that Reagan's lawyers and the Justice 
Department would be given copies of Poindexter's memorandum stating how the 
diaries fit into defense strategy. Previously, that memo was seen only by the 
judge. Both Reagan's attorneys and the Justice Department will be allowed to 
try to persuade the judge to reverse his order. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting the standard set by the Supreme Court's decision in the 1974 case 
involving Nixon's Watergate tapes, Greene said Reagan would be required to 
comply with Poindexter's subpoena only if Poindexter's "need for the 
information outweighs the claim of privilege." 
</P>
<P>
The high court ruled 8 to 0 that Nixon had to comply with the special 
prosecutor's subpoena for the White House tapes. The court's decision affirmed 
that a President has a right to protect his personal communications, but that 
the right is not absolute. 
</P>
<P>
"The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, 
specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial," the court said.

BRUISING BATTLE A TURNING POINT IN SOVIET HISTORY

<P>
In the Kremlin battles that shape the future of the Soviet Union and much of 
the world around it, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has prevailed once again in his 
unrelenting determination to bring about political and economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when his domestic popularity had declined sharply and his political 
grip seemed to have slipped to the point where rumors of his resignation were 
credible, the Soviet president led the Communist Party on Wednesday into giving 
up its long monopoly on political power. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with a deepening political, economic and social crisis in the 
country and the belief of many that his reforms are largely responsible, 
Gorbachev persuaded the party's policy-making and largely conservative Central 
Committee that perestroika must be broadened and accelerated, not curtailed or 
slowed. 
</P>
<P>
After three days of debate, the 250-member committee voted to accept 
Gorbachev's new platform for the party, at least as a basis for discussion at 
the party congress planned for early summer, and only one person -- populist 
Boris N. Yeltsin, who thought it not radical enough -- voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the full extent of that victory will not be clear until the platform 
is published, Gorbachev's supporters within the leadership were already 
speaking of the party's decision to share power as a turning point in Soviet 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a step of exceptional magnitude in our party's history, a landmark," 
Alexander N. Yakovlev, one of Gorbachev's closest supporters in the party's 
ruling Politburo, said, asserting that in importance the adoption of the new 
party platform exceeds all the reforms undertaken in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
But the debate was bruising. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev was attacked by conservatives for ideological errors, by local party 
leaders for mismanagement, by nominal supporters for attempting to do too much 
and go too fast and by one old and embittered Byelorussian politician for 
overweening political and personal ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our discussion was not just a series of friendly embraces," Yakovlev told 
journalists at the end of the meeting. "There was not a paragraph in the 
platform on which we did not have a debate or a discussion or an argument. 
There were heated and emotional debates, and sometimes it moved beyond the 
limits of a polite and friendly discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who still very closely associate themselves with old-time 
methods, old-time customs and who very highly evaluate the stability and 
comfort of days past. Then there are people who welcome the changes and support 
them, and there are also people who are less patient, who are eager to see more 
rapid changes and who tend to take more radical attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"The task of a politician in any country is to take those attitudes and strive 
for a consensus," Yakovlev continued. "Otherwise, he would not live up to his 
role as a political leader because we cannot just brush some of the opinions 
aside and turn a deaf ear to others. This is not the way things are worked out 
in a democratic society." 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of just such a prolonged and sharp debate, the Central 
Committee meeting had been scheduled to last two days, rather than the normal 
one. Instead, it ran three, still finishing three hours later than planned 
Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives forced changes in the platform -- Yakovlev called them 
"minor" but acknowledged the rewriting had continued to 4 a.m. two days in a 
row -- but they could not defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no alternative, absolutely none," eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov, 
who attended the meeting as an observer, said as he left the Kremlin on 
Wednesday evening. "Gorbachev let them say what they wanted, but it was really, 
as you Americans say, their last hurrah. Even as they spoke, they knew they had 
no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
But few, even among Gorbachev's liberal supporters, appeared to understand the 
logic for move -- his carefully weighed political bet that the party's image 
would be enhanced if it stood ready to take on all comers in the political 
arena, that the power it has held for so long was corrupting it and that only 
through offering to give it up did the party have a hope of retaining it. 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, anticipating Gorbachev's move to free the party from such 
political responsibility, had begun their attacks on him within the Central 
Committee in December, according to two senior party officials. They reached a 
level during this plenary meeting that had not been heard since Nikita S. 
Khrushchev was ousted in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism, according to accounts published in the party newspaper Pravda, 
came from across much of the Soviet political spectrum: from conservatives who 
thought he was going too far, from radicals who accused him of timidity in not 
moving faster, even from liberals who, like others, have been dismayed by the 
failure of perestroika to resolve the country's problems. 
</P>
<P>
The old-line conservatives, traditional in their orthodoxy, said plainly that 
they could not accept many of the basic concepts in the reforms -- the party's 
decision to give up its "leading role" in the government and society, the 
inclusion of privately owned enterprises in the mixed economy, the readiness to 
let the country's constituent republics go their own way, the reduction of the 
country's military might through unilateral moves, the setbacks suffered by 
socialism in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Others, regional and local party officials, who clearly fear loss of their 
power -- even their jobs -- under the new system, focused on the need to 
restore order and discipline amid the chaos created, they contended, by early 
reforms. Those reforms were poorly conceived and haphazardly executed, they 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these officials will probably not survive the forthcoming government 
and party elections, and Gorbachev spoke several times of the need to "renew" 
the Central Committee and the Politburo at the party congress, which is planned 
for June or early July. 
</P>
<P>
For Gorbachev, the question remains, as it has after each of these political 
battles in recent years, of what he will do with his enhanced authority, with 
the broadened reforms. He has repeatedly sought and obtained greater powers to 
push through even more sweeping reforms only to find new obstacles that must be 
cleared. 
</P>
<P>
The paradox of his leadership has, as a result, become his ability to win such 
showdowns in the Kremlin but his inability to reap those victories in the 
factories, on the farms and in the troubled provinces. 
</P>
<P>
"After this, I do not think that he can continue to blame the conservatives for 
compromising his program," a Soviet political commentator remarked Wednesday 
evening. "He has what he asked for, and now he must make it work."

BONN ASKS E. GERMAN TALKS NOW ON ECONOMY, CURRENCY 
</P>

BONN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West German government declared Wednesday that it wants to negotiate 
"immediately" with East Germany on a monetary union and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn Cabinet managed to enlist the support of West German central bank 
President Karl Otto Poehl, an independent official who has been skeptical that 
merging the currencies of East and West Germany would solve the former's 
critical problems. 
</P>
<P>
And the Cabinet, under prodding from Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed to work out 
details of a currency union that would be presented to East German Prime 
Minister Hans Modrow when he arrives here on an official visit next week. 
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to set up working groups to harmonize differences 
in the legal, political and administrative structures of East and West Germany, 
as a prelude to unification. 
</P>
<P>
East German government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said the East Berlin regime 
will consider the Bonn proposals at its regular Cabinet meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
After the Cabinet decision, Finance Minister Theo Waigel told Parliament that 
the decisions to proceed toward a single currency are necessary to dampen the 
"escalation of the crisis" in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We must remain master of the political process," said Waigel, who is head of 
the conservative, Bavarian branch of the ruling Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"The deutschemark has become the currency of choice for the people," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government now envisages a virtual takeover of the East German 
economic and monetary system to keep it from collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere welcomed 
the West German decision as perhaps the only solution to keeping East Germans 
from leaving for the West, currently at the rate of about 2,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal is suited to give signals for people to stay here," said De 
Maiziere, who is head of the East German Christian Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn economists and financial experts hope that substituting the West's hard 
mark for the East's weak mark will convince East Germans that they are being 
paid in a solid currency and encourage them to remain where they are. East 
German workers paid in West marks would see their purchasing power immediately 
jump by 5 to 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
Further, some experts say, if East Germany had a freely convertible currency, 
Western investors would be more easily persuaded to put their money into major 
efforts to renew industry and redevelop the economy there. 
</P>
<P>
However, a West Berlin economic research institute reported Wednesday that 
monetary reform might not stem the flow of East Germans heading west for better 
jobs and lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The real differences in standards of living, which are at the core of the 
extremely difficult economic situation in East Germany, would remain," said the 
report of the DIW Institute. 
</P>
<P>
And Helmut Geiger, head of West Germany's Savings Bank Assn., said Wednesday 
that rescuing the East German economy will need staggering financial assistance 
-- "substantial double-digit sums in billions (of marks)." 
</P>
<P>
West Germans are beginning to realize, to their dismay, that their own standard 
of living might drop if ambitious programs to salvage the East German economy 
are enacted. 
</P>
<P>
But Kohl and Waigel say that the alternative is the westward flow of millions 
more East Germans. East Germans are guaranteed automatic citizenship and 
benefits under the West German constitution, and a flood of them would create a 
housing and job crisis in the Federal Republic. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Western diplomat said Wednesday that the standard of living in a 
united Germany would probably at first decline while East German was being 
modernized but that later, a new "economic miracle" could well take place. 
</P>
<P>
The mass circulation newspaper Bild quoted an internal Bonn Finance Ministry 
report on Wednesday as suggesting that in the short term, as many as 1.4 
million East Germans could face loss of work in the shift to a free market 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, the European Commission on Wednesday set up a special "German 
group" to study the implications of a joint East-West German currency. It 
issued a statement saying that Kohl had called Commission President Jacques 
Delors to brief him on the Bonn developments, adding: "The chancellor 
underlined that the negotiations which are to begin will not cause any delay in 
the timetable of community business," referring to the community's single 
market, scheduled to begin at the end of 1992.

CHINA TREATED DIFFERENTLY, U.S. AIDE SAYS

<P>
One of the senior Bush Administration officials who took part in two secret 
missions to Beijing last year said Wednesday that the Administration has 
decided to treat China differently from any other country in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, seeking to fend off 
comparisons between the Bush Administration's conciliatory policy towards China 
and its tougher stance towards other countries, told the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee that China's population, size and history merit special 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do with regard to China is China-specific," Eagleburger 
declared. " . . . It is different than the way you deal with the GDR (East 
Germany) or Romania or Czechoslovakia, because it's a different country, not 
least of which is it's substantially over a billion people and is a good bit 
larger geographically. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Eagleburger warned that the Administration might not react the 
same way it did after China's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators 
if the Soviet Union were to crush pro-democracy demonstrators in Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that anyone should draw any conclusions from U.S. policy with 
regard to China after Tian An Men Square that applies in any other case," he 
said, responding to questions by senators about possible comparisons with the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger was the first senior U.S. official to testify about the 
Administration's China policy since last July, when President Bush sent him and 
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft for secret talks with Chinese 
leaders. The same two officials made a second trip to Beijing in December. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger's blunt testimony did nothing to assuage congressional criticism of 
the two secret trips. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's hearing, both Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Sen. Gordon J. 
Humphrey (R-N.H.) said they felt that Bush, who headed the U.S. liaison office 
in China in 1974-75, had failed to remain impartial. They accused Bush of 
developing "clientitis." Sarbanes defined this as becoming "so close to the 
country . . . that (he) in effect start(s) speaking for the country instead of 
speaking for the United States." 
</P>
<P>
During his testimony, Eagleburger provided the first sketchy details of his 
July trip to Beijing. On that occasion, just one month after the massacre in 
Beijing and only two weeks after Bush had publicly announced a suspension of 
high-level exchanges between U.S. and Chinese officials, U.S. officials did all 
the talking and Chinese officials just listened, Eagleburger said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only say that the (Chinese) response was inscrutable," Eagleburger said. 
He told Congress that the Chinese leaders would say only that it was up to the 
United States to "untie the knot" -- that is, to make the first move in easing 
the friction in Sino-American relations. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that our July visit was neither easy nor pleasant," said the 
deputy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
That trip lasted only 24 hours, Eagleburger testified. He said he and Scowcroft 
were accompanied only by Douglas H. Paal, director of Asian affairs for the 
National Security Council, and by a secretary. Eagleburger did not say with 
which Chinese leaders the American delegation met. 
</P>
<P>
There has been considerable speculation that the purpose of that first visit 
was to tell Chinese leaders that the President wanted to maintain strong ties 
with China, despite the series of sanctions which he had just imposed. 
According to this theory, the U.S. officials were sent to tell the Chinese 
regime not to overreact, but to wait until Congress and the American public had 
time to forget about the massacre in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
But Eagleburger described the mission in different terms. The trip, he said, 
"was intended to convey an undiluted message from the President to the Chinese 
leadership about America's horror over the massacre." Eagleburger said he also 
told Chinese leaders about Bush's own personal outrage as well, and did not try 
to draw a distinction between the President's views and those of the American 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Sarbanes, the senator who took the most active role in the questioning, pressed 
Eagleburger about the results of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . You made this visit. You came back. You then looked to see what was 
happening. What was happening? My understanding is they detained or arrested 
more than 10,000 people. . . ," Sarbanes said. "Didn't the repression 
continue?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir, it did," admitted Eagleburger. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that when he returned to China in December, "there was much better 
give-and-take" between the Bush Administration officials and the Chinese 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say it was a mea culpa by the Chinese leadership," he said. 
Nevertheless, by December, he said, "there was clearly, on the other side, an 
expression that they heard us."

JIMMY VAN HEUSEN, PROLIFIC SONGSMITH, OSCAR WINNER, DIES

<P>
Jimmy Van Heusen, who took his name from a shirt label and his melodies from a 
mirthful mind and gentle heart, has died at his home in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
The tunesmith whose "Swinging on a Star," "All the Way," "High Hopes" and "Call 
Me Irresponsible" not only won four Oscars but became national monuments, had 
celebrated his 77th birthday last month. 
</P>
<P>
He died Tuesday, a spokesman for the Riverside County coroner's office said 
Wednesday. His death was attributed to a stroke, and the coroner's spokesman 
said he had suffered from cerebral vascular disease for about two years. 
</P>
<P>
Born Edward Chester Babcock in Syracuse, N.Y., he was a mischievous boy who was 
expelled from high school for singing a mildly salacious song "My Canary Has 
Rings Under His Eyes" at a school assembly. 
</P>
<P>
It probably was the only song he was ever identified with that he didn't 
compose himself. 
</P>
<P>
He grew to become a fun-loving adult who once told an interviewer "I dig 
chicks, booze, music and Sinatra -- in that order." 
</P>
<P>
It was Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby who made famous his songs -- "Aren't You 
Glad You're You" from Crosby's film "The Bells of St. Mary's"; "Moonlight 
Becomes You" from Crosby's "The Road to Morocco"; "(Love Is) The Tender Trap," 
from Sinatra's "The Tender Trap" and "All the Way" from Sinatra's "The Joker Is 
Wild." 
</P>
<P>
He was nominated for eight additional Academy Awards for such musical 
masterpieces as "The Second Time Around" from "High Time"; "Pocketful of 
Miracles" from the 1961 film of the same name; "My Kind of Town," a Sinatra 
signature song from "Robin and the 7 Hoods" and more. 
</P>
<P>
He won an Emmy for "Love and Marriage" from the 1955 production of "Our Town." 
It since has become a leitmotif for the current generation of TV watchers who 
now hear it as the theme of the ribald "Married . . . With Children." 
</P>
<P>
If he helped make stars of Crosby (both as a priest and with Bob Hope in the 
legendary "Road" series of comedies) and Sinatra, he also helped make household 
words and friends of his many collaborators -- Johnny Mercer, Johnny Burke, 
Eddie DeLange and most notably and recently, Sammy Cahn. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a building contractor who played the cornet, young Edward Babcock 
was encouraged to seek a conventional education, even though he was more 
interested in music. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving high school under circumstances his parents didn't consider 
amusing, he enrolled briefly at a boarding school near Syracuse but left there 
when teachers found him more often in poolrooms than classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
While still a student, Babcock (who never changed his name legally) landed a 
job on a local radio station for $15 a week. The station manager insisted that 
he change his name, and he appropriated Van Heusen from the shirt manufacturer 
and James because he said he just liked it. 
</P>
<P>
He did attend Syracuse University from 1930 to 1932, studying piano and 
composition, and while there formed a partnership with Jerry Arlen, Harold 
Arlen's younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
His next-door neighbor in Syracuse had been composer Arlen, and when the man 
who was to write the music for "The Wizard of Oz" went to Hollywood in 1933, he 
asked his brother and Van Heusen to take over his composing duties at Harlem's 
famed Cotton Club. 
</P>
<P>
Van Heusen wrote "Harlem Hospitality." The tune and the show it was written for 
flopped, but Van Heusen hung on in New York, operating a freight elevator at 
Park Central Hotel and plugging tunes. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first compositions, "There's a House in Harlem for Sale" was 
performed by the hotel orchestra and got him out of the elevator and into a job 
with a music publishing firm. 
</P>
<P>
He met orchestra leader Jimmy Dorsey in 1938 and offered him his latest song, 
"It's the Dreamer in Me." The resultant recording became a hit and also sold 
100,000 copies of sheet music. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby also recorded it and, by 1940, Van Heusen had become one of Tin Pan 
Alley's most successful composers, with 60 songs published in just one season. 
Next came Hollywood, and he joined with Burke for a songwriting team that 
became known as the Gold Dust Twins. 
</P>
<P>
He composed his first film score with Burke for "Love Thy Neighbor" in 1940, 
which was widely recorded. 
</P>
<P>
In a single week that year, Van Heusen had three songs on the Hit Parade, 
including "Shake Down the Stars," "All This and Heaven Too" and "Polka Dots and 
Moonbeams." 
</P>
<P>
During the wartime summer of 1942, Van Heusen toured West Coast Army camps with 
Crosby, sometimes serving as the crooner's pilot. He had amassed enough flying 
time to qualify as a test pilot for Lockheed Corp., taking war planes up for 
their maiden voyages between 1942 and 1944. 
</P>
<P>
He owned aircraft and a helicopter during the 1960s, and his Yucca Valley ranch 
was equipped with a landing pad. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Van Heusen and Burke were under contract to Crosby, 20th Century 
Fox, MGM, Columbia and International studios. 
</P>
<P>
In 1955 Van Heusen teamed with Cahn and produced a string of motion picture 
scores that became hits. Their Academy Award-winning "High Hopes" was chosen as 
the official song for John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The composer also donated the song "California" to the inaugural gala held for 
former California Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had tremendous success with popular tunes (seven Grammy 
nominations) and movie music, Broadway was one venue whose success eluded Van 
Heusen. The productions of "Swingin' the Dream," "Nellie Bly" and "Carnival in 
Flanders" were all acknowledged by the composer as flops. 
</P>
<P>
(The durable jazz ballad "Darn That Dream" was one of the few bright spots from 
the 1939 "Swingin' the Dream," which starred Louis Armstrong and Benny 
Goodman.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big, big gamble," he said in 1965 before the stage production of 
"Skyscraper," for which he was nominated for a Tony award. "You spend two years 
putting it together, and if six critics don't like it, you're out of business 
overnight. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
He had shaved his head for years and cut a dashing figure with exquisite but 
casual clothes. He loved entertaining, parties, and, until 1969 when he married 
singer Bobbe Brock, being single. Friends said he was able to write songs with 
a party going on around him or while lounging by his swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
He also wrote songs for those same friends, including two for Sinatra's 
daughters -- "Nancy (With the Laughing Face)" and "Tina." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, lyricist Cahn said by telephone from New York that when people 
ask him who is the most fascinating character he ever met, he always answers 
"Jimmy Van Heusen." 
</P>
<P>
"Then they say, 'what about Sinatra?' 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them Sinatra thought he was Van Heusen, but he couldn't pass the 
physical." 
</P>

<P>
CRIME: THE REPUTED UNDERBOSS OF THE MILANO CRIME FAMILY IN LOS ANGELES IS FOUND 
GUILTY OF ATTEMPTED MURDER IN THE EXTORTION-RELATED SHOOTING OF A TOPLESS-BAR 
OWNER.

<P>
Michael Anthony Rizzitello, reputed underboss of the Milano crime family in Los 
Angeles, was found guilty Wednesday by an Orange County Superior Court jury of 
attempted murder and mayhem in an extortion-related shooting of the primary 
owner of a Santa Ana topless bar. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first conviction of Rizzitello, 62, since he and four other Milano 
family members were found guilty of racketeering in a Los Angeles trial 10 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello had been tried in three separate cases since then, and each time was 
acquitted. One of those cases involved a charge of conspiracy to murder a 
government witness and the other two were racketeer-related fraud cases. His 
lawyers accused law enforcement officials of going after him as a "trophy" in 
the Orange County case because of those acquittals. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello was accused of shooting Mustang Club investor William Carroll just 
after midnight on May 1, 1987, while in a car at a parking garage near the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. Prosecutors argued that 
Rizzitello believed he had to eliminate Carroll before he could muscle in on 
profits from the lucrative topless dancer club, which is now defunct. 
</P>
<P>
Just before pulling the trigger, according to Carroll's testimony, Rizzitello 
said: " 'This is for not letting us eat.' " 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 57, survived three shots to the back of his head, but one of the 
bullets struck an optic nerve and left him permanently blind. For 18 months he 
refused to reveal who had shot him. But on Oct. 6, 1988, he agreed to talk to 
investigators. He identified Rizzitello as the shooter and Joseph Angeleno 
Grosso, 46, as the driver who held him down to prevent his escape from the car. 
Grosso was convicted of attempted murder in a separate trial in December. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll's change of heart came just 15 minutes after prosecutors reduced felony 
bank fraud charges against him to a misdemeanor with no jail time. Carroll told 
jurors that he waited until his case was over to name his assailants for fear 
that Rizzitello would have him killed if he had to go to jail in the bank case. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello showed no reaction when the verdicts were read. But later, one of 
his daughters, Donna Smith of Palm Springs, said she was shocked and angry. 
</P>
<P>
"My father is a kind, loving man," she said. "He would never hurt anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said her father had attempted to "go straight and do the right thing" 
after his prison term in the Los Angeles case. "But they won't let him," she 
said. "The FBI and the prosecutors are framing him just because of his name." 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello -- also known as Mike Rizzi -- was prominently mentioned as a top 
hired gunman for the mob in "The Last Mafioso," a best seller written by 
Aladena (Jimmy the Weasel) Fratianno, a mobster-turned-informant. Fratianno 
later testified against Rizzitello at two of his trials. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzitello faces an automatic sentence of at least 27 years to life in prison 
with a possible three years added for the jury finding of great bodily injury. 
The mayhem count was added because Carroll was left blind. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr. set sentencing for March 16.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the space of eight months, the hallowed and powerful role of old-line 
Communist parties in East Europe has eroded steadily. Here is a chronology: 
</P>
<P>
1. 
</P>
<P>
June 10, 1989 -- Under pressure from reformers, the Hungarian Communist Party 
and opposition groups agree to negotiate a multi-party system. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 7, 1989, the Communist Party formally disbands, reconstitutes itself as 
the Hungarian Socialist Party and says it aspires to democratic ideals. 
</P>
<P>
2. Nov. 29 -- The Czechoslovak Parliament deletes from the constitution the 
authority for Communist Party dominance. 
</P>
<P>
3. Dec. 1 -- The East German Parliament removes a constitutional provision 
guaranteeing the party's leading role. 
</P>
<P>
4. Dec. 29 -- The Polish Parliament eliminates a clause in the constitution 
that gave the leading role to the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
5. Jan. 12, 1990 -- Interim Romanian President Ion Iliescu declares that the 
the Communist Party is outlawed. The order is rescinded later, but most leading 
party officials are arrested, and the party's power is broken. 
</P>
<P>
6. Jan. 15 -- The Bulgarian Parliament votes to abolish the guaranteed leading 
role of the Communist Party.

SOVIETS LIKELY TO ASK DEEPER TROOP CUTS IN CENTRAL EUROPE; 
</P>
<P>
ARMS CONTROL: BAKER PRESENTS 'A NUMBER OF NEW POSITIONS' IN HIS FIRST MEETING 
WITH SHEVARDNADZE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III arrived here Wednesday amid signs that 
his Soviet hosts will suggest deeper cuts in U.S. and Soviet forces in Central 
Europe than the 195,000-each figure proposed by President Bush last week. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Baker presented "a number of new positions" in nuclear, 
conventional and chemical arms control during his first meeting with Soviet 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. offers focused on issues in the conventional forces reduction 
talks in Europe, a senior U.S. official said, including such matters as 
aircraft and tanks, but not new manpower proposals. Baker's aim is to speed 
conclusion this year of a treaty now being negotiated to reduce those 
conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had indicated some new U.S. flexibility in dealing with the 
definitions of tanks and aircraft to be covered in that treaty, such as the 
distinction between armored personnel carriers and tanks, and whether training 
and interceptor fighters should be counted in the ceilings for numbers of 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers, beginning the new round of talks, met for three 
hours in their first session, which had been scheduled for half that time. 
</P>
<P>
Baker told reporters on his plane en route here from Prague, Czechoslovakia, 
that he "would not be surprised" at a lower counteroffer from the Soviets on 
the 195,000-troop ceiling that Bush proposed for both U.S. and Soviet forces in 
Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, speaking to reporters as he waited for Baker to arrive, replied, 
"We'll see" when asked if the Soviets will come back with a lower figure for 
troops in the central zone of the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have speculated that Moscow may call for greater force 
reductions in Europe than has Washington because its former allies may not be 
willing to host even 195,000 Soviet soldiers, which is about one-third of the 
current Soviet strength there. 
</P>
<P>
The governments of Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and influential Polish figures 
such as Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, have demanded that all Soviet forces be 
removed within a year. Only East Germany has not yet called for Soviets troops 
to go home, but that may come very soon after the East German elections next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for expecting a Soviet counterproposal is that Bush's offer also 
provided that the United States would retain an additional 30,000 men in Europe 
outside the central zone. The Soviets would have the option to do the same, but 
will almost certainly not be invited to do so by the Warsaw Bloc countries of 
southeastern Europe. They would therefore be likely to seek a way to offset 
that numerical advantage. 
</P>
<P>
On another issue, the question of German reunification took on a new urgency 
during the day with the Soviet announcement that top West German leaders will 
come here Saturday to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze dodged questions about Soviet views toward a reunification 
scenario proposed by West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, 
saying that Genscher and Bonn Chancellor Helmut Kohl will fly here on Saturday 
for talks that will cover reunification in detail. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, this (issue) is a very important problem -- I would say even more 
important (than for the United States)," Shevardnadze told reporters. He added 
that Genscher "always has many reasonable, sensible ideas," suggesting that he 
hopes that another German proposal might be forthcoming during their visit. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher's plan, supported by the United States, Britain and France, envisions 
a united Germany that remains a member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, but with no NATO military structure in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Shevardnadze had proposed an undefined "international referendum" 
on whether German reunification should be permitted, an idea immediately 
rejected by West Germany and its Western allies, who consider the issue to be 
mainly up to the German people. 
</P>
<P>
Senior U.S. officials said reunification could come "shortly after" East German 
elections are held on March 18. 
</P>
<P>
The Baker-Shevardnadze meeting began one hour later than scheduled because of 
the crucial Communist Party Central Committee meeting which Shevardnadze 
attended. He said later that for the first time in his life, he broke party 
discipline by leaving the meeting before its conclusion in order to meet Baker. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze gave Baker a report on the Central Committee discussions before 
the two laid out an agenda for the next two days of talks. Baker in turn 
outlined the latest U.S. arms control ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Baker had been expected to bring new ideas on how to resolve the continuing 
disagreement in the nuclear arms negotiations on air-launched cruise missiles. 
His proposal, U.S. officials had said, would offer a U.S. concession on the 
range of such weapons in exchange for Soviet concessions on how to count the 
number of those weapons carried on a bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some expectations, Baker did not bring a new proposal on limiting 
multiple warheads on mobile missiles, U.S. officials said, in part because the 
U.S. government could not agree internally on a new position in the face of 
uncertainties about whether Congress will fund global U.S. missiles this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets may raise the questions, however, and if so, the American team will 
defer any detailed discussion of the issue until the next meeting of Baker and 
Shevardnadze.

RED CROSS DELIVERS SUPPLIES TO EMBATTLED EAST BEIRUT;

<P>
LEBANON: OVERCROWDED AND BLOODIED HOSPITAL CORRIDORS DISPLAY SUFFERING IN 
CHRISTIAN SECTOR. A RELATIVE LULL MARKS MILITIA WARFARE.

<P>
A Red Cross relief convoy crossed into embattled East Beirut on Wednesday, 
delivering medical supplies to Christian hospitals and retrieving a handful of 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
As the battle for supremacy between Christian forces continued in its second 
week, overcrowded and bloodied hospital corridors and emergency rooms testified 
to the suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Supplies of oxygen, plasma and drugs were drained or gone, according to press 
reports, and hospital authorities have announced that they will bury the dead 
in mass graves. Continuing shellfire kept most civilians pinned in their 
underground shelters, unable to pick up bodies of relatives for proper burial. 
Hospital morgues, like the rest of the Christian sector of the Lebanese 
capital, have been without power for days. 
</P>
<P>
On the battlefronts, a relative lull marked the fighting between the troops of 
Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and the Lebanese Forces militia. On Tuesday, Aoun's men 
had cut through to the Mediterranean coast at the town of Dbaiye, separating 
the militia's headquarters in the port-side Karantina district and its 
strongholds in urban East Beirut from militia forces farther north at the 
harbor towns of Juniyah and Jubayl. 
</P>
<P>
Press estimates place the number of wounded in a week of fighting at more than 
1,700, with at least 350 killed, a staggering toll that reflects the ferocity 
of the shelling and street battles. Reporters who made their way into Dbaiye on 
Wednesday morning said the town was devastated by the three-day battle there. 
No building appeared untouched, and scores of burned-out tanks and military 
vehicles filled the streets, they reported. 
</P>
<P>
With his outnumbered militia hard-pressed by the loss of Dbaiye, Lebanese 
Forces commander Samir Geagea called late Tuesday on French President Francois 
Mitterrand "to act swiftly to arrange an immediate halt to the hysteric 
killing." France once administered Lebanon and is a strong supporter of the 
country's now-divided Christian community. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross column of 10 ambulances was escorted across the so-called Green 
Line separating the Muslim western sector of the capital from the Christian 
east by French Embassy cars, an operation supervised by French envoy Bernard 
Kouchner. 
</P>
<P>
Kouchner organized a similar relief mission last spring when all of Beirut was 
paralyzed by an artillery war between Aoun's forces and Syrian gunners in the 
west. 
</P>
<P>
After delivering the medical supplies, the ambulances returned to West Beirut 
with 15 critically wounded patients, according to the press reports. They were 
placed aboard a French hospital plane at the Beirut airport for evacuation from 
the besieged capital. 
</P>
<P>
With the collapse of eight cease-fires in the past week, the Lebanese Red Cross 
has managed only four missions into the eastern sector. At times, some of the 
eight Red Cross centers in East Beirut have gone unstaffed because of the 
fighting. One Red Cross team of 25 volunteers was trapped in its center for 
several days with 70 wounded civilians -- and no way to evacuate or feed them. 
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese civil war has exacted a steep price from the Red Cross. Since the 
conflict began in 1975, 11 volunteers have been killed and 30 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, when efforts failed to secure a truce so the Red Cross could pass, 
volunteers Marwan Tayyara and Ghaleb Sleem packed medical supplies in their 
small car and took their chances. 
</P>
<P>
Relying on the good relations the Lebanese Red Cross has with all combatant 
forces in the country, the volunteers were able to reach two hospitals. Then 
Tayyara and Sleem made a second mission carrying bread, cheese, olives and 
water for Red Cross volunteers besieged in one center. Asked why he and Sleem 
had taken such a chance, Tayyara answered that his colleagues "couldn't 
continue any longer. And they would do the same for us." 
</P>
<P>
The International Red Cross has 1,400 volunteers in its Lebanese contingent, 
many of them students. The current stage of the Lebanese conflict began last 
week when Aoun, who had been sacked as commander of the Lebanese army by 
President Elias Hrawi, demanded that the militia disarm or accede to his 
control. Geagea recognizes the Hrawi presidency, while Aoun has repudiated it 
as a Syrian puppet regime. 
</P>
<P>
Early this week, several Arab newspapers suggested that the militia invited the 
break with the support of United States and Syria, both of which had demanded 
that Aoun step down in favor of a national reconciliation government headed by 
Hrawi. A report by the Paris correspondent of the Kuwaiti daily Al Qabas said 
Geagea had met with unidentified American officials in East Beirut and held 
secret contacts with Syrian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The aim, according to the Al Qabas report and others in the Saudi daily Ash 
Sharq al Awsat and the London-based Lebanese newspaper El Hayat, was to topple 
Aoun and bring his loyal troops under the authority of Hrawi. 
</P>
<P>
There was no public confirmation of the accounts, which would put Syria and 
Washington in league with a militia whose reputation has been sullied in the 
past with charges of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fighting continued Wednesday with the failure of yet another 
truce. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one cease-fire that lasts in Lebanon," a local Red Cross official 
said, "and that's the one declared for Mrs. Alexandra Issa Khoury, our 
president." 
</P>
<P>
The 80-year-old Red Cross administrator, a Maronite Catholic, lives in East 
Beirut. On weekday mornings at 6 a.m., she is picked up by her driver, Ali 
Haidar, a Shiite Muslim who lives in the southern suburbs of West Beirut. They 
drive across the Green Line to Red Cross headquarters, located in the western 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
Her 20-year-old Buick bears Red Cross markings and a license plate that reads 
"Number 1." 
</P>
<P>
"When they see Number 1 coming, they hold their fire," said the official.

SEN. BYRD BACKS AID CUTS TO BIG RECIPIENTS; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN POLICY: DEMOCRAT PRAISES DOLE FOR LAUNCHING DEBATE ON LEVELS OF 
ASSISTANCE.

<P>
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.) lent 
Democratic support Wednesday to a proposal by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) to reduce the amount of U.S. foreign aid allocated to major recipients 
such as Israel and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd took issue with some aspects of Dole's much-criticized proposal, which 
would cut all earmarked aid by 5% and reallocate the money to help meet the 
needs of budding democracies in Eastern Europe and the post-invasion government 
of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
But warning that a budget-conscious Congress is not going to bake a bigger 
"foreign aid pie" next year, Byrd praised Dole's courage for launching a 
controversial but long overdue debate over the appropriate level of financial 
assistance to other nations. 
</P>
<P>
The former Senate Democratic leader, who as appropriations chairman will help 
determine how foreign aid is sliced in 1991, offered an alternative proposal 
certain to generate even more controversy -- cuts of 10% to 20% for the 
"largest" recipients of earmarked aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than an across-the-board reduction, it may be wiser to look at each 
country on its merits. Some countries, certainly the largest of our historic 
aid recipients, can probably take cuts substantially larger than 5%," Byrd 
said, adding that "somewhere between 10% and 20%" would be more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd did not single out Israel or other major aid recipients, and he suggested 
that some countries for which Congress currently earmarks aid could be 
exempted. 
</P>
<P>
But, girding for the criticism that is sure to follow, aides indicated 
privately that the senator was referring to the "big five" recipients -- 
Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Turkey and the Philippines -- that account for more 
than half of the $15-billion total U.S. aid budget. 
</P>
<P>
"You can look at the list" of the largest aid recipients "and draw your own 
conclusions," one Byrd staffer said. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, which will receive about $3 billion in military and economic assistance 
this year, and Egypt, which will receive about $2 billion, lead the list of 
U.S. aid recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that overall foreign aid is "not going to grow as a result of the 
so-called peace dividend" and should not expand "out of proportion to our 
domestic programs," Byrd said increasing aid to Eastern Europe and Panama 
depends on a rearrangement of existing resources. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd's proposal was quickly criticized by other Democrats, who disputed his 
contention that the peace dividend -- money that could be siphoned from the 
defense budget now that the Warsaw Pact military threat seems to be receding -- 
could not be used to expand foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Some additional resources could well come from the kind of resources we have 
been devoting to the defense of Western Europe," said House Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley (D-Wash.). 
</P>
<P>
Cutting aid to Israel could send "the wrong kind of signal" to Iran and radical 
Arab states in the Middle East, said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
"If the Syrians, Iranians and Libyans read that signal to mean the United 
States did not stand by Israel's survival, we would be forced to look at a new 
set of realities that would be far more costly, not only to our national 
treasury but to our national interests," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators in both the House and the Senate said the chances of either the 
Dole or the Byrd proposals winning widespread support are virtually nil, 
especially in a congressional election year. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, many lawmakers acknowledge that they share the Administration's 
frustration that much of the foreign aid budget is bound by commitments to a 
handful of countries and cannot be used as effectively as it should to shape 
events and aid U.S. interests in a changing world.

China's Communist Party responded quickly Wednesday to radical changes in the 
Soviet Union by warning its opponents that taking a similar path in China would 
set off civil war. 
</P>
<P>
"In China, without the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, new 
turmoil and wars would surely arise, the nation would be split and the people, 
not to mention state construction, would suffer," the party said in an 
editorial in the party newspaper People's Daily. 
</P>
<P>
The message was released in advance by the New China News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
It raised the age-old Chinese fear of chaos to justify the need for a united 
and supremely powerful authority to govern 1.1 billion people. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the Soviet Union nor Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was 
mentioned by name, but diplomats said the message was clearly aimed at heading 
off any unsettling reaction among the Chinese people to events that have shaken 
the foundations of communism. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Communist Party leadership agreed Wednesday to surrender its 
70-year-old guaranteed monopoly on power, paving the way for the possible 
creation of a multi-party democracy. 
</P>
<P>
China's state-controlled media have maintained a blackout on the Soviet party 
plenum that ended its three-day session in Moscow on Wednesday, but many people 
have tuned in to foreign radio broadcasts.

He lies in a dingy hospital ward, his left arm in a thick cast, but Mohammed 
Bashir says he is only sorry he was not killed when he and his friends tried to 
invade India. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be proud if I was shaheed," or martyred, the 23-year-old laborer 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
So Bashir said he will try again to liberate India's state of Jammu and Kashmir 
when he recovers. 
</P>
<P>
"I will go again," he promised, "but with weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Bashir and the 10 other wounded Muslim youths in the so-called "martyrs ward" 
at the Allama Iqbal Hospital here are the question mark that hangs over the 
increasingly tense India-Pakistan border around Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, several thousand unarmed Pakistanis marched through tall grass to a 
border crossing five miles north of this sprawling frontier town. Ignoring 
Pakistani guards, several dozen rushed across to plant homemade flags on the 
Indian side while others set fire to the grass. 
</P>
<P>
Indian troops fired first into the air, then into the surging crowd, officials 
said. A 13-year-old boy was shot in the head and killed. At least a dozen 
others were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
After months of violence and scores of deaths in Kashmir, the incident marked 
the first Pakistani casualties in the current unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Jammu and Kashmir, as the region is officially called, has been the cause of 
two of Pakistan's three wars with India, in 1948 and 1965. After a U.N. 
cease-fire in 1949, the area was divided by a line of control. India integrated 
its part of the region into India as the state of Jammu and Kashmir, despite 
protests from Pakistan and calls for a plebiscite. The northern part of the 
region remains under Pakistan's control. 
</P>
<P>
Unsanctioned incursions by Muslim zealots helped spark the 1948 and 1965 wars, 
and anxious government officials and diplomats in New Delhi and Islamabad fear 
it could happen again. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want any situation on the ground that will lead to a conflict," J. N. 
Dixit, India's high commissioner in Islamabad, said by phone after the Monday 
shooting. "But intrusions into our territory we will have to resist." 
</P>
<P>
"If they resort to mass killing, let them kill us," responded Sardar Abdul 
Qayyum, president of Pakistan's part of Kashmir, who says he wants some day to 
lead 100,000 people across the border. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials have played down the incident and said that no special 
border alerts or troop movements have been ordered. "Everybody thinks this was 
a mistake," said one officer. 
</P>
<P>
Kashmir's violence was contained until Monday inside the rugged Himalayan 
region that sticks up like India's sore thumb between Pakistan and China. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1988, a growing movement of pro-independence and pro-Pakistan 
groups have fought Indian troops and police in the streets of Srinagar -- 
summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir -- and other towns, 
demanding an end to what they charge is corrupt Indian misrule. Observers say 
more than 200 have died on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
The latest deaths in such clashes occurred Wednesday in Srinagar when two 
bystanders, both businessmen, were killed in an exchange of gunfire between 
separatists and security forces that started after a bomb explosion set fire to 
a hotel and several nearby shops. Five people were reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has long demanded a U.N. plebiscite to let Kashmir determine its own 
future. About 65% of the people in Jammu and Kashmir state are Muslim, making 
it the only Muslim-majority state in predominantly Hindu India. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Islamic fundamentalists are helping to lead the uprising. Extremist 
groups have mushroomed and one, known as Allah Tigers, closed bars, cinemas and 
beauty parlors and ordered women to wear veils in the once-bustling tourist 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Sialkot, where dozens of Indian and Pakistani tanks battled in the 1965 
war, the Muslim connection helped draw about 100,000 townspeople into the dusty 
streets Monday to join a national strike and protest over the Indian crackdown 
on protests in Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
"People say the Indians are crushing the Kashmiris," said Dr. Arif Sheikh, who 
works in the district hospital emergency room. "And only because they are 
Muslim." 
</P>
<P>
His colleague, Dr. Mohammed Saleem, said the parents of the boy who was killed 
on the border, poor farmers from nearby Patessar village, know he did not die 
in vain. 
</P>
<P>
"They say he is a martyr," Saleem said. "He has sacrificed his life for Islam, 
and for the cause of freedom in Kashmir." 
</P>
<P>
The religious zeal was clear inside the dimly lit concrete "martyr's ward," 
where the wounded men lay under red blankets as relatives offered quiet comfort 
and cold curry. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not care for my life," said Sargit Hussain, 25, a bricklayer, when asked 
how he got shot in the hip. "I just rushed with my flag." 
</P>
<P>
"Inshallah, time will come," he added quietly. "We will get Kashmir."

BUSH OBSERVERS DROP MISSION TO NICARAGUA

A 20-member congressional group named by President Bush to observe this month's 
elections in Nicaragua has been disbanded after members were denied visas by 
the leftist Managua government, Sen. Richard G. Lugar said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lugar, an Indiana Republican, said President Bush concurs that there is no 
chance for the group to serve its intended function of determining whether the 
Feb. 25 balloting is free and fair. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nicaraguan government has remained intransigent in arbitrarily choosing 
those it wished to observe the election and making a point of hostility to any 
official U.S. observers," Lugar said. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said in a statement that it is "disappointed that Sandinista 
stone-walling has brought this about." The visa refusals and other actions 
"bring into question the Sandinista commitment (to free elections)," it said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, former President Jimmy Carter, who heads a separate observer 
group, briefed members of the House and Senate on his trips to Nicaragua and 
gave a largely optimistic report about chances for fair elections. 
</P>
<P>
"He feels pretty good about it," said Lugar, who attended one of the briefings. 
</P>
<P>
In Managua, the Sandinista-dominated National Assembly gave formal approval to 
amnesty for more than 1,000 political prisoners, pre-empting a key opposition 
pledge less than three weeks before the elections. 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega, seeking another six-year term, made the amnesty 
proposal last week, and the National Assembly rubber-stamped it Wednesday with 
a 76-4 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The amnesty covers 1,189 people, most of them accused of taking part in the 
U.S.-backed Contra insurgency.

RAINS STALL EFFORT TO MOVE PROSPECTORS OFF INDIAN LAND; 
</P>
<P>
BRAZIL: GOLD RUSH HAS BROUGHT HUNGER, DISEASE AND DEATH TO AN AMAZON BASIN 
TRIBE.

Heavy tropical rains are stalling a government effort to relocate thousands of 
gold prospectors who have illegally invaded tribal lands of Brazil's Yanomami 
Indians and endangered their pristine society, a Justice Ministry spokesman 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A gold rush that began in 1987 has lured the prospectors to large areas of 
Yanomami land, exposing the previously isolated Indians to diseases and 
disrupting their traditional means of livelihood. Sickness and hunger have 
spread, and pro-Indian organizations estimate deaths in the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
The plight of the Yanomami has drawn international attention as an example of 
the harm that is befalling Brazil's 220,000 Indians with settlement of the 
Amazon wilderness. The search for gold on Yanomami lands, said to have yielded 
up to $1 billion, is part of a widespread rush that has drawn hundreds of 
thousands of prospectors into the Amazon River basin over the past several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Justice Minister Saul Ramos reached an agreement with prospectors' 
representatives for the voluntary evacuation of outsiders from areas designated 
as Yanomami tribal lands. In return, Ramos promised to push for the designation 
of areas where gold prospecting would be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, the onset of seasonal downpours has all but stopped evacuation 
of prospectors from the Indian areas by light plane and helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
"It is raining all day," said Ovidio Martins de Araujo, a Justice Ministry 
spokesman. "So we don't have any way of getting the prospectors out." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, 900 prospectors were ready and waiting for evacuation 
from a camp called Bahiano Formiga but aircraft were unable to land because of 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
De Araujo said by telephone from Brasilia, the capital, that 18,000 to 20,000 
prospectors will be evacuated, but he gave no estimate of how long this will 
take. "It's going to depend a lot on the weather," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rainy season could continue into June in that part of the Amazon basin. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, the Yanomami were believed to be the largest South American 
tribal group still isolated from outside society. Brazilian authorities 
currently estimate the number of Yanomamis in this country at 4,000, but 
unofficial estimates put the number as high as 10,000. Yanomamis are spread 
over a wilderness area of 36,000 square miles in the Brazilian states of 
Amazonas and Roraima, and also in southern Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
Indian advocates have long claimed that the 36,000 square miles belong by 
tradition and law to the Yanomami. The area was once recognized as "Yanomami 
indigenous lands" by the government Indian agency, but in 1988 President Jose 
Sarney issued executive orders to create two national forests on nearly half of 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Sarney administration designated 19 smaller areas with a total of 10,000 
square miles as traditional Yanomami tribal lands. Pro-Indian groups argue that 
the 19 areas and the two parks are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
In early January, federal police acting on a court order began operations aimed 
at removing gold prospectors from the 36,000-square-mile area. Last week, 
prospectors demonstrated in Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima, demanding access 
to at least part of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Ramos and other officials met with officials of the Amazon 
Prospectors Union, who promised that the prospectors would leave the 19 new 
Indian areas if they are permitted to extract gold from other parts of the 
36,000 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos promised government efforts to create two previously proposed prospecting 
areas with a total of 1,500 square miles within one of the newly created 
national forests. Ministry spokesman De Araujo emphasized that the prospectors 
must leave Indian areas first, but he acknowledged that the government is doing 
nothing to stop them from entering the two areas proposed for prospecting. 
</P>
<P>
Aldo Mongiano, the Catholic bishop of Boa Vista, predicted that the two 
proposed prospecting areas will not solve the problem. "The presence of the 
prospectors in those areas next to Indian villages should not be permitted, 
because it will be impossible to monitor them and prevent the prospectors from 
invading the Indian reserves again," the bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
Abel de Barros Lima, legal representative of the Committee for the Creation of 
Yanomami Park, said the agreement with the prospectors is illegal because only 
an act of the Brazilian Congress can reclassify land within the 
36,000-square-mile area claimed for the Yanomamis. 
</P>
<P>
Lima said by telephone from Sao Paulo, where the committee is headquartered, 
that the Sarney administration is stalling for time so that it can pass the 
problem on to the administration of President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello, 
who takes office March 15. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that there is no will within the government to carry out the 
evacuation of the prospectors," Lima said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that to save the Yanomami Indians, the entire 36,000 square miles must 
be evacuated, not just the 19 newly designated Indian areas, which he called 
"islands." While the Indians live in the 19 areas, they need to move freely 
among them,to maintain their traditional customs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, malaria and other diseases spread by prospectors are 
rapidly undermining Indian health. Sickness decreases their ability to hunt and 
gather food, while contact with the outsiders increases their dependence on 
scarce commercial supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds and hundreds of Indians dying because of that invasion of 
prospectors," said Lima. "It is impossible to prevent the malaria and stop the 
genocide of the Yanomami if the prospectors are not removed."

The government of Austria agreed to pay about $25 million in reparations to 
Jewish survivors of the World War II Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be invested in projects aimed at helping the survivors. The 
announcement of the payments marked a sharp shift for Austria, which has 
traditionally argued that the country itself was a victim of Nazi aggression. 
Some Austrian Jews theorized that the change of heart stems from the 
international uproar over the 1986 election of President Kurt Waldheim, who 
served in the German army but has denied any complicity in war crimes.

INS REVIVES DETENTION POLICY FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS IN TEXAS

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, citing a need to "defend this 
border," on Wednesday revived its highly controversial policy of placing 
illegal aliens seeking political asylum in a remote detention center here. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the aliens, mostly Central Americans, will be apprehended and 
brought to the tent camp for an immediate determination as to whether they 
qualify for political asylum. If they do not meet the INS' rigorous standard, 
they can then be quickly deported. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by INS Commissioner Gene McNary at the end of a tour 
of the detention facilities here. 
</P>
<P>
The immigration chief said that six large tents had been set up on the grounds 
of the detention center, enough to house 2,500 detainees. He said that as many 
as 10,000 people could be held at the compound. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to enforce the laws concerning the border," McNary said. "We are 
here to stay. We are going to defend this border." 
</P>
<P>
McNary said illegal border crossings had been gradually increasing over the 
last several months. The U.S. Border Patrol said that 1,860 illegal aliens from 
countries other than Mexico were apprehended in January, up from 829 in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
McNary, who has been INS commissioner for three months, is essentially 
re-implementing a program used last winter when large numbers of Central 
Americans, especially Nicaraguans, were applying for political asylum in South 
Texas. The INS contended then that the majority of those seeking asylum were 
not being persecuted in their homeland because of their political beliefs and 
wanted only to come to the United States to improve their standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
The detention program was challenged in court by refugee groups, who charged 
that it was inhumane and violated a 1980 law enacted by Congress to ensure the 
rights of those seeking asylum. The INS eventually won the case. 
</P>
<P>
The INS appeared to be moving away from the policy later in 1989. As late as 
last week, the INS was allowing a number of refugees at the detention center to 
leave without posting bond, so long as they could prove they had a relative to 
stay with and promised to return for their hearing. McNary himself had ordered 
that the detention center population be decreased to 668 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"The most interesting thing about the policy announcement is that it appeared 
the INS was moving in the exact opposite direction," said Robert Rubin, a 
member of the San Francisco Lawyers' Committee for Urban Affairs, which has 
taken an active role in defending refugees. "Mr. McNary in fact said that the 
releases in South Texas were caused, among other things, by a budgetary crunch. 
It's strange that two weeks later it's changing." 
</P>
<P>
Sister Juliana Garcia of the Casa Romero Refugee Center, outside the South 
Texas city of Brownsville, said Wednesday that the number of people seeking 
assistance there had fallen off considerably since the INS began its policy of 
lowering the population of the detention center. She said that refugees would 
instead turn themselves into the Border Patrol confident that they would only 
be detained a few days before being sent on their way. 
</P>
<P>
"All the information gets to the people very very soon," she said. "I guess the 
people in Miami are telling their relatives in Central America that there is 
amnesty in Texas." McNary's announcement in Texas appeared to be an attempt by 
the INS to stem the tide and send out word that there would be no easy way to 
enter the country and then disappear. 
</P>
<P>
McNary said that anyone apprehended will be processed in a single day and a 
decision will be made immediately about whether the illegal alien will be 
allowed to apply for political amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain political asylum in the United States, refugees "must be able to show 
a well-founded fear of persecution and that they are not just coming here to 
get a job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McNary said that $11 million had been allocated for the detention program, a 
figure that seemed somewhat low. Last year, the INS was about $50 million over 
budget and much of that red ink was because of the South Texas campaign to 
detain those crossing the border illegally.

In an indictment of how U.S. schools teach geography, a government study of 
American high school seniors released Wednesday indicates that many students 
are graduating largely ignorant about the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The Geography Learning of High-School Seniors," a 78-page report by the U.S. 
Department of Education, reveals that while 85% of students can locate the 
Soviet Union on a map, a confused minority can't differentiate between latitude 
and longitude, use maps effectively or understand what causes earthquakes. 
Relatively few of the students tested displayed a firm grasp of environmental 
problems and world economic relations. 
</P>
<P>
Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos said students' answers indicate "most of 
what they learned about geography they did not learn in school," but from 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we place a new emphasis on studying geography," he said, "we're passing 
on to our children the stewardship of a world they literally do not know." 
</P>
<P>
Education experts said parents are bringing up their children in an environment 
without atlases or globes and sending them to schools where many teachers have 
little knowledge of physical and cultural geography. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, only one in seven high school students takes a geography 
course, according to the Council of Chief State School Officers. 
</P>
<P>
When it is taught, geography is often integrated into other courses, such as 
history, social studies and science, said the report, which was based on a 
multiple-choice test given in 1988 to 3,030 students in 304 public and private 
schools nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Some excerpts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 71% of the students correctly identified Latin America on a map, but 15% 
confused it with sub-Saharan Africa. Only 37% could locate Southeast Asia, site 
of America's longest war. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 72% could identify the world's major exporters of oil, but only 48% knew 
the areas of major U.S. coal deposits. While two-thirds of the students 
correctly indicated that the Mississippi River emptied into the Gulf of Mexico, 
15% thought its terminus was the Atlantic Ocean, while more than 10% picked the 
Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When asked the cause of the decline of forests in the American Midwest, 65% 
correctly answered "the growth of farming." But 20% attributed the 
deforestation to forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In a map showing population concentrations, almost one-fourth of the 
students mistakenly labeled them "abundant mineral deposits." Some 16% 
indicated that ships traveling from New York to London went through the Panama 
Canal. Some 32% apparently thought that Finland has a tropical or desert 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the results are encouraging, but most are disturbing and confirm what 
we already know: An unacceptably high percentage of American high school 
graduates have not learned geography," said Gilbert Grosvenor, president of the 
National Geographic Society, which co-financed the study with the National 
Center for Education Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, students correctly answered slightly more than half of the 
questions, although scores in the Southeast were lower than in the West, 
Midwest and Northeast. White males performed better in geography than their 
female peers, the study found.

OXYGENATOR PATIENT DIES 5 DAYS AFTER IMPLANT

The first human patient to use an experimental lung-assisting device, a 
teen-ager suffering from severe respiratory stress, died Wednesday, five days 
after the bundle of fine tubing was implanted in her chest. 
</P>
<P>
Melicia Harvey, 16, of Arthur City, Tex., died of "worsening pulmonary 
failure," Tim Madden of LDS Hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental IntraVascular Oxygenator, implanted during a two-hour 
operation Friday, functioned properly until the girl's death, Madden said. He 
added that the hospital's government-approved program of implantation surgery 
will be continued. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no clinical complications from the use of the device, which added 
oxygen to and removed carbon dioxide from the patient's blood," Madden said. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey's name and details of her condition were withheld at her family's 
request until a Texas newspaper, the Paris News, identified her and her father, 
Atrell Harvey II. Madden confirmed her identity Wednesday with the family's 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
The IVOX, a 20-inch bundle of hundreds of gas-permeable tubes, each about the 
thickness of a human hair, was designed to give damaged lungs time to rest and 
recover. It is inserted via the neck or groin into the inferior vena cava, the 
large vein that brings blood to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Two tubes, each the diameter of a soda straw, lead out of the body from the 
main bundle of tubes. One delivers oxygen to the blood; the other vents carbon 
dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
The IVOX was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September for 
temporary use in not more than 10 patients at LDS and three other medical 
centers, including the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Madden said that in its most severe forms, adult respiratory distress syndrome 
causes death in 90% to 95% of all cases. It has a variety of causes and is 
characterized by an inability of the lung to transfer oxygen to the blood. 
</P>
<P>
Before Harvey died, it was unclear how long doctors would leave the device 
implanted.

The Senate approved legislation providing nearly $1.5 billion to upgrade 
education and help the United States deal with an increasingly competitive 
world economy. By a 92-8 vote, senators passed and sent to the House the 
Excellence in Education Act, initially submitted to Congress by President Bush 
last spring. The final passage came after Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) was 
thwarted in attempts to strike a provision awarding $25 million in federal 
funds over three years to the National Board for Professional Teaching 
Standards.

A drug widely used to treat babies who have convulsions during high fevers can 
at least temporarily lower their IQs and should not be routinely used, 
researchers have concluded in a study published in the New England Journal of 
Medicine. The medicine, phenobarbital, is the drug of choice for infants with 
so-called febrile seizures. The researchers found a small but measurable 
decline in the IQs of youngsters who took the medicine for two years.

A medicine widely used to treat babies who have convulsions during high fevers 
can at least temporarily lower their IQs and should not be routinely used, 
researchers have concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The medicine, phenobarbital, is the drug of choice for infants with so-called 
febrile seizures. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors routinely prescribe it to prevent the convulsions from recurring. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found a small but measurable decline in the IQs of youngsters 
who took the medicine for two years. They also found that the treatment failed 
to significantly reduce the seizures. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Deborah G. Hirtz, a co-author of the study at the National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said there has been growing concern about 
the possible hazards of phenobarbital. 
</P>
<P>
"In this trial, we wanted to ask the question of whether there were specific 
cognitive and behavioral side effects in young children treated for febrile 
seizures," she said. "The major outcome variable was the IQ test at the end of 
treatment. We did find that there was a difference between children who had 
been given phenobarbital and those given placebos." 
</P>
<P>
After two years of treatment, the IQs of those taking phenobarbital were eight 
points lower than those who had taken placebos, or dummy pills. Six months 
after they went off the drug, their IQs were still five points lower. 
</P>
<P>
Convulsions are common complications of childhood infections that cause high 
fevers.

TANKER INCIDENT LIKELY TO FUEL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since the Exxon Valdez disaster blackened Alaska's Prince William Sound 
last March, state and federal officials have warned that California's coastline 
could not be protected from an oil spill even one-tenth the size. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the United States warned last year that there was a 94% 
chance of a major oil spill off the Southern California coast during the next 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night's large spill from a tanker off Huntington Beach marked the 
second major incident off California since the disastrous 1969 blowout of a 
platform off the Santa Barbara coast that spilled 77,000 barrels. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, an estimated 24,000 barrels of oil spilled from the tanker Puerto 
Rican when it caught fire and blew up off San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
None of the incidents approaches the 462,000-barrel Alaskan disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday's spill (6,000 barrels, or about 250,000 gallons) still is 
classified as a "major spill" by industry and state officials. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a big deal. As we understand it the slick is 1.5 miles long and 300 
yards wide," said Robert C. Hight, chief of the State Lands Commission's legal 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the Huntington Beach spill's final size, the political consequences 
may exceed its environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
It appears certain to spark new protests against offshore drilling at a time 
when President Bush is under pressure to ban all oil and gas exploration off 
the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
The spill is also likely to add momentum to a sweeping environmental initiative 
proposed for the November ballot. It would prohibit any new oil drilling in 
state waters unless there was a national emergency, and impose a 
25-cent-a-barrel tax to establish a $500-million spill-prevention and cleanup 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
Even as attempts were being made to contain Wednesday's spill, two leading 
opponents of offshore drilling -- Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy and state Controller 
Gray Davis -- were on their way to the scene, declaring that the incident 
proved the case for tough new fines on oil spillers and bans on new drilling. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy and Davis, both Democrats, are members of the State Lands Commission, 
which has banned any new drilling in state waters. They have also pushed the 
legislation to establish the spill-prevention and cleanup fund. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this spill helps us get our legislation, which the oil industry is in 
the process of trying to weaken, passed in Sacramento," McCarthy said minutes 
before he left for Huntington Beach. "If we had that legislation in the 
statutes right now, British Petroleum (operators of the tanker) would probably 
have to pay a $25-million fine." 
</P>
<P>
Davis called the spill "a terrible tragedy with potentially tremendous 
environmental and economic consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Exxon Valdez accident, the oil industry has admitted that it had 
"neither the equipment nor the personnel" to handle a catastrophic spill like 
the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
Industry and government regulators say most emphasis has to be placed on 
prevention, not cleanup. That is because oil spill cleanup technology -- which 
essentially means the use of floating booms to contain the oil, skimmers to 
pick it up and chemical dispersants to break it up before it reaches shore -- 
have proven ineffective in even moderate wind and sea conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Even though California appears better prepared than many coastal states, 
cleanup containment technology may not do the job. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of luck involved, a lot of skill and a lot of preparation. But 
you can't fight Mother Nature," Skip Onstead, manager of an oil spill 
cooperative, told The Times last year. 
</P>
<P>
While most of Southern California is covered by well-trained oil spill response 
teams -- including one cooperative that responded to Wednesday's incident -- 
there are large sections of the California coast, including San Diego and the 
North Coast, that do not have any oil spill response capability that could 
reach even a minor spill.

The outspoken head of a public utility declared his candidacy for the Assembly, 
describing the Legislature as "the biggest little whorehouse in California." 
Joe Buonaiuto, 40, president of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's

Assemblyman Tim Leslie (R-Carmichael), who he described as too conservative and 
unrepresentative of mainstream voters.

Saying he believes that lawmakers have been bought like prostitutes by special

Southland congressmen want two San Bernardino County military bases slated for 
closure to be considered as sites for new airports intended to relieve crowding 
at Orange County's John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Washington convened by Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), an 
opponent of proposals to locate a new airport in Orange or San Diego counties, 
there was general agreement that any new airports should be developed in 
less-populated and less-mountainous areas of Southern California. Packard said 
George Air Force Base near Victorville was discussed as a strong candidate. The 
congressmen also discussed moving all air cargo and overnight mail service from 
John Wayne to Norton Air Force Base near San Bernardino.

Cardinal Jozef Glemp, leader of Poland's Roman Catholic Church, was removed 
from intensive care Wednesday, a week after emergency surgery to stop massive 
internal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
The condition of the 61-year-old primate improved sufficiently to allow him to 
be moved to a normal surgical floor in the Warsaw hospital, where he has been 
since undergoing surgery Jan. 30 and 31, doctors and the church announced in a 
communique. 
</P>

Polish newspapers earlier said Glemp suffered cardiac shock from bleeding 
related to a perforated ulcer.

AFTER 47 YEARS, DEATH OF WORLD WAR II FLIER IS SOLVED; ARLINGTON BURIAL PLANNED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For 47 years, the family of a World War II veteran who was reported missing in 
action never knew how he died. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the family of Staff Sgt. Walter P. Szeliga -- including nephew Dennis 
Maloziec of Huntington Beach -- is planning for the burial of the turret 
gunner's remains, after Army representatives informed them that Szeliga's 
downed plane was discovered in the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandmother always held out hope that he had amnesia and was alive but lost 
in the New Guinea jungle," Maloziec said Wednesday of his uncle's mother, who 
died in Detroit in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the U.S. military informed Maloziec's family of the discovery. 
However, the remains were not in the ocean off New Guinea, as initially 
reported on Dec. 20, 1942, but at a crash site on a mountainside near the New 
Guinea village of Tsili Tsili. 
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of the 23-year-old flier had always puzzled the proud Polish 
family from Detroit's northeast suburb of Center Line, Maloziec said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he never met his uncle, who was known as "Slug" Szeliga, the 
40-year-old Maloziec said that two years ago he told his mother about "weird 
emotions" he had toward his uncle and his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked my mom for his photographs, all his letters to the family and even the 
military letters about his disappearance. It was weird. I wanted to know 
everything about him," said Maloziec. 
</P>
<P>
Maloziec said it could have had something to do with fate. Ever since he served 
in the U.S. Air Force from 1968 to 1971 and his mother put his military picture 
next to his uncle's photograph on her dresser, "I feel as if I've been bonded 
in some way to my uncle." 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 20, 1942, Szeliga was part of a 10-man crew aboard a B-24 Liberator 
bomber that was reported missing while on an armed reconnaissance mission over 
Japanese territory in the Solomon Islands. 
</P>
<P>
"They were to return at nightfall, and were on final approach at a New Guinea 
airport when they radioed the tower to put the runway lights on," Maloziec 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the last they ever heard from them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, the family received a letter from Szeliga's commanding 
officer of the 400th Bomber Squadron 90th Bomber Group based at Iron Range, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"We regret to inform you that . . . (Szeliga) is missing in action," the letter 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
According to the military, there are more than 78,000 American military 
personnel still missing in action from World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In New Guinea alone, there are an estimated 300 crash sites that the military 
"is not actively searching for because of the jungle terrain," said Shari 
Lawrence, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Total Army Personnel Command in 
Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was first spotted in 1984. However, efforts to recover it were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
But in June, 1987, a mining company's research team took aerial photographs of 
identifiable metal parts and the military once again launched a recovery team 
that found the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
"They first found parts of it, but confirmed the discovery with a call sign 
plate on the instrument panel and with part of the plane's tail," Maloziec 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of only seven of the 10 crew members have been notified of the 
discovery, Lawrence said. It will take a few more weeks until a complete 
notification has been made, she said, which will delay burial. 
</P>
<P>
A group burial, possibly at Arlington National Cemetery with a full military 
ceremony, is being planned, Maloziec said. 
</P>
<P>
"After all these years, we finally get to bury uncle Szeliga," he said.

INNOVATION: ARTIFICIAL LIFE IN THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
Whether your taste in Dr. Frankensteins runs to Mary Shelley or Mel Brooks, 
this is where you'll find them -- breeding, replicating, mutating, evolving and 
exchanging their recipes for "life." 
</P>
<P>
The Artificial Life II Conference -- co-sponsored by the Santa Fe Institute and 
the Los Alamos National Laboratory -- is a primordial soup of biologists, 
physicists, computer scientists and anthropologists all struggling not only to 
evolve new theories of life but to actually create new forms. In the same way 
that the artificial intelligentsia use computers as their medium and metaphor 
to model thought, "A Lifers" rely on software and silicon as their virtual DNA 
to emulate life and evolution. 
</P>
<P>
" 'A life' is an attempt to abstract the principles of life from its material 
organization and re-create them in other materials," says Chris Langton, a 
conference organizer and Los Alamos A Lifer. 
</P>
<P>
A Lifers are less interested in biology than in bio-logic. Where biology is 
analytical, artificial life is synthetic. The idea is to craft self-organizing 
systems that explain what life is even as they evolve into new forms of "life." 
</P>
<P>
As scientific subcultures go, the A Lifers are atypically smart, enthusiastic 
and inordinately fond of Gary Larson "Far Side" cartoons. They are passionate 
-- even zealous -- in their belief that we are destined to share the world with 
a multitude of evolving artificial life species. No doubt, a synthetic Frank 
Sinatra will one day be crooning: 
</P>
<P>
 That's (artificial) life 
</P>
<P>
 That's what people say 
</P>
<P>
 Riding high in April 
</P>
<P>
 Reprogrammed in May 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the artificial life movement already offers a set of powerful 
insights into the way technology and innovation will evolve. The awesome 
results of billions of years of biology makes a compelling case to consider 
evolution as a design strategy for new technologies. 
</P>
<P>
For example, as computers and their software grow ever more complex, our 
traditional programming methods dissolve into inefficiency. "If you can't write 
a program, maybe you can evolve it," says Danny Hillis, creator of the 
Connection Machine, a supercomputer that links tens of thousands of 
microprocessors into a super-sophisticated network. "The dream is to evolve 
programs that do things we want. We're not there yet, but there's reason to 
believe that we're just about to be." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge thus shifts from treating a computer program as something to be 
engineered to viewing it as something that can be grown. Hillis believes that, 
increasingly, people will design computer environments that encourage software 
to "grow" in desired ways. Successful software -- the fittest -- will be 
harvested. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, it only makes sense that biotechnology innovation becomes harnessed 
to evolutionary dynamics. "Applied molecular evolution is the next stage of 
biotechnology," asserts University of Pennsylvania biologist and MacArthur 
Foundation "Genius Grant" Fellow Stuart Kauffman, who consults to industry. 
Kauffman sees new generations of pharmaceuticals that are evolved as much as 
they are engineered. By designing and accelerating evolutionary forces, 
industry will be able to more effectively discover the best of billions of 
possible molecular combinations. 
</P>
<P>
But the burning ambition of these A Lifers isn't commercial -- it's to spawn 
new life, to build self-perpetuating, adaptable and intelligent creatures that 
can survive and prosper in the harsh environs of the The Real World. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to prepare for the inevitable," asserts UCLA biologist Charles Taylor. 
"We are all going to be living in a world filled with artificial life forms 
that we haven't yet imagined." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and most A Lifers point to computer worms and viruses as but the first 
crude artificial life forms to be propagated in the real world. These little 
chunks of software can demonstrably spread and replicate, parasitizing little 
personal computers and giant mainframes. A Life true believers insist that, 
just as biological life evolved into higher and more sophisticated beings, 
artificial life will likewise evolve more complex and powerful creatures. The 
next century, they say, will see a co-evolution of carbon-based life forms and 
silicon-based artificial life. 
</P>
<P>
Other A Lifers are even more extreme. They see us humans as a mere evolutionary 
stepping stone on the path to a more highly evolved, highly intelligent 
silicon-based species. Carnegie-Mellon's Hans Moravec actually argues that 
"This is the end" and that a "genetic takeover is under way." 
</P>
<P>
Conference organizer J. Doyne Farmer of the Complex Systems Group at Los Alamos 
asserts that "With the advent of artificial life, we may be the first species 
to create its own successors. What will these successors be like? If we fail in 
our task as creators, they may indeed be cold and malevolent. 
</P>
<P>
However, if we succeed, they may be glorious, enlightened creatures that far 
surpass us in their intelligence and wisdom. It is quite possible that, when 
the conscious beings of the future look back on this era, we will be most 
noteworthy not in and of ourselves but for what we gave rise to. Artificial 
life is potentially the most beautiful creation of humanity. To shun artificial 
life without deeper consideration reflects a shallow anthropocentrism." 
</P>
<P>
Just call me a shallow anthropocentrist. To explore artificial life as a medium 
to gain a better understanding into life is as worthy an intellectual adventure 
as can be found. Anything we do to enhance our appreciation of the underlying 
beauty and patterns that animate matter -- that give us life -- is a good 
thing. Life should inspire a healthy mix of curiosity, fascination and awe. If 
artificial life techniques yield a new generation of technologies for us to 
co-evolve with, then so be it. 
</P>
<P>
But if this emerging generation of young Dr. Frankensteins genuinely believes 
that our destiny is to be superseded by our own software, then what they are 
playing with is strictly loony tunes. Because what they literally want to give 
birth to would be as threatening to humanity as that other technology to come 
from Los Alamos: The Bomb.

STARS LIKELY TO BE MORE CAREFUL IN ADS AFTER LLOYD BRIDGES CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most people know actor Lloyd Bridges for starring in the TV show "Sea Hunt." 
But around Hollywood, he may soon be better known for the role he played 
Wednesday in a lawsuit that could end up curtailing the use of celebrities in 
TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, who was the seafaring adventurer Mike Nelson in "Sea Hunt," agreed 
Wednesday to take unspecified financial responsibility for a commercial in 
which he heartily endorsed a company that eventually bilked investors out of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement -- which has a confidentiality clause barring disclosure of the 
terms -- was approved Wednesday in Chicago during a brief hearing before a U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges was sued by a number of investors who say they sank money into two 
Illinois companies before the firms filed for bankruptcy in 1986 -- the 
investment firm A. J. Obie &amp; Associates, and its companion firm, Diamond 
Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Both were eventually found to be involved in illegal schemes in which 
investors' money was used to pay off prior investors, giving the illusion of 
success. Actor George Hamilton, who also made commercials for Diamond Mortgage 
Corp., was also sued by investors and previously reached an out-of-court 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges could not be reached for comment Wednesday. His New York agent did not 
return several phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, singer Pat Boone was ordered to help pay refunds to unsatisfied users 
of an acne medicine he endorsed. Boone had previously signed a consent 
agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. The commission said it was the 
first time a product endorser agreed to be personally accountable for 
advertising claims. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of these types of cases and settlements, TV viewers may soon see 
fewer celebrities in commercials for certain companies -- like investment or 
insurance firms -- that ask consumers to phone in their orders. And celebrities 
and Hollywood agencies that link TV and film stars with advertisers say they 
will now be far more cautious in selecting products to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"If these suits become as common as personal injury suits, celebrities will not 
want to go out and do these sorts of commercials," said Noreen Jenney, 
president of Celebrity Endorsement Network, a Woodland Hills company that links 
celebrities with advertisers. "Remember, even if they are faultless, the 
celebrities still have to go out and defend themselves when they're sued." 
</P>
<P>
Even Art Linkletter, one of television's best-known pitchmen, said in an 
interview Wednesday that, as a result of the Bridges case, he will think harder 
about what products he endorses. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I hear about something like this, it reminds me to be even more 
careful," said Linkletter, who in 1988 appeared in ads for National Home Life 
Assurance. The ads were ordered off the air by regulators in the state of 
Washington, who called them false and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
But Linkletter, who now appears in TV spots for special contour chairs, said he 
has always refused to take part in hard-sell ads that ask people to send in 
money immediately. "I won't say 'Buy it now,' in commercials," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Linkletter -- who insists that he researches all products he endorses -- says 
he doesn't believe that celebrities should be held responsible for problems 
with the products or companies they endorse. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of someone suing the endorser is ridiculous," said Linkletter. "Sure, 
the endorser has a responsibility to try to make sure that everything he is 
saying is true, but there's no way of knowing that for certain." 
</P>
<P>
One Beverly Hills entertainment attorney said he always insists that he get 
final approval over the scripts of any commercials that his clients appear in. 
"Even though a client may be totally enthusiastic about a product, we've become 
more gun-shy because of the potential for liability," said Steven Katleman, who 
represents actress Cathy Lee Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
Those who manage the careers of celebrities agree that decisions such as the 
one in the Bridges case will probably not affect major advertisers such as Coca 
Cola or Budweiser -- which generally include insurance policies that protect 
the celebrities -- but will more likely affect smaller advertisers with 
lesser-known products. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're doing a Coke commercial, you're not so worried about a rusty nail 
showing up in a bottle of Coke," said Stan Schneider, who is a business manager 
for several top entertainers, including Glen Campbell. "But if you're doing an 
ad for the XYZ Company and you say its beauty cream will make people look 
younger, you'd better make sure it's not also taking some of their skin off."

UC REGENTS SUE LILLY IN DISPUTE OVER BIOTECH PATENT FOR INSULIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The regents of the University of California on Wednesday sued Eli Lilly &amp; 
Co., alleging that the largest U.S. maker of insulin infringed on a university 
patent for the biotechnology that Lilly uses to make its genetically engineered 
insulin product. 
</P>
<P>
The university obtained the patent in 1984 after the technology was developed 
by four scientists at UC San Francisco, the regents said in a complaint filed 
in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. The scientists discovered a way to 
splice the gene for human pro insulin (an insulin precursor) from human genetic 
material and turn it into a bacteria that produces human insulin, the 
university said. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis-based Lilly "has been and still is willfully infringing" on the 
patent despite protests from the university, the complaint said. The university 
filed the suit after reaching an impasse in negotiations with Lilly toward a 
licensing agreement to compensate UC for the technology, UC attorney Allen B. 
Wagner said. He said this is the first time the university has sued to protect 
one of its approximately 100 biotechnology patents. 
</P>
<P>
The university is seeking an injunction barring Lilly from continuing the 
alleged patent infringement, an accounting of profits and triple damages "in 
view of the willfulness of the infringement." The suit also seeks attorney's 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Lilly officials couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lilly, one of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies, controls 80% of the 
U.S. insulin market with two products. It markets insulin derived from animals 
under the name Iletin but sells far more of the genetically engineered insulin 
sold under the Humulin name. Some analysts estimate 1989 sales of Humulin at 
$295 million, compared to $160 million for Iletin. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner said the share of those sales to which the university believes it is 
entitled "will be the subject of considerable research." 
</P>
<P>
Lilly's major product is the oral antibiotic Ceclor, and analysts expect sales 
of the antidepressant drug Prozac, introduced in 1988, to explode in 1990. But 
Humulin is considered a key factor in Lilly's sales growth and expansion 
overseas. Physicians appear to prefer Humulin for treating diabetics because it 
is identical to human insulin, whereas insulin derived from animals has some 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
Lilly was the first company to introduce a human insulin and was able to enter 
the European market and win some market share from the European manufacturers. 
Lilly announced in 1988 a new $150-million plant in Indianapolis to meet 
worldwide demand for Humulin and has announced plans for a new Humulin plant in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
Universities are increasingly willing to take on private industry to protect 
patent rights. The University of Pennsylvania recently said it is suing Johnson 
&amp; Johnson Co. in a dispute over the acne medicine Retin-A, which has also 
been touted as an "anti-aging" cream that smoothes facial wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
The university and one of its professors who developed Retin-A had a license 
agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson on the use of Retin-A for acne. But the 
university alleges that the professor, without telling the university, obtained 
a separate patent for Retin-A to fight wrinkles and signed a separate deal with 
Johnson &amp; Johnson. The university claims that all patent rights belong to 
the institution because the professor was a university employee. It is also 
seeking damages and royalties from the sale of Retin-A.

SCULLEY BEGINS RESHAPING APPLE RIGHT TO THE CORE; 
</P>
<P>
COMPUTERS: ANALYSTS SAY THE LATEST EXECUTIVE SHUFFLE IS A LONG-OVERDUE ATTEMPT 
TO DEAL WITH THE COMPANY'S WOES. THE CHAIRMAN'S OWN REPUTATION IS AT STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apple Computer, once a symbol of brash, aggressive entrepreneurial success, has 
become a victim of swollen bureaucracy and sluggish technology. And Chairman 
John Sculley -- his own reputation on the line -- says he has finally had 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
Bothered by unfocused marketing efforts, new-product delays and plunging 
profits, Sculley has announced layoffs, an executive suite shake-up and a firm 
intention to become directly involved in overseeing the company's lagging 
product development process. 
</P>
<P>
The latest shoe dropped this week, just days after Sculley criticized Apple's 
new-product development. Jean-Louis Gassee, who headed those efforts for the 
last five years, apparently was unwilling to become Sculley's scapegoat and 
decided to leave Apple. He is expected to depart by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Sculley's decision to assert himself in product development and marketing -- a 
critical move that several analysts recommended many months ago -- comes at a 
crucial time for the 14-year-old personal computer pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the industry, computer sales are sagging and earnings are lackluster 
at best. Virtually every large computer maker -- including International 
Business Machines, Compaq, Digital Equipment, Unisys and Wang Laboratories -- 
reported problems of varying degrees last year, and analysts don't expect to 
see much improvement until at least next year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, things aren't much better. 
Leading edge technology and popular new products, long the pride of this 
Silicon Valley upstart, aren't getting out the door fast enough to suit Sculley 
or a growing chorus of critics. Existing product lines are clearly showing 
signs of advanced age. And sales are slowing while profits are declining. For 
the first fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, profits fell 11% from the prior-year 
period while sales grew at a mere 6%, far below the industry average and 
Apple's own 26% growth rate just six months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Further -- and perhaps even more ominous -- competitors, led by IBM and Compaq, 
are increasingly catching up with the once trail-blazing technology offered by 
Apple's Macintosh model, a PC system widely considered to be the easiest and 
most enjoyable to use. 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to knock my socks off with something new, but they haven't done 
it," complained Richard Shaffer, editor of a personal computer newsletter. 
"They seem to have some difficulty making the right product choices, packaging 
the technology correctly and getting their message to the customers." 
</P>
<P>
Added Andrew Neff, a high-technology analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New 
York: "Apple spent four times what Compaq did on research and development last 
year, but only got out about one-third the number of new products. There's no 
excuse for it." 
</P>
<P>
Even Sculley has acknowledged that somewhere on its latest spurt to becoming a 
$5-billion-a-year company, Apple has lost focus and stalled under the weight of 
its 14,000-plus employee payroll and a slowing worldwide appetite for 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
Though Sculley's diagnosis of Apple's current ills was months in the making, 
his prescription and its execution came quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last several weeks, Sculley forced out the unpopular president of U.S. 
operations, Allen Z. Loren, and replaced him with Michael H. Spindler, the 
architect of the company's successful European sales strategy. He announced 
pending layoffs of an unspecified number of Apple employees, and started 
looking over Gassee's shoulder, apparently prompting Gassee's departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to compress the decision-making time and I want better-focused 
marketing," Sculley said in an interview preceding last week's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of our engineers. . . . We have many things under 
development in our labs. The issue is how do we move more things from the 
research and development phase to the product phase. That's where I want to 
turn up the heat." 
</P>
<P>
Insiders recall that the last time Sculley made his presence so visible within 
the company was in 1985, another down year in the computer industry and the 
worst ever for Apple. Although the company had introduced the Macintosh the 
year before, it was still floundering for a marketing strategy to spur its 
disappointing sales. 
</P>
<P>
Sculley, then Apple's president, moved quickly that time. Within a six-month 
period, he ousted Apple chairman and co-founder Steven P. Jobs, laid off about 
20% of the company's work force and focused the company's agenda on making the 
under-recognized Macintosh more accepted among businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff came quickly. In January, 1986, Apple introduced the Macintosh Plus, 
a mainstay in the current product line-up and the best-selling Mac model to 
this day. Other models and accessories quickly followed and over succeeding 
years, the company grew from $1 billion in sales to more than $5 billion last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The turnaround earned Sculley, a former Pepsico president and marketing whiz, 
high marks. It also propelled him into the top ranks of U.S. high-tech 
executives and became the basis of "Odyssey," his autobiography that is 
considered required reading among Apple employees. 
</P>
<P>
The current situation, although hardly as bleak as it was five years ago, has 
taken some of the burnish off Sculley's reputation as a stellar manager, and 
left several analysts perplexed about why he failed to recognize the problems 
in Apple's product line sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question but that the product line has been mismanaged," said 
Stewart Alsop, a PC newsletter publisher in the Silicon Valley. Alsop argued 
that the company has wrongly focused its attentions exclusively at the high end 
of the Macintosh product line, while abandoning the middle range and ignoring 
the low end completely. 
</P>
<P>
"They forgot that they couldn't just be a high-end purveyor for the power 
user," Alsop said. "They need to provide the total solution to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Although analysts say they had been telling Sculley and his now-departed 
lieutenants this for months, the chairman has apparently now gotten the word. 
</P>
<P>
Sculley said last week that one of the first moves in his "break out" strategy 
for renewed growth is speeding the introduction of a low-cost Macintosh, a 
machine with a price tag in the $1,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders say that with Sculley's full clout firmly behind it, the system -- 
which would fill a gaping void in the Macintosh product line and attract 
first-time Mac customers -- could hit the market as early as next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Sculley's reentry into Apple's product and marketing process is widely welcomed 
both within and outside the company. 
</P>
<P>
"These are tough times for Apple. . . . They have got to start speeding their 
new product development," said Paul Norris, a market research analyst with the 
Gartner Group and former Apple employee. "Sculley has identified the right 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Even top-level insiders admit that product development over the last few years 
has slowed and suffered. The problem, explained Larry Tessler, Apple's vice 
president for research and development, is that the engineers and marketers 
have often taken too long to lock up the specifications of a given product. 
</P>
<P>
The low-cost Mac is said to be a victim of just such a process. According to 
Tim Bajarin, a Silicon Valley market analyst and sometime Apple consultant, 
Sculley approved the basic product concept at least a year ago. But development 
languished as the engineers, product designers and marketing teams quibbled 
over features, intended users and pricing strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say a Macintosh laptop model, finally introduced late last year to 
unenthusiastic reviews after two years in the labs, was another such victim. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been innumerable reviews, rethinking and refocusing of products 
while they were still in the lab," Tessler said, identifying no particular 
product. "So by the time you get around to actually doing the product, the 
competition had beaten us to it." 
</P>
<P>
Although getting a low-end Mac and other products out the door is an immediate 
priority, there are other -- and perhaps more critical -- challenges facing 
Apple. 
</P>
<P>
Primary among them is what to do about the entire Macintosh product line, a 
question that Tessler and Gassee's successor will no doubt wrestle with. The 
basic technology of the line, which accounted for more than $4 billion worth of 
Apple's sales last fiscal year, was developed in the early 1980s, and has begun 
to show signs of its age. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sculley and Tessler say replacement technologies are well under 
development in the research laboratories, they are reluctant to break away 
entirely from a product with more than 3 million users and a huge library of 
software. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the issue has been put off while Apple has introduced 
incremental innovations that have steadily expanded uses for the Macintosh. But 
analysts say the potential pool of such advances is shrinking and express 
genuine concern that the key competitive edge that the Macintosh has enjoyed 
over its PC competitors -- namely its easy-to-use features -- is fast 
disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more happening here than management shuffling," said Bruce Lupatkin, 
an analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco. "The strategy hasn't 
been working and it's getting harder to differentiate Apple from the pack."

A decline in housing affordability caused sales of existing homes in the Los 
Angeles and Orange County regions to tumble in 1989, a California trade group 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles region, existing home sales plummeted 12.8% in 1989 compared 
to the previous year, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. Orange 
County sales sank 16.8%, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
However, sales in the inland areas, where homes are cheaper, continued to grow, 
and sales of existing condominiums rose a whopping 15.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, existing home sales dropped 4.2%, the realtors said. Still, 1989 was 
the second-biggest year in the 1980s for existing home sales in California. 
</P>
<P>
Across the state, 538,770 existing, single-family detached homes were sold 
during 1989, compared to 562,570 homes sold in booming 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Given the drop in affordability, why were 1989 sales so strong? 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially it was a carryover from the surge in sales that appeared in 1988," 
said Leslie Appleton-Young, vice president of research and economics for the 
state group. 
</P>
<P>
Appleton-Young said the erratic behavior of interest rates and the Federal 
Reserve's squeeze on credit had created a popular 
"Let-me-get-in-now-before-it-be-comes-too-late" attitude among home buyers 
during the first quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But rising prices made for weaker sales in the second and third quarters of 
1989. There was a mild comeback in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In December, high prices and low demand caused home sales in California to drop 
10.1%, the sharpest month-to-month drop in nearly three years, the group 
reported last month. 
</P>
<P>
As for 1990, Appleton-Young said continued slow growth is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Appleton-Young estimated that about 480,000 homes might be sold this year, for 
an 11% decline. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles region, the median price of an existing home surged 20.1% 
during 1989 to $215,472, up from $179,423 in 1988. In Orange County, the median 
price rose 18.6% to $245,262 in 1989, up from $206,857 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The median price means that half of the homes sold cost more than that price, 
and half less. 
</P>
<P>
Only 19% of state households could afford mortgage loans to purchase the 
$196,521 median-priced, existing single-family home, down from 24% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And nationally, sales of existing homes crept up 2.1% during the fourth quarter 
of 1989, but were still down 4.3% for 1989, according to the National Assn. of 
Realtors in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.85 million units during 
the fourth quarter, the national group said. The national median price was 
$93,100.

PUC WILL LET THE MARKET SELECT PIPELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission said Wednesday that it will allow 
competition to determine which proposed pipelines will bring clean-burning 
natural gas to California from out of state, rather than making the choice 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
California's demand for natural gas is rising rapidly and the state needs new 
pipelines, said PUC Commissioner Stanley W. Hulett. Electric utilities, which 
can use either oil or gas to generate electricity, frequently find their 
natural gas transmissions cut when supplies are short because the needs of 
residential customers are put first. 
</P>
<P>
"With the recognition that natural gas is the environmentally preferred fuel, 
especially for electric generation in the southern part of the state, it is 
obvious that new pipeline capacity will benefit this and future generations of 
Californians," Hulett said. 
</P>
<P>
An administrative law judge recommended last year that the commission back the 
pipeline proposed by Kern River Gas Transmission Co., which intends to begin 
building a 904-mile pipeline from Wyoming to California by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But the PUC found that because so much competition exists to serve the 
California market, the commission only needs to set conditions to "prevent the 
cost of the new pipelines from falling disproportionately on residential 
customers." The commission said it would back all proposals that met those 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
A Kern River Gas Transmission spokesman said the company is "extremely 
delighted" with the decision because it believes its proposal will be 
competitive. Its pipeline, a joint venture between the Williams Cos. of Tulsa, 
Okla., and Tenneco Inc. of Houston, should begin operating in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Wyoming-California Pipeline Co., known as Wycal, also said it was pleased 
with the ruling. Wycal, a subsidiary of Houston-based Coastal Corp., said it 
plans to begin construction by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Also covered by the decision are pipelines proposed by the Mojave Pipeline Co., 
Pacific Gas Transmission Co./Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, and Transwestern 
Pipeline Co. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the PUC proposed restructuring the way gas is purchased and 
delivered to industrial customers. The intent of the restructuring is to make 
the natural gas market more competitive, the PUC said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals would prohibit regulated gas utilities -- primarily Southern 
California Gas, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric -- 
from selling to industrial and large commercial users except at the same rates 
they charge residential customers. One of the proposals would require utilities 
to spin off non-regulated affiliates that would compete with all other gas 
suppliers if they want to sell to industrial customers.

BORDER GROUP NAMES MILKEN 'MAN OF THE DECADE'

<P>
Indicted junk bond king Michael Milken has been named "Man of the Decade" by 
the Mexican and American Foundation Inc., a spokesman for the border business 
group said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Milken was unanimously selected to receive the foundation's top award of the 
1980s by the board late last year, said Ron Valles. 
</P>
<P>
The former Drexel Burnham Lambert executive, who faces trial this year on 98 
felony counts of securities fraud and related charges, will receive the award 
at an annual foundation banquet Sept. 22 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Milken notifying him of the award, foundation President Tony 
Valencia and two other foundation officials wrote: "The assistance you are 
giving to the goals that we represent are innumerable. Your quest to obtain 
capital to help finance the growth of minority businesses, who would not 
otherwise have those resources, is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"Additionally, by encouraging investment in Mexico, you help develop 
trans-border commerce and civic relations between Mexico and the United 
States," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter informed Milken that Americans who received "Man of the Year" awards 
from the foundation during the 1980s included two California Republican 
congressmen, Sen. Pete Wilson and Rep. Duncan Hunter; Lodwrick M. Cook, 
chairman and chief executive of Arco, and Brian Dyson, president of Coca Cola 
USA. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, Milken was honored at a foundation luncheon in Tijuana for his 
record of financing Hispanic businesses in the United States and for investing 
in Latin American export-oriented industries. 
</P>
<P>
Milken received special permission from the Justice Department to attend the 
banquet. The 42-year-old junk bond wizard toured eight Mexican border 
maquiladora plants and later received the key to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation officials said then they were not dismayed by Milken's legal 
difficulties in the United States. "As far as we're concerned, he is innocent 
until proven guilty. That's the American way," said finance director Gil 
Fuentes.

Wesson Refinery to Close: Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson will close its Wesson oil 
refinery in Fullerton, eliminating about 100 jobs, a company spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
No date was set. The company told workers that the refinery would be closed for 
"economic and strategic reasons," the spokeswoman said. The 1,500 employees at 
Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson's Fullerton headquarters and another 900 employees -- 
including seasonal employees -- at the tomato-processing and can-making plants 
also in Fullerton are not affected.

FDA WARNS BAXTER IT MAY LOSE LICENSE FOR SCREENING BLOOD

Baxter International Inc., which runs one of the largest laboratories for 
screening blood for AIDS, hepatitis and other illnesses, has been warned it may 
lose its license unless it takes corrective action, government documents 
revealed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Documents from the Food and Drug Administration show that Baxter Screening 
Laboratory of Round Lake, Ill., was found in violation of FDA quality control 
standards in 69 instances during inspections made by the agency last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The facility tests more than 2 million blood samples a year for a variety of 
diseases including AIDS, hepatitis and syphilis, from 10 regional blood banks. 
Donated blood from the banks goes to hospitals for use in surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The information was included in a letter dated Feb. 2 from the FDA and obtained 
by Reuters under the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
"The company considers the FDA's findings very serious and is working closely 
with the agency to correct them," said Baxter spokesman Les Jacobson. 
Deerfield, Ill.-based Baxter is a major manufacturer of health-care supplies, 
including hospital gowns, gloves, heart valves, monitoring equipment, and 
diagnostic instruments. Its sales last year were $7.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the most serious issue raised by the FDA involved six plasma 
units that were classified as negative for hepatitis-B even though the test 
initially was positive. 
</P>
<P>
"Clerical errors were responsible for the misclassification," the company said. 
"After further testing the six units tested negative." 
</P>
<P>
Baxter said it is spending more than $1 million for additional staff and is 
expanding and improving the facility, the company's only blood screening 
laboratory. New training and operating procedures to assure accuracy and safety 
have begun and the company said it is using new computer systems to automate 
data collection and record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the FDA said some of Baxter's testing procedures do not comply 
with the agency's standards and requirements. In addition, the FDA said many of 
the deficiencies found during an earlier inspection in August, 1988, have not 
been corrected.

ROCKWELL AIMS TO BOOST EARNINGS DURING NEXT 5 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE GOAL TO INCREASE PER-SHARE INCOME BY 12% ANNUALLY IS OPTIMISTIC, 
CONSIDERING THE OUTLOOK FOR THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Rockwell International Chairman Donald R. Beall told shareholders Wednesday 
that the firm has set an objective to increase its earnings during the next 
five years by 12% annually on a per-share basis, a goal that defies the dismal 
outlook confronting the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
Beall has been on a tireless campaign lately to persuade the financial 
community and the news media that Rockwell is no longer just a defense 
contractor but has become a more diversified manufacturing company that faces 
bright growth prospects in a variety of commercial fields. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to setting the profit-growth objective, Beall said, the company is 
seeking to earn a 16% to 22% return on shareholder equity in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department contracts generated just 27% of Rockwell's 1989 sales, while 
domestic commercial sales were up to 32% last year, Beall said at the firm's 
annual meeting in Los Angeles on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Beall predicted that El Segundo-based Rockwell's $4.9-billion-a-year 
electronics business, generating 39% of the firm's sales in 1989, will be the 
fastest-growing part of the firm in the next few years. The company is also 
expecting growth in its vehicle components segment, its printing press business 
and even its defense business, Beall said. 
</P>
<P>
But the electronics business has experienced problems, Beall disclosed. The 
firm's telecommunications business, which involves building modems for 
facsimile transmitters and for personal computers, had an inventory glut 
develop last year, Beall said. 
</P>
<P>
When sales of facsimile machines and personal computers turned down last year, 
Rockwell inventories of modems grew out of balance. There were also performance 
problems of Rockwell products and some products were late in entering the 
market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beall declined to say whether the firm was forced to write off inventory, but 
he pointed out that Rockwell has very "conservative" accounting practices in 
such matters, implying that it did take a writeoff. Beall said the firm 
replaced several general managers in the telecommunications area. 
</P>
<P>
On another matter, Beall declined to comment on whether Rockwell is negotiating 
to acquire Marquardt, a San Fernando Valley producer of specialty rocket 
motors. The issue arose when a shareholder asked if a deal had been 
consummated, drawing a "no comment" from Beall.

McDonnell-Douglas Helicopter Co. said Wednesday that it will lay off 800 
workers in late February because of cutbacks in defense spending and production 
of the U.S. Army's Apache attack helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the layoffs include about 400 of the 5,900 workers at its Mesa 
plant and another 400 at its California Manufacturing Center in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
The California plant has 1,650 employees at present. The layoffs are effective 
Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The company said production of the Apache helicopters, currently at the rate of 
10 aircraft a month, will be reduced to six per month in June, with final 
Apache deliveries to the Army scheduled for mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
President William P. Brown said that, while McDonnell Douglas is pursuing 
opportunities for international sales of Apache helicopters, "In the meantime, 
we must reduce our work force to meet the reality of our delivery schedule with 
the U.S. Army." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said that adding to the need for reductions in spending is a recently 
announced $137-million writeoff on helicopter programs attributed to 
re-estimated material costs incurred over the life of several government 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the layoffs, Brown said the company will reduce employee travel, 
participation in industry trade shows, replacement of non-critical equipment 
and other discretionary spending. It also has delayed plans to expand its light 
helicopter facilities. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas had planned to begin in January an expansion of its light 
helicopter facilities to accommodate production of its new MDX and MC 520N-530N 
helicopters. That plan has been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
"We will need the facility when full MDX production begins in 1993," Brown 
said. "Until that time, existing facilities will be used for these programs."

DRUG COMPANY BUYS STAKE IN BIOTECH FIRM 
</P>

<P>
In the latest of a string of strategic alliances between young biotechnology 
firms and established drug manufacturers, Gensia Pharmaceuticals of San Diego 
has agreed to sell 15.9% of its stock for $15 million to Marion Merrell Dow 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The deal gives Marion Merrell Dow the right to exclusively license, manufacture 
and market certain oral drugs Gensia is developing that use a new class of 
compounds called purine/pyrimidines to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular 
diseases. The drugs may benefit heart attack and heart disease victims. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Kansas City, Marion Merrell Dow was formed last year when Dow 
Chemical's Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals subsidiary merged with Marion 
Laboratories to form a $2-billion-plus drug manufacturing and marketing 
company. One of the company's drugs, a calcium channel blocker called Cardizem, 
is a leading treatment for angina and hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
Closely held Gensia was founded in 1986 by two University of California, San 
Diego, scientists and has since raised $26.2 million in venture capital to 
further its research and development of compounds associated with 
purine/pyrimidine metabolism, President David Hale said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The compounds seem to be effective in minimizing the tissue damage called 
ischemia, which results from the lack of oxygen caused by heart attacks. If 
successful, the drugs could be administered to acute heart attack victims as 
well as to chronic sufferers of heart disease, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
Gensia's first product, a purine compound called ARA-100, is in advanced stages 
of clinical trials in the United Kingdom and may reach the market by 1994, Hale 
said. The potential market for the drug is at least $100 million for acute 
applications and $200 million for chronic patients, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Stover, a principal with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons investment bankers in 
New York, said the Marion Merrell Dow-Gensia agreement is "characteristic of 
Marion's strategy where they find interesting technology and sources of 
products for some of their therapeutic areas, particularly cardiovascular and 
ischemic heart disease." 
</P>
<P>
Hale, who was president of Hybritech when the San Diego-based monoclonal 
antibody company was acquired by Eli Lilly for $485 million in 1986, said in a 
statement that the "physician office-based market" for the oral drugs Gensia is 
developing is "best served by a major pharmaceutical company such as MMD, which 
has the marketing capability and financial resources to address these large 
markets."

FIRST LADY GIVES CHEER TO LITERACY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While her husband traveled up the coast to San Francisco, First Lady Barbara 
Bush paid a visit to Montebello on Wednesday where she observed the operations 
of a regional literacy program and congratulated some of its participants. 
</P>
<P>
The Montebello Public Library, a usually quiet haven for students and assorted 
book seekers, was abuzz with Secret Service agents, news media crews and 
members of the White House entourage as Mrs. Bush arrived for a one-hour visit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to cheer these people," she said, referring to several adults who 
have learned to read through the Los Angeles County library program. "I'm 
thrilled with what California has done." 
</P>
<P>
The County Public Library system provides adult literacy programs as part of 
the 5-year-old California Literacy Campaign. In 1986, a toll-free, multilingual 
literacy hot line began at the Montebello library, making it a headquarters 
linking those wanting to learn to read with those willing to teach them. The 
regional program has had more than 8,000 students, many of whom found tutors by 
dialing the hot line number -- 1-800-372-6641. 
</P>
<P>
After her arrival at 10:30 a.m., Mrs. Bush, honorary chairwoman of the National 
Advisory Council of Literacy Volunteers of America, watched briefly as the 
coordinator of the Community Access Library Line fielded two hot line calls 
about the literacy program. 
</P>
<P>
The First Lady chatted with 12 of the program's tutors and students, among them 
a 52-year-old man who sought help so he could read his Bible, and a 45-year-old 
mother of nine who last week wrote a letter for the first time in her life. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting the First Lady, student William Heeney, 27, explained why he 
entered the program in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought 'how could I look after my kids if anything happened to my wife?' 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought it would get this big," said the father of two, who owns a 
construction business. "I never thought I'd meet the President's wife." 
</P>
<P>
It could inflate a man's ego, meeting Barbara Bush, said student Chris Norton, 
26, a landscaper. He said it would be a nice story to rub in the face of those 
kids, now grown, who called him "retarded" because he had to take special 
education classes when he was a little boy. But he won't. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel special (to have met her). . . . But deep down inside, I'm no better 
than they are," said Norton, whose reading skills have jumped from a second- to 
a sixth-grade level. "I wish they could have felt that way (in school); that 
they were no better than anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Norton said low self-esteem because he could not read kept him from 
participating in sports and other activities as a child. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a lonely world not knowing how to read," he said. "I just wish I 
could've done this when I was 10 years old and not 26." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush praised the regional program and the statewide literacy campaign, but 
added that there is still much work to be done to combat the problem of 
illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hear you have a million people who need help, then you have to get a 
bigger campaign going," she said, referring to the estimated number of 
functionally illiterate adults living in the county. "I'm not knocking Los 
Angeles. It's all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush left with a bouquet of red roses, and at least one new fan. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush "is a good guy," said Norton, standing outside the library door. 
But "if she was President, I'd vote for her."

DOUBTS RESURFACE ON ABILITY OF RTD POLICE TO HANDLE BLUE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can the understaffed, overextended transit police from the Southern California 
Rapid Transit District handle security on the Blue Line trolley from Long Beach 
into downtown Los Angeles when it opens this summer? 
</P>
<P>
That question -- first raised by a panel of police specialists a year ago in a 
critical report to the RTD -- is being asked again by the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission as the two transit agencies gear up to start 
operations of the 22-mile light rail line, the first stretch of a new commuter 
rail system planned for Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The future of the Blue Line -- and all other rail projects -- hangs on the 
public's perception of how safe these new, high-tech trolleys will be, rail 
experts agree. If commuters feel unsafe on the trains, they will drive their 
own cars or ride the bus. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the transit agencies agree the problem is critical because the Blue 
Line runs through high-crime areas and gang turf in South-Central Los Angeles. 
Graffiti and vandalism are already a major headache, months before the first 
trains are scheduled to run. 
</P>
<P>
Security is also very much on the minds of potential riders, according to a 
public opinion poll conducted recently for the commission. Well over half of 
those polled were concerned about gang activity and the possibility of 
shootings; one-fourth said the fear of crime would keep them from riding the 
trolleys. 
</P>
<P>
The commission -- which is building the $871-million line -- doubts the transit 
police department's ability to adequately police the rail line. Commission 
officials want the RTD to hire the Los Angeles County Sheriff to police the 
line, at a cost of up to $10 million a year. The commission would pay the bill 
with local transit tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a chance the RTD police force can provide the security 
that line needs by the July 16 start-up," said Neil Peterson, commission 
executive director. "Most law enforcement professionals and public at large 
believe . . . the sheriff would be a much more effective entity to provide 
security." 
</P>
<P>
The commission has contracted with the RTD to operate the Blue Line and all 
other commuter trains that will eventually run on a 150-mile rail network now 
being planned. RTD officials contend that the transit police are qualified to 
handle security and they have already started hiring and training more 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
RTD police recruits and sheriff's trainees are required to have at least a high 
school education. They undergo about 16 weeks of state-approved training. The 
RTD's starting monthly salary is $2,465 -- about $300 a month lower than 
sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The police issue -- the latest dispute between the area's two big transit 
agencies -- is up for debate before the RTD board today. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said the commission's doubts are based on the troubled history of the 
transit police and the findings reported by three top law enforcement officials 
hired by the RTD to review its police department last year. 
</P>
<P>
This peer review found that the RTD police department -- then operating without 
a chief -- was understrength, had a high turnover and suffered from low morale. 
They reported that the department's ability to handle district security had 
already deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a question whether they are capable of dealing with the added 
responsibility associated with the (Blue Line)," wrote Gerald D. Hotopp, 
director of police services for the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit 
Authority. The report recommended a reorganization and a major increase in 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
In the two years before the review, the RTD's police force was racked by 
controversy. The former chief had left amid charges he had fixed parking 
tickets and accepted lodging in a Palm Springs condominium owned by a 
consulting firm hired by the RTD. Several RTD police officers had either quit, 
been placed on leave or been fired after they complained about job 
discrimination, the department's internal problems and the way officers treated 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Top RTD officials say problems reported by the review board are being 
corrected. A new chief has recently been hired and morale is no longer a 
problem, they said. The RTD would have no trouble policing the Blue Line, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done some reorganization and we have provided the transit police with 
clear sense of identity," said Alan F. Pegg, RTD general manager. 
</P>
<P>
However, not all RTD problems have been solved, Pegg acknowledged. In a police 
force stretched over a five-county area, there are 15 vacancies on the regular 
force of 75, he said. And the RTD will have to hire 50 off-duty, part-time 
policemen before this summer if it is to have enough officers to police the 
Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its problems, Pegg said, "We have a fully qualified agency that can 
provide more security than the sheriff can . . . at less cost." He provided no 
figures on the cost comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the RTD's bus drivers said that police protection leaves something to 
be desired. Some complain that calls for help with troublemakers sometimes go 
unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
"They just don't show up," said one driver, who did not want to be named. "A 
lot of time they are busy and have calls backed up. I know that . . . but we 
need help." He and two other drivers said they rely more on other police 
agencies than transit police. 
</P>
<P>
Riders expressed similar views in the public opinion poll taken for the county 
commission. Those polled rated the performance of the RTD police below that of 
both the Sheriff's Department and the California Highway Patrol. In filmed 
interviews, several passengers were critical of the transit police attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"They had no concerns (for people)," said a woman passenger who had helped an 
elderly woman who had fallen in the bus. When transit police finally arrived, 
she said, they were brusque and uncaring. Another woman added, "It's no 
question about their qualification; it's their attitude toward the situation." 
</P>
<P>
The recently named RTD police chief, Sharon Papa, denied that RTD officers are 
slow to respond or are insensitive to needs of passengers and drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"That is ludicrous; our response time is quicker than the LAPD or the sheriff," 
said Papa, a nine-year RTD police veteran. "Our officers are sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
While she had not seen the commission poll or the taped interviews, she 
discounted the reports, saying pollsters too often ask leading questions. She 
said most of the public is not aware of the transit police force and would tend 
to know more about the Highway Patrol and the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has evolved out of the often rancorous relations between the two 
transit agencies. RTD officials contend that the commission is trying to weaken 
the RTD's control over the line. Commission officials deny the charge, saying 
they only want to ensure riders' safety. 
</P>
<P>
After lengthy discussions, the district and the commission agreed that the 
proposed Blue Line security force should be increased to 101, double the 
earlier staffing level. The increase came after both agencies began to have 
second thoughts about how to control vandalism and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is paying the sheriff's office $1.3 million to police 
construction sites and rail line facilities until July 16, when the line is 
expected to start running.

PETITIONERS TRY TO DERAIL METRO RAIL TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Property owners hoping to escape millions of dollars in taxes intended for 
construction of the second phase of the Metro Rail subway are trying to kill a 
proposed assessment by forcing an election on it. 
</P>
<P>
Some commercial landowners near planned Metro Rail stations in Hollywood, 
Mid-Wilshire, North Hollywood and along Vermont Avenue say the tax, which could 
raise $627 million over 19 years, should not be borne by them alone. They want 
the RTD to poll an estimated 3,000 affected commercial property owners before 
imposing the levy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about a question of taxation without representation," said 
Andrew Miliotis, a Mid-Wilshire businessman circulating petitions that would 
force the transit district to hold an election. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas De Angelo, general manager of the Sheraton-Town House on Wilshire 
Boulevard, said his hotel would be assessed $85,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Metro Rail, but we think the way they are financing the assessment is 
unfair," De Angelo said. "It increases my real estate taxes 115% for 19 years. 
This is why we are up in arms." 
</P>
<P>
The RTD board heard complaints about the proposed tax several weeks ago at a 
public hearing, but the board is expected to approve it today. 
</P>
<P>
Regional transportation officials are nervous about the petition drives because 
they say the tax is key to a $2.5-billion financing package for the 13.3-mile 
subway extension, scheduled to begin running between MacArthur Park and North 
Hollywood in 1998. Without the money, they said, construction could be delayed 
or scaled back, or funding for other segments of the 150-mile rail network 
could be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it would be serious," said Richard Stanger, director of rail 
development for the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which 
oversees federal funding for Metro Rail. "The project may just have to be 
completely rethought." 
</P>
<P>
Gary S. Spivak, director of planning for the RTD, said a vote against the tax 
would send officials back to the drawing board to find an alternative 
assessment. The current proposal was fashioned by a 30-member task force 
appointed by the RTD, including some property owners along the route. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, commercial property owners within one-half mile of 11 
planned stations from Mid-Wilshire to North Hollywood would be subject to the 
so-called "benefit assessment." 
</P>
<P>
The tax, collected in 19 annual installments beginning in 2000, would enable 
the RTD to issue $75 million in construction bonds. RTD officials estimate they 
would need to collect between $376 million and $627 million in assessments to 
finance and repay the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The RTD has divided the 13.3-mile stretch into five separate districts: 
Mid-Wilshire, Vermont Avenue, Hollywood, North Hollywood and Universal City. 
Under state law, the RTD is required to call an election in any of the 
districts if landowners holding 25% of the assessed value of property demand a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Should property owners in any of the districts succeed in killing the tax, the 
RTD will face the difficult task of making the assessments stick in the other 
districts. Spivak said the RTD would move forward with plans in districts where 
it is not defeated, but even the tax's strongest supporters say that would be a 
hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
"People would resent having to pay," said Larry Kaplan, president of the 
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which views Metro Rail as an important part of 
Hollywood's revitalization. "It would be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the tax have 30 days to collect the necessary signatures, although 
there is some confusion as to when the 30-day period begins. Those gathering 
signatures in Hollywood and Mid-Wilshire, acting on the advice of their 
attorney, began the countdown on Jan. 20, the day the RTD board held the public 
hearing on the proposal. The RTD said its attorneys have not made a ruling on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
After verifying signatures, the RTD would have 90 days to hold the election. 
Only those property owners subject to the assessment could vote. Owners would 
receive one vote for each $1,000 of assessed value, with a simple majority of 
the votes prevailing. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the assessment would fall between 33 cents and 55 cents per square 
foot annually and would affect an estimated 57 million square feet of property. 
It would not apply to residential property or land owned and occupied by 
nonprofit groups or government agencies. It would need to be approved by the 
Los Angeles City Council and the county Board of Supervisors before becoming 
law. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials say the proposed assessment is justified because studies in other 
cities have shown that property owners near new subway stations enjoy higher 
land values and easy accessibility. The RTD likens the tax to fees homeowners 
and businesses typically pay for street lights, sewer systems and other public 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
But a group of property owners near six planned stations in Mid-Wilshire and 
Hollywood, calling themselves the Committee Opposed to Metro Rail Taxation, 
question those studies. They say the $75 million should be raised from gasoline 
taxes or other countywide measures since the entire Los Angeles area stands to 
benefit from the subway, not just nearby property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation officials said there are no other sources of funds, unless they 
take money intended for other segments of the regional network. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have money sitting around doing nothing," said Spivak. "The money is 
committed." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the tax has been greatest in Mid-Wilshire and Hollywood, but 
petitions are also circulating in North Hollywood and along Vermont. There 
apparently have been no efforts to begin a petition drive in the Universal City 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The Mid-Wilshire district includes planned stations on Wilshire Boulevard at 
Vermont, Normandie and Western avenues; the Vermont Avenue district includes 
stations at Beverly, Santa Monica and Sunset boulevards; the Hollywood district 
would have stations on Hollywood Boulevard at Vine Street and Western and 
Highland avenues; the Universal City district has one station near the 
Hollywood Freeway and Lankershim Boulevard; and the North Hollywood district 
has one station near Chandler and Lankershim boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Miliotis, a spokesman for opponents in Mid-Wilshire and Hollywood, said the 
group already has about half the necessary signatures in Mid-Wilshire. The 
drive there has been bolstered by support from two prominent business 
organizations, the Wilshire Chamber of Commerce and the Wilshire Stakeholders 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, signature gathering has been slower, in large part because there 
are fewer large landowners and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has thrown its 
support behind the assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, nobody likes to pay taxes . . . but sometimes you have to bite the 
bullet and you have to make an investment in the future," said Kaplan, the 
chamber president.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FLORES OPENS CAMPAIGN FOR SECRETARY OF STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who recently helped sink a key 
provision in the city's proposed ethics-in-government code, said Wednesday that 
she is running for secretary of state to promote election and political reform. 
</P>
<P>
"The secretary of state is our state's chief elections officer, and because of 
a lack of state leadership, California has the most confusing patchwork of 
campaign election laws anywhere in the nation," the three-term councilwoman 
said at a news conference outside City Hall.

Flores, 53, a Republican who represents the city's 15th Council District, said 
she decided early this week to run after receiving encouragement from 
supporters, including Republican gubernatorial candidate Sen. Pete Wilson. She 
accused Democratic incumbent Secretary of State March Fong Eu of having created 
"a vacuum of leadership in this office."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INITIAL STEPS AUTHORIZED TO RECONSTRUCT 
COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission authorized up to $15,000 to retain 
a consultant and begin preparing specifications for the environmental impact 
studies necessary to go ahead with a proposed reconstruction of the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The commission acted although talks with the Los Angeles Raiders, aimed at 
retaining the football team in a rebuilt stadium, have not yet come to a 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The new commission president, attorney Matthew Grossman, said preliminary work 
laying out what kind of studies would have to be undertaken if an agreement is 
reached would save time. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commission will pay for the consultant, the prospective private 
developers of a new Coliseum, Spectacor Management Group and MCA Inc., are 
expected to pay for an environmental report if and when one is prepared, 
Coliseum officials said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BID BY PARENTS TO BAN GRADE SCHOOL TEXTS 
FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attempt by a group of fundamentalist Christians to have a controversial 
series of grade school readers banned in Redondo Beach has failed as the city's 
elementary school trustees voted unanimously this week to retain the texts. 
</P>
<P>
The decision capped several months of intense lobbying by opponents of the 
Impressions series, who said the books promote satanism and include stories 
that are inappropriate for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The series has been under fire in a number of California school districts, 
including the Hacienda La Puente Unified and East Whittier City school 
districts, where trustees voted to shelve the books. But Redondo Beach trustees 
had said from the outset that they viewed the effort to ban the books as an 
attempt at censorship. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the local Coalition of Concerned Parents -- formed by members of the 
fundamentalist Hope Chapel -- said they plan to work against the trustees in 
the next election, and will put their children in private school.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HOLDS 3 HOSTAGES AT VA HOSPITAL FOR 2 
HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 34-year-old man invaded Wadsworth Veterans Hospital in West Los Angeles 
Wednesday morning and took three women hostage for about two hours before 
releasing them unharmed and giving up, the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant, identified as Billy R. Winston, thought to be from Memphis, 
forced three hospital employees into a ground floor office at knife point and 
indicated in a "convoluted statement" that drug dealers were trying to kill 
him, Agent Fred Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
After talking to FBI hostage negotiators, who were working out of the nearby 
federal building, Winston eventually agreed to release his captives and come 
out.

NOTRE DAME'S DEAL SHOULDN'T BE A SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Indignation is doing a brisk business these days as the country's big-time 
athletic directors line up to criticize Notre Dame's decision to become a free 
agent and sell its 1991-95 home football games to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the university signed a five-year deal with NBC worth about $40 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark agreement leaves the College Football Assn. without its No. 1 
draw, the box-office equivalent of "Casablanca" without Bogart. It also exposes 
how frail the union of 64 -- oops, 63 -- CFA member institutions can be when 
millions of dollars and precious television exposure are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The CFA finds its own five-year, $320-million combined deal with ABC and ESPN 
in jeopardy as the networks ponder the alternatives, which are few. They can 
pursue legal action against the renegade Fighting Irish or renegotiate their 
contracts with the Notre Dame-less -- and thus less attractive -- CFA. 
</P>
<P>
Look for renegotiation and continued Notre Dame-bashing from the CFA's more 
vocal members. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it greed," said Rudy Davalos, Houston's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Added Georgia's Vince Dooley: ". . . Ultimate greed." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame would prefer to call it the ultimate business opportunity, a chance 
to add money to its endowment and further improve its visibility. Armed with 
the Notre Dame mystique, university administrators simply took advantage of the 
market demand, albeit clumsily. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not another school in the country that could have done it," one 
network official said. "There are some who think they could, but they can't. If 
they sat back and looked at it, they'd realize it." 
</P>
<P>
The evidence: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only three college football games received double-digit ratings last 
season, and each involved Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A look at the ratings of ABC's or CBS' top four college football games in 
1989 shows that Notre Dame played in each. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if that doesn't tell me something, nothing will," the network official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In short, NBC, in need of sports programming, purchased the most viable college 
product available. If there were a Q rating -- TV's recognition factor -- for 
college football, Notre Dame would win easily. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dick Rosenthal, Notre Dame's athletic director, the university 
will apologize for nothing. Greed wasn't the issue as much as exposure, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the CFA's new agreement with the networks, Notre Dame's 
visibility could have been compromised by a viewing schedule that emphasized 
regional games. The fear among school officials was that the Fighting Irish 
would get heavy play in the Midwest but perhaps few appearances on the West or 
East coasts. For a private, independent school that considers itself a national 
institution, such possible constraints were considered unsatisfactory and, 
ultimately, unacceptable. Financial contributions would be threatened, a no-no 
at any university, Rosenthal argued. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what motivated us to act," Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame played 13 games last season, 12 of which appeared in one form or 
another on national television. By signing with NBC, the school guarantees 
itself at least six national appearances a season with more to come when ABC, 
ESPN and the CFA rework their arrangement. After all, what network wouldn't 
want to broadcast Notre Dame's 1991 road schedule, which includes Michigan, Air 
Force and Penn State? The next year, the Fighting Irish visit Michigan State, 
Pittsburgh and USC, among others. 
</P>
<P>
While it is difficult to argue with Notre Dame's logic, it is easier to argue 
with its methods. 
</P>
<P>
CFA members are outraged over what they consider a form of treason by one of 
their own, and, in a small way, they have a point. 
</P>
<P>
While it is clear that Rosenthal never committed to the CFA television package, 
it is unclear why so many CFA members and officials, including CFA Executive 
Director Chuck Neinas, were so shocked by Notre Dame's announcement. Rosenthal 
never signed a contract sent to him by the CFA that would have given the 
school's consent to the ABC/ESPN deal. But it remains to be seen if Rosenthal 
expressed Notre Dame's dissatisfaction to the CFA before the school negotiated 
its own arrangement with NBC. If he didn't, CFA members have a reason to feel 
misled. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rosenthal: "We clearly haven't done anything wrong. We have the rights to 
our games. We were volunteer members of the CFA." 
</P>
<P>
Big Eight Commissioner Carl James has questioned the role of Father William 
Beauchamp, the Notre Dame executive vice president who was involved with the 
CFA's television negotiating committee. Without accusing Beauchamp or Notre 
Dame of conflict of interest, James made it clear that the school's 
participation in the negotiations was ironic, considering the school's decision 
to essentially secede from the CFA. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said Beauchamp "acted very responsibly. His role was to try to aid in 
bringing what was the best television contract to the membership of the CFA." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal also said that most of the money earned from the NBC deal -- $30 
million for the 30 home games, about another $10 million in "additional rights 
fees," said a source familiar with the negotiations -- will go to the school's 
student-aid endowment, not the athletic department. Also, the revenue of $1 
million a game will be shared by Notre Dame and the visiting university. 
</P>
<P>
So, the CFA was caught by surprise, but in retrospect, it shouldn't have been. 
It was only a matter of time before a school such as Notre Dame, which attracts 
large national audiences, would strike its own deal. It happened in college 
basketball, where such conferences as the Big East and the Atlantic Coast 
Conference are reaping the riches of television money. It now is happening in 
college football, an inevitable development. 
</P>
<P>
What probably irks the remaining 63 CFA member schools the most isn't that 
Notre Dame is assured of big bucks and increased viewing time, but that they 
aren't part of a similar package. To this end, there are rumors of further 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Miami, the defending national champion, is reassessing its 
position with regard to the CFA contract, said Sam Jankovich, Miami's athletic 
director. Like Notre Dame, it never officially agreed to the ABC/ESPN 
agreement. What is to stop Jankovich from approaching, say, CBS -- as is 
rumored -- and making a deal of his own? Last season, Miami earned about $2 
million in regular-season television money. Contrast that with what Notre Dame 
will receive in 1991, and it's easy to understand why high-profile programs 
such as Miami's are reevaluating their monetary worth. 
</P>
<P>
Free agency in college football has begun, in earnest. And despite the protests 
of the CFA, it will continue. Notre Dame merely took the first step on a trail 
that will be traveled by many.

MORNINGSIDE'S LESLIE SCORES 101 IN ONE HALF; 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS' BASKETBALL: SHE IS INITIALLY CREDITED WITH RECORD-TYING 105, BUT GAME 
OFFICIALLY ENDS WHEN OPPONENTS REFUSE TO PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Lisa Leslie of Inglewood Morningside High School scored 101 points in only 16 
minutes Wednesday night against South Torrance, but any opportunity she had to 
break the national record of 105 points was eliminated when the basketball game 
was called at halftime because the opponents refused to play. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie thought that she had tied Cheryl Miller's eight-year-old scoring record 
when she left the Morningside Gym because officials had allowed Leslie to take 
four technical foul shots at the beginning of the second half, charging South 
Torrance with a delay-of-game penalty. Leslie made all four, but the free 
throws were nullified later by a Southern Section administrative ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of heartbroken that I didn't break the record," Leslie said. "I 
asked the (South Torrance) coach before they left the court if they would let 
me score three more baskets, and then he asked his team, and they said 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
The confusion began when South Torrance Coach Gil Ramirez did not bring his 
team back on the court to begin the second half with his team trailing, 102-24, 
the official final score. 
</P>
<P>
After beginning the game with only six players, South Torrance was forced to 
play the final minutes of the first half with four players after two fouled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Said official John Lundquist: "I allowed her (Leslie) to shoot the foul shots 
because she was so close to the record. But, after review with (Southern 
Section associate commissioner) Dean Crowley, the game was over at halftime 
after the coach refused to play." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, a 6-foot-5 senior center who won this season's Dial Award as the top 
female student-athlete in the nation, made 37 of 56 field goal attempts and 27 
of 35 free throws. She scored 49 points in the first quarter and 52 in the 
second, an average of more than six points a minute. Sherrell Young scored 
Morningside's only other point with two minutes remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
"The points I scored weren't easy," said Leslie, whose lip was cut during what 
she said was a physical game. "There were not a whole lot of layups. They sent 
all five players after me the whole game, and I tried not to pay attention to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside Coach Frank Scott was disappointed with the Southern Section's 
ruling nullifying the record but added: "We will accept their ruling, but I am 
not very happy with the South Torrance people for taking their team off the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section will recommend disciplinary action against the South 
Torrance coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Removing a team from the court is a serious violation of our (Southern 
Section) sportsmanship code of ethics," Crowley said. "We will contact South 
Torrance and expect the principal to remove the coach from his duties for the 
remainder of the season, if reports are true." 
</P>
<P>
South Torrance principal John Schmitt, who was not aware of Crowley's remarks 
late Wednesday night, said earlier that he did not condone running up the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
"As I understand it, the kids were playing as hard as they could trying to stay 
out there," he said. "One of the four had a previous injury and (Ramirez) was 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I have concern over the score and running the score up at the expense of an 
another team. That is not what we promote at our school. I am going to find out 
more details." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's Scott said he didn't like to run up the score, but added that he 
likes "to let a senior shine once a year" in his team's last home game. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Morningside's Jo Jo Witherspoon scored 68 points against South 
Torrance, which had ranked first in the Southern Section single-game scoring 
until this game. Two years ago, Shaunda Greene scored 61 points against El 
Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a former Riverside Poly standout who set the record in 1982 against 
Riverside Norte Vista, knows the attention that a scoring mark can bring. 
</P>
<P>
"I know their (South Torrance) coach will holler about poor sportsmanship, but 
the game is to score points," Miller said. "It is a shame that she did not get 
a chance to break the record."

KING, FOREMAN SPAR OVER TYSON FIGHT

The critics scoff and sneer, but pay-per-view exhibitors are lining up already 
to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tyson vs. George Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tyson's promoter, Don King, sought to pop that inflating balloon 
today, claiming that Foreman already has turned down an offer that might have 
earned him $30 million to fight Tyson later this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I offered George Foreman blank paper (a contract) in December, and it was for 
$5 million against 30%," King said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was before he knocked out (Gerry) Cooney. If he beats a ranked 
heavyweight and sets up a title fight with Mike, George Foreman is very 
promotable. He's a former champion. He's got two generations of fans. If he 
takes the 30% and the fight goes through the roof, he's lookin' at $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
"So, when George turns that down, what he's tellin' you is, he doesn't want to 
fight Mike Tyson, and we're gonna accommodate him." 
</P>
<P>
This is all gamesmanship, of course. Pay-per-view's exhibitors around the 
country are all but panting for a Tyson-Foreman bout. 
</P>
<P>
Foreman told reporters last month that King had offered him a $5-million 
contract to sign for a Tyson fight, contingent upon his beating Cooney and a 
ranked heavyweight -- Foreman is expected to fight Jose Ribalta in April. He 
did not say King had offered him a percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had been Bob Arum, I'd have signed for a dollar down," Foreman said. 
</P>
<P>
King, who is here with Tyson for Sunday's Tyson-Buster Douglas fight, was asked 
if another offer would be made to Foreman should he defeat a ranked opponent in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
"I already handed him a blank contract," King said. "I can't offer him anything 
better than a deal made in heaven, and that's what that was. He talks a lot 
about fighting Mike, but he really doesn't want it. He's just not in Mike's 
future." 
</P>
<P>
What happens if the pay-per-view people tell King that a Tyson-Foreman bout 
could do, say, $200 million? 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to make $200 million, we'll go get (wrestler) Hulk Hogan," King 
said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
King was asked if he fears that too much Tyson-Foreman talk will diminish the 
promotion of the June 18 Tyson-Evander Holyfield fight, for which Donald Trump 
has paid $12 million. It is reported that pay-per-view sales to exhibitors for 
that one are moving slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," King said. "That fight would do $50 million tomorrow, right out 
of the chute, with no promotion at all. The reason the pay-per-view deals 
aren't moving is because I'm over here, not there." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, King said, sees a Foreman fight as one he can't win. "Mike says if he 
beats him, people will tease him about beatin' up on a 42-year-old man, and 
they'll laugh at him if he loses," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson said Wednesday that Foreman belongs in a seniors' league. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think much of him as a fighter," Tyson said. "But if you put him in a 
40-and-over league, he'd kill everybody. And that stuff about wanting to eat 
all the time . . . he reminds me of that wrestler, what's his name? Hillbilly 
Jim?" 
</P>
<P>
King said Foreman's refusal of his December offer reminded him of Foreman's 
late-hour holdout for more money at the 1974 Foreman-Muhammad Ali fight in 
Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all vintage George Foreman; he's done this before," King said. "The 
day before the Ali fight, he sent someone to tell me he wanted another $500,000 
or he wouldn't fight. So we sent one of his men, Leroy Jackson, to London, to 
see our banker there. 
</P>
<P>
"I called the banker before Jackson got there and told him to stall him, but to 
let him think he'd get the money. 
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, George gets a visit by the Zaire Army. About 20 soldiers come 
bustin' through George's door with machine guns, and one of them tells George: 
'You can't embarrass our President like this.' 
</P>
<P>
"George picks up a Bible and starts reading some psalms out loud. Then he 
starts to pray. Then he looks at the soldiers and says: 'The light came to me 
-- I'm gonna fight.' 
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, in London, it's amateur night for Leroy Jackson. Our banker has him 
believing the extra $500,000 is on its way. Leroy calls George and tells him 
not to worry. So George goes in the ring against Ali, believing he's got 
another $500,000 on ice somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has changed with George."

Kristi Yamaguchi was out of bed to make the trip to Bountiful at 8 a.m., which 
must have seemed like sleeping in to her considering that she often is on the 
ice for practice by 5 a.m. No, it wasn't the starting time Wednesday that gave 
Yamaguchi that iron-poor blood look. It was the stopping time. 
</P>
<P>
After becoming the first woman since Margaret Graham in 1953 to win medals in 
both singles and pairs at the national figure skating championships last year 
in Baltimore, Yamaguchi, 18, was advised by some well-meaning people within the 
sport to give up one or the other before she burned out. Not only did she not 
listen, it's a wonder she didn't start looking for a dance partner. 
</P>
<P>
"She might look meek, but she has a mind of her own," said her singles coach, 
Christy Kjarsgaard Ness. "Don't let the quiet ones fool you." 
</P>
<P>
So Yamaguchi, from Fremont, Calif., has no one but herself to blame for the 
schedule Wednesday at the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
From 10:30 a.m. until 1:30 p.m., she was at the Bountiful Ice Rink for the 
singles compulsory figures. That meant she had to miss her scheduled pairs 
workout with partner Rudi Galindo of San Jose. Under the circumstances, the 
U.S. Figure Skating Federation made a concession, allowing them to practice 
immediately after the figures. 
</P>
<P>
After that workout, she began another for singles. A few hours later, she went 
to the Salt Palace for the opening phase of the pairs competition, the original 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"She can only endure this sort of nightmarish schedule because she has such 
great talent," said John Nicks, who has worked periodically with Yamaguchi and 
Galindo since the death of their pairs coach, Jim Hulick, in December. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, they won the original program. In second place, however, was the 
unexpected pair of Natasha Kuchiki of Canoga Park and Todd Sand of Thousand 
Oaks. Even if Kuchiki and Sand finish among the top three, they will not go to 
the World Championships next month in Halifax, Canada, because Kuchiki is only 
13. Sharon Carz of Playa del Rey and Doug Williams of Los Angeles were third. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Yamaguchi finished fifth in the singles compulsory figures, a 
significant improvement over her eighth-place finish a year ago. With a skating 
style that belies her small body (4-foot, 11 inches, 82 pounds), she managed to 
finish second overall to Jill Trenary. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time champion, Trenary, 21, was first in the figures Wednesday. She said 
afterward she is more prepared mentally this year for a challenge from 
Yamaguchi. A clear favorite last year, Trenary left a news conference in tears 
after she won the championship because so much media attention was devoted to 
the ingenue. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Yamaguchi has a different role as a contender. But if there is more 
pressure, she doesn't acknowledge it. 
</P>
<P>
"She's detached, almost unemotional," Nicks said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that was her saving grace last year. After the World Championships in 
Paris, where she finished fifth in pairs and sixth in singles, her singles 
coach, Ness, moved to Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi commuted between there and her home in the Bay Area, where she worked 
with Galindo and Hulick. But Hulick, who learned in 1988 that he had cancer, 
died in December. He was 38. 
</P>
<P>
"That was hard for them at first," Ness said. "Both of them felt he was always 
going to be there. When they actually had to deal with his death, it was 
traumatic." 
</P>
<P>
Galindo and Yamaguchi spent two weeks in December in Costa Mesa and a week 
earlier this year in Salt Lake City with Nicks, who was Hulick's pairs coach 
when he competed. But they also have spent time without a pairs coach in 
Edmonton, practicing programs that Hulick gave them.

DODGERS' GOTT SAYS HE HAS GOT IT BACK AFTER WORKING OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Gott, claiming that he feels more hunger than pain, pitched at the Dodgers' 
workout in Dodger Stadium Wednesday and pronounced himself "80% to 85%" 
recovered from last season's elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel absolutely no pain, it is unbelievable," said Gott, one of the new 
Dodger relievers, after a 12-minute session that is standard for pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to be in a spring training game right now. More than anything, I'm 
hungry to pitch again, and to show the Dodgers what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
Gott has not thrown in competition since last April, when he injured his right 
elbow in the season's second game while pitching for Pittsburgh against 
Montreal. The elbow was hurt on a third-strike pitch to Hubie Brooks, now with 
the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
After undergoing surgery on May 12, Gott missed the remainder of the season and 
became a free agent this winter. The Dodgers signed him despite worries about 
whether he would be ready for the start of the season. Now, they are worrying 
less. "I see no problems with him right now, knock on wood," said bullpen coach 
Mark Cresse, who has been catching Gott. "It looks like he is finished 
rehabilitating and ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
A visitor to the workout was former Dodger pitcher Rick Rhoden, who is a free 
agent. Vice President Fred Claire said Rhoden "is somebody you would have to 
give consideration to." . . . Claire said he declined a request for a tryout by 
former Dodger pitcher Tommy John. . . . Although the Dodgers and outfielder Kal 
Daniels are set for arbitration Feb. 15, Daniels will probably lower his demand 
of $700,000 and could settle. Cleveland's Chris James, a player with similar 
experience and statistics, recently signed for $560,000. The Dodgers are 
offering $550,000.

NEWSWIRE: SEAU WILL APPLY FOR DRAFT, ADVISER SAYS

<P>
Junior Seau, USC's junior linebacker, is scheduled to meet with Coach Larry 
Smith today to tell him he intends to be available for the National Football 
League draft, Seau's legal adviser said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Feldman of Costa Mesa said Seau "absolutely" will go through the draft, 
rather than return to USC for his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
Said Feldman, a lawyer-agent who represents more than 50 professional athletes: 
"You have to consider the risk of injury and the opportunity to take advantage 
of the draft situation." 
</P>
<P>
Seau, the Pacific 10 Conference defensive player of the year, has received 
early attention from professional scouts. Feldman said he hoped Seau would be 
among the first five players selected in the draft April 22-23. 
</P>

Smith was out of town on a recruiting trip and could not be reached for 
comment. CURT HOLBREICH

ARBITRATOR RULES IN FAVOR OF ANGELS IN WHITE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In favoring the Angels over center fielder Devon White, arbitrator Howard Block 
gave management a 2-1 lead over players in baseball arbitration decisions this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Block, a Tustin attorney, ruled Wednesday that White will receive the $580,000 
salary figure submitted by the Angels rather than the $865,000 he requested. 
White, an All-Star last season, hit .245. with 12 home runs and 56 runs batted 
in. He had a team-high 44 stolen bases. He earned a base salary of $320,000. 
</P>
<P>
White and his agent, Ed Keating, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In previous decisions, Angel first baseman Wally Joyner was awarded a 
$1.75-million salary Tuesday over the Angels' $1.225-million offer, and the 
Kansas City Royals' offer to Bo Jackson of $1 million was chosen over Jackson's 
request for $1,900,001. 
</P>
<P>
Angel General Manager Mike Port said that just as he did not regard the Joyner 
decision as a defeat, he does not consider the White verdict a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all procedural, a salary-setting process," Port said. "We feel in Devon 
White's regard that the arbitrator having selected the club's figure is not 
going to make Devon White any less a player or give any less than before. It's 
done. By whatever means, his 1990 salary is set. All that's ever in question is 
how much of an increase will it be. Even on the downside (for the player), it's 
an increase." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have arbitration cases still to be heard with Kirk McCaskill and 
Jack Howell. McCaskill's hearing is set for Feb. 19 and Howell's is the 
following day, both in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Port said the Angels' spring training plans have been "on standby" during 
contract negotiations between players and owners but added that Friday's owners 
meeting in Chicago could change that status. "Friday is going to be 
informationally important to us," Port said. "We will do whatever the PRC 
(Player Relations Committee) directs."

ROSE BOWL BIDS FOR SUPER BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: IN PROPOSAL FOR 1993 GAME, THE L.A. SPORTS COUNCIL WILL OFFER 
INCENTIVES TO NFL, INCLUDING RENT-FREE STADIUM USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles Sports Council, in a bid to bring Super Bowl XXVII to the Rose 
Bowl in 1993, will offer the stadium to the National Football League rent-free 
in a proposal next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Council, which represents the Los Angeles-Orange County area in 
trying to bring major sports attractions here, also will offer the NFL all 
income from concessions and the sale of novelty items. 
</P>
<P>
Competing against the Rose Bowl are San Diego, San Francisco and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Rose Bowl has 102,083 seats, the council selected it as the prime 
venue. Under a joint agreement, the Coliseum and Anaheim Stadium did not submit 
competing bids, but they would share in the revenues if Pasadena gets the game, 
said Ed Aghjayan, Pasadena's deputy city manager. "The bulk of the revenue 
would go to the Rose Bowl, but the idea is that we would share with the 
Coliseum and Anaheim," Aghjayan said. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the split are still being negotiated. One plan calls for the Rose 
Bowl to receive 75% of the proceeds, with the two other facilities sharing 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena earned $300,000 from the 1983 Super Bowl and $800,000 in 1987, the 
money coming from stadium rental fees, concession sales, admission taxes, 
charges for use of a hospitality tent compound and parking fees. In addition, 
the city was allowed to buy 1,200 tickets at face value for local distribution 
by directors and other city officials. 
</P>
<P>
But as bidding for the Super Bowl has become more competitive, the NFL has 
taken more of the income, Aghjayan said in a report to the city's Board of 
Directors. In most parts of the country, the stadium is offered rent-free in 
exchange for the benefits to local economies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal for the 1993 game, the city would give up most of the 
previous sources of revenue and allocate them to the NFL. It also would provide 
350,000 square feet of space for the league to build a hospitality tent 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
The city would receive about $79,000 from seat taxes, $75,000 in hotel and 
sales taxes arising from the event and a share of about $55,000 in parking 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
The board has approved the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl, meanwhile, has proposed an $8.3-million project to renovate the 
press box and restructure about 1,000 seats for club seating, with an adjacent 
lounge, restaurant, hall of fame museum and gift shop.

ROOTS ARE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, BUT DRAG RACERS ARE OHIO-BASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Eckman, Bill Orndorff and Dale Eicke, three grass-roots drag racers who 
learned their trade on the San Fernando, Lions, Irwindale and Orange County 
strips when Southern California was the mecca of hot-rodding a decade and more 
ago, have combined forces to challenge for the No. 1 position in the pro stock 
division. 
</P>
<P>
But they have had to move to Ohio to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Eckman, driving the team's yellow Pennzoil Pontiac Trans Am, qualified fastest 
in all three pro stock sessions last week before rain washed out the final 
round of the 30th Chief Auto Parts Winternationals at the L. A. County Fairplex 
in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The National Hot Rod Assn. has rescheduled final eliminations for Saturday, 
starting at 11 a.m. A special practice session, from 1 to 5 p.m. Friday, will 
give teams an opportunity to shake down equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"The delay gives us more time to savor our position," Eckman said from his home 
in Ventura. "It might give the opposition more time to improve their situation, 
but, on the other hand, it might give them more chances to get things fouled 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Eckman qualified on Saturday at 7.29 seconds to take the No. 1 position for the 
first time in his NHRA career. Favorite Bob Glidden, an Indiana veteran who has 
won the Winternationals seven times, was a surprising fifth at 7.331 in a Ford 
Probe. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd estimated at 40,000, which was a record for a non-final round, attended 
Saturday's time trials. 
</P>
<P>
Eckman failed to qualify nine times last year, a disappointment that led to the 
team's decision to move to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Eicke, the engine man, attended L. A. Polytechnic High and Trade Tech College, 
but moved to Granville, Ohio, in 1984 to work for race driver Butch Leal. 
Orndorff, the car owner, grew up in Oxnard and lived there until recently, when 
he sold his TV and appliance story in Camarillo to move to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes sense to have the team headquartered back there because you can come 
and go from races much easier than you can from California," Eckman said. "Our 
biggest problem last year was that we blew an engine up early in the season 
and, with races nearly every week, we were never able to get it repaired 
properly and get back on track. 
</P>
<P>
"This season, we decided to get serious and have Dale (Eicke) prepare our own 
Pontiac engines instead of buying them and having them done outside. I think 
what happened last week at Pomona proved our point, even though we didn't have 
the engine ready until Monday and I hadn't sat in the car for three months 
before the first run at Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Eckman, 47, who graduated from Van Nuys High and Ventura College, started 
bracket racing in 1958 in a '52 Ford at the San Fernando Drag Strip. After 
serving with the Army in Germany as an interpreter and in Vietnam, Eckman 
resumed racing in partnership with old friend Orndorff. To maintain his racing 
habit, he worked as an oil field superintendent in Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
He and Orndorff moved up to professional racing in 1980. In 1987 Eckman won an 
NHRA event, the Summernationals, for the first time, and in 1988 he scored his 
greatest victory when he upset Glidden in the final of the Winston 
Invitational, a pro stock all-star meet in Atlanta that brought together the 10 
leading drivers of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The $30,000 purse was the highest in pro stock history at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Glidden has never forgiven me for beating him that day, and he's been beating 
on me ever since," Eckman said. "Maybe the tide has turned for us, though, and 
we've broken out of our slump. We have the power now, thanks to Eicke and 
Pontiac, and now it's up to me. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have power, there's not much a driver -- any driver -- can do. 
Without it, driving doesn't come into play. I feel like we're ready for Glidden 
now, for all the guys for that matter." 
</P>
<P>
One way in which Eckman is different from Glidden, Bruce Allen, Joe Lepone, 
Warren Johnson, Darrell Alderman and other top pro stock drivers, is in his 
transporter. Others have enormous 18-wheel rigs to haul their cars and 
equipment, but Eckman moves his car in a little trailer. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks kind of like an old medicine wagon compared to the others," he said. 
"But that's good because it might work on their minds, seeing us doing so well 
without all the fancy stuff. We'll probably get a truck and tractor, but at the 
moment we'd rather put all our resources toward improving the engine and the 
performance."

SPRINT CARS -- The California Racing Assn. will begin its 44th season in a most 
unlikely place Sunday -- on the high-banked asphalt oval at Mesa Marin Raceway 
in Bakersfield. It will be the first official CRA race not on dirt since 1977. 
Defending champion Ron Shuman heads a field of CRA veterans against Indy car 
drivers George Snider, Rich Vogler and Billy Vukovich III, who wish to take 
advantage of their asphalt experience in the CRA wingless cars. 
</P>
<P>
Winged machines will move into the spotlight next week when the World of 
Outlaws opens its season Friday and Saturday nights at Bakersfield Speedway in 
Oildale before heading for Ascot Park and the season-opener for the Agajanian 
family track Feb. 23-24. Making it a full weekend of racing for San Joaquin 
Valley fans, the CRA will follow the Outlaws with a second Mesa Marin program 
on Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- Old-timers Jeff Ward, Rick Johnson and Jeff Stanton, who won 14 of 
the 15 races last year, will make another attempt to stem the challenge of 
youngsters Damon Bradshaw, Jean-Michel Bayle and Jeff Matiasevich in Round 
Three of the Camel Supercross Series Saturday night at San Diego's Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, 17, won the opener on a Yamaha at Anaheim Stadium before 66,141 and 
repeated on Saturday night at the Houston Astrodome in front of 42,648. 
Johnson, a resident of El Cajon, will be seeking his fourth consecutive victory 
before his hometown fans. He finished sixth and 15th in Anaheim and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
OFF-ROAD -- The opening event of the Miller Off-Road Challenge, which was 
postponed by rain and snow last week, has been rescheduled for Sunday at Glen 
Helen Park in San Bernardino. Rory Holladay, Greg George and Eric Arras are 
favored in the main event. It is the first of a five-race series. 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS CARS -- Robby Gordon, the precocious off-road driver from Orange, made 
his debut in sports cars a winning one when he, Calvin Fish and Finland's Bob 
Leppaienen drove a Mercury Cougar XR-7 to victory in the GTO class of the 24 
Hours of Daytona. It was the first time Gordon, 21, had driven in a race on 
pavement. He drove 12 of the 24 hours and the team finished fifth overall. 
</P>
<P>
Bart Kendall drove a Mustang to win the opening round of the Sports Car Club of 
America's Toyota Super Production Grand Prix series at Willow Springs. It was 
the first victory for a Mustang in the three-year-old series. Shane Lewis of 
Lancaster won the opening Formula Ford race in an SCCA regional championship 
series.

HANSEN STILL LICENSED BY STATE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The banning of jockey Ron Hansen by Golden Gate Fields last Sunday apparently 
was the result of an investigation into Bay Area racing that began about a 
month ago when two Las Vegas race books suspended betting on Bay Meadows 
thoroughbred races after recorded losses estimated at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The two books, at the Stardust and the Desert Inn, said they had noticed 
unusual betting patterns on races, and Scotty Schettler, manager of the book at 
the Stardust, said, "I'd rather book wrestling than racing from Bay Meadows." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's case is complicated. Although he has been banned from competing at 
Golden Gate -- under what race tracks generally refer to as the exclusion rule 
-- he is still licensed by the state racing board. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's attorney has asked the racing board to issue a stay order, which would 
suspend Golden Gate's action and enable Hansen to ride there, pending a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Stetson, a racing board investigator, said Wednesday that the board is 
trying to determine whether it has jurisdiction to review an order issued by a 
track's management. The Golden Gate stewards, who are responsible to the racing 
board, have not issued a ruling against Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
Since signing the ban against Hansen that went into effect Sunday night, Peter 
Tunney, the track's general manager, has declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne McDonnell, Hansen's agent, has called the ban "the biggest joke I've ever 
heard." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, 30, who has averaged almost 220 thoroughbred winners a year for the 
last seven years, rode 147 in the 109-day season that ended Jan. 22 at Bay 
Meadows, another Bay Area track. Hansen also was the leading rider early this 
season at Golden Gate with 18 winners. 
</P>
<P>
Several attempts to reach Hansen, McDonnell and Hansen's attorney were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, a native of Logan, Utah, rode his first winner in 1976 in Idaho. He was 
voted the top apprentice in Canada in 1978, when he finished third among North 
American apprentices in wins. 
</P>
<P>
He was Canada's leading rider in 1979 and 1980 but failed in an attempt to 
crack the tough Santa Anita-Hollywood Park-Del Mar circuit in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
He has been successful almost everywhere else, though. He was the leading rider 
at Pomona for four consecutive years and has been among the leaders at 
Sportsman's Park in Illinois, Canterbury Downs in Minnesota and Longacres near 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
When Russell Baze, the perennial Bay Area riding champion, moved to Southern 
California, Hansen became his successor, winning 111 races at Bay Meadows in 
1988 and '89 and riding Simply Majestic to three stakes victories at Golden 
Gate. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, Hansen has won at least 207 races a year. His best year was 1989 
when he had more than 230 wins and purses worth $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The banning of Hansen is the latest in a series of problems at Bay Area tracks. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1988, Tony Diaz, a six-time Bay Meadows riding champion, was 
caught carrying an electrical prod -- known as a battery -- after winning a 
race at the San Mateo track. Diaz was given a two-year suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, jockey Bryan Campbell reported that jockey Doug Schrick had 
offered him $1,000 to lose a race. The racing board has suspended Schrick for 
10 years, and he also faces criminal charges for attempted bribery in a trial 
that began this week.

SANTA ANITATSU'S DAWNING FINISHES THIRD AT 1-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most observers figured that the $80,700 Santa Catalina Stakes Wednesday at 
Santa Anita looked about as competitive as the La Canada Stakes and Santa Maria 
Handicap had last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But to the dismay of those who took 1-5, Tsu's Dawning didn't come close to 
emulating Gorgeous or Bayakoa. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive in defeating Land Rush and Assyrian Pirate, two other promising 
3-year-olds, Dec. 28 after having routed maidens a few weeks earlier, Tsu's 
Dawning came up empty Wednesday against a less than stellar lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Tsunami Slew finished third, beaten by 14-1 shot Music Prospector, 
who won by a nose over 22-1 outsider Senegalaise, providing trainer Steve 
Miyadi only his seventh win in the last four major local meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Boxed in early after breaking a step slowly, Tsu's Dawning got clear down the 
backside, then was outrun in the final furlong. Perhaps he would have been 
better served opening up, considering how pedestrian the fractions were. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible reason for his failure was the track. The surface is 
considerably looser and slower than it was when Tsu's Dawning won opening week 
in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, I can't make any excuses for him," trainer Ed Gregson said. "He 
didn't break well and he was climbing a little bit, but Chris (McCarron) did 
the right thing and moved him up into the right spot. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll scope him and see if we see anything. The track is a lot looser, so it's 
a possibility (he didn't care for it), but he had trained well over this track. 
It's very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
After Music Prospector's second victory in as many U.S. starts, Miyadi couldn't 
wait to gloat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been reading some articles about the wonder horse (Tsu's Dawning)," he 
said. "But, then I remember reading some other articles, too. Remember Ziggy's 
Boy, the media horse from New York a few years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, nobody could recall Ziggy's Boy being hyped and nobody ever termed 
Tsu's Dawning a wonder horse. He is simply considered one of the area's better 
3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second stakes collaboration for Miyadi and Frank Olivares. Last 
September, Drag Race, thanks primarily to Single Dawn's bad luck, pulled a 
surprise in the Del Mar Futurity, an effort he hasn't come close to 
duplicating. 
</P>
<P>
A son of Crafty Prospector, Music Prospector won a maiden race in Ireland 
before he was purchased by Miyadi for owner Motohide Aoki. 
</P>
<P>
"He's gutty," said Olivares after his second win of the day. "I think he's 
turning out better than expected. He never works fast in the morning, but he 
acted like there was another gear, I always thought." 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro's Hero was fourth, then came Flying Reb, the 5-1 second choice and 
Short Timer. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes

<P>
Mister Frisky, unbeaten in 13 starts in Puerto Rico, will make his local debut 
in the seven-furlong $100,000 San Vicente Breeders' Cup Stakes Saturday at 
Santa Anita. Trained by Laz Barrera since his arrival last month, the 
Florida-bred broke track records at El Comandante for six and seven furlongs. 
One of the marks was held by Bold Forbes, another Puerto Rican import who won 
the 1976 Kentucky Derby and Belmont. Mister Frisky worked five furlongs in 1:00 
4/5 Wednesday morning. Among Mister Frisky's expected opponents are Leading 
Laddie, who won four races in Canada, Farma Way, Phantom X., Tarascon and Top 
Cash. . . . Akinemod won't be joining Gorgeous and Bayakoa in the Santa 
Margarita a week from Sunday. The 4-year-old filly, who missed the La Canada 
Saturday because of a temperature and infection, will be away for two months, 
according to trainer Jerry Fanning. Akinemod had won six straight after 
beginning her career with a loss. Most recently, she won the El Encino by 18 
lengths in her first try around two turns. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens escaped injury when Chief Dare, his mount in the second race, 
veered in and attempted to scale the auxiliary rail shortly after the start. 
Stevens was a bit slow to get up, but rode the rest of the day after having 
been examined at the first aid station. "I had the wind knocked out of me," he 
said. "At first, I thought I had broken a couple of ribs. As soon as I was able 
to get some air, I was all right." . . . Lans Manus, a 7-year-old gelding who 
had spent his entire career in trainer Bill Stepp's barn, was claimed Wednesday 
for $10,000 by Willie Washington after the horse had scored his 12th victory in 
the first race. Lans Manus, who has 62 starts, has now been in the money 29 
times, earning more than $215,000. Later in the program, Lark's Legacy, a 
9-year-old gelding, won for the 23rd time in his 100th appearance. He has been 
first, second or third 57 times. He was also claimed for the third straight 
race, going from Julio Canani to Sandy Shulman. . . . Grand Canyon had his 
first recorded workout of 1990 when he went a half-mile in :48 4/5 Tuesday 
morning.

Western help to contain an AIDS epidemic among children in hospitals and

OIL'S ODOR SPREAD THE BAD NEWS;

BEACHFRONT: PEOPLE'S WORST FEARS BEGAN TO MATERIALIZE IN SURF CITY. THE SMELL 
'SOCKED YOU RIGHT IN THE FACE,' A LIFELONG RESIDENT SAID.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the beginning, it was the smell that signaled that trouble was bearing down 
on Surf City. 
</P>
<P>
At first, of course, the odor was faint and people did not give it much 
thought. But as it got stronger, as the smell wafted toward the coast from out 
in the sea, people's worst fears began to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Oil spill. The two dirty words that all California beach-lovers have come to 
despise were suddenly on everyone's lips in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It just socked you right in the face," said Jeffrey Krips, 34, a lifelong 
resident of Huntington Beach. He and his son, Frank, were hit by the smell as 
they left a seaside restaurant. Immediately, both father and son knew the 
stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank wanted to go get a video camera to take pictures of all the animals 
we're going to lose," the elder Krips said. 
</P>
<P>
Any view of the crippled American Trader quickly disappeared into the darkness 
as word of the spill spread. By the middle of the evening, onlookers gathered 
in small groups, some peering into the gloomy darkness with binoculars and 
wondering how soon the oil would be upon them. Bystanders said they were 
surprised to discover that the smell was pungent to the point of being 
overpowering in a given spot, then barely noticeable just dozens of yards away. 
</P>
<P>
For beachcombers, the early reactions predictably bordered on the morbid. "Oh, 
goodness," said Janice Belk, who with her husband bicycles along the Huntington 
Beach shore every morning, taking special delight in surfers. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't be seeing the surfers," she said. "We'll be seeing the dead fish and 
the dead birds." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Tuko, a bartender at Cagney's by the Sea on Ocean Avenue at Main Street, 
arrived for work about 6 p.m. As she got out of the car, the smell stunned her. 
</P>
<P>
"It smelled like everyone in the world was putting gas in their car at the same 
time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To Jeffrey Krips, the long-feared spill only reinforced his worst fears and his 
lamenting for what used to be: "I remember when Huntington Beach -- you could 
walk out on the pier and almost see the bottom of the sea. And now you put on a 
mask, and you can't see nothing. It's so scuzzy and dirty." 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that Surf City had not been a victim before. 
</P>
<P>
Mother Nature did a number on the Huntington Beach Pier in 1983, when a violent 
storm ripped out 30 pilings and 500 square feet of deck and sub-structure. When 
the storm left, the End Cafe and a bait shack teetered at the end of the pier. 
Demolition crews finished the job on them. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in January, 1988, two days of heavy surf knocked into the sea 250 feet of 
pier, including the rebuilt End Cafe. The rest of the pier, judged structurally 
unsound, is now closed, pending efforts to raise money to rebuild it. 
</P>
<P>
But that was nature; this was man. 
</P>
<P>
Because Huntington Beach holds a fond spot in the hearts of surfers and other 
lovers of the myths of a simpler California, the news was especially 
disheartening. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Christensen, 24, grew up on the water along Huntington Beach. His 
passions are surfing, scuba diving and sailing -- a Californian in love with 
the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear about things like the Alaska accident and we think, 'Oh, it could 
never happen to us,' " Christensen said. "But it's happening -- right now. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at your own hometown, you can't imagine it. . . . In the 
summertime, you step in it (oil) every once in a while. You'll get a glob on 
your foot, and it won't come off unless you use acetone or fingernail polish 
remover. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just a little bit, but how much are they saying (was spilled)? I just 
can't imagine it." 
</P>

TANKER TRAFFIC OFF SOUTHLAND IS 'MODERATE TO HEAVY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tanker that spilled oil off the coast of Huntington Beach on Wednesday 
night was one of as many as two dozen tankers that sail the waters off Southern 
California in any given 24-hour period, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a busy coast," said Joseph Bradarich, manager of BP Oil Shipping, the 
company that chartered the tanker. "We're not the only company chartering ships 
out the coast here, and I'd describe the traffic as moderate to heavy." 
</P>
<P>
As few as 10 and as many as 25 tankers per day make calls in Los Angeles, San 
Pedro, Long Beach and other Southern California destinations, officials said. 
One of the busiest terminals is Berth 121 in Long Beach, which is operated by 
Atlantic Richfield Co., Bradarich added. 
</P>
<P>
Tankers can also make their way to offshore moorings several miles off the 
coast at Huntington Beach and El Segundo, where Chevron Corp. has a major 
refinery. At such moorings, tankers can tie up and pump their cargoes directly 
into a pipeline that runs under the sea back to shore. The offshore mooring at 
Huntington Beach was where the tanker was headed Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The tankers come from all over the world and from Alaska, where North Slope 
crude oil is loaded onto tankers for shipment to refineries up and down the 
West Coast. In addition, tankers may ferry finished products or intermediate 
feedstocks between refineries along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
After delivering its load to Golden West, the American Trader was to have 
returned to Long Beach to discharge the rest, Bradarich said. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of traffic does not normally present a hazard, Bradarich said. 
</P>
<P>
But the prospect of an accident is enough to generate concern among residents, 
said Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), one of several congressmen who 
voted to require double hulls on oil tankers in a House session Wednesday.

CLEANUP CREWS USE PLAN CREATED AFTER THE VALDEZ CALAMITY

When word of alarge oil spill reached U.S. Coast Guard headquarters Wednesday, 
officials put into place an updated local contingency plan developed as a 
direct result of the Exxon Valdez disaster last year in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said the new plan enabled it to immediately react when it 
received word that the American Trader was leaking thousands of gallons of 
crude oil near some of Orange County's most popular beaches and most sensitive 
coastal wildlife areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say this, but this is an excellent exercise for us," Coast Guard 
Cmdr. Gary Gregory said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clean Coastal Waters, an oil industry cleanup cooperative based in 
Long Beach, dispatched an oil containment boom to the American Trader shortly 
after the spill was reported at about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday. It formed a 
perimeter around parts of the spreading slick. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, American Trading Transportation Co., which owns the tanker, sent a 
cleanup coordinator and an assistant to help with operations. They were 
scheduled to arrive early today. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists were put on alert as booms went up at 
three environmentally sensitive sites: the Santa Ana River mouth and Bolsa 
Chica wetlands in Huntington Beach, and Newport Bay in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Goodbred, an environmental specialist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, said several endangered species could be harmed. They include 
lightfooted clapper rails in estuaries at Bolsa Chica State Beach and 
California brown pelicans which feed throughout the area. Sea gulls and 
migratory birds called alcids -- sometimes referred to as northern penguins -- 
also could be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
"We absolutely have some significant concerns," Goodbred said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that if there are "oiled birds, we're going to need to mobilize 
facilities to clean the birds . . . warm 'em up, fluff 'em up, put a band on 
'em -- and see if they make it." 
</P>
<P>
Judi Jones, a marine mammal expert at the Sea Lion Marine Mammal Center in 
Laguna Beach, said she did not believe that the spill would threaten dolphins, 
gray whales, seals or sea lions, which can easily swim away from the oil slick. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Cmdr. Chris Desmond said that if the oil reaches Huntington Beach 
it will be much simpler to clean up than the slick that washed up on Alaska's 
shore after the Valdez accident. 
</P>
<P>
"We scoop the sand up and remove it until it's all taken up. It's not like 
cleaning it off rocks in Alaska, where you have to take each individual rock," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Gregory said, the response to the spill has gone according to plan and 
the Coast Guard is gathering its resources on the West Coast to clean up the 
oil over the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
He said the approval process has begun for using dispersants -- chemicals that 
break up oil on the surface and cause it to form globs that are supposed to 
sink. But Gregory said that while the Coast Guard wanted dispersants as an 
option, the seas were not rough enough to make their use worthwhile Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Dispersants also are controversial because they can harm sea life, something 
that is taken into consideration during the approval process. Federal 
authorities must approve the use of dispersants. 
</P>
<P>
The new cleanup procedures, which are being put to their first test with the 
American Trader spill, specify the role of each agency. Desmond said that while 
ship owners and operators bear the burden of the cleanup, the Coast Guard must 
enforce the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard makes sure the owners dispatch commercial cleanup crews to the 
area immediately after the spill. "Now they've got it. It's their spill, their 
oil," he said. "They will keep cleaning until it's cleaned up to our 
satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely pleased with the way things are going," Gregory said.

1986 MURDER IN DARK LOT SPURS CAMPUS LIGHTING BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a cold January night in 1986, student disc jockey Robbin Brandley was 
walking to her car in an unlit parking lot on the Saddleback College campus in 
Mission Viejo when she was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the 23-year-old Laguna Beach woman, a communications major who had 
looked forward to a career in broadcasting, was found several hours later next 
to her car. She had been stabbed repeatedly. There was no evidence of sexual 
assault or robbery and the case was never solved. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, after recently being contacted by the young woman's parents, 
state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) introduced legislation to require 
lighting on all public campuses in California. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a rise in crime on the nation's college campuses, Bergeson said the 
increased lighting would act as a deterrent. Brandley's mother, Genelle Reilley 
, said lights in the Saddleback parking lot four years ago might have saved her 
daughter's life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too late for our daughter, but we don't want this to happen to anyone 
else's child or grandchild," Reilley, 51, said at her Laguna Beach home 
Wednesday. "We want to do everything we can to protect our children on these 
campuses." 
</P>
<P>
Reilley and her husband, John, also 51, a Ralston-Purina executive, approached 
Bergeson last December about the possibility of enhancing campus security with 
more lighting. Upon looking into the issue, Bergeson said in a statement 
Wednesday, she found that no lighting standards existed on California campuses. 
Schools, she said, look to the state architect's office for lighting 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill will give the state architect an adequate standard which will 
guarantee a minimum average of two foot-candles (a unit of measuring 
illumination) at the pavement throughout the parking or walkway surface," 
Bergeson said. "(The bill) will effectively double the amount of light 
available to most school lots." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson noted that, in recent years, campus crime in California and across the 
nation has been on the rise. Reilley said Saddleback College has been at 
particularly high risk because of its location amid hills where shrubbery can 
conceal an attacker. 
</P>
<P>
The year before Brandley's death, another Saddleback student was attacked on 
campus. In April, 1985, a 25-year-old student was abducted from a different 
parking lot by two men who beat her over the head, stripped her, then dumped 
her naked, but alive, about six hours later on a freeway off-ramp. Since 
Brandley's death, at least three other women have reported being sexually 
assaulted there. 
</P>
<P>
On the night she was attacked, Brandley -- a student disc jockey for KSBR-FM -- 
served as a volunteer usher for a piano concert and reception at the school's 
Doyle G. McKinney Theatre. She was returning to her car, about 100 yards from 
the theatre, when the attack occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, John and Genelle Reilley have sought to assuage their pain over 
their daughter's murder by pushing for campus security reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Genelle Reilley testified in support of a state Senate bill that 
would have required colleges to submit a list of all recent crimes to enrolling 
students. The bill passed the Senate and Assembly but was vetoed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Reilley said, she and her husband organized a Violence in America 
seminar at Cal State Fullerton. The seminar, she said, focused on causes of 
violent crime and ways to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
The Reilleys said they have been less successful in their dealings with 
Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband pushed unsuccessfully for the school to establish a 
violence-prevention program. School officials, however, have said they were 
never contacted by the Reilleys and that the college already offers a program 
that examines how to deal with victims of violence. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1986, the Reilleys filed a lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court 
claiming that county, state and community college officials were partly 
responsible for the death of their daughter by not providing adequate security. 
The suit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Though she sees Bergeson's bill as a victory in her campus security campaign, 
Reilley added that the pain of her daughter's loss persists. 
</P>
<P>
"I still wake up at 3 a.m., which is the time I was notified by police," 
Reilley said, wringing her hands while perched on the edge of a sofa. "You get 
used to the pain, but it is still intense and sometimes it just really hits 
you."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; 
</P>
<P>
OWNER GETS OK TO DIVIDE 45-ACRE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Las Vegas casino owner who acquired 45 hilltop acres in the Laguna Greenbelt 
as a collection on a gambling debt will be allowed to divide the site -- paving 
the way for its development. 
</P>
<P>
In a 4-1 vote this week, the Laguna Niguel City Council upheld an Orange County 
Planning Commission decision to allowing Jack Binion to split the parcel, which 
is on a steep ridgeline in the southernmost tip of the Greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
The council action paves the way for eventual construction of estate-size homes 
on top of the 750-foot-high ridgeline, which offers a panoramic view of the 
Pacific Ocean, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The division was opposed by some South Laguna residents. But Mayor Patricia C. 
Bates on Wednesday said that she has assured Laguna Beach officials that any 
"eventual development" on the bowl-shaped ridgeline will be closely 
scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there will be development on that parcel," said Bates, who voted with the 
majority. "But it will be dictated by the high standards of Laguna Niguel, in 
which we will be extremely sensitive to the residents' concerns regarding 
ridgelines." 
</P>
<P>
Binion, owner of Binion's Horseshoe Casino, acquired the parcel 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It lies in both Laguna Niguel and Laguna Beach. The lower portion, in Laguna 
Beach, is dedicated for open space and will not be developed, city officials 
there said. The upper 22-acre portion, in Laguna Niguel, is zoned for medium 
density residential. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on complaints by South Laguna residents who opposed any construction on 
the ridgeline late last year, Laguna Beach city officials had fought the County 
Planning Commission's decision to allow the lot split. 
</P>
<P>
But in Laguna Niguel, only Councilman Paul M. Christiansen agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised," Christiansen said of his colleagues' vote. "I don't mind on 
occasion being the odd man out, but I was just optimistic that all council 
members share the same perception that the open space issues are worth voting 
for." 
</P>
<P>
Greg De Santis, whose South Laguna home is located at the bottom of the steep 
ridgeline, said that despite assurances, the ridgeline will be spoiled by any 
development. 
</P>
<P>
He charged that Laguna Niguel council members, most of whom campaigned on 
environmental issues, were "paying lip service" to slow growth and 
preservationist causes. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the perfect opportunity for all of us to work together," De Santis 
said.JAMES M. GOMEZ

PACKARD REJECTS SITES FOR REGIONAL AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR Airport OptionsTwo Air Force bases, due to be closed, 
are being proposed as possible sites for regional airports.Rep. Ron Packard 
says he opposes a task force's recommendation of three possible airport sites. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard, a member of the powerful House aviation subcommittee, vowed 
Wednesday to fight three sites soon to be recommended by an Orange County 
citizens' panel as potential locations for a new regional airport. 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent preemptive move, Packard (R-Carlsbad) hosted a meeting of 
several local congressmen in Washington, during which they agreed to draft 
broad guidelines for the location of any future airport. Packard said there was 
general agreement among the congressmen that a regional airport should be 
located in less populated and less mountainous areas of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County's George Air Force Base, which is due to close, was 
discussed as a strong candidate for a future airport, Packard said. The 
congressmen also discussed moving all air cargo and overnight mail service to 
Norton Air Force Base, also in San Bernardino County and slated for closure, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Packard represents a district that straddles San Diego and Orange counties and 
includes all three sites expected to be named in a final report from a 
citizens' task force. The sites, already named in a draft report, are Potrero 
Los Ninos, a plateau east of San Juan Capistrano; Cristianitos Canyon, east of 
San Clemente; and South Camp Pendleton in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Although the congressmen would play no direct role in selecting the sites, they 
could assist in getting federal funding for the airport as well as steering it 
through the federal regulatory process. 
</P>
<P>
Packard, for example, serves on the aviation subcommittee of the House Public 
Works and Transportation Committee, which oversees the Federal Aviation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we could lay the ground work for a regional airport plan that the 
local people could then run with," Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to take over in any sense the local responsibility of selecting 
sites for an airport, but we certainly don't want to be in a position of 
saying, 'No, don't put it here and don't put it there,' and then not be in a 
position to help find a solution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Packard, who has previously expressed displeasure with the potential airport 
sites named in the citizens' task force draft report, said he would oppose 
federal funding for them. 
</P>
<P>
"The simply are untenable," Packard said. "They simply could not serve as the 
kind of airport we need. . . . They are fraught with problems." ROSE ELLEN

EGGERS LEADS IN RACE FOR CAMPAIGN FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Michael Eggers has raised more than twice as much money as his 
nearest colleague for the June 5 city election, according to campaign 
disclosure forms filed last week. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers raised $13,349 in 1989 and shows a total of $18,595 on hand for his 
upcoming campaign. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Ingrid McGuire raised $6,612 in 1989. Minus expenditures and 
non-monetary contributions, however, her campaign shows a total of $5,941 on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Eileen L. Krause raised $4,985 but spent the entire amount to repay loans 
made in the previous election. Krause indicated she will kick off her campaign 
with a fund-raiser March 21. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers largest contributors, who each gave him $350, included developers Barry 
G. Hon of Hon Development Co., Kathryn Thompson of Monarch Bay and the Kathryn 
Thompson Co., Kevin Darnall of Pulte Homes, and the Building Industry Assn. of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire's leading contributors included developers Van Stevens of the Mission 
Viejo Co. and Thompson, who each gave her $400. 
</P>
<P>
The three council members have all indicated they will run for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
Filing for the City Council race opens Monday and closes March 9.

MORATORIUM PLACED ON NEW DANCE HALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By JAMES TORTOLANO

<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned about an increasing amount of violence and noise at local dance 
halls, the City Council has put a temporary freeze on the opening of any new 
dance halls. 
</P>
<P>
During the 45-day moratorium, city officials will be considering ways to 
improve regulation of establishments classified as dance halls, including dance 
clubs where members dance with hostesses, "go-go" dance bars and dance clubs 
for juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
This week's moratorium follows a Jan. 9 workshop in which police and planning 
officials told the City Council about problems at the dance halls, including 
parking, traffic, noise, litter, and violence involving gang clashes and 
gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, according to city staff, piano bars have become dance halls 
without proper permits. Under the moratorium, anyone who opened a new dance 
hall during the 45-day period would be subject to a $35-a-day fine. JAMES

CITY STUDIES HIRING AIRPORT CONSULTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNDA NATALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city may hire an airport consultant to help determine if Fullerton 
Municipal Airport poses a threat to Buena Park residents, according to Mayor 
Donald L. Bone. 
</P>
<P>
"As a council we have talked about this and have directed staff to begin 
investigating what it would require to hire a consultant," Bone said. 
</P>
<P>
The action follows the city's unsuccessful attempts to get the Federal Aviation 
Administration to compare the safety record of Fullerton airport to airports 
with similar characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
Following a plane crash in September, the council sent a letter to the FAA, 
asking that the agency conduct a safety analysis based on factors including the 
number of accidents, the amount of damage and the number and type of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
However, in recent correspondence, FAA officials informed the city that they 
have no ability to conduct such an analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to find out what it would cost, the time line, et cetera," Bone said. 
</P>
<P>
Bone said that city staffers will begin compiling information and that then the 
council will determine if the private consultant should be hired. 
</P>
<P>
One factor in the decision will be cost. Due to increased cost of services and 
labor contracts, the city is already facing a budget deficit of more than $1 
million. In recent months the council has raised taxes in an attempt to offset 
the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the budget out of the red will take priority over other projects, Bone 
said.LYNDA NATALI

DAY-CARE SUBSIDY A RESPITE FOR PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council's decision this week to subsidize fee increases at the Child 
Development Center for four months brought a sigh of relief to Toni Reid. 
</P>
<P>
"Money's tight right now," said Reid, a single Tustin mother of four. "We've 
got taxes to pay and Christmas just came." 
</P>
<P>
Because the preschool has helped her son, Jeffrey, 4, learn to talk and 
interact with other children since he entered it eight months ago, Reid did not 
want him to leave. But with all of her children in day-care programs, the fee 
increase will stretch an already tight budget. 
</P>
<P>
The fees for the preschool, which serves 41 3- to 5-year-olds at Lambert 
School, will go from an average of $10.50 per day to $15 per day, when a 
nonprofit group takes over the operation on March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers At Work, a nonprofit group with child-care programs in Lakewood and 
Garden Grove, also plans to discontinue the part-time program. The parents of 
12 children who attend part-time would have to pay for full-time care without 
the city subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
The city will offer subsidies for four months to parents who write a letter to 
the mayor saying the increase would cause a financial hardship and to parents 
who have children enrolled part time. 
</P>
<P>
Reid and another parent, Ann Humke, said Tuesday they plan to write letters to 
the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Humke, whose 3-year-old daughter Angela attends the preschool, said she would 
have had to quit her job without the subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision was prompted by complaints from Humke and other parents 
after staff members signed a contract with Mothers At Work in December. Parents 
complained that the fee increases would hit them in the middle of the school 
year, when there are few spots available in other programs. 
</P>
<P>
City staff said the decision to hire an outside group was made after the 
independent contractors who teach at the preschool approached the city and 
requested health and other benefits, which they do not receive. Several 
teachers said Monday they did not care about the benefits, but wanted taxes 
taken out of their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits are expensive to provide and even without them, the program has 
already been losing about $2,400 a month during the last three months, staff 
estimated. Under the contract with Mothers At Work, all employees will have 
taxes taken from their checks and the full-time instructors will receive 
benefits packages, staff said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city notified parents of the increases in late March, Councilwoman 
Ursula E. Kennedy said she did not think that was sufficient notice for young 
mothers on tight budgets. SHANNON SANDS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; 
</P>
<P>
AD PUSH DESIGNED TO BOLSTER TOURISM

In a first for Buena Park, city officials have teamed with several local 
businesses in a bid to lure tourists from Northern California to such 
attractions as Knott's Berry Farm by promoting the city in an ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento Consumer Campaign, scheduled to begin in April, is a cooperative 
effort conceived to boost not only tourism but also the city's tax base, 
through the transient occupancy tax. 
</P>
<P>
The ad campaign will cost $50,000, which will be split by the city and 
participating businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento was chosen as the first target because, according to marketing 
surveys conducted by area businesses, Northern California is where most Buena 
Park tourists come from, said Marilyn Cuadros, director of marketing for the 
Buena Park Visitors and Convention Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
If this effort is successful, other potential areas to be targeted will include 
San Diego, Phoenix and San Francisco, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been thinking for a long time about doing something there," said Joyia 
Emard, director of marketing for the Medieval Times theater-restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Emard said the campaign is attractive to her business because it is a 
group-sponsored promotion. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign will target several media, including newspaper and radio. Several 
promotions are planned, including an on-the-spot discount for patrons who show 
a Sacramento-area driver's license when buying tickets at participating 
attractions.LYNDA NATALI

LECTURE: THE POSSIBLE CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE AND FILM MAKER TALK TO AN 
ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE ABOUT MOVIES AND WAR.

Anti-war activist and could-be congressional candidate Ron Kovic and film-maker 
Oliver Stone recounted the difficulties of bringing "Born on the Fourth of 
July" to the screen to an enthusiastic crowd of about 3,000 people Wednesday 
night at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The pair, both Vietnam veterans, met in 1977 in the first attempt to bring 
Kovic's life story to film. Kovic was paralyzed in a 1968 combat mission in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"This film has changed my life," Kovic told the crowd. "It has turned my 
bitterness into joy." 
</P>
<P>
Stone and Kovic each spoke for about half an hour before giving way to 
questions from a panel as part of a seminar on the depiction of war in 
Hollywood films. While Stone gave a low-key and droll recounting of his film 
career, Kovic took an inspirational tone. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of national Democratic Party leaders, Kovic is considering 
running against Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) in this year's election. 
The Redondo Beach resident has been touring Orange County to gauge interest in 
his candidacy but has not yet announced whether he will run. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan has wasted no time in meeting the potential challenge, sending out 
60,000 mailers last weekend to past political contributors, asking for 
financial help against Kovic. 
</P>
<P>
"His stands are the antithesis of a county that named its airport after John 
Wayne," Dornan has told The Times. "This guy has attacked everything John Wayne 
stood for." 
</P>
<P>
Kovic, who responded that he is "proud to be the antithesis of John Wayne," has 
said repeatedly in interviews that Hollywood movies starring Wayne and others 
glamorized warfare and incited young men such as himself to go to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"The movie," Kovic said, "is about breaking through, breaking down walls . . . 
of ignorance, of lies, of half-truths." 
</P>
<P>
As depicted in the film, Kovic grew up in a strict Roman Catholic family on 
Long Island. The son of a grocery store manager, he volunteered for service in 
the Marines and was paralyzed from the chest down during a 1968 combat mission. 
Upon his return, he battled depression and alcoholism before directing his 
energies to anti-war activities. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami, Kovic and another 
disabled Vietnam veteran got onto the convention floor and disrupted the 
proceedings. The event, depicted in the film, put Kovic in the spotlight as a 
spokesman for anti-war efforts. In 1976 he published his autobiography, "Born 
on the Fourth of July," on which the film was based. 
</P>
<P>
Stone first became involved with turning Kovic's story into a film in 1977, 
when he was asked to write a screenplay for a movie to star Al Pacino. But 
financing for the project fell through, and the screenplay languished until 
Stone scored a commercial and artistic success in 1986 with "Platoon," also set 
during the Vietnam war. 
</P>
<P>
The director revived the project, this time with Tom Cruise as the star, and it 
was released just before Christmas. The film received mixed reviews, but so far 
the $18-million movie has made more than $44 million in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's seminar, originally scheduled for a lecture hall on campus, had to 
be rescheduled for the Bren Events Center after drawing an unexpected amount of 
public interest. The event was sponsored by UCI's Global Peace and Conflict 
Studies program.

BOARD COOL TO MADD PITCH FOR D.A. PAY RAISE; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY SALARIES: SUPERVISORS ACCUSE MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING OF TAKING 
SIDES IN DEADLOCKED PAY TALKS WITH ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.

<P>
The local director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving received a cold shoulder 
Wednesday as she attempted to persuade members of the Board of Supervisors to 
raise the salaries of prosecutors in the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The response seemed to stem from the lengthy, sometimes heated salary 
negotiations that the board has been having with the 185 deputy district 
attorneys. The two sides are deadlocked and a strike has not been ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the board members told Janet K. Cater that they were surprised that her 
organization was taking sides and that it had the same facts often recited by 
the deputy attorneys. Others seemed upset because MADD was challenging the 
board's record on funding programs to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
"What I think I heard you say in your statement . . . is the inference that the 
county board has a low priority for prosecutorial services," Supervisor Gaddi 
H. Vasquez said. "Is that what I heard you say?" 
</P>
<P>
"What I said was if you're not willing to pay for good people then that is a 
low priority on prosecutorial skills," Cater responded. "Because you get what 
you pay for." 
</P>
<P>
In her short presentation to the supervisors, Cater said that MADD was 
concerned with the condition of the district attorney's office, which she said 
was being hit by a number of resignations among its prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"Because many of the experienced D.A.s that we depend on to protect the rights 
of victims of crimes are gone," she said, "new recruits not only are lacking in 
experience, but they are also many times lacking in good people skills. Orange 
County salaries are simply not competitive with (salaries of) neighboring 
counties or even with the city of Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
She said that MADD received its information about district attorneys' turnover, 
workload and pay from the association representing the attorneys in salary 
talks. The information originally came from county administrators, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"But the deputies had nothing to do with me going to the board," Cater said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecuting attorneys and county public defenders are asking for a 25% raise 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Cater said the workload of Orange County deputy district attorneys was much 
higher than that of their colleagues at the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"The result of this heavy caseload is a lack of time for deputies to contact 
and meet with victims' families. . . . This contributes to victims' feelings 
that they are just a piece of evidence and they are abused by the system," 
Cater said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said that he was "extremely disappointed" at the 
possibility that MADD was interjecting itself into the collective bargaining 
process, which he characterized as very complex. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to be ignored," Cater said later. "But I was instead surprised by 
the aggressiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder encouraged Cater to meet with supervisors 
individually. "It is obvious you are getting it from one source," Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said that he also was concerned with his 
office's recruitment and retention of qualified attorneys. He said that he lost 
27 attorneys last year to other public agencies and to private practice because 
many of them found higher salaries and benefits. He said that his most seasoned 
prosecutors make $74,000 a year, while their peers in Los Angeles and San Diego 
counties make $86,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry L. Metcalfe, president of the Orange County chapter of MADD, said that 
the organization considered the attorneys' resignations a very important issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It is of great concern to MADD that many of the experienced deputy district 
attorneys are leaving their jobs because of the lack of parity with other 
district attorneys' offices," she said in a letter to the supervisors dated 
Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
"It has long been a maxim in the business world that you get what you pay for," 
she said. "As long as Orange County is offering a non-competitive pay scale and 
benefits for its deputies, the county will not be able to attract the best 
qualified candidates." 
</P>
<P>
MADD has 1,200 members in Orange County. The national organization of a million 
members and supporters has been instrumental in lobbying for tougher drunk 
driving laws in California and other states. The group works with people who 
have lost family and friends in alcohol-related traffic accidents.

MIKAN HEADS GROUP SEEKING HOCKEY TEAM; 
</P>
<P>
NHL: FORMER BASKETBALL GREAT AND HIS ORANGE COUNTY ASSOCIATES HOPE TO PUT TEAM 
IN PROPOSED ANAHEIM FACILITY.

<P>
Basketball legend George Mikan is heading a group of investors trying to buy a 
professional hockey team to play in Anaheim's proposed indoor sports arena, 
sources confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anaheim city officials estimated that legal challenges to the arena 
could increase construction costs as much as $500,000 a month, or a minimum of 
$1.5 million, even if the city prevails at an upcoming court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and the developers of the $85 million arena had previously 
declined to identify the groups trying to purchase NHL and NBA franchises. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Mikan confirmed Wednesday that his father's group is negotiating with 
an NHL team, which he declined to identify, and had made an unsuccessful bid to 
purchase the Winnipeg Jets last fall. Larry Mikan said the investors include an 
unspecified number of Orange County businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Papiano, attorney for arena developer Ogden Allied Services, also 
confirmed that Mikan heads a group made up of "all Orange County people." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Mikan, who as a player was the NBA's first superstar, was vacationing 
in Arizona Wednesday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Papiano nor Larry Mikan would reveal the investors' identities. Papiano 
said Mikan's group is separate from another group of investors, most of whom 
also are from Orange County, that also hopes to bring a pro basketball or 
hockey team to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Papiano said he recently told Mikan that the developer would "certainly want to 
talk to you" if Mikan's group purchases a hockey team. He said Mikan's 
investors have the financial resources to purchase a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Kings hockey franchise was bought by Bruce McNall for $20 
million in 1988, but now is valued at up to $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The NHL's constitution stipulates that franchises may not be moved, which has 
required the constitution to be amended on the few occasions that franchises 
have been shifted. Such amendments require unanimous approval from the league's 
Board of Governors, a league spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City Scouts, a team launched in the expansion of 1974-75, moved to 
Denver for the 1976-77 season and in 1982-83 moved again to New Jersey, where 
they remain. The California Seals moved to Cleveland for the 1976-77 season and 
merged with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978-79. The Atlanta Flames, who began 
play in 1972-73, moved to Calgary before the 1980-81 season. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Shenkarow, president of the Winnipeg Jets, said Tuesday that a group from 
Anaheim had made one of several offers to purchase his hockey franchise last 
fall, but that the team is not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Mikan group now has its sights set on another hockey team, said Larry 
Mikan, who is in the real estate business with his father in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"We have another existing team that is very interested in that (Anaheim) area," 
Larry Mikan said. "I'm not at liberty to tell you which one. I just got off the 
phone with one of the partners . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't (the) Minnesota (North Stars), believe it or not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars have applied to the NHL for permission to move, perhaps to 
Oakland to play in the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Mikan was the first big man to dominate play in the NBA and came to be known as 
Mr. Basketball. An All-American at DePaul University, Mikan went on to a Hall 
of Fame career with the Minneapolis Lakers, retiring in 1956 before the team 
moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana, which has plans for a nearly identical 20,000-seat indoor arena, 
also is trying to land either a pro hockey or pro basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the city of Anaheim will go to court today to seek a delay for a 
hearing on three lawsuits challenging the City Council's re-zoning of land for 
the arena, issuance of a parking permit and approval of an environmental report 
on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of Orange Tree Mobile Home Park obtained a temporary restraining 
order Jan. 28 prohibiting the city from proceeding with its arena plans and 
delaying construction. 
</P>
<P>
The city's attorney, John Fellows III, said Anaheim needs additional time to 
prepare its case. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some real potential harms to both the city and to Ogden" if the 
court further bars work on the arena, Fellows said. 
</P>
<P>
"Increases in construction costs will run to half a million dollars a month for 
each month" of delay, Fellows said. "We're looking at, realistically, three 
months before this thing is decided, so we're looking at $1.5 million."

MACLEAN-WILSON LATEST PAIR TO PUMP UP THE VOLUME AT PAULEY; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: UCLA FANS ARE USED TO TALENTED FORWARDS, BUT THE CURRENT DUO IS 
EVEN STIRRING MEMORIES OF SIDNEY WICKS AND CURTIS ROWE.

<P>
As he embarked upon the task of restoring glory to the UCLA basketball program 
1 1/2 years ago, Coach Jim Harrick faced doubts about the players who would 
provide the cornerstones in the rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
He wondered if Trevor Wilson, after two stormy years under former Coach Walt 
Hazzard, would be able to curb his temper. Would Wilson be able to blend his 
splendid individual skills into a team concept? Would Wilson react positively 
to a one-week suspension from preseason practice? 
</P>
<P>
He wondered how Don MacLean, only a few months removed from Simi Valley High, 
would adjust to the more rigorous demands of college basketball. Would MacLean 
score as well as he had in high school? Would MacLean have the stamina to 
rebound, defend and run? 
</P>
<P>
Harrick has since watched Wilson, a 6-foot-8 senior, and MacLean, a 6-10 
sophomore, develop into one of the most proficient forward tandems in college 
basketball. The two have proved to be worthy heirs to a long line of exemplary 
Bruin forwards that includes Sidney Wicks and Curtis Rowe and eight other NBA 
first-round draft choices since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is averaging 19.1 points and 8.6 rebounds. His teammates call him Rock, 
in reference to his physique and not his abysmal free-throw shooting. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean is averaging 19.8 points and 8.4 rebounds. His teammates call him Air 
because his on-court demeanor is the opposite of Michael (Air) Jordan's. 
</P>
<P>
Between them, that's 38.9 points and 17 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
As seniors in 1971, Wicks and Rowe combined to average 38.9 points and 22.8 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, Marques Johnson and Richard Washington averaged 34.7 points 
and 18 rebounds. The next season, Johnson and David Greenwood averaged 36.6 
points and 20 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The latest tandem has led UCLA to a 15-4 record, within a game of the Pacific 
10 Conference lead entering tonight's game at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean is the No. 3 scorer and rebounder in the Pac-10, and Wilson ranks fifth 
in scoring and second in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Said John Wooden, who has either coached or observed all who have manned the 
corners for UCLA in the last four decades: "If we were to compare them to the 
other pairs, I'd say they're not nearly as stable. They're a great pair of 
forwards, perhaps as fine a pair as there is in the country from an offensive 
point of view, but each tends to get out of control every now and then because 
of their temperament. 
</P>
<P>
"Wilson is more outgoing, has been less disciplined in the past than MacLean. 
But MacLean, in his desire to excel, gets himself riled up at times and loses a 
bit of control. And when he does that, he loses a bit of his effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"MacLean appears to be a more placid individual, but he really isn't. Rowe 
wasn't (placid), either, but he appeared that way. He was very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
While Wicks and Rowe never backed down from a challenge, Wooden said, they were 
"spirited without being temperamental." 
</P>
<P>
Physically, however, MacLean and Wilson might be their equal. 
</P>
<P>
"MacLean is as fine around the board as any 6-10 man you'll see," Wooden said. 
"He has a great touch. 
</P>
<P>
"Just taking the physical qualifications to play forward, I'd say Sidney 
(Wicks) had about as many as you could find in an individual, and so does 
Wilson," Wooden said. 
</P>
<P>
College basketball coaches across America breathed a sigh of relief in 1969 
when the former Lew Alcindor finally graduated after leading UCLA to three 
consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships. 
</P>
<P>
But in the two seasons before Bill Walton joined the Bruin varsity in 1971 and 
started another reign of terror in Westwood, Wicks and Rowe kept the dynasty 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins won 57 of 60 games and consecutive NCAA championships in the 1969-70 
and '70-71 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970-71, UCLA outrebounded its foes by an average of 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We were extremely confident of our ability to get the ball inside and score," 
said Steve Patterson, who was the Bruins' center. "And if we didn't score on 
the first shot, then we'd score on the second or the third or the fourth. I 
remember that we used to really take control of games on the inside." 
</P>
<P>
Rowe provided consistency. 
</P>
<P>
"As a starter for me for three years, Curtis Rowe never had a bad game," Wooden 
said. "He didn't have the great games like Sidney might have, but he never had 
a bad game." 
</P>
<P>
Wicks was brash -- outgoing and talkative. Like Wilson, he wore his emotions on 
his sleeve. And, like Wilson, he clashed with his coach. 
</P>
<P>
And so, as a sophomore, Wicks was used as a reserve behind Rowe and Lynn 
Shackelford, neither of whom was as talented. 
</P>
<P>
"That used to trouble him," Wooden said. "He'd say to me, 'You know I'm better 
than them.' And I'd say, 'I know you are. They probably do too. It's too bad 
that you let them beat you out.' Eventually, he came to understand what I was 
talking about, and in his last two years he was the best college forward in the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, Wicks averaged 21.3 points and 12.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe averaged 17.6 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Wicks was like Wilson, and Rowe was like MacLean," Wooden said. "Though not as 
good a scorer as MacLean, (Rowe) was steadier than MacLean has been. Maybe I 
won't say that next year, or in (MacLean's) senior year." 
</P>
<P>
Like MacLean, Rowe was quietly intense. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a good sense of humor -- he loved to laugh -- and he was very 
easygoing," Patterson said. "Yet, on the court he had a demeanor that was 
fearsome. He really could be scary at times on the floor. He just had a look of 
a guy you wouldn't want to mess with. I think he really scared people at 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Rowe is a community service worker in Detroit. He averaged 11.6 points 
in an eight-year NBA career with the Detroit Pistons and the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Wicks, a UCLA assistant coach under Hazzard, is a real estate investor in Los 
Angeles. He averaged 16.8 points in a 10-year NBA career with the Portland 
Trail Blazers, the Celtics and the San Diego Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Among Harrick's first priorities as UCLA coach were to persuade MacLean to sign 
with the Bruins and to persuade point guard Darrick Martin, who had signed 
several months earlier, to honor his commitment. Accomplishing both, he has 
said, laid the foundation for his program. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, it seems, was bringing Wilson into line. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a time, Trevor and I, when I needed to think about him being on our 
team," Harrick said. "I felt that I needed to get Trevor's attention and let 
him know that there was only one crazy guy on the team, and that was me. And 
that, most of the time, things would be done my way." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick didn't like Wilson riding his teammates in practice. He wanted Wilson 
to encourage, not chastise and discourage. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, before last season, he suspended Wilson for a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was an individualist, and there was no place for that on our 
team," Harrick said. "That was just his style, but it was contrary to the way I 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Trevor, I can't put up with this for two years. I'd be a 
fruitcake, so we might as well part, unless . . . 
</P>
<P>
 " 'We do this, this, this and this.' I had about four pages of things I wanted 
him to do." 
</P>
<P>
Among the requirements was a weekly meeting with a sports psychologist, Dr. 
William Parham, who works regularly with several UCLA athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Working with Parham helped him control his emotions, Wilson said. And except 
for an occasional flare-up, such as last month's technical foul incident at 
Stanford, Wilson's behavior has steadied. 
</P>
<P>
He joined Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), Walton, Greenwood and Johnson 
this season as the only Bruins who have both scored more than 1,500 points and 
grabbed more than 800 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Wilson never considered leaving UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"No way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Transferring would have meant not playing with his boyhood friend, MacLean, 
whom he met in the summer before the eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember seeing this huge guy," MacLean said. "He'd miss three layups in a 
row and then finally make it. We used to joke that that was the only way he led 
the league in rebounding." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and MacLean talked of playing together, but Wilson stayed close to home 
at Cleveland High in Reseda and MacLean stayed in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
So, before hooking up in Westwood, they were teammates only in pickup games. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been playing together for so long that we kind of have a feel for each 
other," Wilson said. "We know each other's strengths and weaknesses so well, 
and we kind of play off them. It's become instinctive. It's not something we 
talk about, but I just know where he's going to be sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, when Wilson averaged 18.4 points and 8.7 rebounds, and MacLean 
averaged 18.6 points and 7.5 rebounds, it was the first time two Bruin forwards 
had each averaged more than 18 points in the same season. And while Wilson led 
the Pac-10 in rebounding for the second consecutive season, MacLean set a 
freshman conference scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
This season, MacLean has accounted for 537 points and rebounds, only 12 more 
than Wilson. And in the last four weeks, the two have experienced a role 
reversal. Wilson has been the more accurate shooter in UCLA's last eight games, 
making 59.6% of his shots, while MacLean has been the more consistent 
rebounder, pulling down an average of 10.6 rebounds to Wilson's 7.8. 
</P>
<P>
"Trevor is about as quick a forward as I've ever known," Harrick said. "And not 
many teams have a 6-10 player who can stay with MacLean. He shoots over most of 
the people who guard him, he's got good moves around the basket and he's got a 
soft touch." 
</P>
<P>
Only two former Bruins, Alcindor and Walton, averaged more points a game as 
sophomores than MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought he'd be quite this good," Harrick said. "But I thought after 
last season that by January, he'd be one of the top players in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Both are expected to be first-round NBA draft choices, although some have 
questioned Wilson's shooting touch from the perimeter and the foul line. He has 
made only 52.9% of his free throws this season. But Newell said: "I like 
(Wilson's) fire. I like the fact that he wants to win. He'll give up his body 
to help his team win." 
</P>
<P>
MacLean is already being mentioned as an eventual NBA lottery pick. His unusual 
shot, released on the way up, is difficult to defend, Newell said. "His shot 
reminds me of Bernard King's. He shoots so quickly that he doesn't get a lot of 
shots blocked." 
</P>
<P>
Together, Wilson and MacLean form a combination that's difficult to beat, 
MacLean said. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Harrick said there are better tandems in the country," he said, "but I 
don't think -- as far as playing together and being so complementary (goes) -- 
that there are." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, however, defers to Bruins past. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen some tapes of Wicks, and he's far superior to either one of us," 
Wilson said. "The stats are comparable, but we have to win a championship to be 
truly compared to those guys." 
</P>

Glenfed Shares Sold: Royal Trustco, meantime, sold 515,000 shares of stock in 
Glendale Federal's parent firm to reduce its ownership stake to a little less 
than 5%, approximately 1.5 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian firm had purchased nearly 10% of Glenfed Inc. stock in the fall of 
1987 in an apparent effort to work out a friendly merger. 
</P>
<P>
But Glenfed rebuffed Royal Trustco, and the Canadian firm did not want to 
launch a hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
After its purchase of Pacific Savings, Royal Trustco was required to reduce its 
stake in Glenfed to less than 5%. Federal regulations prohibit the owner of one 
federally insured S&amp;L from holding more than 5% of an S&amp;L that it 
doesn't control, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Canadian firm sold 836,400 shares to cut its stake from 9.4% to 
6.7%. Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer

TACO BELL CUTS 3 DIVISIONS IN REORGANIZATION

<P>
Taco Bell has eliminated three divisional posts as part of a restructuring at 
the Mexican-style fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
The three vice presidents who headed Taco Bell's western, eastern and southern 
divisions have been reassigned within the chain's Irvine headquarters or within 
Pepsico Inc., which is Taco Bell's parent, said company spokesman Elliot Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the reorganization, Taco Bell eliminated the three divisions and, 
instead, has 12 zones reporting directly to corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring will result in "less than 25 layoffs," Bloom said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell reported the restructuring this week along with fourth-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The chain's operating income rose 12%, to $28.6 million, despite a $5.5-million 
one-time charge for costs related to the reorganization. Without the one-time 
charge, Taco Bell's operating income in the fourth quarter climbed 33%. 
</P>

SEX CHARGES DON'T SHAKE FAITH IN COVENANT HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 9:30 p.m. Tuesday and time for the night meeting at Covenant House in 
Hollywood. More than 30 young people, mostly males, crowded the front offices, 
a row of semi-partitioned small rooms crammed with overstuffed furniture. In a 
few minutes they would be transported to hotels or shelters for the night, to 
be brought back to Covenant House in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Had any of them heard of Father Bruce Ritter? a counselor asked. Mildly 
interested, one youth offered, "Didn't he found this program?" "Right." "Does 
he live in L.A.?" 
</P>
<P>
"New York. He has been the subject of some media inquiries," the counselor 
began. He was briefing those assembled on the circumstances that led to 
Ritter's announcement that day that he was taking a leave of absence from his 
duties as head of Covenant House, the nationwide system of shelters for street 
kids, runaways and troubled youths that he founded 22 years ago in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Franciscan priest is the subject of more than media inquiries. 
The Manhattan district attorney's office and the Franciscan Order are 
investigating allegations that Ritter engaged in sexual acts with three young 
men in the program, and that he misused Covenant House funds. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Father Conall McHugh of Union City, N.J., minister provincial of 
the Franciscans, directed Ritter "to begin a period of rest and recuperation 
without responsibility for Covenant House until this inquiry is completed." On 
Wednesday, Covenant House named former New York City Schools Chancellor Frank 
Macchiarola to take over Ritter's duties. 
</P>
<P>
While the meeting continued in the front office, Anne Donahue, the 33-year-old 
director of Covenant House in Los Angeles, beckoned a visitor to follow her two 
doors down to a 20-bed shelter housed in a similar two-story tan stucco 
building. The people in the front office, she said, were the overflow crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter's night meeting was already over. Upstairs in the lounge, five 
young men sprawled on couches and chairs watching the last segment of "Hang 'Em 
High," while down the corridor a few young men were settling in for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Jason, 18, his hair still damp from the shower, welcomed visitors into his 
room. He had come to Los Angeles from North Carolina, he said, "to spend some 
quality time with my mom, but it didn't work out that way." 
</P>
<P>
He had been living at the shelter for almost two months and had found a job 
transporting films between studios. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good program," Jason said. Giving a look of recognition when 
Ritter's name came up, he smiled, shrugged and said, "I wouldn't know anything 
about that situation." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in her upstairs office, a beleaguered but calm Donahue described what it 
has been like trying to operate during the past two months, since the news of 
the district attorney's investigation broke in New York 
</P>
<P>
"It goes on. . . . They don't stop coming," she said, mentioning that three 
youths were being taken to the airport that night, one to be reunited with his 
family in St. Louis, one to join the Army in Florida, another to follow a job 
offer in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing right now is to focus on the mission. All of my 
energy is focused on that." 
</P>
<P>
The agency has been in Los Angeles for just over one year. It started 
operations with its outreach program, in which blue Covenant House vans patrol 
such places as Santa Monica Boulevard at night, bringing hot chocolate, 
sandwiches and offers of help to youths selling themselves on the street. Staff 
members estimate they have passed out 7,000 sandwiches, served 370 youths 
through programs at the center or referrals to other services, sent 214 
children home to their families and, since the 20-bed shelter opened last 
November, housed 63 young men and women there, mainly 18- to 20-year-olds, 
referring younger teen-agers to available beds in other programs. 
</P>
<P>
The staff, she said, is going ahead with plans to open a 60-bed shelter next 
year and is looking for facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging it has been a tough time, Donahue said: "I'm OK. I've been with 
Covenant House for 8 1/2 years. It's not like I just started. I have a lot 
invested in the mission, the ministry. It hurts to see it attacked." 
</P>
<P>
The signs of her connection with the program were all around her as she spoke. 
Plaques and citations on the wall, a framed photo of her and Mother Teresa 
standing outside one of the blue vans, another photo of her and Ronald Reagan, 
framed with a letter from the former President to Ritter, saying that he and 
Nancy were delighted that Covenant House had come to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Almost from the start, Covenant House has been surrounded by friends in high 
places and controversy. Ritter and his program have been praised by the 
Reagans, President Bush and other world and national leaders and celebrities. 
But along with the praise has come criticism -- that the program is too big, 
with 100-bed shelters in some cities; too fat (its budget last year was $87 
million, most of which was raised from direct-mail appeals), and too slick and 
connected to the ego of its charismatic founder. 
</P>
<P>
Covenant House came to Los Angeles against considerable opposition from local 
service providers who voiced all of those criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
A compromise of sorts was worked out, with Covenant House agreeing to 
coordinate with local agencies, form a board with residents and start with a 
small shelter, holding off on a larger one for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilman Michael Woo was involved in those community 
negotiations. On Tuesday, calling the news of the investigation "tragic and 
shocking," and "a fearful blow to the credibility of the organization," Woo 
said: "Regardless of what happens with Father Ritter, I think Covenant House 
must go on in any case. It's more than the work of one individual. . . . I've 
been impressed with the energy and vision Covenant House has brought to the 
kids on the streets of Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
To Gabe Kruks, director of youth services at the Gay and Lesbian Community 
Services Center in Hollywood, the criticism he had of the program last year -- 
that it is unprofessional in its approach to social work -- directly relates to 
the situation today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to witch-hunt the most visible person in an organization. What has 
to be examined is the entire philosophy of an organization," Kruks said. "The 
reaction is going to be, 'Sex, sex, sex,' I'm afraid. But, to me whether he 
slept with the kids is not the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"(It's) what was any staff person doing taking a kid home or being in a room 
(alone) with a kid (as Ritter has admitted doing). It's that whole issue of 
boundaries. They violated their boundaries, period. . . . If I have any staff 
person developing a personal friendship (with a client), it's out the door." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Yates directs the High Risk Youth Program at Childrens Hospital in 
Hollywood. As chairman of the Coordinating Council of Homeless Youth Services 
for Los Angeles County, a group of 50 organizations and agencies, he led 
opposition to Covenant's House plans to open a 100-bed facility in Hollywood 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Saying he hoped the investigation of Ritter "will end up not well-founded," he 
said Covenant House had been attending council meetings and coordinating on 
some issues. 
</P>
<P>
He had visited its 20-bed shelter, the model he and Kruks strongly prefer, and 
said he found it "a tight facility, well laid out and staffed." 
</P>
<P>
The real test will come, he said, when they make their move to a larger 
facility. He opposes that, and he reiterated his conviction, as did Kruks, that 
the real need for youth shelters in Los Angeles is outside Hollywood, in such 
under-served areas as South Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Covenant House California's board chairman, the Rev. Dickson Druary of First 
Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, was undeterred in his support and said he 
felt strongly that Covenant House would continue to serve "the needs of the 
children of L.A., and clearly there is an abundance of them." 
</P>
<P>
Describing herself as concerned about the effect on the children and morale, 
Donahue said: "We told the kids right away, the first day it broke in December. 
We wanted them to hear it from us rather than rumors." 
</P>
<P>
The kids worried about what it would mean for them, for the program, and she 
said they rallied behind Ritter. He visited the Hollywood shelter last month, 
and after his return to New York, the shelter residents made him a card, 
complete with drawings and messages. It was full of "hang in there's" "we're 
behind you's" and "God bless you's." 
</P>
<P>
Among them was a message from someone who signed himself Alexander: "To Father 
Bruce. May the truth prevail."

CAROLYN MILLER CHAIRS ONE FROM THE HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She's all heart. Carolyn Miller not only looks like a Valentine and talks like 
a Valentine, she acts like a Valentine. She is a Valentine for the American 
Heart Assn., Greater Los Angeles Affiliate. She will chair the association's 
Heart Ball Friday night at the Regent Beverly Wilshire -- for the third time. 
Her gift of time and expertise is expected to help gross $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Love is what it's about. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother has had two four-way bypasses and a valve replacement," Miller said. 
"My father had a sister and brother who both died of heart conditions at age 
59. I care about this." 
</P>
<P>
She adds: "I basically am an optimist, but sometimes I feel depressed. So I 
keep several quotes around me, and I try to do something for somebody else, and 
that makes me feel better." One of her favorite quotes: "Where much is given, 
much is expected." 
</P>
<P>
She's married to Charles D. Miller, chairman and chief executive officer of 
Avery and its CEO since 1977. He's on the boards of Johns Hopkins University 
and Occidental College, a director of four major corporations and past chairman 
of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
She's on the boards of the American Heart Assn., the California Special 
Olympics and the California Family Study Center. A Mormon, she also co-teaches 
a Sunday school class for 14-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
The Millers, who live in Pasadena, privately adopted two children in one year. 
First, they made arrangements through a lawyer to adopt a baby to be born five 
months later. When another young mother said she wanted them to be the adoptive 
parents of her baby, the Millers said yes. Thus, they have red-haired Amanda, 2 
1/2, and blond Candice, 2. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn was at the hospital when each was born and brought both babies home 
when they were a day old; each slept in the Millers' bedroom the first six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be the one who bonded with them," she says. "I got up for a whole 
year during the night. Chuck (he has three daughters by a previous marriage) 
slept just fine. And I still did the company entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I couldn't have children, these children were meant for me." 
</P>
<P>
Motherhood hasn't thwarted her avocations. In July, Miller climbed Mt. 
Kilimanjaro, hiking to the summit. She also keeps the computer and fax humming 
in her home office, handling real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I'm good at balance sheets," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She's a graduate of Brigham Young University, with a major in accounting, and 
she spent 15 years pursuing a career in international finance, working with 
Fritz Companies, Carnation, Capital Planning Resources and Van de Kamps. In 
fact, it was on a Carnation business trip that she met her husband. Several 
years later their paths crossed again. They were married in 1982.

CRITIC AT LARGE: WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE IS STILL NEWS AFTER FOUR CENTURIES; 
</P>
<P>
DRAMA: KENNETH BRANAGH'S FILM AND STAGE PRODUCTIONS REIGNITE UNENDINGLY FRESH 
CONTROVERSIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watching Kenneth Branagh's fine new film of "Henry V" and his Mark Taper 
productions of "King Lear" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream," it is impossible 
not to realize once more just how easily the work o'erleaps the 400 intervening 
years. 
</P>
<P>
There is a suppleness in the ideas and the characterizations that has let them 
speak to succeeding generations in slightly different ways, thanks to new 
interpreters with fresh eyes and ears. 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Olivier's film of "Henry V" in wartime was a glorious cry of 
patriotism and his soliloquy to the embattled island could leave only hearts of 
stone untouched. Branagh's film, from the same root text, is an anti-war 
statement, a kind of poetic docudrama that takes nothing from the charm of the 
boy king nor the glorious valor of his troops but sees them with the irony of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Scofield's Lear, several seasons ago, suggested not a great king but a 
mercantile baron dividing his business empire and then quarreling over who got 
the servants. Yet the language soared, the descent into madness was rending, 
the human tragedy somehow the more affecting because it felt closer to hand, 
more knowable and less mythic, even if in his imperious grandeur, Scofield was 
a mythic figure. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Brier's Lear at the Taper is less regal, less mythic and more mundane 
than Scofield's and in the end less moving, whatever the grace he was falling 
from. Yet the play's language, much of it so familiar in quotation that any 
production seems to have been stitched together from Bartlett's, is thrilling 
to hear being said well. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, many of them (I suspect) drawn as unknowingly and reluctantly to 
Shakespeare as the syllabi make them draw their students to Shakespeare, have 
much to answer for. In our day it is almost invariably necessary to rediscover 
Shakespeare in adulthood, through superior films and magical productions that 
sweep us past the memory of those tiresome classroom days spent searching for 
meaning and the nights spent trying to memorize "To be or not to be" to the 
last correct comma. 
</P>
<P>
The glory of Shakespeare done well and the power of the language to convey 
sense and feeling, even after the subtle changes English has undergone down the 
centuries, inspire inevitable attention on that most astonishing of all the 
authors who have ever written in English. 
</P>
<P>
And, unless you are a hopelessly committed Stratfordian, accepting 400 years of 
legend now solidified, or petrified, into fact, you must surely wonder if the 
untutored lad and sometime smalltime actor from the country could possibly have 
been the author. Could he have had or acquired the author's genius for abstract 
thought, for poetry so magical it transcends time and geography, for the 
delineation of passions and emotions that equally transcend class, as well as 
place and time? 
</P>
<P>
Summing up a television program examining the claims to the authorship of 
Shagsper of Stratford and Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, producer Al 
Austin said: "Those who believe De Vere was Shakespeare must accept an 
improbable hoax as part of it, a conspiracy of silence involving, among others, 
Queen Elizabeth herself. Those who side with the Stratford man must believe in 
miracles." 
</P>
<P>
But of the options, and improbable as it is, the conspiracy of silence is 
easier to accept than the miracle. It is surmised -- but there is no proof of 
it -- that the Stratford man attended the local grammar school. Yet the author 
used a vocabulary of 17,000 words -- twice as many as the well-educated John 
Milton. He also coined 3,000 new words, from Latin and Greek roots. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Twain, an early and eloquent doubter (who had probably never heard of 
Edward de Vere), wrote in a small masterwork of invective called "Is 
Shakespeare Dead" that what we know of his life is "an Eiffel tower of 
artificialities rising sky-high from a very flat and very thin foundation of 
inconsequential facts." The reason we don't know more, Twain concluded, is that 
"he hadn't any history to record." 
</P>
<P>
The evidence for De Vere is all circumstantial, monumental but in the end still 
circumstantial. (It fills something like 900 pages in Charlton Ogburn's "The 
Mysterious William Shakespeare.") 
</P>
<P>
The mystery is frustrating but it is also infuriating. Orthodox scholarship has 
chosen almost totally to ignore the possibility that an authorship question 
exists, retreating behind facades of scorn, contempt, indifference and quick 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the early advocates of Francis Bacon in particular carried 
their search for hidden messages encoded in the Shakespeare texts to such 
extremes as to invite ridicule. (They also did a disservice to those who find 
serious philosophical resonances between Bacon and the author.) 
</P>
<P>
The exploration of the authorship question has been left, by default and 
necessity, to those outside academia -- in the United States, in the case of 
the Earl of Oxford, to Charlton Ogburn and to Judge Minos D. Miller and his 
wife, Ruth Loyd Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The Millers, both lawyers, were my accidental introduction to the authorship 
question several years ago. Louisianans, they make an annual visit for research 
at the Huntington Library. They have spent considerable sums publishing new 
editions of relevant books, including a two-volume annotated version of Thomas 
Looney's "Shakespeare Identified in Edward de Vere, Seventeenth Earl of 
Oxford," published in 1920 as the first marking of Oxford as the possible 
author. They have also done, and underwritten, much research in English 
archives. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Miller will address the Shakespeare Authorship Roundtable at the Pasadena 
Public Library on Saturday, Feb. 24. Earlier, on Feb. 17, she will address the 
Huntington Westerners on a celebrated 19th-Century California case known as "In 
Re Neagle." 
</P>
<P>
The great Shakespeare mystery itself may well never be solved to everyone's 
satisfaction. But this is not to say the detection should stop -- in or out of 
academia.

CRASH MAY PUT NEW BILLY IDOL ALBUM, MOVIE ROLE ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Billy Idol's motorcycle accident Tuesday morning occurred just hours after the 
rock star finished his first album in more than three years and just five weeks 
before he was to begin his co-starring role in an Oliver Stone film about Jim 
Morrison, the controversial lead singer of the Doors rock band. 
</P>
<P>
The British-born Idol (real name: William Broad) broke his right leg and left 
forearm when he went through a stop sign in Hollywood and crashed into a moving 
automobile, said Los Angeles police. Though he was not wearing a helmet, there 
were no serious head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Idol's publicist, Ellen Golden, said Wednesday that the singer, 34, had taken a 
long time on the new album because he viewed it as a transitional work that he 
hoped would expand his audience from his largely teen rock following to include 
a more adult crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"The record is definitely his most mature and honest record," Golden said 
describing "Charmed Life," which is scheduled to be released in April. "He 
refers to himself directly a lot on it. He's very proud of what he has to say." 
</P>
<P>
A national tour was to follow the album's release. 
</P>
<P>
How the injuries will affect these plans was still uncertain Wednesday. Idol 
was described by a Cedars-Sinai Medical Center spokesman as in serious but 
stable condition following a seven-hour operation Tuesday involving three 
orthopedic surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokesman Ron Wise said Idol would probably remain hospitalized for up 
to two weeks. His need for physical therapy or further treatment had not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
"Working in his favor is that he's young and healthy and athletic," said Wise, 
who added that Idol was awake and alert Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Idol's last album, not counting a greatest hits package, was 1986's "Whiplash 
Smile," which sold more than 1 million copies and represented a preliminary 
step away from the flashy, rebellious near-punk image he'd courted since his 
days leading the late-'70s London band Generation X. His best-known solo hits 
include "White Wedding," "Rebel Yell" and the 1986 Top 10 selection, "To Be a 
Lover." 
</P>
<P>
Though he still invariably appeared in black leather and studs, a seemingly 
permanent sneer on his face, "Whiplash Smile" presented him as a maturing 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Idol has been a fixture in Los Angeles, often seen at local 
music clubs where he sometimes spontaneously took the stage for late-night jam 
sessions. He was also one of many celebrity Harley-Davidson riders, seen in the 
company of the likes of Mickey Rourke and Gary Busey, who himself had a serious 
crash in late 1988. Idol performed at a November 1988 benefit to help track 
down the hit-and-run driver who killed a cycle-riding friend of his.

A WHIRLWIND YEAR FOR L.A. THEATER'S JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: CHARLES MAROWITZ RESUMES DIRECTING WITH 'VARIATIONS ON MEASURE FOR 
MEASURE.' HE EXERCISED VARIOUS THEATRICAL TALENTS LAST YEAR.

Consider the following. You're a person devoted to the theater -- every aspect 
of it: directing, play writing, adapting, critiquing. You're used to job 
insecurity; that goes with the art form. Still, in one year's time, you: 1) 
resign a top post at a prestigious theater; 2) squeeze in two book-writing 
assignments as the publishers are tapping you on the shoulder; 3) take the 
theater critic job at a newspaper; 4) lose the job when the newspaper closes; 
5) finish off the books; 6) return to directing. 
</P>
<P>
Some might wonder if this is a life, or a roller coaster. For former Los 
Angeles Herald Examiner critic Charles Marowitz, who experienced all of the 
above in 1989, it is all in the course of things. At least, that is the 
somewhat stoic attitude he holds these days, as his Shakespeare adaptation, 
"Variations on Measure for Measure," plays at the California Repertory Company 
on the Cal State Long Beach campus. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles theater community, he is nearly alone in his penchant for 
crossing the fence from theater artist to critic and back again, according to 
his desire. He is certainly unique in the breadth of talents he plies. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been on both sides," he said, sitting in an outdoor campus 
breezeway. A New Yorker by birth, Marowitz left London for Los Angeles in 1981 
after two, sometimes-stormy decades in the British theater scene. His voice, a 
polyglot of American and British, carries a residue of those years. He has 
chronicled this period in one of his upcoming books, "Burnt Bridges." 
</P>
<P>
Marowitz made it clear that, if he has burned any bridges lately, he has no 
regrets. Joining Los Angeles Theatre Center in March, 1988, as dramaturge and 
editor of the LATC magazine, Alarums and Excursions, Marowitz left 10 months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it in a strong, spontaneous impulse," he said. "I was fed up with LATC. 
I found myself fighting with the management, and eventually, it burst." 
</P>
<P>
The bursting point came in January, 1989, when Marowitz was organizing a panel 
discussing theater's future. LATC artistic director Bill Bushnell objected to 
the panel's all-Anglo makeup. Marowitz's response was to walk out the door. He 
claimed to The Times after his departure that Bushnell had interfered with 
"contractually delegated" aspects of his job. 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell denies the charge: "It's inaccurate. This dispute did not involve any 
contractual matters." 
</P>
<P>
Marowitz insisted, though, that he doesn't wish an all-Anglo theater for Los 
Angeles. "I'm strongly in favor of ethnic theaters developing and growing, but 
they shouldn't be assessed by special criteria. They are treated in a 
patronizing way, which doesn't do them any good." 
</P>
<P>
In another stab at LATC and its multicultural programming, he added: "Black and 
Latino theater should have their own sovereignty, independent funding, and not 
be under the paternalistic wing of an Anglo-run operation." 
</P>
<P>
As the Herald Examiner critic from May, 1989, until its demise in early 
November, Marowitz had a platform for such opinions. Everyone knew, including 
Marowitz when he finally accepted the paper's offers to come on board, that the 
Herald was a sinking ship. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, did he do it? "I knew full well that it would be a short stint, so 
it was comforting to realize that I wouldn't be reviewing forever. It was an 
adjustment, going from the one or two weekly reviews I did -- and still do -- 
for the (London) Guardian, to three or four for the Herald. I hoped that I 
could influence local theater. There wasn't a counterpoint (to The Times). 
Maybe I could provide one. 
</P>
<P>
"I received a lot of letters and responses to the reviews. Some were very upset 
that I reviewed the Venice boardwalk, female mud wrestling and weekend driving 
schools. They protested that, with so little space, I shouldn't cover such 
trivia. But my point was to broaden the conventional view of theater. Much 
theatrical work happens outside of theaters: Chippendale's, Disneyland, the 
Crystal Cathedral." 
</P>
<P>
In a moment of self-reflection, Marowitz remarked that since "90% of what a 
critic sees is (awful), you can either become a curmudgeon, or you can step 
back and offer constructive alternatives." Some of these for him include 
theaters moving away from the naturalistic stage style and not choosing "safe" 
or commercially proven plays. 
</P>
<P>
This suggests risk-taking, which "Variations on Measure for Measure" would seem 
to be replete with. Marowitz has, in some circles, become notorious for 
adapting Shakespeare to his own ends. For instance, his controversial 1986 
adaptation, "The Shrew," gave Kate the final word. He feels that this latest 
attempt at coming to terms with "Measure for Measure" -- perhaps the most 
nettlesome of the Bard's so-called "problem plays" -- continues in "The 
Shrew's" feminist direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I can sum up in a few words what I'm saying in the play, but I 
will say that it's a radical revision. I've deleted the comic parts, which I've 
never seen work well. I'm re-examining the way justice is meted out, 
particularly to Isabella," the virgin (played in this production by Marowitz's 
actress-wife Jane Windsor), who is faced with saving her brother's life or 
giving in to the entreaties of a ne'er-do-well. 
</P>
<P>
You might call it "Recycling Shakespeare," which happens to be the title of 
Marowitz's other new book, due this autumn. "I'm not saying that we should kick 
out 'Measure for Measure.' This play is inspired by the original one, after 
all. But I am interested in carrying on an ideological dialogue with the 
original, so the audience can come away with some fresh ideas regarding 
justice."

THE RUSH IS ON AT DOOLITTLE FOR LAST-MINUTE $10 TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Public Rush made its debut at Tuesday's performance of "The Piano Lesson" at 
the Doolittle Theatre -- and 45 theatergoers showed up to take advantage of the 
new policy. According to the plan, all remaining seats for performances (except 
Saturday nights) will go on sale 10 minutes before the 8 p.m. curtain. The 
price: $10 cash -- as opposed to the regular $26-$36. 
</P>
<P>
"I would've come anyway, but this was a major incentive," said Kim Zucco. 
Out-of-towners Hy and Frances Brenner also termed the new rush "an incentive," 
as did Joel Weiss, who waxed nostalgic about Broadway's half-price Tkts Booth 
and expressed hope that the rush policy would spread to other theaters. Added 
Chris Fink, "I'd heard good things about the play, but this definitely spurred 
me on. Without this, I might've put it off and ended up not going." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Van Buren had seen the play last week with friends. "But my roommate is 
on a fixed income, and he can't afford $36. So I was real pleased when I saw 
the (announcement). The only thing I'm disappointed about is, I was hoping that 
with a price of $10, more of the black community would be able to come. But I 
look at the line . . . " He appraised the scarcity of black faces around him 
and sighed. 
</P>
<P>
Although theater employee Kim Cruise was to have notified those in line that 
the rush seats were all in the balcony that night, no one polled by The Times 
had been informed. None, however, seemed to mind. "I wasn't told, but I assumed 
it would be in the balcony," said Joel Walsh, who'd already made plans to come 
-- at full price. "When I called the theater last week, that was all they had." 
The small, terse rush sign, Cruise noted, will be soon replaced by a more 
detailed one explaining the rush policy. 
</P>
<P>
If an unsuspecting theatergoer shows up intending to pay full price? "If people 
come up and ask me about the rush," Cruise said, "I'll tell them." The box 
office will also volunteer the information.

BRUINS HAVE INSIDE TRACK IN RECRUITING; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: UCLA COACH TERRY DONAHUE IS DOING IT AGAIN. HE HAS VERBAL COMMITMENTS 
FROM TWO OF THE SOUTH BAY'S TOP PREP PLAYERS THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter to the editor last month, a reader wrote that UCLA football Coach 
Terry Donahue was "the best recruiter and worst coach in America." 
</P>
<P>
An outlandish comment, but one with a shred of truth. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue is hardly the nation's worst coach, despite the assessment to the 
contrary offered by a frustrated fan in the wake of the Bruins' 3-7-1 record 
last season -- their first losing campaign since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is no denying Donahue's reputation as a crack recruiter. UCLA's 
recruiting classes have been rated among the top five in the nation four of the 
last five years by Super Prep magazine, and there is no sign of the Bruins' 
slipping in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA is clearly in the top 10 right now," said recruiting guru Allen Wallace, 
editor and publisher of Super Prep. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue and the Bruins are No. 1 with two of the South Bay's top recruits. 
Hawthorne running back Chris Alexander, the Bay League Co-Player of the Year, 
and Carson linebacker Nkosi Littleton, the Pacific League Defensive Player of 
the Year, have each given non-binding verbal commitments to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Prep seniors can officially commit to a college beginning Wednesday, the first 
day of the national letter-of-intent signing period. 
</P>
<P>
"It went well, really well," Littleton said of his home visit from Donahue. "My 
parents liked him. He was nice and kind of funny, down to earth." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander had the same reaction from his talks with Donahue. "We have a good 
understanding toward each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-2, 220-pound Littleton, a ferocious hitter who is projected to play 
inside linebacker in college, picked UCLA over Washington and Colorado. It 
didn't hurt that former Carson linebacker Arnold Ale, who redshirted last fall 
after transferring from Notre Dame, was Littleton's host when the senior 
visited Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
"(Ale) said it's different from Notre Dame," Littleton said. "He likes the 
atmosphere at UCLA better." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, a speedy back who rushed for 1,133 yards and 17 touchdowns and 
averaged 9.3 yards per carry last season, picked the Bruins over Washington, UC 
Berkeley and the University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the coaches and players," Alexander said of his visit to UCLA. "It 
seemed like one big family." 
</P>
<P>
He was also impressed by the school's strong academic reputation and the track 
team. Alexander, Hawthorne's best sprinter, placed fifth in the state 100-meter 
dash as a junior and plans to run track in college. 
</P>
<P>
Other South Bay seniors who have given verbal commitments or are close to 
making decisions include: 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance defensive back Josh Moore said Tuesday that he will accept a 
scholarship offer from Washington. He is the only area senior, aside from 
Littleton and Alexander, headed to a Pac-10 school. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery's 6-4, 320-pound lineman, Chris Maumalanga, said he has 
narrowed his choices to two Big Eight schools -- Kansas and Missouri. He said 
he was recruited by several Pac-10 schools, but not the one he wanted. "The 
only Pac-10 team I'd go to would be USC," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's Michael Ross is considered one of the state's best wide receivers, but 
because of grade problems he is being recruited only by schools willing to take 
Proposition 48 casualties. If he does sign, he said he'll probably end up at 
Nevada-Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo defensive end Kenny Talanoa visits Hawaii this weekend, and don't be 
surprised if that's where he ends up. "I've always wanted to go to Hawaii," he 
said. Another plus is that Hawaii has told Talanoa he'll room with close friend 
and former El Segundo running back Erik Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger Coach Steve Carnes said quarterback-defensive back Zac Odom has 
verbally committed to Hawaii, where he will join his brother Mark, an outside 
linebacker who was named the Western Athletic Conference Defensive Player of 
the Year as a junior last season. 
</P>
<P>
Two Banning defensive backs have given verbal commitments to out-of-state 
colleges. Free safety Curtis Daniel is headed to Michigan State, and cornerback 
Nizam Walter has pledged his services to Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
A year and several Scholastic Aptitude Tests later, former Hawthorne 
quarterback Curtis Conway will finally sign with USC. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes quarterback-safety Blake Anderson will follow in the footsteps of 
his illustrious father, former Miami Dolphins All-Pro safety Dick Anderson, by 
signing with Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Alexander's Hawthorne teammates -- linebacker Sione Mahe and defensive 
back Kalvein Latu -- have given verbal commitments, Cougars Coach Goy Casillas 
said. Mahe is headed to Utah, Latu to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's Armin Youngblood, who is being recruited as both a quarterback and a 
free safety, has narrowed his choices to three schools. Utah wants him as a 
defensive back, while Fresno State and Hawaii have said he can play 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Serra defensive back Steven Johnson and wide receiver Donald Godden have each 
visited Nevada-Las Vegas and Hawaii. Defensive back Clayton Lopez has visited 
only UNLV.

PATTI DAVIS' MARRIAGE ON ROCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Patti Davis, Ronald and Nancy Reagan's estranged daughter, is now estranged 
from her husband, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 37, has been living apart from yoga instructor Paul Grilley, whom she 
married Aug. 14, 1984, for about a month, the New York Daily News said. "They 
are divorcing," a friend of Davis told the newspaper. Davis' acting career 
failed to take off, and she turned to writing novels -- first with "Home 
Front," an unflattering parallel of her family, and then "Deadfall," a thriller 
about Nicaraguan policy. Neither pleased her parents, according to reports.

<P>
Winds kept a 2-mile-long slick of Alaskan crude oil from washing ashore as of 
noon today, raising hopes that the 300,000-gallon spill can be cleaned up 
before causing serious damage to Orange County beaches and wildlife sanctuary, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been extremely lucky," said Peter Bontadelli, director of the state 
Department of Fish and Game. "The wind changed (last night) and the oil has not 
hit the beaches." 
</P>
<P>
But shortly after noon today, Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays said winds 
were shifting, threatening to drive the slick ashore near the environmentally 
sensitive Bolsa Chica Wetlands, north of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of volunteers, environmentalists and local city officials anxiously 
watched the purplish slick -- about 2 miles long and 4 miles wide -- as it 
drifted about 3 miles off Huntington Beach. Officials said it was too large to 
encircle with a boom, so cleanup efforts were focused on scooping up the light 
crude from the damaged tanker the American Trader. Several large skimming 
vessels were on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said two dozen shore birds had been fouled by the oil, and six 
have died. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the spill was still under investigation, with the skipper and crew 
of the U.S.-registered tanker under orders to remain on board for questioning. 
The ship's owner said that alcohol tests proved "negative," but the results of 
drug tests will not be completed for at least two days. The owner, American 
Trading &amp; Transportation Co., said the vessel struck its own anchor as it 
attempted to moor offshore to unload a cargo of crude through underwater 
pipelines for a Santa Fe Springs refinery. The anchor theory was supported by 
U.S. Coast Guard officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very likely the anchor," said U.S. Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Dan 
Dewell. "Our investigators have seen damage to the anchor." 
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources, the 21-year-old ship has been involved in four 
relatively minor accidents, two within the last 10 months. No oil was spilled 
in those accidents. 
</P>
<P>
A federal emergency response team considered using chemical dispersants and 
lighting the oil afire in cleanup efforts but ruled out both options after 
reviewing the scene, said Terry Wilson of the Environmental Protection Agency's 
district office San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too close to the coastline, especially a sandy coast like you have in 
Huntington Beach," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
He placed the updated spill figure at 300,000 gallons and said the tanker 
suffered two ruptures on its starboard side. 
</P>
<P>
A host of local and state politicians descended on Huntington Beach today, 
staging a series of press conferences to voice support for cleanup efforts and 
raise questions about oil drilling and tanker movement in Southern California.

VOLUNTEERS, ANXIOUS RESIDENTS KEEP VIGIL

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the early dawn today, clusters of residents and city officials stood on the 
world-famous strand here, looking out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
The group held a subdued vigil as they watched for any signs of oil. Some had 
been on the beach all night. By noon, however, no oil had washed ashore. But 
city officials said the reprieve, due mainly to favorable winds, might not last 
more than a few hours longer. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 miles out to sea, the oil tanker American Trader dominated the horizon. 
It was a leak from the ship that on Wednesday afternoon caused a 297,000-gallon 
oil spill and which triggered the residents' anxious watch over their beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got to be more careful," said Tim Wynglarz, 29, a steel worker, as he 
watched the ship. "This is my hometown." 
</P>
<P>
The oil slick was not visible from shore. Some on the beach got their best 
description of the slick from Mayor Thomas J. Mays, who flew over the ocean in 
a helicopter about 7:45 a.m. and then came to the beach at First Street and 
Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
"The slick is about 5 miles long and 2 to 3 miles wide," Mays told a cluster of 
reporters and residents on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
A slight odor of petroleum hung over the beach area, near the pier, where most 
of the residents and sightseers gathered this morning. Earlier, the odor had 
been stronger, according to some at the beach. The mild Santa Ana wind, blowing 
from the land out to sea, had dampened the fuel smell as well as holding back 
the oil slick, according to several observers. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Leipzig, a city Planning Commission member and executive director of the 
Bolsa Chica Conservancy, stood inside the city's lifeguard headquarters 
building at the same intersection. Scores of volunteers approached him in the 
early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here with my children, and we want to do what we can to help save the 
birds," said one woman. 
</P>
<P>
Leipzig told her and other volunteers to walk the beaches, looking for any 
injured birds or sea animals. 
</P>
<P>
"If you find any, gently put them in a cardboard box and bring them here 
(lifeguard headquarters), and then we'll take them to Huntington State Beach 
headquarters and clean them off," Leipzig said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said two dozen shore birds had been fouled by the oil, and six 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists standing on shore said they were relieved that the danger to 
the city's main beach, at the pier, seemed to have lessened. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the residents said, the danger still hovered, always dependent on the 
whims of winds and tides. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Cook, chairwoman of the environmental group Save Our Parks, said, 
"Something has to be done to prevent this from ever happening again. Maybe the 
solution is double-hulled boats."

The United States is deeply concerned about the possibility of a terrorist 
attack against Americans or U.S. installations in Europe to coincide with the 
11th anniversary of the Islamic revolution in Iran, the State Department said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher recalled that a threat advisory was issued 
last December and he said that threat continues. 
</P>
<P>
The anniversary of Iran's revolution is this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher added that the United States has no specific information about the 
alleged terrorist operation or its target. 
</P>
<P>
"If further credible or specific information on this threat develops, the 
department will issue additional alerts to travelers and other concerned 
parties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the department is encouraging travelers to Europe to exercise 
caution but that Americans are not being urged to cancel plans they may have to 
visit the Continent.

In its latest effort to halt rioting in the occupied territories, the Israeli 
army has introduced a jeep-mounted gravel thrower that spews out 600 egg-sized 
rocks a minute, Israel radio said today. 
</P>
<P>
The battery-powered device weighs 66 pounds, can be mounted on a jeep and 
operated by one soldier. It can throw the egg-sized stones 75 yards, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The new device is the latest addition to the army's growing anti-uprising 
arsenal that also includes tear gas and various types of rubber, plastic and 
metal bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has drawn international criticism for firing guns at stone-throwers, 
most of them children and teen-agers. But army officials contend that troops 
use live ammunition only when their lives are in danger.

ARMY RETRIEVES 14 COMBAT MEDALS;

PANAMA INVASION: EMBARRASSED MILITARY SAYS BADGES WERE MISTAKENLY GIVEN TO

The Army, in an embarrassing admission, is taking back Combat Infantryman 
Badges from 14 wounded soldiers who were mistakenly granted the coveted awards 
within days of their involvement in the Panama invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the awards were incorrectly bestowed because the wounded men were still 
under sedation when the medals were pinned to their pillows and could not be 
quizzed about their duties during the incursion, according to Army spokesman 
Maj. Joe Padilla. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Carl Vuono, the Army chief of staff, awarded the medals during a widely 
publicized visit to two military hospitals in San Antonio, Tex., on Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
The chief of staff awarded 186 medals -- such as Combat Infantryman Badges and 
Purple Hearts -- during his time at the hospitals, Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were 14 non-infantry soldiers awarded the CIB in Operation Just Cause. 
However, the awards have since been withdrawn and the affected soldiers 
notified," Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the awards apparently were given with some haste and without the usual 
review, the spokesman said the decision was not made to grant the medals just 
for publicity's sake. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not a photo op for Gen. Vuono," Padilla said. "This was an honest 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
"It was thought to be an opportunity for the men to be decorated by the chief 
of staff of the Army. . . . It was an effort to distinguish those soldiers 
thought to be deserving, and allow those who were wounded to wake up with the 
award on their pillow," Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
A pool of reporters was permitted to accompany Vuono to Wilford Hall Medical 
Center for the presentation of medals to just three soldiers. The general also 
visited nearby Brooke Army Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The badges had been granted to men who were military policemen, artillery 
soldiers, communications specialists, truck drivers and specialists in 
psychological operations, not infantrymen, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Combat Infantryman Badge is granted only to officers or enlisted personnel 
with specific infantry specialties who have "satisfactorily performed their 
duty" in an infantry unit while it has engaged in combat, Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
A formal review of the CIB awards found 14 were incorrectly given to soldiers 
who were not infantrymen or did not have infantry specialties, Padilla said.

Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson today said the economy is "falling 
apart" and his government will resign unless Parliament bans strikes and 
imposes a wage-price freeze for two years.

The plan that Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt outlined in Parliament would 
also put a two-year freeze on local taxes, rents and stock dividends.

Collective bargaining is a pillar of the Swedish welfare system, which has 
eliminated poverty and guaranteed health care and education for everyone. The 
Swedish mix of socialism and capitalism became a model for the industrial 
welfare state. 
</P>
<P>
"What was known as the Swedish Model is, on the whole, gone, and this is just 
another sign," bank economist Nils Lundgren said on Swedish radio.

JUDGE WON'T YIELD NORIEGA JURISDICTION;

DRUG CASE: EFFORTS TO HAVE FORMER DICTATOR MOVED TO FOREIGN COUNTRY ARE

A federal judge refused today to give up jurisdiction in the drug trafficking 
case against Manuel A. Noriega, rejecting defense efforts to have the fallen 
dictator moved to a neutral country. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't find that under the Geneva Convention I must divest myself of 
jurisdiction," said U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, the trial judge. 
</P>
<P>
William Bryson, U.S. deputy solicitor general, had argued the government's case 
that the judge does have jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we have agreed to treat Gen. Noriega as a prisoner of war," Bryson said. 
But, he said, the Geneva Convention clearly authorizes Noriega's prosecution in 
a U.S. civilian court. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Frank Rubino strongly dissented, saying the government was 
trying to read the Geneva Convention to justify an illegal invasion and the 
detention of Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"Your honor is going to decide whether we are going to strictly observe the 
Geneva Convention, or whether we are going to push it aside a little bit so we 
can bring General Noriega to trial," Rubino said. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino said he was asking the judge not to dismiss the indictment but to 
acknowledge he had no jurisdiction over Noriega except to send him back to 
Panama or a willing third country. Rubino said the United States could then try 
"fair and square" to get him back by extradition. 
</P>
<P>
The comments came during a status conference on the indictment. Both sides 
agree that the judge must also decide soon what procedures will be used to give 
the defendants classified documents they say are essential to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing saw the first gathering in court of all six defendants brought here 
to face charges in the February, 1988, drug trafficking case: Noriega, Brian 
Alden Davidow, Luis del Cid, Luis Saldarriaga, Daniel Miranda and Eduardo 
Pardo. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Davidow, 28, asked for a separate trial for his client. In the 
motion, defense attorney Richard Sharpstein said Noriega's presence "is similar 
to an atomic bomb, producing fallout which would kill anyone tried with him."

The American apparel industry, which proudly sews "Made in the U.S.A." labels 
on its products, has been hurt by U.S. government policies that favor foreign 
competitors, a study said today. 
</P>
<P>
The study, prepared by the Economic Policy Institute, concluded that the 
federal government has "given away" large portions of the U.S. apparel industry 
in pursuit of military or diplomatic goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Having lost half of its domestic market, the U.S. apparel industry is now 
teetering between survival and extinction," the study said. "It would not take 
much to push many of the remaining firms out of domestic production." 
</P>
<P>
With 1.6 million production workers, the U.S. textile and apparel industries 
employ more Americans than any other industry, including steel, autos and 
chemical refining combined. 
</P>
<P>
The study said the setbacks suffered by the nation's apparel industry in recent 
years have been a result of government policies that treat clothing makers as a 
"sunset industry," or one that has fallen into a tailspin and can no longer 
compete with low-cost foreign labor. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Rothstein, the report's author, said the federal government has been 
"reluctant to enforce" agreements to control the growth of apparel imports from 
developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
Rothstein also said the demands by the U.S. government and international banks 
that debtor nations repay their loans have led to depressed wages in these 
developing countries. This, in turn, results in lower-cost goods, which are 
exported to the United States.

Georgia Gulf Corp., moving ahead with a plan to avoid a hostile takeover bid by 
Texas investor Harold Simmons, filed today for permission to offer $200 million 
in notes to investors to back its recapitalization proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-based chemicals producer previously said its board of directors 
would make a decision on the $1.1-billion, or $45-a-share, unsolicited offer by 
Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, it advised shareholders not to tender their shares in the hope of 
gaining support for its previously announced recapitalization plan. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons' NL Industries Inc., a Houston-based specialty chemicals company, has a 
9.9% stake in Georgia Gulf and recently announced the $45-a-share offer. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Gulf is hoping that a recapitalization will discourage Simmons' 
overtures. The company has valued the recapitalization plan at $55 a share, but 
Wall Street analysts value the plan at $45 to $50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Georgia Gulf set April 19 as the date for a shareholders 
meeting at which a vote will be taken on its plan.

Japan's Mitsubishi Estate Co., which bought New York's Rockefeller Center last 
October, will join two other concerns in a major redevelopment project at 
London's Paternoster Square, a company spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The project, to begin in the summer of 1991, is expected to cost $1.2 billion 
before completion in the autumn of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Mitsubishi in the office and retail development project, next to 
historic St. Paul's Cathedral, will be Britain's Greycoat and Park Tower Realty 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The three companies, which have invested an equal amount of equity capital in 
the Paternoster Square project, will have access to long-term financing made 
available by an affiliate of Mitsubishi, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen said the group plans to redevelop the 4.2-acre site with buildings of 
"excellence and sensitivity to the importance of the setting."

2 PHONE COMPANIES FINED, TOLD TO RETURN $35 MILLION

The Federal Communications Commission today imposed a $1.4-million fine against 
New York Telephone Co. and New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and 
ordered them to return $35 million to customers for alleged violations of rules 
governing transactions with an affiliated company. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's action-the largest federal penalty against a phone 
company-targets the two subsidiaries of the NYNEX Corp. and is based on the 
findings of an audit initiated during 1988 to investigate procurement practices 
involving NYT, NET and their non-regulated affiliate, Materiel Enterprises Co. 
</P>
<P>
"The bureau audit focused on compliance with the affiliate transaction rules 
and policies, which are designed to protect ratepayers and competition from 
harmful cross-subsidies," the FCC said. 
</P>
<P>
The rules provided that when a regulated telephone company purchases supplies 
or services from an affiliated company, the telephone company can recover from 
ratepayers no more than the cost that would have been incurred in an "arm's 
length" transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC said the three companies engaged in a series of transactions between 
1984 and 1988 designed to increase the overall profits of their parent company, 
NYNEX Corp., at ratepayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC said its audit revealed that NYT and NET purchased equipment, supplies 
and services from MECO at prices that were inflated by $118.5 million. 
Approximately $35 million of these inflated costs were passed along to 
interstate ratepayers, the FCC said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's order directs NYT and NET to show cause within 30 days why 
they should not make the ratepayer refunds and pay the fines.

Former NBC News President Reuven Frank has joined Linda Ellerbee's Lucky Duck 
Productions as consulting producer. He will help develop nonfiction programming 
for networks, syndication, public television and cable. 
</P>
<P>
Ellerbee formed Lucky Duck in 1987 after leaving ABC News where her weekly "Our 
World" drew critical praise but poor ratings on Thursday nights against NBC's 
"The Cosby Show." A pilot project for a late-night show, "And So It Goes," 
featuring Ellerbee, failed to attract enough stations to go into syndication. 
The Feb. 21 edition of PBS' "Smithsonian World" will include a segment called 
"A Moveable Feast," produced by Lucky Duck and narrated by Ellerbee's co-anchor 
at NBC News, Lloyd Dobyns. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said Wednesday the production company expects to make an 
announcement "very soon" regarding "various things in development on both 
coasts." Frank, who served twice as head of NBC News, had an award-winning 
career as a documentary producer at the network.

<P>
Comedian Garry Shandling will be host of the 32nd annual Grammy Awards 
presentation this month, the Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Shandling is best known as the slow-talking star of the comedy television 
series "It's Garry Shandling's Show." 
</P>
<P>
The Grammys will be presented Feb. 21 during a live, three-hour CBS-TV 
broadcast from the Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The awards honor artistic and technical recording achievements in 77 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
Shandling was a writer for television comedies before developing a stand-up 
routine of his own in the mid-1970s. He has also appeared on "The Tonight Show 
Starring Johnny Carson" -- for which he often served as a guest host -- and 
"Late Night With David Letterman."

NIELSEN CRASHES 'HOUSE PARTY'

<TEXT>
<P>
So how's Steve Doocy doing on his new syndicated show, "House Party"? 
</P>
<P>
Don't ask. The magazine show, which is seen on stations owned by NBC and Group 
W (it's a joint production of NBC productions and Group W), debuted the week of 
Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
But that's the good news for Steve. In Los Angeles, "House Party" airs at 10 
a.m. on KNBC, right after reruns of "The Golden Girls" and "227." This past 
Monday, "House Party" averaged a 0.3 rating and a 1% share of the Los Angeles. 
audience at that hour. Tuesday, it shot up to a 1.5-7. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, in Chicago, it averaged a 1.4-4 on NBC-owned WMAQ following "Santa 
Barbara" in the afternoon. Tuesday, it averaged a 0.8-2. And in Indianapolis 
the ratings are so low, they don't meet "minimum reporting standards" for the 
Nielsen count. "House Party," which has signed on for a 13-week run, airs in 11 
of Nielsen's 23 big-city markets. So far it has averaged a 2.0-8 in those major 
markets.

LIZ SMITH: LENA HORNE SENDS THANK YOU NOTE FOR 'GLORY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By LIZ SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
We get a lot of mail around here; sometimes even the celebrated and the famous 
write us to complain, explain, threaten and cajole. So my eyes lit up when I 
received a letter from my good friend, the one and only legend, Lena Horne. I 
can't improve in any way on Lena's sentiments in this letter, and so here, in 
her own words, is what the Lady wants to say: 
</P>
<P>
"I AM writing to ask a tremendous favor. Could you possibly get word to Freddie 
Fields (whom I don't know) and tell him how grateful I am for his production of 
'Glory'? 
</P>
<P>
"After seeing this powerful picture, when I was able to calm myself emotionally 
as I stood in the lobby of the theater, I realized once again that this Civil 
War -- more than any other war -- was the most dreadful our country has ever 
suffered. And the repercussions from it have never died away. Then my anger 
took over, as I realized that never in the history of our public school 
curriculum (from my time and up to now) have children been able to study the 
glorious past of this country's black citizens in any depth whatsoever. It is 
as if we were a ghost race, invisible except for the odd bits and pieces we've 
seen on television (the civil rights times of the sixties; "Roots"; some fine 
productions on public television). 
</P>
<P>
"But even this material doesn't reach our young people in any great numbers, 
and so they -- the ones who can still be saved -- aren't exposed to our black 
history in any meaningful, systematic way. Please tell Mr. Fields that I wish 
every school child could see 'Glory' -- as much as I wish our young 
African-American directors and producers would find it possible to create a 
series of short subjects about our past to be shown in the schools, where it 
could then be studied and discussed further. 
</P>
<P>
"For myself, knowing who I was and what I came from was my survival kit. I was 
fortunate to be born to a family who believed it had a stake in this country, 
and made a point of passing on its history to each succeeding generation. My 
mother's paternal grandfather was in the mighty 54th Regiment -- one of the 
ordinary freed black men who believed they were Americans, and who fought not 
just to free slaves. They fought for a united nation, an undivided nation that 
believed in its Declaration of Independence and its Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, that communication between generations and that sense of commitment 
seem to have broken down. In this age of drugs and guns, when I find myself 
feeling that this generation doesn't give a damn about its past, I have to 
remind myself that the fascinating and inspiring heritage I'm talking about is 
NOT readily accessible. If we could make this history available to pre-high 
school students, perhaps then we could save more of them -- maybe one out of 
five. The only hope remaining is the education system." 
</P>
<P>
"From your sister, with a loving heart, and Southern roots, Lena Calhoun 
Horne." 
</P>
<P>
AND HERE are my few comments about Freddie's film. It received an "R" rating 
although it may be one of the cleanest films in movie history. It has no sex 
scenes and no profanity. The MPAA gave it an "R" based on the highly realistic 
fighting scenes of the bloodiest battle ever fought in all U.S. wars -- the 
Battle of Antietam, in which 40,000 Americans lost their lives in just five 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Fields likes to paraphrase the late Sam Goldwyn. He says, "I don't 
care if I don't make a nickel from this picture, but I want every man, woman 
and child in America to see it." Let's remember that Fields made "Glory" 
against all the odds. Nobody in the industry wanted to handle such a touchy and 
difficult subject.

Michael Dokes and Razor Ruddock couldn't get fights with heavyweight champion 
Mike Tyson, so they'll fight each other. 
</P>
<P>
Their April 4 meeting at Madison Square Garden was announced today in New York, 
and it's being billed as "Fighting Mad" -- not at each other but at promoter 
Don King for sidestepping them in the heavyweight championship chase. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if Tyson's trying to avoid me, or whether King is manipulating 
him," Dokes said at a midtown Manhattan luncheon. "But I would like to ask him 
personally." 
</P>
<P>
Last August, King reportedly turned down Dokes' asking price of $3 million to 
fight Tyson and offered $1 million, which Dokes considers chump change. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, King made a deal to co-promote a fight with Murad Muhammad between 
Tyson and Ruddock. Tyson pulled out of that November bout with a minor illness, 
then signed to fight Buster Douglas, whom he meets Sunday in Tokyo.

Swimmer Jon Sieben of Australia, who broke the Olympic and world records for 
the 200-meter butterfly at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, announced his 
return to the sport less than 12 months after retiring.

Sieben, 22, said his aim was to win the gold medal in the 200-meter butterfly 
at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.

<P>
Sieben upset favorite Michael Gross of West Germany in setting world and 
Olympic records and winning the gold medal in 1984. Gross has since broken 
Sieben's record. 
</P>
<P>
"While my world record was broken by Gross in 1986, I firmly believe that I 
will have both the physical fitness and mental determination to win it back in 
1992," said Sieben, who is studying for a law degree. Sieben said his first 
major goal will be to make the Australian team for the 1991 world championships

MOST PANAMANIANS IN L.A. BACK OUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Angeles.

<P>
Most members of the local Panamanian community are happy about the ouster of 
Manuel Antonio Noriega, but they generally have ambivalent feelings about how 
it was achieved: the massive U.S military invasion of their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, as a Latin American, the invasion posed an ethical dilemma," said 
Santiago Torrijos, former consul general of Panama in Los Angeles and nephew of 
one-time Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, I didn't know which carried more weight, the intervention of 
foreign troops in a sovereign nation, or the fall of a bloody dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Torrijos leaned toward supporting President Bush's policy. "Bush 
exhausted all the diplomatic channels. I was a personal victim of Noriega, and 
now I know there was no other way out," he said. Torrijos, who was removed from 
office by Noriega during a political crisis in 1988, said he was tortured 
during a recent visit to Panama. 
</P>
<P>
For Roger Martinez, who as a Panamanian Defense Forces first sergeant 
participated in the failed coup attempt against Noriega on Oct. 3, the invasion 
"was the only way left" to remove him. But he said it was a mistake to have let 
the strong man survive that October action. "All of that could have been 
avoided if (U.S. forces) had come to get him when we detained him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During that coup attempt, the rebels briefly held Noriega, but U.S. military 
forces did not take that opportunity to capture him. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, an 18-year veteran of the Panamanian Defense Forces, now lives in 
Arcadia with his wife and three children. They were among a group of 18 
military families that sought refuge in Los Angeles after the coup attempt 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
The onset of the Dec. 20 invasion kept Southern California Panamanians up all 
night, glued to their television sets. "We were following the news minute by 
minute, from the moment President Bush announced he was sending in the troops," 
said Jorge Cuevas, a Panamanian who has lived in Los Angeles since 1957. "We 
were very fearful for the fate of our relatives, and for the deaths that could 
result from the military action." 
</P>
<P>
The telephone became the main source of information. "We were able to get 
through the next day, but what my relatives were saying the first few days was 
very sad. They couldn't go out on the street, or go to buy food," said Xiomara 
Galindo, a KTLA Channel 5 producer. 
</P>
<P>
"What was being shown on television," she said, "was very disquieting: the 
looting, the activities of the 'Dignity Battalions.' There seemed to be no 
order. And Noriega had not been caught." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, former Consul Torrijos said that "on the 24th things were 
quieter, once it was learned that the dictator had taken asylum in the Papal 
Nunciature." 
</P>
<P>
"Jubilation broke out on Jan. 3" with the announcement of Noriega's surrender 
to U.S. authorities for trial, said actor Ron Henriquez, a star of the film 
"Code of Silence" who also appeared in the television miniseries "Drug Wars: 
The Camarena Story." 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to talk about national sovereignty when one hasn't lived under a 
tyrant like Noriega," said Henriquez, who said he favored the invasion from the 
start. "U.S. help was needed to oust the dictator. The military was abusing its 
power. 
</P>
<P>
"The only freedom in Panama was that of Noriega's henchmen, to steal and commit 
atrocities," said the actor, who compared the actions of U.S. troops in his 
country to those of the U.S. Army in Europe during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Yet not all Panamanian residents of Los Angeles -- estimated at 10,000 -- feel 
that the intervention was justified. 
</P>
<P>
"I was against Noriega and his corruption, but nothing justifies an armed 
operation in my homeland," said attorney and economist Edmundo Valentin 
Fernandez, who worked in the Panamanian embassy in Washington in 1976 and 1977 
helping to negotiate the Panama Canal treaties signed by the Torrijos and 
Carter administrations. 
</P>
<P>
"I am against the invasion for reasons of sovereignty and respect for the 
principle of non-intervention established in international law by the U.N. 
Charter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. action drew even harsher criticism from Leonardo Sidnez, main Los 
Angeles spokesman for the Jan. 9 Panamanian Committee. "The invasion was a 
typically imperialist act supported by the Panamanian oligarchy," Sidnez said. 
His group, with about 20 members, took its name from a 1964 protest by 
Panamanian students against the U.S. presence in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Sidnez said U.S. intervention in December was merely "an excuse to break the 
canal treaties." He referred to the fall of Noriega as "the overthrowing of a 
government (that was) legitimate and representative of the Panamanian identity, 
since there were blacks, Asians and whites in his Cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, Panamanians have rarely made themselves felt as a 
community. However, members of that community have gained prominence in a 
number of fields. They include actor-musician Ruben Blades, jockey Laffit 
Pincay Jr., structural engineer Benito Sinclair and baseball star Rod Carew.

EVANGELICALS GAIN LATINO FOLLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Like most Latinos who came to worship in the chilly Santa Ana warehouse, Angie 
Martinez told a story of a life transformed. 
</P>
<P>
After she accepted God into her heart, she said the painful struggle of a 
single, working-class mother vanished. She was able to forgive the husband who 
deserted her and her two children. She could look forward to her 10-hour-a-day 
job as an electronics assembler. 
</P>
<P>
On this Saturday night, Martinez glanced at the men and women who had been 
waving their arms in surrender to God, beating tambourines in time to lively 
Latin music and offering emotional testimony in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the joy and happiness here," said Martinez, a former Roman Catholic. "I 
want to worship like this." 
</P>
<P>
She said she hoped to persuade the rest of her family, all Catholics, to join 
her at the Centro Cristiano, one of 40 Spanish-language evangelical 
congregations in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez's story is common in Southern California, where besieged Catholic 
leaders are now being forced to grapple with the realities of a rapidly 
transforming flock. A steady influx of Latino immigrants has sparked a battle 
for their souls that church leaders say will last throughout the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle has become a national issue, pitting the Roman Catholic Church 
against evangelical Christian groups competing with increasing success for 
Latino converts. 
</P>
<P>
Sociologist-priest Andrew Greeley has concluded from recent data that about 23% 
of all Latinos in the United States are Protestant, and that the movement of 
Latinos away from Catholicism -- which traditionally has included virtually the 
entire Latino population -- has been accelerating. About 60,000 Latinos join 
Pentecostal and fundamentalist Protestant churches nationwide each year, 
Greeley found. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials are particularly concerned about the defection among Catholic 
immigrants, but also worry about losing Latinos who have lived here all their 
lives. "Numerically we are behind," concedes Louis Velasquez, associate 
director of Hispanic Ministry for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez estimates about 70% of the 3.4-million Latinos in the sprawling 
three-county archdiocese are Catholic compared to about 85% in the early 1970s. 
Worse, he said, is that probably no more than 20% of Southern California 
Catholic Latinos attend Mass regularly. 
</P>
<P>
The local Protestant Latino churches that are growing the most rapidly are 
charismatic, said Carlos Piar, lecturer in religious studies at Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants find spirited services, lively music and lay leadership in those 
churches. "There's none of the staid organ hymns, Gregorian chants type of 
thing," said Piar, former pastor of the Spanish-language Emanuel Baptist Church 
in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, churches often serve as informal halfway houses for 
immigrants, Piar said. 
</P>
<P>
The Evangelical Covenant Church in downtown Los Angeles, for instance, is 60% 
Salvadoran, 30% Guatemalan and 10% Mexican, Piar said. "You go to Santa Ana, 
churches are 80% Mexican, 10% Central American and maybe a few Ecuadoreans and 
Puerto Ricans mixed in." 
</P>
<P>
As the rivalry between Catholics and evangelicals grows, it evokes anxiety and 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
Catholics complain that their competitors' "anti-Catholic" tactics have torn 
Latinos from their roots. 
</P>
<P>
Many evangelical and Pentecostal groups take "a very emotional approach to the 
whole thing," said Father Luis Valbuena, pastor of the huge Holy Family 
Catholic Church in Wilmington, where nine of 11 Sunday Masses are in Spanish. 
"You and Christ; Christ and you. Does that mean your neighbor doesn't count? 
They aren't related to other things in the community . . . That is a very false 
gospel they are preaching." 
</P>
<P>
But Protestant evangelicals such as Daniel de Leon, pastor of Templo Calvario 
in Santa Ana, say they are only responding to needs the Catholic Church has 
left unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
"A little sheep, if not fed by the shepherd, will go looking somewhere else for 
food," said De Leon, whose 3,000-member church is one of the largest Latino 
evangelical churches in the country. His church had just 100 members in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
With a $1-million annual budget, Templo Calvario has opened 40 missions 
associated with the Assemblies of God in Latin America and two in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
De Leon says he hopes to expand his congregation to 6,000 during the 1990s and 
establish 15 new churches in the United States. The first one, Templo Calvario 
in Riverside, opened for services on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The last survey of Latino Protestant churches in Southern California was in 
1985, and showed 687 congregations in Los Angeles County and 80 in Orange 
County. Those figures have increased about 10% each year since, said Clifton 
Holland, president of In-depth Evangelism Associates, a nonprofit research 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Protestants' success is forcing Southern California Catholic leaders to 
re-examine their own strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are 200 Latino priests in the Los Angeles archdiocese plus 
another 351 who are bilingual and "function" in Spanish, it's far too few, says 
Velasquez, the Latino ministry specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a gut-level feeling that if we had 100 new Hispanic seminarians 
tomorrow morning, we wouldn't have enough priests for the year 2000. And they 
must also learn the Hispanic culture and customs," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Diocesan priests in Los Angeles and Orange counties have been required since 
1987 to learn Spanish before being ordained at St. John's Seminary in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
But considering the continued shortage of priests of all ethnicities, the 
greatest hope is the Latino people themselves, church leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of lay movements, called comunidades de base, or neighborhood 
communities, are taking hold in parishes such as the 5,000-family Epiphany 
Church in South El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
Small neighborhood territories, composed of 50 to 100 households each, are 
being organized throughout the parish and meet in parishioners' homes, with 
some groups speaking English and the rest Spanish, said Father Joseph Greeley, 
Epiphany's pastor. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the comunidades de base is to spread the gospel of Jesus, as 
well as to create that sense of belonging . . . that the church is in the 
neighborhood," Greeley said. "And this happens in person-to-person contact. 
This happens in leadership formation." 
</P>
<P>
One such program at Epiphany that closely mirrors a technique of Pentecostal 
Protestants is a charismatic-style prayer and training meeting to equip Latino 
lay people to lead weekend spiritual retreats. 
</P>
<P>
Auxiliary Bishop Juan Arzube, head of the archdiocese's San Gabriel region, 
agrees that personal contact is the best way for Catholics to meet the 
challenge of Protestant proselytizing. 
</P>
<P>
Catholics arrive here from Latin America and they come to Mass and "are lost in 
the crowd," Arzube said. "If they had belonged to a small group in the barrio, 
then they would at least know people when they went to church on Sunday."

"We just knew we were angry," said Maria Contreras-Sweet of the women who 
formed Hispanas Organized for Political Equality (HOPE). They believed that 
women's concerns were not getting attention and began sponsoring forums to 
increase Latinas' involvement in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
"HOPE probably includes the leading Hispanic business and community women in 
Southern California," said Contreras-Sweet, the group's president and a vice 
president at 7-UP/RC Bottling Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes minorities struggle so hard and attack the Establishment so hard. 
We're saying to these women: 'It's time to stop complaining and accept 
responsibility ourselves.' " 
</P>
<P>
Estela Lopez, the new president of the Los Angeles Children's Museum board, 
finds a certain appeal in one exhibit where youngsters can "see what it's like 
to be an anchorperson." Small wonder. Lopez, 36, worked in news departments at 
three L.A. television stations. Lopez, executive director of the Miracle on 
Broadway redevelopment project downtown, said she hopes more children in Los 
Angeles' ethnically diverse community will discover "the riches the museum has 
to offer." 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had to initiate things like this," U.S. Army veteran Ruben 
Treviso said. "We're not bitter. We're just going to build our own memorial." 
The Assn. of Hispanic Vietnam Era Veterans is working to raise $300,000 for the 
memorial, which would include the names of more than 20,000 Latinos who have 
died in combat since World War II, said Treviso, of the Whittier-based Veterans 
in Community Service Inc. Latino servicemen, he said, have won 37 Medals of 
Honor, more proportionately than any other ethnic group. EDWARD J. BOYER

PLAY TELLS TRAGIC TALE OF TEEN AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERI RAE, Rae is a free-lance writer based in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her voice rising, grief etched into her young face, Angie turns to Rudy and 
cries out, "You don't understand; kids can get AIDS, too! My brother. . . ." 
She lowers her eyes and says softly, "My brother died of AIDS last year." 
</P>
<P>
It is a dramatic moment in a play produced by the Teen Teatro AIDS Prevention 
Project, a division of Avance Human Services. The audience -- teen-agers 
themselves -- reacts with a mixture of tears, thoughtful silence and a few 
embarrassed snickers. But as the word gets out about AIDS, the teen-age actors 
are hearing a lot less laughter from their young audiences. 
</P>
<P>
The play is entertaining all right, but its message -- that even teen-agers are 
at risk of contracting AIDS -- is deadly serious. 
</P>
<P>
The young actors who play Angie, Rudy and other characters speak peer to peer 
about what has all too often been an unspeakable subject in the Latino teen-age 
community -- AIDS. The actors are street-smart and cool. And they speak a 
language that communicates far better than any white-coated doctor lecturing 
with charts and graphs. 
</P>
<P>
The facts about AIDS are sobering. Latinos make up 7% of the U.S. population 
but 14% of the nation's AIDS cases. In Orange County, the incidence of Latinos 
with AIDS is lower than the national average at 12.5% of all reported cases, 
but it rises to 18% in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, 20% of women with AIDS are Latinas, and one in five teen-agers with 
AIDS is Latino. AIDS experts are particularly concerned that Latino youths are 
engaged in behavior that puts them at high risk for contracting the fatal 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Eve Rubell, administrative coordinator of the Avance AIDS Community Outreach 
Service, stated what most parents would rather not acknowledge: "Kids are 
having a lot of sex. They think monogamy is having just one partner for a month 
or two, then going on to another partner." 
</P>
<P>
Rubell said a sizable majority of sexually active teen-agers do not use 
condoms, leaving them in peril of being infected by the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now the number of teens infected with AIDS is not that high," she said, 
"but so many are engaging in high-risk behavior that a sizable number could 
very well become ill in their early 20s." 
</P>
<P>
Janet Martinez of AIDS Project Los Angeles said, "There's a lot of denial going 
on in the Latino community. People don't want to talk about sex so we have to 
come up with creative ways, through theater or education, to do whatever we 
can. The (Teen Teatro) performances are very therapeutic because they create 
awareness about the risks and provide the kids with the information they need." 
</P>
<P>
If Angie's tragic story about her brother does not move the young audience 
watching the play, Rudy's probably will. 
</P>
<P>
He is the cute guy who dates all the girls -- and doesn't believe in using 
condoms or taking precautions. Or there is Christina, a drug user who has shot 
up with shared needles, another AIDS high-risk action. And then there is 
homeboy Joe, who thought it was macho to get a tattoo from a sleazy parlor. But 
now he, like the others, is scared. 
</P>
<P>
Just to make sure Latino youths get the message, each teatro performance is 
conducted in English and Spanish. A bilingual question-and-answer session after 
each performance lets the audience ask the most personal and embarrassing 
questions and get direct, no-nonsense answers. 
</P>
<P>
How effective the teatro is in changing teen-age attitudes toward AIDS is 
difficult to measure, but Rubell believes that the play hits home. "Before 
teens change their behavior, they have to believe they're at risk." 
</P>
<P>
Rubell said the teatro emphasizes that "it does not matter whether you have sex 
with a man or woman, what matters is whether you practice 'safer sex.' Using 
condoms is safer than nothing at all, but it's not 100% safe. Abstinence would 
be safest . . . for preventing the AIDS virus transmission. But if you are 
going to have sex, use condoms." 
</P>
<P>
The teatro program "has been pretty well accepted," she said. "Although some 
Catholic groups haven't wanted us to present it, others have. And there have 
been no negative reactions as far as I know." 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks after a performance at Bancroft Junior High School in Hollywood, 
Principal Peggy Selma admitted, "I was a little apprehensive toward the end of 
the program with all the talk about condoms, but honestly, I have not heard any 
negative feedback -- not from students, the Student Council, not even from 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
Following one recent performance of "AIDS . . . I Want to Know," a 
16-year-old-girl burst into tears. "One of my best friends got AIDS," she 
sobbed. "And when people found out he was sick, nobody would even talk to him. 
If they had seen what we saw today, then maybe he wouldn't have died alone." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Rodriguez, 18, who plays Christina in the play, said, "Many teens 
don't know very much about AIDS because their parents are strict and don't want 
them to know." 
</P>
<P>
But the teen-agers -- and their parents -- have to know, teatro members insist. 
As Angie concludes in a dramatic moment in the performance, "we are talking 
about death and survival here." 
</P>

SOCCER FANS TO ENJOY WORLD CLASS COMPETITION

Good things happen to soccer fans who wait. 
</P>
<P>
In the year of the 14th World Cup, slated for June 8 through July 8 at various 
Italian cities, local soccer enthusiasts will have the chance to watch some 
outstanding international teams. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 20 and 22, the national teams from the Soviet Union, Colombia and Costa 
Rica, plus the Chivas club from Guadalajara, Mexico, will compete for the 
Marlboro Cup at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
On the first night, Colombia faces the Soviets at 7 p.m., followed by Chivas 
against the Costa Ricans at 9 p.m. The losers will meet on Feb. 22 at 7 p.m. 
with the winners vying for the championship at 9 p.m. Advance tickets are $14 
for each night through Ticketmaster agencies or $16 at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, Colombians and Costa Ricans will play in the World Cup. Of the 
trio, the Soviets have the best chance of qualifying for the tournament's 
16-team second round thanks to their grouping with Cameroon, Romania and 
defending champion Argentina, which is one of the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they lose to Argentina's Diego Maradona &amp; Co., the Soviets should 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia, on the other hand, will make only its second World Cup appearance and 
Costa Rica is in the World Cup for the first time. Both countries, however, 
feature some excellent players. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielders Evaristo Coronado and Hector Marchena, and sweeper Roger Flores 
lead Costa Rica, which finished first in the World Cup qualifying group 
involving North America, Central America and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
The South Americans count on the services of midfielder Carlos Valderrama and 
goalkeeper Rene Higuita. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very positive that international teams are coming here. With all the 
Latinos, Europeans and Asians in this area, there's utmost interest," said Luis 
Alberto Bravo, sportscaster at KWKW radio. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to realize that after Italia '90 comes the World Cup of 1994 in the 
United States. All the promotions put together in this country will improve the 
interest of Americans in this sport." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the U.S. team chose not to come to Los Angeles, although it 
played in the Miami Marlboro Cup on Feb. 2 and 4. The Americans will face the 
Soviets at Stanford Stadium on Feb. 24, and will travel to Europe in March. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, of course, is preparing for its first World Cup in 40 years. 
But their stay in Italy most likely will be short. They landed in Group A with 
the powerful hosts, and Austria and Czechoslovakia. Arrivederci! 
</P>
<P>
Key players on the U.S. team include two Latinos, Uruguay-born midfielder 
Tabares (Tab) Ramos and midfielder Hugo Perez, originally of El Salvador. They 
arguably are the two most creative players on the team. Perez, after recovering 
from injuries, scored the only goal against El Salvador in a World Cup 
qualifying match. 
</P>
<P>
Both Perez and Ramos have clashed with the U.S. Soccer Federation over money 
but they remain integral components on the team. Ramos had threatened to ply 
his trade with Leeds United of England but backed off. Perez did go to Europe 
and is reportedly making $100,000 a year with Red Star 93 in France. But he is 
free to fulfill obligations to the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team clinched a trip to Italy with a 1-0 victory over Trinidad and 
Tobago last Nov. 19 on a goal by Paul Caligiuri, who played AYSO (American 
Youth Soccer Organization) soccer in Diamond Bar and for four years at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Those who were hoping to see 1989 Division II women's cross-country national 
champion Darcy Arreola run track for Cal State Northridge this year will have 
to wait. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, from El Cajon, will redshirt the 1990 track season and save the year 
of athletic eligibility for 1991, when Northridge climbs to Division I, the 
competition level for the largest U.S. colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old junior has won Division II titles in the 1,500 meters and twice 
in the 3,000 meters. She tried to make the 1988 U.S. Olympic team in the 1,500 
meters but was eliminated in the semifinals at the trials. 
</P>
<P>
She passed up earlier this month a chance to make the U.S. team for the world 
cross-country championships because of a nagging foot injury sustained in late 
October. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just give her some time," said Northridge track Coach Don Strametz. "Her 
health is more important." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola said she enjoyed the cross-country season last year more than ever, but 
welcomed the hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to it," she said. "I've been competing so much that I need 
a break." 
</P>
<P>
Another college athlete who enjoyed a banner season last year was East Los 
Angeles College running back Adan Avina. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot, 9-inch, 185-pound sophomore, who will turn 20 on Feb. 16, 
established state junior college single-season marks of 1,772 yards rushing and 
2,044 all-purpose yards, and his 18 touchdowns ranked him fifth in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Avina was relegated to the all-state second team, something that did not 
settle well with the former Montebello High School star or East L.A. College 
Coach Al Padilla. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got robbed. That's about it," said Avina, who hopes to pursue a degree 
in business administration and a few more yards on the field at a Division I 
school in the fall.

P.D.Q. BACH TO BRING MUSICAL BAG OF TRICKS TO COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Schickele is the 20th Century's preeminent case of musical schizophrenia: 
two distinct composers forced to inhabit the same person. 
</P>
<P>
The serious Schickele turns out commissions with respectable titles such as 
String Quartet No. 3, "Monochrome VI" and "Dream Dances" for flute, oboe and 
cello. The other Schickele -- who uses the name P.D.Q. Bach -- pens works named 
Schleptet in E-flat, the "Unbegun" Symphony, "Fuga Meshuga" and a full-length 
opera titled "The Abduction of Figaro." 
</P>
<P>
"The only problem with having two personalities is that some people don't know 
that I do serious stuff," Schickele complained. "Not too long ago, I learned 
that a performing group applied to a foundation for a grant to commission a 
work from me. They were turned down because the foundation said that P.D.Q. 
Bach was too commercial. Even when the group informed the foundation that Peter 
Schickele also wrote serious music, they were still unwilling to award the 
grant." 
</P>
<P>
That P.D.Q. Bach is a commercial success, however, is beyond argument. Over the 
past 15 years, this completely mythical son of J.S. Bach (whose more famous 
composer offspring are also universally known by their initials, such as 
C.P.E., J.C.F. and W.F.) has virtually cornered the American market on musical 
parody. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 8 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, the P.D.Q. Bach 
Pick-Up Orchestra (a.k.a. Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra) will play several of 
the more immortal works of P.D.Q. Bach, including the "Howdy" Symphony in D, 
the "Royal Firewater Musick," "Fuga Meshuga" (from "The Musical Sacrifice") and 
Fantasieshtick for Piano and Orchestra. The concert, sponsored by the Orange 
County Philharmonic Society, will be a benefit for the society's youth 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
On the podium will be yet another Schickele persona, Professor Peter Schickele, 
the conductor and musicologist who has "discovered" the lost oeuvre of P.D.Q. 
Bach. Of course, the real Schickele is not really a professor. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it is hard to prove my credentials at the University of Southern North 
Dakota at Hoople," Schickele admitted when pressed by a skeptical reporter. 
"But I taught at Juilliard in the early 1960s," he protested. Although the 
non-professor's university is as bogus as P.D.Q. Bach -- whose dates are always 
given as (1807-1742)? -- Hoople is quite real. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there really is a Hoople, a town of 400 located northwest of Grand Forks, 
N.D., near the Canadian border. Once, when I played a concert in Grand Forks, I 
was presented with the key to the city by the mayor of Hoople." No doubt the 
key opened both doors there. 
</P>
<P>
Schickele attributes his primary inspiration to the American musical humorist 
Spike Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"I was introduced to the recordings of Spike Jones at the age of 9 or 10. In 
fact, my brother and I would lip-sync his records and even did this as 
entertainment for Kiwanis Club lunches." He also credits as influential the 
early recordings of England's zany Hoffnung Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Schickele's earliest forays into the strange world of P.D.Q. Bach occurred 
during his college years, while he was at home in North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
"In the summer of 1953, I was home from Swarthmore College, where I was a 
student. Some friends and I were fooling around with tape recorders, and three 
of us made a recording of one of the Bach Brandenburg Concertos. They played 
all the strings parts, and I played all the wind parts on bassoon two octaves 
too low, something that sounded rather like mud wrestling. The next week I came 
up with a piece called the 'Sanka' Cantata. Although I don't clearly remember 
whose idea the name P.D.Q. Bach was, my buddie Ernie Lloyd's mother claims her 
son came up with it." 
</P>
<P>
When Schickele taught at Juilliard, he and his colleagues would give an annual 
concert of his musical parodies under the baton of Jorge Mester. In 1965, 
Schickele made his professional debut as P.D.Q. Bach at New York's Town Hall, 
and the rest is demented history. 
</P>
<P>
If Schickele is known for his pun-filled titles, crude sight gags and on stage 
pratfalls, he is quick to point out the serious craft behind his P.D.Q. Bach 
compositions. 
</P>
<P>
"For all its ineptness," he said, "the secret weapon in my P.D.Q. Bach writing 
is solid construction and musical ideas interesting enough for someone to 
listen a second and third time. After all, once you know the punch line, you 
know the joke. A P.D.Q. Bach piece needs more than a good joke to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Philharmonic Society will present a program of music by 
P.D.Q. Bach at 8 tonight) at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town 
Center Drive, in Costa Mesa. The concert will benefit the Society's youth 
programs. Tickets: $10-$30, with premier benefit tickets at $125 (includes a 
post-concert reception at the Center Club with the artists). Information: (714) 
646-6277.

A CLUE TO THE ARTIST'S FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: A FRANKENTHALER RETROSPECTIVE OPENS SUNDAY AT LACMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artist Helen Frankenthaler's mystique seems to be partly based on staying out 
of the limelight. Among art world insiders, she is almost as well known for 
living a privileged, quiet life on Manhattan's Upper East Side as for her 
lyrical abstract canvases. But since last June, when Frankenthaler's 
retrospective exhibition opened at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, she 
has been in the public eye almost constantly. 
</P>
<P>
The traveling exhibition, which opens at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art 
on Sunday, set off an avalanche of profiles and reviews in newspapers and 
magazines. The 61-year-old artist has also turned up in less predictable 
forums. As a member of the National Endowment for the Arts advisory council, 
she responded last July to the controversy over Robert Mapplethorpe's and 
Andres Serrano's work by advocating "quality control." In a New York Times 
commentary, Frankenthaler took the unpopular position of worrying that the 
council might have begun to "spawn an art monster" while "endorsing 
experimentation." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, photographs of a youthful Frankenthaler and accounts of her 
associations with New York School artists cropped up in a controversial new 
biography on Jackson Pollock by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. And the 
February issue of Art &amp; Antiques magazine features Frankenthaler cheerfully 
posing in a Rolex ad. 
</P>
<P>
Has la grande dame, arguably America's most famous living female artist, let 
down her guard? Probably not. In Los Angeles for the opening of her show at 
LACMA, Frankenthaler was very much the well-bred, immaculately groomed woman 
who is unfailingly polite while measuring what she says to the press. She 
formed sentences slowly, answered questions concisely and almost never picked 
up an invitation to expand on any particular point. 
</P>
<P>
Painful as this public process may be, Frankenthaler seems to suffer none of 
the tyranny that is often attributed to artists' retrospectives. "I don't think 
a retrospective is a finality, it's a summing up, an opportunity to see where 
you have been and where you will go from there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed both with my first retrospective, at the Whitney Museum of American 
Art in 1969, and the current one that I made many discoveries. They had to do 
with the continuity of my painting but they also gave a clue to things that 
could be developed further." 
</P>
<P>
This second retrospective opened a full 20 years after the first, and 
Frankenthaler is already looking forward to the third. "I hope there will be a 
next one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest daughter of Alfred Frankenthaler, a New York State Supreme Court 
judge, Frankenthaler attended the Dalton school in New York, where she studied 
with Mexican painter Rufino Tamayo, and Bennington College in Vermont. As a 
young painter in New York, she was championed by the influential critic Clement 
Greenberg, with whom she was romantically involved. Later married to painter 
Robert Motherwell, she forged a distinctive identity and has never wavered from 
her course. 
</P>
<P>
Frankenthaler's "soak-stain" abstractions of the early '50s are considered a 
link between Abstract Expressionism and the color-field movement of the '60s. 
Picking up on Pollock's energetically dripped paintings, she began to pour 
pigment on her canvases and let it soak into the fabric, creating soft-edged 
bursts of pastel color. 
</P>
<P>
Frankenthaler's retrospective at the County Museum of Art includes about 40 
works done between 1952 and 1988. The show begins with her most famous early 
painting, "Mountains and Sea" (a pale 1952 work that looked like a paint rag to 
some observers but impressed critic Greenberg and artists Kenneth Noland and 
Morris Louis as a breakthrough), and ends with the ominously dark "Casanova" of 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
In an era when art changes almost as often as clothing styles, Frankenthaler 
seems unconcerned about being up-to-date. Securely rooted in Abstract 
Expressionism, the style that established American art on an international 
stage, she values a historical view of art. "Young artists should have an idea 
of the importance of Abstract Expressionism, just as I should have a sense of 
my heritage. I think the importance of Abstract Expressionism has to be a major 
consideration in where art went from there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As for where she thinks art actually has gone, Frankenthaler is diplomatically 
silent, saying only that much current work is "fashion." She also prefers not 
to expound on the artists and works that influenced her. "Paintings speak for 
themselves, the good ones," she said, then ticked off a list: Pollock, 
Motherwell, Noland, Louis, David Smith, Anthony Caro, Adolph Gottlieb, "early 
Willem de Kooning" and "certain paintings" by Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, who supported these artists' work, is a great critic, Frankenthaler 
thinks. "Everything he has written is extremely valuable, and it is written in 
such a way that will hold up well into the future. You can't say that about 
very many writers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Naifeh's and Smith's biography of Pollock takes a dissenting view of Greenberg. 
"I haven't read the book thoroughly, but I think it is unfortunately dedicated 
to entertainment rather than factual history. I always slightly cringe at the 
idea that Van Gogh, Gauguin and now Pollock are material for mega-movies. They 
should be represented by their best work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Frankenthaler retrospective will be at LACMA through April 22, then travel 
to the Detroit Institute of Art, June 11 through Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit appearance doubtless will call for another round of interviews, but 
Frankenthaler has her mind on other projects now. She recently signed three new 
prints produced at Tyler Graphics in Mount Kisco, N.Y., an April show of her 
recent works of paper is scheduled at Manhattan's Andre Emmerich Gallery and 
she is working on a catalogue raisonne of her graphics that she hopes to 
complete in 1991.

LAURIE ANDERSON OPTS FOR A CREATIVE HOUSECLEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine you're driving across New Mexico when out in the middle of nowhere you 
come across a fish hatchery. You go in to see the facility, and there working 
at the spawning pool is Laurie Anderson. That's right. Laurie Anderson. The 
spiky-haired New York multimedia performance artist. 
</P>
<P>
It's just the kind of what's-wrong-with-this-picture story Anderson often tells 
in her high-tech pop performance pieces. But this was almost a true story. 
</P>
<P>
"I was out in New Mexico recently and I realized it was the only place in the 
world I really felt comfortable," Anderson said by phone recently from her New 
York digs. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this gigantic sky, this 180-degree sky. And I passed this fish 
hatchery, and I smelled this smell I hadn't smelled in years -- kind of Canada 
and little rotten docks and coffee and my grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
"I headed in there and realized it was just fish. And I followed the game 
warden around all day and he said, 'There's a job opening here.' I said, 'What 
do you need?' He said, 'A high school diploma.' I said, 'I got that!' And I 
almost signed on." 
</P>
<P>
But not quite. Anderson is still a member of the performance crowd. Her latest 
piece, "Empty Places," will be presented at the Wiltern Theatre on Sunday 
through Wednesday and at San Diego's Symphony Hall on Thursday, with a special 
Roxy show on Saturday previewing the run. 
</P>
<P>
She's still traveling in the same gadget-laden, audiovisual territory she's 
occupied from her breakthrough 1982 debut single "O Superman" to her five-hour 
mid-'80s "United States of America" extravaganza. But the new show, like her 
latest album "Strange Angels," reflects the changes in her outlook that nearly 
lead her to a fishy life. 
</P>
<P>
The moment of truth came several years ago while she was working on her concert 
movie "Home of the Brave." Approaching 40 (she's now 42) and having achieved 
the oxymoron state of being an established avant-gardist (her Warner Bros. 
recording contract "runs into the 21st Century," she says), Anderson found 
herself in a creative and personal rut. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I learned you should never take that many pictures of yourself," she 
said. "Once, in the editing, we were on a freeze frame of a close-up of me and 
I thought I should shoot myself if I ever had to look at me again. After that I 
threw a lot of things out of my house and thought I should start over. It was 
quite a process." 
</P>
<P>
A creative housecleaning took place at the same time, as Anderson reevaluated 
both her own talents and her role in the art world. 
</P>
<P>
"I got shamed into taking singing lessons," she said, explaining how on 
"Strange Angels" she has moved away from her trademark sing-speak delivery -- 
often with electronically altered voice -- into a more melody-based song 
format. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working on one song I've never released that sounded too much like 
something you'd hear on the radio," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The backup singers had done their parts and I stepped to the mike to do the 
lead. It was a song I'd written myself so you'd think I'd have thought about 
this, but I started thinking, 'I have no idea what to sing.' I could either 
just talk like usual, or else learn a few things about singing. It's not like I 
now think of myself as a singer, but it's like I have a new instrument. It's 
odd performing like this. Singing is a vulnerable thing to do. You have no 
buttons to push." 
</P>

Part of the inspiration for opening up to this vulnerability came from a chance 
encounter with German film director Wim Wenders while he was writing his 1988 
movie "Wings of Desire," a fantasy about an angel wishing to be human. That 
influence is reflected directly in the title and recurring references on 
Anderson's new album, in which angels are welcome-but-mysterious house guests 
(and sometimes housecleaners). 
</P>
<P>
"We spent some time in Berlin talking about angels," she said. "Once they got 
into this record, I couldn't get them out. They kept flapping into the songs." 
</P>
<P>
More significant, though, was another personal revelation. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last couple of years I started thinking maybe I'm not an artist at all, 
but a thinly disguised moralist," she said. "The art I really like are things 
that help me live my own life in a better way. I know that's not an incredibly 
avant-garde thing to say . . . but I guess I'm more interested in that than the 
next logical move of the avant garde. 
</P>
<P>
"I am on the other hand terrified of being preachy," she continued, "though 
there is a song on the album that is an advice song, called 'Ramon.' And that 
was hard. I can barely run my own life, so why would I tell anyone else? But 
there are a couple things I wanted to say, simply, that if the problem is this, 
just do that. I have this reputation of being all technology, but there's more 
that I want to show." 
</P>
<P>
That facet, Anderson says, is a focus of "Empty Places," which was premiered in 
October at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. 
</P>
<P>
"Like a lot of people, I napped through the Reagan years," she said. "Coming to 
and looking around is an amazing experience, and this work is trying to 
describe that, but in a much more personal way than in the past. . . . It's a 
solo performance, which with me means there are eight other people involved, 
dancing and stuff, and big screen projection. But no musicians other than me." 
</P>
<P>
The Roxy show will be even more personal. 
</P>
<P>
"That will be much more casual, more a talk with video, not all the big 
screens. I'm really looking forward to that . . . mostly because I want to talk 
about a few things that are a little harder to do in the full show. Like I'm 
interested in the obscenity law, and in clubs it's a chance for a different 
kind of contact with people. . . . There's some odd audience participation to 
it -- not sing-along, though. We'll see how it works." 
</P>
<P>
It's about as close as we're likely to see Anderson doing the kind of solo 
acoustic show a number of rockers have ventured recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep thinking the next thing I'm going to do is going to be acoustic," she 
said. "But it doesn't work out like that. I just love gadgets. I think, 'I'll 
keep it simple this time,' but then, 'Oh! This makes it more simple to use this 
gadget.' Maybe I'll go acoustic someday. I just kind of make this up as I go 
along anyway."
