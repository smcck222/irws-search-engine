For Don James, the football coach at the University of Washington, recruiting 
high school players in Los Angeles can be an exciting experience. 
</P>
<P>
He was recently meeting with the family of one prep star in South-Central Los 
Angeles when several gunshots rang out down the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than maybe on a hunting trip I don't think I've ever heard gunshots 
before," James said Thursday from his campus office in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the shoot-out, James added, "I read in the newspapers that the 
incident involved Todd Bridges," the former star of the television show, 
"Diff'rent Strokes," who was arrested and charged with attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
And the student that James was recruiting? 
</P>
<P>
"He signed with us," the coach said. "I guess he wanted to get out of town." 
</P>
<P>

While historians generally agree that the 16th President was born Feb. 12, Cal 
State Northridge won't observe the occasion until Dec. 29. You'd think an 
educational institution would get the date right. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, this bit of revisionist history is intended to shift some holidays to 
days that school personnel generally take off anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people take the last week of the year off," explained one Northridge 
official. "So we just decided to make it a five-day holiday and close the 
campus." 
</P>
<P>
And what a week it promises to be for Northridge employees, with Christmas 
scheduled for Dec. 26, followed by Columbus Day (Dec. 27), Veterans Day (Dec. 
28), and the birthdays of Lincoln (Dec. 29) and Washington (Dec. 30). 
</P>
<P>
The employees might have to take the next week off just to recover from all 
those activities. 
</P>
<P>
Stop by sometime after work," wrote members of UCLA's Tau Kappa Epsilon 
fraternity to their famous brother. 
</P>
<P>
Such a visit would have been inconvenient when he was laboring in Washington. 
But Ronald Reagan is in Century City now, so he dropped in on the Westwood frat 
house Thursday afternoon and brought the members an autographed jar of red, 
white and blue jellybeans. 
</P>
<P>
During the 35-minute visit, the former President regaled his listeners with 
tales of the fun he used to have in the town cemetery when he was attending 
Eureka (Ill.) College. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said he would "lie down on a favorite tombstone and look at the stars." 
Occasionally, "I'd blow my TKE whistle," he continued, and from the answering 
whistles, he could tell there were plenty of other TKEs in the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Reagan goes from UCLA fraternity brothers to Mother Teresa. 
</P>
<P>
A Reagan spokesman said the Nobel Peace prize-winner will journey to Century 
City to thank him for his efforts to achieve world peace. 
</P>
<P>
"How to Strip for Your Lover" is just one of the courses offered locally by the 
Learning Annex, which calls itself a "life-enhancing" adult-education program 
and leaves its catalogues at restaurants all over town. 
</P>
<P>
"We specialize in classes not found elsewhere," director Donna Sher said at the 
firm's branch office in West Los Angeles. Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"How to Strip" is a one-time, three-hour class that costs $24. It's offered to 
women only, a fact that so far has apparently escaped the attention of attorney 
Gloria Allred, the equal-rights champion. Other courses include, "50 Ways to 
Tie a Scarf" ($19), and "Past Life Regression," offered at a flat rate of $27, 
no matter how many past existences you've had. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, some smart aleck in the East would have to say it after snow fell in 
parts of Los Angeles County this week.

REDUCING TAXES ON CAPITAL GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just found the time to throughly study the income tax return form for 
1988. The first thing that I discovered was that there is a 33% tax bracket 
that was not included in the estimated tax form that I used during the year. 
Next I learned that the 33% bracket applies only to taxable incomes between 
$71,900 and $149,250. Above $149,250 the tax rate goes back to 28% plus the 
loss of personal exemptions. It is an obvious concession to the very wealthy 
such as those people who are making hundreds of millions on leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
On top of this our President wants to reduce the capital gains even further. 
All this while the economic conditions of low-income people continue to 
deteriorate. The tax schedule emphasizes that no matter how many "tax reforms" 
occur, the very wealthy retain their advantage.

REDUCING TAXES ON CAPITAL GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The column by Rep. Don J. Pease ("Back Into the Thicket With Bush; Capital 
Gains Break Would Undo Fairness of Tax Reform," Op-Ed Page, Feb. 1) attacked 
President Bush's capital gains tax reduction proposals. How can people bemoan 
our nation's low rate of savings and still support taxing savings and 
investment? What kind of sense does it make to allow tax deductions for debt, 
and yet tax savings? 
</P>
<P>
When Rep. Pease (D-Ohio) raises the "fat cat" argument, trying, like his 
party's recent presidential candidate, to create antagonism for the wealthy, he 
displays his true colors. We all know that the poor do not save. Clearly, 
middle-class wage earners, living from paycheck to paycheck, do not save or 
invest. How do we get our nation's saving rate higher without increasing the 
benefits and incentives for saving, not consuming, income? 
</P>
<P>
Those who save are by definition wealthy enough to have the income to invest. 
Such savings are with after-tax income -- that is, already-taxed money. It is 
the investment and savings of the "fat cat" wealthy which create jobs for the 
rest of us. Does taxing these savings and investment returns seem like a 
helpful incentive to consume less and save more? 
</P>
<P>
Debt is tax deductible. What the "tax reform" act of 1986 did was to raise the 
value of debt related to housing, reduce the deduction for consumer debt and 
raise the tax on savings and investment from 20% to 28%. That was a 40% 
increase in taxes on the kind of thrift which leads to future savings and 
investment! 
</P>
<P>
The real problem is that politicians want to control the savings and investment 
of our nation -- target it, so to speak -- making them more powerful and 
capable of dispensing favors to the political action committees who pay for 
their reelection.

In his column, Danziger rebukes colleges and universities for encouraging 
insincerity in the youth of America when they write their college application 
essays. 
</P>
<P>
Danziger muses, "What would happen if someone just wrote what he or she was 
thinking?" Well, here's the start of an essay that's not at all phony, one that 
Danziger might like. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to 
know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my 
parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David 
Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to 
know the truth."

A DISTURBING BACKDROP FOR CONVENTIONAL ARMS TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST CONINE, Ernest Conine writes a column for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A member of the West German Parliament, visiting in Los Angeles recently, was 
asked by American luncheon companions to comment on complaints in this country 
that the European allies are not carrying a large enough share of the burden 
for their own defense. His response was blunt. 
</P>
<P>
"I am tired of hearing that if West Germany doesn't do this or that, the United 
States will withdraw its troops," he said. If America wants to withdraw its 
forces, it should go ahead and do so. 
</P>
<P>
Other West Germans at the meeting, sponsored by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, 
hastened to say that the Bundestag member does not reflect the Bonn 
government's views on defense issues. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, however, participants in a NATO seminar in Munich heard 
similar words from Rupert Scholz, the West German defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
Objecting sharply to U.S. "reproaches" on burden-sharing, he said that they 
could result in "indignation against the American ally" and a rethinking of 
German commitments to the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The growing U.S.-German frictions form a disturbing backdrop to preparations 
for a crucial new round of East-West talks aimed at deep cuts in conventional, 
non-nuclear forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
There is a broad and growing weariness in West Germany with what is seen as an 
outmoded U.S. predominance in German affairs. 
</P>
<P>
It is reflected in public demands for a reduction or even an elimination of 
low-level practice flights by NATO warplanes after recent crashes in which 
German civilians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
It is also reflected in trade frictions and high-level resentment at overt U.S. 
pressures on Bonn to crack down on West German companies that provided 
materials and know-how for a chemical-warfare facility in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is a staunch ally who welcomes the fresh breezes from 
Moscow but believes that a stable and peaceful Europe will require a strong 
American military presence into the indefinite future. 
</P>
<P>
Probably most West Germans still support NATO membership, but the foundations 
of that support are visibly eroding. Recent polls indicate that 75% of the West 
German public believes that the military threat has ended, up to 80% want all 
nuclear weapons removed from Europe and a large minority now favors a 
withdrawal of U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
This mood, coinciding with budgetary pressures in Washington, will make it hard 
for the alliance to maintain the unity that is badly needed in the 
conventional-arms talks. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush must get a handle on the huge U.S. budget deficit. The 
impression is growing that he will accept, albeit reluctantly, the necessity of 
large cuts in projected defense outlays. 
</P>
<P>
The American military commitment to Europe -- where more than 340,000 U.S. 
troops are stationed -- will inevitably come under review. However, significant 
reductions would be risky unless the Soviets are willing to make even deeper 
cuts in their numerically superior forces. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced plans in December for a 
unilateral reduction of 500,000 troops, plus cuts of 10,000 tanks, 8,500 guns 
and 800 combat aircraft in Eastern Europe and western parts of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Allied governments, although delighted by the promised cuts, have jointly 
observed that even after the unilateral reductions occur the Warsaw Pact will 
have more than a 2-1 advantage in weapons most suited for an assault on Western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if a negotiated reduction of U.S. troops is to take place, the Soviets 
must make deeper cuts than we do. Gorbachev had appeared to agree, but the 
latest pronouncements from Moscow reflect the Soviet military's stand that 
asymmetries favoring the Soviet side are already offset by asymmetries in the 
Western favor. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's interests in force reductions seems real, however. Just the other 
day he told his people that cutbacks in military spending are essential to 
solving Soviet economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
There is ample evidence that the Soviet military believes that Gorbachev indeed 
intends to make deep cuts -- and is uneasy over the prospect. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the way may be open for negotiated reductions that will allow Bush to 
safely reduce U.S. outlays for European defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin, however, may be sorely tempted to stonewall in the expectation 
that the West will make reductions anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and the Bush Administration itself may not be able to wait for 
successful negotiations before reducing U.S. military outlays in Europe. West 
Germany, especially, is in no mood to take up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
It seems, then, that the best hope lies not in Western steadfastness, which may 
not exist, but in the domestic economic pressures on Gorbachev to get on with 
shifting resources away from the Soviet military. 
</P>
<P>
Those pressures are real. We might luck out. But relying too much on another 
country's altruism is a chancy business -- especially when you consider that 
the survival of Gorbachev and his policies is far from a sure thing.

MEXICO STEELS ITSELF FOR HARD-LINER U.S. ENVOY; 
</P>
<P>
APPOINTMENT OF NEGROPONTE FUELS SUSPICION ABOUT INTERVENTIONISM IN NAME OF 
SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SERGIO MUNOZ, Sergio Munoz is the executive editor of La Opinion, Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that was bold, and perhaps clever, President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari this week accepted John D. Negroponte as the next U.S. ambassador to 
Mexico. The move was bold because Negroponte's nomination had not even been 
officially announced, much less confirmed. It may have been clever if, in doing 
so, Salinas got the upper hand over another challenge from his political 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
When the rumor of Negroponte's promotion began circulating in Mexico City, the 
left demanded that Salinas reject him. His reputation as an accomplished 
interventionist had preceded him, and he was considered a threat to Mexico's 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas was put in a most uncomfortable position as the press and some in his 
own party -- even some in his own cabinet -- joined in the cry of "Yankee, stay 
home!" Rejecting an ambassador is seldom done. Yet if Salinas accepted 
Negroponte without complaint, he would be accused of being soft by his own 
supporters, and he would be savagely attacked by his opposition as a "yes-man" 
to U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
To further complicate things for Salinas, the Negroponte dispute arose at the 
worst possible time, just when the debate on how to reformulate relations with 
the United States was taking place within the inner circles of the government. 
</P>
<P>
For three months a honeymoon of sorts had developed between both of the 
incoming administrations. At least that was the impression on the Mexican side. 
From Salinas on down, all of the officials who traveled to Houston to meet with 
President-elect George Bush returned optimistic, believing that there was good 
will in Washington to understand and help Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Houston, Mexico was working toward less confrontational, friendlier 
and more "businesslike" relations with the United States. It was within this 
spirit that the designation of Fernando Solana Morales as foreign minister and 
Gustavo Petricioli as ambassador to Washington were to be read both in Mexico 
and in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The popular perception in Mexico -- until the affair of the infamous border 
ditch -- was that the United States would help to alleviate the burden of the 
debt, which would mean economic recovery and the end of the political turmoil 
that has kept the government party preoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
Then, along comes Negroponte, and word of his hawkish past sends chills 
throughout the nation, raising again the question of the United States' 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
Negroponte's record, indeed, proves him to be a man of unbending 
interventionist zeal. He was the junior diplomat who argued that the United 
States had a moral commitment to support South Vietnam at any cost; the 
negotiator who criticized the abilities of his boss, Henry Kissinger, 
considering him ineffective in dealing with the North Vietnamese; the 
career-minded diplomat who went to Honduras to run the Contras and became the 
proconsul of that country; the security-council official who was instrumental 
in denying assistance to Nicaragua when it was devastated by Hurricane Joan 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
These are, however, only the factual highlights of a productive career in 
gunboat diplomacy. There are also assumptions and questions that his nomination 
raises. 
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that Negroponte's career is so tied to security issues, the 
first question is whether national security is the Bush Administration's main 
concern regarding Mexico. Security in this instance has to do with the private 
armies of drug lords traveling back and forth between both countries; with 
massive immigration from Central America to Mexico and from there to the 
States; with unprecedented signs of political instability in Mexico; with a 
climate of growing social unrest due to an increase in criminal activity. In an 
interview with The Times Wednesday, CIA Director William H. Webster expressed 
concern about unrest in Mexico and said that it would receive "far more 
attention . . . than in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Looking at Salinas' cabinet appointments, one would swear that both 
administrations share the same concerns about security, although each will 
approach the possible solutions separately. The question is whether Negroponte 
will be the best man to stand in the middle when the bilateral interests come 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Many times it has been said that Mexico needs as U.S. ambassador someone with 
direct access to the centers of power in Washington. Negroponte knows how the 
State Department, the White House and Congress work. Therefore, the theory 
goes, he could work out good deals for Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as John Gavin's tenure showed, good access to Washington can be 
doubled-edged: Gavin helped to advance some of Mexico's positions regarding 
debt relief, but he proved to be a formidable adversary in the case of the U.S. 
drug-enforcement officer murdered in Mexico. Much of Mexico feels that Gavin's 
direct access to President Reagan caused a drug war of words, to Mexico's great 
disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Negroponte, the Mexicans fear him more because of his reputed 
intelligence and efficiency; they seem to think that he is capable of 
destabilizing the country. Strangely enough, they see themselves as fragile as 
Honduras, which, with all due respect to the Hondurans, is not at all the case. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the whole problem springs from two very different perceptions of 
international relations. The United States is accustomed to using its military 
and its money to influence other governments. Mexico believes firmly in 
nonintervention. The United States plays its power game in global terms; Mexico 
digs into its past to defend itself by reviving fears. 
</P>
<P>
The Negroponte affair will force Mexico to accept the rules of the game in 
international relations as it is now played: Nothing is off-limits, and 
interventionism in the affairs of others often cannot be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
One can only hope that this will lead to a formulation of a Mexican foreign 
policy that defines the national interest without a reference to the past and 
with pragmatism for its goals -- not crying foul at every turn. Yes, Negroponte 
is the personification of interventionism, and Mexico should learn to live with 
him, control him and use him for its own benefit.

With the world's attention now focused on the future of the Middle East, it is 
long past time to honor one of the greatest acts of statesmanship in the recent 
history of that troubled region: the role of President Jimmy Carter in securing 
the 1978 Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Camp David would not have been possible without the efforts of the 
heroic Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, and the gritty Israeli prime minister, 
Menachem Begin -- efforts that were quite fittingly honored by the 1978 Nobel 
Peace Prize. But Camp David would not have been successful without the 
extraordinary personal labors of Jimmy Carter, whose invitation to Camp David 
broke a negotiating logjam and who refused to take failure for an answer during 
12 long days of bargaining at the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
There is now a tendency to deprecate the achievements of Camp David. These 
criticisms seem to me wrongheaded. It is true that the Camp David accords did 
not solve the Middle East problem in any distinctive way. It is true that the 
Palestinian issue continues to plague the region. It is true that radicals like 
Hafez Assad of Syria and Saddam Hussein of Iraq remain as unreconciled as ever 
to peace. But why blame these on Camp David? 
</P>
<P>
Instead of looking at the problems that remain, why not look at what was 
accomplished? After Camp David a major Middle East war, on the models of 1967 
and 1973, was far less likely. After Camp David an unprecedented pattern of 
normal diplomatic relations was established between Israel and one of its Arab 
neighbors. After Camp David Israel exchanged land, a lot of it strategic land, 
for peace. After Camp David it was possible to think that unending conflict 
between Israel and its neighbors was not a given, like the sun rising in the 
east. These were not mean accomplishments. In fact, they were great 
accomplishments. And they were Carter's accomplishments as much as any man's. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all the current argument and commentary about the peace process in the 
Middle East, there are two lessons of Camp David that ought to be borne in 
mind: 
</P>
<P>
First, the agreements reached there followed a negotiation that was itself made 
possible by a changed political situation: Agreement requires negotiation, and 
negotiation requires politicking. You just can't start cold with negotiations 
and expect much of anything to happen except rhetorical cannonading. Sadat's 
stunning mission to Jerusalem in 1977 and Carter's invitation to Sadat and 
Begin to come to Camp David under the President's auspices were acts of great 
political imagination that broke logjams, changed the political environment and 
made negotiation possible. Defining similar acts of political imagination -- 
instead of arguing about spurious international peace conferences -- ought to 
be the first order of business for the Bush Administration, the new Israeli 
government of Yitzhak Shamir, the leadership of the Palestinian movement and 
King Hussein of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Second, American leadership was essential in dramatically altering the 
political relationships among negotiators so that negotiation would be not only 
possible but also successful. For reasons that seem to have involved a 
fascinating amalgam of religious conviction, personal self-confidence, a trace 
of recklessness about his own political hide and sheer American stubbornness, 
Carter simply would not let the Camp David negotiation fail. An American 
President constantly looking over his shoulder at a carping press corps and a 
fiddling Congress could never have pulled off Camp David. Carter took the 
burden of power onto his own shoulders, and the results were historic. 
</P>
<P>
It is no secret that I had, and still have, the most serious differences with 
Jimmy Carter about America's role in world politics. But I would be less than 
honest if I, as one of Carter's critics, did not acknowledge his most signal 
foreign-policy accomplishment: his leadership in securing the Camp David 
accords. And I might suggest that the Nobel committee consider redressing a 
historic injustice by awarding its 1989 peace prize to the man who made the 
1978 Nobel Prize to Sadat and Begin possible: the 39th President of the United 
States, Jimmy Carter of Georgia.

ROBBINS SEEKS NEW HEARING ON VAN NUYS AIRPORT PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.W. McGARRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) has asked Caltrans to reopen a hearing on a 
vital state permit for Van Nuys Airport to investigate charges by an anti-noise 
activist that Los Angeles city lawyers misled him into supporting the permit's 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office denies the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins sent a letter to the state Department of Transportation last month, 
asking the agency to reopen the hearing into the city-owned airport's variance, 
which allows the facility to operate without meeting state noise-control 
limits. Like almost all major airports in the state, Van Nuys Airport could not 
remain open without a variance because it is impossible to meet the law's noise 
standards, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesmen said that the department has not decided what to do about 
Robbins' request but that no such hearing has ever been reopened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bad-Faith Accusation 
</P>
<P>
Robbins acted after Don Schultz of Van Nuys, president of Ban Airport Noise, 
accused the city attorney's office of acting in bad faith, misleading him 
during negotiations for an agreement that cleared the way for the variance's 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz has refused to sign his part of the agreement, leaving the issue 
unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz and leaders of other San Fernando Valley homeowner groups demanded a 
public hearing on the variance in 1987, urging Caltrans to impose stricter 
noise controls on the airport in exchange for the permit's renewal. The city 
Department of Airports resisted. 
</P>
<P>
But a state administrative law judge conducted a trial-like hearing at which 
the city, Caltrans and the anti-noise forces led by Schultz presented 
arguments. In July, the judge recommended to the head of Caltrans, which has 
final authority on variances, that the variance be granted with 10 
noise-fighting conditions attached. 
</P>
<P>
One condition was an order to rezone a residential neighborhood south of the 
airport, containing 26 homes and 151 apartments, to industrial and commercial 
use. The aim was to bring the airport closer in compliance with the law 
limiting airport noise in residential neighborhoods by eliminating the 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fight Promised 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office, arguing that the state has no authority to mandate 
changes in city zoning laws, asked Caltrans to reconsider the order and 
promised to fight the issue in court if Caltrans persisted. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Caltrans attorney Larry Thelen hammered out a compromise with the 
Department of Airports. The airports department agreed to eliminate the mandate 
on rezoning and also promised to "use its best efforts" to persuade city 
officials to rezone the land. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, representing the "intervenors" who requested the hearing, in turn 
agreed to the dropping of the judge's recommendation that the airport be 
forbidden to take any action that could increase its "noise footprint," the 
zone in which noise exceeds the limit for residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative, Schultz said, was the prospect of a legal battle between the 
city and the state that probably would have lasted five years or more, in which 
time the variance would have been automatically extended without any of the 
judge's noise-limiting recommendations in effect. 
</P>
<P>
When the reworded agreement was sent to him for his signature, however, Schultz 
refused to sign. 
</P>
<P>
He charged that the city attorney's office had concealed knowledge that a 
proposed office development at the airport by the Retlaw Corp. would increase 
the "footprint." The development will include hangar space for up to seven 
private jets. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz maintained that the city attorney's office was guilty of bad faith for 
not disclosing that information to him before he agreed to drop the provision 
barring increases in the noise footprint. He would not have agreed to the 
stipulated settlement if he had known, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office, in a reply to Caltrans, said Schultz had taken part 
in a number of debates on the Retlaw plan and was well-informed on the subject. 
The city also argued that the anticipated noise from planes at the Retlaw 
hangar will add only 3.3 acres to the 549-acre footprint, an increase of .6%, 
which the city calls insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans now has several choices, said Thelen, the Caltrans' attorney: 
</P>
<P>
"We could honor the city's request for reconsideration of our July order, or we 
could go ahead and amend the order in accordance with the stipulation on the 
grounds that we don't agree with Mr. Schultz that he was fraudulently induced, 
or we could decide that the facts are sufficiently in doubt that we could go 
along with Sen. Robbins' request for a hearing."

CAMARILLO WOMAN ARRESTED; 
</P>
<P>
5,000 THREATS SENT TO STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Camarillo woman has been arrested for allegedly sending an estimated 5,000 
notes to actor Michael J. Fox threatening to kill him, his wife and their 
unborn baby, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Marie Ledbetter, 26, who works as a Westlake Village shipping clerk, was 
arrested last Friday on suspicion of making terrorist threats after 
investigators were able to trace the anonymous notes to her, spokesman Al 
Albergate said. 
</P>
<P>
Albergate said the notes had been arriving steadily at studios where Fox worked 
and at public relations agencies that represented him since February, 1988. 
Some were mailed in letters, and others were mailed in packages. 
</P>
<P>
"They were spread out pretty evenly over a year's time," Albergate said. "I 
haven't read all 5,000. Basically, they have the same theme. She threatened to 
kill him and his wife and their unborn baby." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
July Marriage 
</P>
<P>
Albergate said Ledbetter is apparently a fan of Fox, 27, the star of the 
television show "Family Ties" and such films as "Back to the Future" and 
"Bright Lights, Big City." She apparently became upset when Fox began dating 
actress Tracy Pollan and then married her in July, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted him to go back to an old girlfriend," Albergate said. 
</P>
<P>
After the actor's representatives and the studios began to receive the 
threatening notes last year, Fox hired a private investigator who in turn 
alerted the district attorney's office in September, Albergate said. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us awhile to track down the author," Albergate said. 
</P>
<P>
Albergate would not release details on how the notes were connected to 
Ledbetter other than to say that some of the packages were traced to the 
shipping office where she worked and that evidence contained in some of the 
letters was then used to determine who mailed the notes. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say what that evidence was or to identify where Ledbetter works. 
Ledbetter, who was released after her arrest on $100,000 bail, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Ledbetter is not expected to be charged until next week, Albergate said. Under 
state law, she could be charged with either a misdemeanor or a felony, which 
could carry a penalty of up to three years in prison.

JUST JACK; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL WRITE-IN CANDIDATE SAYS LESS NAME IS MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the beginning there were only two of them: Fabian and Dion. Then came other 
famous single-namers, such as Cher and Madonna. Now make way for Jack. 
</P>
<P>
Jack is the irrepressible Jack McGrath, a political consultant running as a 
write-in candidate in the Los Angeles City Council's 5th District. In a move 
that has sent election officials scurrying for a legal opinion, McGrath says he 
wants to jettison his last name and be formally known strictly as Jack. 
</P>
<P>
"I think single names are catchy," McGrath said. "It's like Gov. George 
Deukmejian. Everybody knows him as Duke. With me, it will just be Jack." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, 43, has already hit the streets with his campaign theme. As he extends 
his hand to 5th District voters riding buses, walking and eating in 
restaurants, McGrath is confidently proclaiming: "Jack is back!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simplicity's Appeal 
</P>
<P>
McGrath said he will highlight the single-name gimmick throughout the campaign. 
The North Hollywood resident, who is running against his former boss, 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, said the simplicity of one name appeals to the 
"street people" who are the target of his grass-roots campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take street power over institutional power any day," McGrath said. 
"There's a lot of that spirit alive. No one has tapped it, but I will." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Giles, the assistant chief of the city's elections division, confirmed that 
McGrath is seeking one-name status in the election. Giles said he has forwarded 
the request to the city attorney's office for a legal opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Giles could not recall another instance in which a write-in candidate used a 
single name. He also could not say when the city might issue a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's purely up to the city attorney's office at this point," Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Failed to Get Signatures 
</P>
<P>
McGrath entered the council race as a traditional candidate but was 
disqualified Saturday when he failed to get the 500 signatures needed to 
qualify for the ballot. McGrath blamed himself, saying he had trusted others to 
collect signatures. The idea of running as a write-in candidate came shortly 
afterward, McGrath said, as he sat on the beach considering his options. 
</P>
<P>
"I did some real soul-searching," McGrath said. "And I realized I could do a 
better job this way. There's only one Jack who's a write-in candidate." 
</P>
<P>
The filing deadline for write-in hopefuls in the April 11 City Council primary 
is March 28. If McGrath is allowed to run as a single-name candidate, his 
backers will be able to vote for him by writing "Jack" on their ballots. 
Presumably, they would also have the option of scribbling his full name. 
</P>
<P>
But Yaroslavsky's campaign manager, Karin Caves, said she doubts that many 
voters will do either. "This is a guy who couldn't even get 500 voter 
signatures to support him," Caves said. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, however, is approaching the unlikely campaign with self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The former Yaroslavsky campaign manager and deputy, who made a name for himself 
in political circles with his flair for publicity, has proclaimed himself the 
people's candidate. As have Yaroslavsky's other opponents, Westwood activist 
Laura M. Lake and traffic consultant Ryan Snyder, McGrath has pledged that he 
would fight for a better quality of life in 5th District areas, such as 
Westwood, Beverly-Fairfax, Sherman Oaks and North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath is campaigning full time and plans to produce a cable television 
advertisement stressing his single-name theme. He also has a new campaign theme 
song, called "In the Streets," by newcomer Ivan Neville. 
</P>
<P>
"I play it all the time," McGrath said. "I love people in the street."

SOVIET SCHOLARS' CHARM WARMS YOUNG FRIENDS; 
</P>
<P>
VISITORS OFFER ADVICE TO PUPILS IN STOP TO DEDICATE EXHIBIT 
</P>

<P>
Mikhail S. Gorbachev isn't the only Soviet citizen who can charm an American 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday eight Soviet scholars -- as charismatic as their premier -- smiled, 
talked and sang their way into the hearts of about 500 students during a 
two-hour visit to Viewpoint School in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't look like Russians, they look like grandparents," 5-year-old Justin 
Marangas said of the Soviet academics, who are in Los Angeles for the opening 
of a Museum of Natural History exhibit on nomads of the Eurasian steppes. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet visitors acted like grandparents too -- lavishing hugs, kisses, 
gifts and friendly advice on the students. 
</P>
<P>
"You must study good," Rudolf Its, director of the Soviet Academy of Science's 
Institute of Ethnography, admonished a ninth-grade biology class during a tour 
of the school. "Your future and our future is in your hands. Come study at my 
university. There is a difficult exam to come, but I'll help you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advice to Students 
</P>
<P>
"All of us should have a good knowledge of history," Vladimir Basilov, also of 
the institute, advised the student body in perfect English during an assembly. 
"History repeats itself again and again, and the better we know history, the 
better we can arrange our lives." 
</P>
<P>
When presented with gifts and school medallions from students, the Soviet 
visitors were unabashedly affectionate, turning students' handshakes into big 
bear hugs. The professors delighted the audience by singing a popular Russian 
children's song for peace and by giving solo performances of regional folk 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at the suggestion of Basilov, all joined in a boisterous round of "When 
the Saints Go Marchin' In." At the end, the Soviet visitors presented school 
officials with a painted porcelain samovar, a traditional Russian urn used to 
boil water for tea. 
</P>
<P>
Students at the private school, who range from kindergarten through grade 12, 
were exuberant after the assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Alona Berger, a seventh-grader whose mother and grandmother are Russian 
immigrants, said she was thrilled by her opportunity to welcome the guests in 
their native tongue. "It was really neat but really scary," she said. "I was 
shaking the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
Most students, however, said they were excited because it was their first 
experience with "real Russians." 
</P>
<P>
"They were so nice, so kind," said 12-year-old Rebecca Ba'Gah. "We hear these 
bad things, but they are good. It was neat to have Russians and Americans 
together, united." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Occasion for Tears 
</P>
<P>
Kristin Lane, a 12-year-old seventh-grader, said she was so overwhelmed by the 
visitors' warmth that she cried. "It was so nice that we could be friends and 
appreciate each other." 
</P>
<P>
For the Soviet scholars, the outpouring of affection appeared to come 
naturally. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that I can find the words to explain how happy we are," Basilov 
told the students. "It is so nice to find that we, the Russians, and you, the 
Americans, can be together, can coexist as good friends." 
</P>
<P>
The visit seemed to demonstrate that despite cultural and political 
differences, some things are universal. 
</P>
<P>
Irina Semashko, also an ethnographer, noted that "our children are like 
American children, very gay and very hospitable -- especially the small ones. 
Even the uniforms are similar, the same color." 
</P>
<P>
"I must say that your boys and your girls are the same as my grandsons and my 
granddaughters. The youngest, yes, and the oldest, well, they like those rock 
groups," Its said, shrugging.

CAPTIVE CONSUMERS;

COLD CASH BLOWS INTO CASTAIC WITH THE SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In Castaic, there's no business like snow business. 
</P>
<P>
When surprisingly fierce winter weather closed the Grapevine on Interstate 5 
and stranded hundreds of truckers and motorists in Castaic on Wednesday, money 
snowed down on Castaic's merchants like the white flakes that blanketed the 
Santa Clarita Valley. Sales of hamburgers, burritos, hot cocoa and coffee were 
as fast as a good bobsled ride. 
</P>
<P>
But by Thursday, after the California Highway Patrol announced that the 
Grapevine would remain closed at least through today, almost all the truckers 
and motorists headed south to find other routes. In one day, Castaic slumped 
from boom town to ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
The drastic change in fortune came as no surprise, Castaic merchants said 
Thursday. Over the years, they said, they have developed a love-hate 
relationship with the snow that, falling on the Grapevine, can fill or drain 
their cash registers each winter. 
</P>
<P>
The Grapevine, as described by the CHP, is a mountainous stretch of I-5 that 
winds like a grapevine roughly from California 138 through Gorman and down into 
Kern County. The unincorporated community of Castaic is the last haven for 
truckers before Gorman, 25 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
When the snow temporarily blocks the Grapevine -- say three or four hours -- it 
traps drivers in Castaic just long enough to encourage them to shop or eat, 
merchants said. If the snow stays too long, as it did Thursday, it drives the 
customers away. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, merchants said, they appreciate the snow. A good road closure can help 
a small business survive until summer, when thousands of weekend tourists 
descend on the town and nearby Lake Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody prays for snow," said Debra Johnson, a cashier at a Castaic 
7-Eleven. "We do look forward to the closures." 
</P>
<P>
Business boomed at the store Wednesday. It ran out of 12-ounce coffee cups and 
completely sold out of hot cocoa mix. "We sell out of everything that can keep 
people warm," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Foster's Freeze next-door, workers brewed seven pounds of coffee 
Thursday morning for motorists who had slept in their cars overnight, said Lupe 
Calderon, restaurant manager. On a typical morning, she said, the restaurant 
brews only two pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Supplies -- except for pastrami -- held out well, Calderon said. Those who 
couldn't get pastrami at the Foster's Freeze apparently walked over to the 
7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday at 7-Eleven, a lone pastrami sandwich sat next to a handful of 
burritos and sandwiches in the refrigerated display case. 
</P>
<P>
The store still had plenty of Slurpee mix, however. "That doesn't tend to sell 
in the snow," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a good snow closure," said Gerald Barnes, owner of a Radio Shack. 
Barnes said he rented 500 videos on Wednesday, roughly one video for every 10 
Castaic residents. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Barnes, Wednesday happened to be "Dollar Day," when he rents 
out videos for a buck rather than the customary $2. " 'Dollar Day' killed all 
the profit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday was good," said Tara Mistry, manager of the Subway sandwich shop, 
speaking of Wednesday's business. "We had the locals because they were 
trapped." 
</P>
<P>
But by Thursday afternoon, the Subway was deserted.

ON BEHALF OF CYNTHIA GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been in my heart to speak on behalf of Cynthia Jeter Green in the death of 
her mother, Virginia Jeter, who had Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know Cynthia or her possible personal problems, but I do know that 
caring for an Alzheimer's patient at home can be completely crazy-making. 
</P>
<P>
My own mother progressed from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's and went to live with 
one of my sisters, who surprised us all by suddenly dying after 3 1/2 years 
from the demands of that and her job combined. At that time, we didn't know how 
life-sapping it was either. After we lost her, I retired from my job in 
California to go back to the Midwest to help with Mom for the next four years. 
Mother lived with another sister, also working as well. Mom finally passed 
away, and the heavy burden left us -- but in varying stages of disintegration 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
I came back to California and spent a year in and out of doctors' offices and 
in and out of bed. Finally I feel I have regained enough normal energy to 
continue my own pursuits again. The second sister, now also retired, is still 
undergoing care for the stress syndromes induced by this impossible task. 
</P>
<P>
You may ask, "Why not a nursing home?" Before the Parkinson's became evident, 
Mom broke her hip and spent some time in a nursing home. She and both sisters 
were appalled at the casual but serious neglect patients endure (how can they 
receive complete care?) and they promised Mom never to subject her to this. 
</P>
<P>
So we did some of the work and hired a nurse and took whatever benefits 
Medicare could provide. We had a full-time nurse from the start -- the full 
eight years -- and provided the evening and weekend care ourselves. Although 
two sisters always tried to share the work, it still took over their/our lives. 
</P>
<P>
It's almost suicidal. Both your body and brain suffer. The patient does her 
best but can't swallow and so doesn't eat or messes in the clean diapers or 
urinates all over the bed so you have to get up in the middle of the night to 
change it. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the daily washings of the dirty linen and clothes, the shopping 
for easy foods, the grinding and serving of fresh foods through a plunger 
arrangement because she cannot chew, and the patience you must try to hang onto 
when it takes two hours to feed and give medications four times a day. You have 
to forswear any social life whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently Cynthia Green didn't have anyone to share these duties and not even a 
job to pay for the hygienic necessities. Perhaps it all caught up with her, and 
so she just gave up and let it all flow over her. And now they call it homicide 
because of neglect, even though she accepted the responsibility of taking her 
mother in and gave up her own freedom. 
</P>
<P>
For those who sit in judgment, may I say I hope it happens to you, only so you 
get understanding. As for me, my sis and I have decided if and when either of 
us comes to the point we know it is definitely in our future, we shall go out 
by our own hand instead of inflicting this suffering either on our loved ones 
or ourselves. This degree of sacrifice is too punishing, even for Mother 
Teresa. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck, Cynthia!

BURBANK IN THE SMOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The picture with the article "Smog-Ridden Burbank to Study How to Cut Car Use" 
by Greg Braxton (Jan. 12) speaks for the smog-saturated downtown Burbank. Here 
we see, in one picture, four RTD smog-producing buses. The city of Burbank 
should now realize that light-rail vehicles are long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
It is virtually impossible to "cut the number of single-car trips," as the city 
fathers suggest. The only way to cut emissions feeding smog is to go with 
cleaner energy, and that includes reducing the bus fleet and replacing heavily 
traveled lines with light rail. 
</P>
<P>
All the money that has been used just in rail studies could have provided the 
whole Los Angeles mega-opolis with a super-transit system to the benefit of 
all.

LIGHT RAIL IN L.A. COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eventually the goal for Los Angeles County should be a light-rail line on each 
side of every freeway. No bus system should monopolize a freeway lane, which in 
the end defeats the purpose of the freeway! 
</P>
<P>
The cost would not be as great as condemning and buying new land for rail 
routes since land already exists! 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, just off the freeways in the Valley, as in other areas, are office 
buildings and many shopping centers. North Hollywood, Sherman Oaks, Van Nuys, 
Reseda, Tarzana, Woodland Hills and Canoga Park would be centers where most 
people work or shop. 
</P>
<P>
I remember the Red Car -- Chandler Boulevard and up Van Nuys. Today you're 
going to have people against such an old Red Car route! It would also serve 
less people! 
</P>
<P>
Just follow the freeways with light rail!

STUDENTS SHOW A REAL INTEREST IN THEIR ANIMATION CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His fingers moving rapidly over the computer keyboard, Musa Mustafa "sketched" 
a hat on the screen and maneuvered it onto Gumby's head as a visiting Soviet 
animator shook his head in delight. 
</P>
<P>
Fedor Khitruk, president of the Union of Soviet Animators, was tickled again 
when Mustafa, selecting from a computer display of colors, created green eyes 
for a cartoon alien. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to take this toy," Khitruk said finally. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the glare of movie lights and the high-tech wizardry of the video, 
sound and film-editing equipment surrounding him recently, Khitruk wasn't 
touring a Hollywood studio. Instead, he was in a high school classroom in 
Rowland Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the teen-agers' productions are anything to dismiss lightly. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last decade, animation students at Rowland High School have produced 
more than 1,000 films and won about 50 international prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Six Rowland animation students brought back prizes from this year's 
International Student Media Festival in Dallas, the 10th consecutive year the 
school has won first-place awards in that competition. Last summer, three live 
half-hour shows produced at the school, featuring sights and activities in 
Rowland Heights, were aired by local cable television stations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coaches 200 Students 
</P>
<P>
Animation teacher Dave Master coaches 200 students at the high school, and four 
other teachers instruct 125 students at elementary and junior high schools in 
the Rowland Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Students from throughout the district, as well as graduates of the program such 
as Mustafa, 21, gathered at the high school for the visit by Khitruk and 
Czechoslovakian animator Jan Svankmajer, who were in Los Angeles last month for 
the third annual Los Angeles Animation Celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Through an interpreter, Svankmajer answered questions after a screening of his 
surrealistic work. 
</P>
<P>
A vignette featuring two tongues aroused plenty of curiosity. Real pig tongues 
were used, Svankmajer said, with wires inserted in them to make them more 
lifelike. Some students giggled or said "Ugh." 
</P>
<P>
"For every (camera) take," Svankmajer said, "we had to bring a fresh tongue 
from the slaughterhouse because they deteriorated very fast." 
</P>
<P>
Rowland Unified's animation program was created single-handedly by Master, who 
joined the district as an art teacher 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Master assigned an animation project to his art class at Rincon 
Intermediate School as "just something to try out." With one camera, the 
students made a 10-second film that combined drawings, paper cut-outs and clay. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, his students' works were praised at a Los Angeles film 
festival. District officials let Master start teaching animation full time, 
then encouraged him to move to Rowland High to develop a more in-depth program. 
In 1984, he won the California School Board Assn.'s "Golden Bell Award" for 
excellence in education. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Master helped develop animation classes in the district's other 
schools, conducting workshops and sharing equipment with fellow teachers. 
Today, he said, Rowland Unified is the only school district in the country that 
offers animation classes beginning with the elementary grades. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teaching Workshops 
</P>
<P>
Several students have transferred from other high schools to Rowland to 
continue studying animation. In response, Master has begun conducting animation 
workshops for teachers in other districts, said district Supt. Sharon Robison. 
</P>
<P>
Through film festivals and competitions, Master has developed close ties with 
professionals in the field who have donated sophisticated equipment as well as 
their time to share tricks of the trade with his students. 
</P>
<P>
Master was president of the Los Angeles Student Film Institute for four years 
and has served for seven years on the Education Commission of the International 
Animated Film Society. 
</P>
<P>
An early supporter, Bill Littlejohn, an animator for "Peanuts" and "Garfield" 
cartoons, described the Rowland students' works as remarkably sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Better Every Year' 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's thrilled to see them," said Littlejohn, who often judges at film 
festivals. "They have good gags, and they get better every year." 
</P>
<P>
June Foray, the voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel in "Bullwinkle" cartoons, 
often visits Master's students to give them tips. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very gratifying that he starts teaching them early," said Foray, who gave 
the animation program its first recording unit. 
</P>
<P>
Atari Educational Action Research Group has donated a $10,000 video-camera 
animation system, and Apple Computer Inc. has given the program three rooms of 
sound recording and mixing gear. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Master's 200 high school students can work with more than $800,000 worth 
of animation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Master's classroom looks more like a large workshop. Boards bearing the titles 
of award-winning films and star-shaped pieces of wood with the student 
producers' names adorn the walls. Current students hammer and saw to build sets 
ranging from dollhouse-like homes of plywood to cardboard mountains and painted 
rivers. 
</P>
<P>
A wall-sized sheet of fiberglass, spray-painted black, provides a backdrop for 
space movies. "Starlight" from fluorescent tubes shines through holes drilled 
in the sheet. Hanging nearby is a planet improvised from an abandoned lamp 
shade. 
</P>
<P>
In other rooms, students edit film and sketch cartoons: 90 drawings for each 10 
seconds of film. 
</P>
<P>
In sound studios, students select from a wide range of prerecorded sounds, from 
the roar of a jet to human screams. They can also create their own effects with 
synthesizers, which can stretch or compress any given sound. 
</P>
<P>
Another room houses a haphazard array of cameras, goose-neck lamps and 
miniature sets. Clay figures star in the films made here, painstakingly shot 
frame by frame as their tiny limbs are moved by fractions of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
Because each frame lasts only one-eighteenth of a second, the figures, on film, 
seem alive and moving. This process is called claymation, the art that brought 
Gumby and the singing California raisins to life. 
</P>
<P>
Students plan how the character should "move" and at what pace, what camera 
angles to use, and what expression the character should have. Often, multiple 
heads are created for each character because the originals tend to melt in the 
heat of movie lights, said 11th-grader Matt Manning, who won second place among 
10th- to 12th-graders at this year's International Student Media Festival. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30-Minute Cartoon 
</P>
<P>
"When you do it yourself, you see how much work goes into a 30-minute cartoon," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
For his two-minute depiction of a snorkeling adventure, Manning spent two 
months building his set, often working after school. He stuck clay fish onto a 
glass sheet that he moved in front of the camera for a realistic underwater 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Master's 15-year-old son, Brian, combined claymation and live acting in his 
story of a boy horrified by creatures that pop out of a book. The youth is 
finally sucked into the pages and trapped. The work won third prize in the 
ninth-grade category at the same festival. 
</P>
<P>
All the students learn quickly that making an animated movie takes time. 
</P>
<P>
"With beginners, the titles are twice as long as the film," said Master, whose 
students average one film a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the character would fall over, and we would have to control 
ourselves, make sure we didn't smash him," confessed student Mike Lorge. 
</P>
<P>
He and classmate Stephen Wood came in third among the 10th- to 12th-grade 
entrants at the festival with a claymation fantasy about a monster that escapes 
from a TV set. To prevent their figure from melting, "After shooting we would 
stick him in the fridge," Lorge said. 
</P>
<P>
Master sees his class as an opportunity to experiment with a variety of art 
forms and a painless way to learn technology. 
</P>
<P>
Some graduates have gone on to become professionals. Mike Belzer worked on the 
Gumby series for a year. George Wong has helped make children's movie specials 
with puppetry and animation effects that have aired on ABC and HBO. 
</P>
<P>
Many other alumni continue to pursue their hobby with a passion. 
</P>
<P>
Mustafa created a laser show last year using computer animation for a college 
project. He remembers scratching film while looking through a magnifying glass 
to create the illusion of laser beams when he was in Master's class. 
</P>
<P>
A part-time Apple Computer employee for two years, Mustafa is working on an 
animated version of the David Letterman show during his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Samples Won Job 
</P>
<P>
Former student John Ramirez, 21, said his animation samples from Master's 
classroom probably netted him his job with Battaglia Associates, an Irvine 
company that designs theme parks all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, who won 34 animation awards as a student of Master's from age 12 until 
he graduated from high school, has just completed some costume designs for a 
parade at the Tokyo Disneyland. He was also on a team of 12 that designed an 
amusement park for Lotte World, an entertainment complex in Seoul, South Korea, 
due to open in April. 
</P>
<P>
For a dinner show on the Lotte project, he designed 15 robotic birds -- each 
will cost $25,000 to construct -- that will perform like those in Disneyland's 
Tiki Room. He also designed the floats, costumes and props for a parade that 
will wind through the park. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez said that in his work, "character design is the big thing, and that I 
learned in the animation class: what makes an appealing character."

BRUINS' BURRIDGE CHECKS SLUMPING KINGS WITH 3 GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As part of a checking line assigned to stop Wayne Gretzky, Boston's Randy 
Burridge put on a memorable offensive show. 
</P>
<P>
Burridge scored three goals for his first National Hockey League hat trick and 
assisted on another Thursday night as the Bruins beat the slumping Kings, 4-1, 
for Coach Terry O'Reilly's 100th career victory. 
</P>
<P>
Burridge got his first career hat trick as goalie Reggie Lemelin, playing in 
his 400th NHL game, had 18 saves, including a spectacular dive to stop Gretzky 
on a third-period breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins outshot Los Angeles, 32-19, in extending their home record against 
the Kings to 11-0-1 since Jan. 24, 1981. In their last 10 games overall, the 
Kings are 1-7-2. The loss dropped the Kings into third place in the Smythe 
Division, one point behind Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I was lucky, particularly on the third goal that hit me and went into 
the empty net," said Burridge, who is in his second full NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy Brickley was covering Gretzky most of the time and that enabled Greg 
Johnston and I to go two-on-two a lot down low," Burridge said. "It worked out 
very well. I'm really happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a hat trick with the Bruins, so I never think of things like 
that. Then, after the second goal, I thought things were going my way. It 
turned out they certainly were." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston also scored while Gretzky, covered by Ken Linseman and Craig Janney at 
times on multiple shifts, managed just three shots on goal while going 
scoreless for only the fifth time in 54 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Boston played better than us," said Steve Kasper, traded by the Bruins to the 
Kings on Jan. 27. "Boston played a game I know they're capable of playing. They 
forechecked really well, and they really limited our offensive chances." 
</P>
<P>
Lemelin, beaten for six goals in the NHL All-Star Game Tuesday night, was on 
the verge of handing Los Angeles its first shutout of the season. However, his 
bid for his 10th career shutout was spoiled by John Tonelli's score midway 
through the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli took a pass from Doug Crossman, skated down his left wing, eluded a 
Boston check and fired his 28th goal past Lemelin. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Johnston took the puck from goalie Glenn Healy behind the net to set up 
Burridge at 4:03 of the first period. Johnston passed to Burridge, who scored 
his 14th goal into an empty net. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins made it 2-0 as Johnston tipped in a pass from Burridge for his fifth 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli pulled the Kings to within 2-1 at 10:49 of the third period, but 
Burridge struck back less than 3 minutes later, sending a 15-foot shot over 
Healy's glove. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after Healy had been pulled for a sixth skater, Burridge got his third 
goal when John Carter's shot deflected off his skate into an unguarded net.

TOROS NIP RIVERSIDE, TIE FOR LEAD

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills put an end to its shooting slump Thursday night and 
with it the short-lived reign of UC Riverside as the No. 1-ranked Division II 
team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The 18th-ranked Toros made eight of their first 11 field goal attempts, blew a 
14-point second-half lead, then clawed back in a physical game to upset the 
Highlanders, 72-67, in overtime, before a standing-room-only crowd of 955. 
</P>
<P>
The victory avenged a 59-58 loss to Riverside and pulled the two clubs into a 
first-place tie in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. It also snapped 
Riverside's 18-game win streak, which was one shy of the CCAA record it set in 
1982. The teams are 8-1 in conference play. Riverside is 19-3 overall, 
Dominguez Hills, riding the crest of a seven-game winning streak, is 16-6. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Blackmon, who missed a 17-foot jumper with nine seconds to go in their 
first meeting, a shot that would have handed Dominguez Hills the victory, iced 
the game Thursday night with two free throws in the final five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills, which had shot only 41.3% from the floor in its last five 
games, blistered the nets in the first half, making 15 of 22 attempts. Not only 
did the Toros outshoot the top-ranked Highlanders in the first 20 minutes, but 
Dominguez Hills out-rebounded them, as well, 13-9. 
</P>
<P>
For the game the Toros made 61% of their field goal attempts (26 of 43). 
</P>
<P>
UCR's inability to make free throws in the overtime cost its national ranking, 
which it had held for just two weeks. The Highlanders missed four charity 
tosses to open the period and made just three of eight attempts. Dominguez 
Hills countered by hitting eight of nine. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for nearly 10 minutes of the second period Dominguez Hills could not buy a 
field goal as Riverside went on a 15-3 scoring spurt that knotted the game at 
51 with 6:33 left. 
</P>
<P>
From that point on the lead changed hands or was tied 10 times before 
regulation ended, 60-60, sending Dominguez Hills into its fourth overtime game 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills grabbed a 65-60 lead on a pair of free throws by Robert 
Barksdale and a 3-point play by Blackmon. Riverside cut the lead to 65-64 with 
1:53 left on a pair of free throws by Chris Ceballos. 
</P>
<P>
Despite nine turnovers, Dominguez Hills took a 37-30 halftime lead. A 3-point 
basket by Riverside guard Chris Jackson tied the score at 12 with 13:40 to go, 
but the Toros took a 16-12 lead on a basket by Derrick Clark with 11:35 to go 
in the half. Dominguez Hills upped its lead to 22-16 at 8:21 when Blackmon 
grabbed his own miss and put in a layup. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Viera scored five consecutive points for the Highlanders to cut the Toro 
lead to 22-21 with 6:43 left. 
</P>
<P>
But Barksdale retaliated with five consecutive points to spur a 15-9 run that 
closed the half. In all, the 6-1 sophomore guard scored nine points in the 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-foot base-line shot by Clark and a 3-point basket by Blackmon opened a 
42-30 Dominguez Hills lead in the first minute of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside 65, Dominguez Hills 44 -- The Highlander women (7-15, 2-5) avenged an 
earlier loss and dropped Dominguez into the CCAA cellar. The Lady Toros (6-14, 
1-7) got within 10 points with 11 minutes to go. Guard Devon Akita (13 points) 
was the only player for Dominguez Hills to score in double figures. Center 
Khyra Anderson had 16 rebounds.

The regular season winds down for Valley-area wrestling teams in the Southern 
Section on Saturday when the Marmonte, San Fernando Valley, Frontier, Del Rey 
and Channel leagues hold their league tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
The league championships are decided by a combination of tournament results, 
which account for half, and league dual meet standings. 
</P>
<P>
A league-by-league analysis: 
</P>
<P>
MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Westlake High clinched the league title with a victory over Camarillo on 
Wednesday and will be the favorite in the tournament at Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Hunter and Neil Mason, a transfer from Agoura, lead the Warriors in the 
175- and 145-pound classes, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Farzin Daneshnia (112), Brad Miya (119), Shawn Valance (138), Darrell Valance 
(165) and Dave Schumm (191) also could contend for league titles. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park is the only league team to beat Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers boast Chris Kilbane, the defending 4-A Division champion at 145 
pounds who is 34-0 at 154 pounds this season. Kevin Mabry (105) and Jeff Jay 
(heavyweight) also will be forces. 
</P>
<P>
Perennial power Channel Islands has a team that offers such contenders as T. R. 
Merickel (98), Val Barajas (105), Chris Corpuz (112), M. T. Merickel (132) and 
Chris Whitmore (191). 
</P>
<P>
Others who could make an impact include Robin Song (105), William Cardinos 
(126), Bryan Ha (138) and Charlie Verhoven (154) of Simi Valley; Jim James 
(119) and Zach Achen (165) of Camarillo; and Sean Toner (165) of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"Westlake has the best chance," Newbury Park Coach Marty Maciel said. "They 
have a real good tournament team." 
</P>
<P>
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Harvard finished 4-0 in league dual meets and will be the team to beat Saturday 
at Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
"We have at least one good wrestler in every weight class," Harvard Coach Lew 
Roberts said. "I'd like to see a lot of champions, but I feel it will be very 
close." 
</P>
<P>
At 126 pounds for the Saracens, senior John Lee was undefeated in league 
matches and 21-3 overall. Robert Rhodes (18-0 at 154), Kevin Newman (28-3 at 
175) and Rick Farrell (15-6 at 191) are keys to Harvard's title hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes and Newman probably will face Chaminade wrestlers who have beaten them 
in the past. Justin Stark beat Newman last season and Felix Goodson twice 
defeated Rhodes last year. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany features Marc Brazo (145) and defending league champions Chris Carmona 
(119) and Adam Wardlow (132). 
</P>
<P>
FRONTIER LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
In one year, Fillmore went from a winless league season to a dual-meet league 
championship. The likes of Jaime Valdez (heavyweight) and Jeremy Hernandez 
(112) make the Flashes a good bet to also win the tournament, which will be at 
Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Gutierrez (126) leads Moorpark, and Steve Baer (105), Mike Matthes 
(heavyweight), Brian Bengelsdorf (138) and Adam Kuklin (126) could make 
contenders of a young Agoura team. 
</P>
<P>
CHANNEL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa has perhaps its best shot ever at dethroning Dos Pueblos, which has 
won or shared 13 consecutive league championships. 
</P>
<P>
Robby Cook (132), Wyatt Anderson (145) and Tony Flores (191) are among the 
Spartans' outstanding wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
DEL REY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-place Crespi hopes to upset Bishop Amat, which was undefeated in league 
dual meets.

A TUMBLING SPORT; 
</P>
<P>
GYMNASTICS IN THE CITY SECTION APPEARS HEADED FOR EXTINCTION DESPITE THE 
HEARTFELT EFFORTS OF MONROE COACH LES SASVARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gymnastics at the high school level in Los Angeles and many other parts of the 
nation is going the way of the dinosaur. The sport is briefly pumped back to 
life every four years when the Olympians come tumbling into America's living 
rooms between TV commercials, but as soon as the Games end, so does the 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
There are 49 high schools in the Los Angeles City Section, for example, but 
only six will organize gymnastics teams this season, which begins March 9. 
</P>
<P>
And Les Sasvary of Monroe High, who has tried harder and accomplished more for 
high school gymnastics than anyone else in Los Angeles for more than two 
decades, is fighting the urge to slam someone's head against a pommel horse as 
he watches the slow death of the sport that has been his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced we've reached the end of the gymnastics era in the L. A. 
schools," he said. "It's very disappointing. There has been nothing done to 
save the sport. I'm afraid there will be no more program at all next year. 
We're down to six schools now, and if a couple more drop it, then it's all 
over. It makes me angry." 
</P>
<P>
The anger comes because Sasvary has lived and breathed gymnastics since the age 
of 13, when he was a boy in Eger, Hungary, a town 100 miles northeast of 
Budapest. His love for the sport carried him to a university in Budapest, where 
he learned the sport from some of the world's best teachers. It also brought 
him the honor of being the youngest member of the 1956 Hungarian Olympic 
gymnastics team. 
</P>
<P>
But it also led to great disappointment when, under the threat of a national 
revolt against hard-liners in the country's ruling Communist Party, the 
gymnastics squad was pared to two members and Sasvary was left home. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, when Hungary did rise up in protest -- one quickly and violently 
squashed after the government called in the Soviet army -- the pull of 
gymnastics brought Sasvary across the Austrian border and eventually to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be in the Olympics and I thought I could maybe make it in the 
United States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He never did. After finishing 11th in the national championships, which helped 
determine the Olympic team in 1960, Sasvary turned to coaching. He moved with 
his wife from Ohio to Los Angeles and got a job teaching at Wilson High. Four 
years later he was transferred to Monroe and began putting a gymnastics program 
together. He also started the school's soccer program in 1978 and now coaches 
two high school teams. 
</P>
<P>
In 21 years at Monroe, Sasvary's gymnastics teams have won 10 City 
championships. Sasvary has produced individual champions as well, including 
Steve Malis, who became a Pacific-10 Conference standout for USC; Phil 
Gonzalez, a former All-American at the University of New Mexico; and David 
Mariel, who has had a brilliant career at UCLA. Under Sasvary's direction, 
Mariel became the only gymnast in City history to win all seven events in the 
individual championships. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the glory days seem to be fading. 
</P>
<P>
"The old-timers have gone and the new ones don't have the knowledge or the 
desire for the sport," said Sasvary, 55. "And then there's the liability 
factor, the chance of injury in this sport. If not taught properly, it can be 
such a dangerous sport. Administrators are pretty anxious to get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
Hal Harkness, commissioner of the City Section, said that administrators do not 
want to end gymnastics. But he did agree with Sasvary that the sport in the 
City schools may be on its way out. 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely not true that administrators are trying to get rid of 
gymnastics because of any liability problems," Harkness said. "From my 
perspective, there has been absolutely no pressure, overt or covert, regarding 
decisions on gymnastics and liability. That is simply not a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is coaching. We are just not getting people with the background or 
people willing to get the background. It's an extremely technical sport and you 
don't just walk out and coach it. And as the number of teams decline, then the 
number of people who compete and form gymnastics backgrounds diminishes. It's a 
bad cycle." 
</P>
<P>
A cycle that Harkness said has left the sport in a precarious position. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly all of our remaining gymnastics coaches are veteran people, closer to 
retirement than the start of their careers," he said. "There is a real danger 
in the next few years of having no coaches and, thus, no gymnastics program at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"If the program is terminated, it will be because of insufficient interest and 
the number of coaches, not because of any decision by the City Section. When it 
becomes impractical -- and we are very close to that now -- then it will go. We 
want to do everything to keep it going, but we're right on the edge now. With 
only six teams, any additional attrition and we just can't have a league 
anymore. Then, gymnastics will be gone." 
</P>
<P>
And so will the area's most accomplished gymnastics coach. 
</P>
<P>
Sasvary's success long has been noted by national officials. He was selected as 
a judge for the 1972 Olympics in Munich and judged the finest gymnasts in the 
world again at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. In 1978, he was elected vice 
president of the U.S. Gymnastics Federation and oversaw the national gymnastics 
program for five years while he continued coaching at Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
Often, the lure of a bigger arena for his talents tugged at him. But always, he 
resisted. The problem, he said, was a simple one. His position as teacher and 
coach at Monroe paid more than most college gymnastics jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had several chances to coach at universities, but the problem was always 
money," he said. "Universities, particularly those in the California system, 
kept offering me jobs with a 10% pay cut from what I was making. That was not 
possible. I have a family. 
</P>
<P>
"I once aspired to that, but I don't think I'd consider it anymore. I will 
retire in five years. My chances were there, but now I think I'll finish up 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Sasvary said that the reason for his success as a coach was always obvious to 
him: He knows the sport more intimately than most coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"The background is very important," he said. "I was a competitor and made it to 
the Hungarian Olympic team. And also, there was the education in the sport. I 
went to the university of Budapest for gymnastics and studied with the best 
teachers in a place where gymnastics was the major sport. My background and 
education in Hungary always gave me a big advantage over coaches in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Sasvary said, he was shocked to see the lack of interest in 
gymnastics in the United States. But gradually, he said, he was able to find a 
few youngsters who didn't think of the sport as tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not as many of them as there are in Hungary and most other European 
nations, but always there were a few who were willing to work, willing to make 
the sacrifices this sport demands. I set my standards very high as a coach, and 
I found kids who wanted to make the sacrifices. I didn't get every kid 
interested in gymnastics, but the ones I got I knew were serious about it." 
</P>
<P>
No one has been more serious about it than the intense Sasvary. But as a 
lifetime of gymnastics starts to wind down, the fatigue from more than 20 years 
of battling apathy toward the sport sometimes shows. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes now I think that maybe I've had enough. Sometimes it can get 
tiring," he said. "I still enjoy being with the kids and seeing their progress. 
And I still like to win. Winning is not everything, but it's almost everything. 
That has always been a big motivator for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy winning."

REDELL TALKS TO WESTLAKE ABOUT OPEN FOOTBALL JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just three weeks after announcing his retirement from coaching, Bill Redell, 
the former Crespi High football coach, may be back in business. 
</P>
<P>
Redell has talked with Westlake High Athletic Director Bob Fisher about the 
Warriors' vacancy and a decision could be reached as early as next week. Fisher 
made it clear that Redell is not the only candidate -- former Crespi assistant 
Jim Benkert also is under consideration -- but the Warriors apparently would 
welcome Redell with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be outstanding for Westlake High," Fisher said. "He's an 
outstanding coach and a great motivator. He's well-known in the community and 
would help our football program expand." 
</P>
<P>
Redell, a Westlake Village resident who works as an insurance salesman, would 
be hired as an off-campus coach who would not teach. His position would be 
similar to the one he held last season at Crespi, in which he ran the football 
program but had time to run his insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to see whether he can afford to take time out from his insurance 
business and have time to run the whole program like he did at Crespi," Fisher 
said. "It is almost certain we'll have a walk-on coach and we can't afford to 
shut any doors. We're not looking at just one person." 
</P>
<P>
Redell, who declined comment on the Westlake job, coached five years in two 
stints at Crespi and compiled a 43-16-1 record. During his second term at 
Crespi, he inherited an 0-9-1 team in 1984 and won a Southern Section 
championship two years later. Redell coached for two seasons in the now-defunct 
United States Football League between stops at Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
Benkert has been an assistant at Crespi since 1982 and applied at Westlake 
after the Celts hired fellow assistant Tim Lins last month as Redell's 
replacement. Benkert said that he would not coach next season as an assistant 
-- either for Lins at Crespi or Redell if he gets the Westlake job. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be a head coach," Benkert said. "If I don't get a head coaching job, 
I'll go back to college and work on my master's degree."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
DIMINUTIVE CALDERON BEGINS TO SIZE UP POTENTIAL COLLEGE CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exactly how far can a 5-foot-8 point guard expect to extend his basketball 
career? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to go to college," Marnie Calderon of Burroughs said. "But the 
letters haven't been coming." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon might not be hearing from colleges because he is only a junior. But 
the three-point baskets have kept coming -- at a rate of one in every two 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, who is averaging 10.3 points a game, has made 43 of 86 three-point 
shots, including four in a game three times. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of his threes have pretty much been NBA threes," Burroughs Coach Ira 
Sollod said of Calderon's cruise missiles. "A lot of it is just coming down and 
pulling up. He's got the green light. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year he was only a fair shooter. But he's really come on." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon's contribution this season is one reason Burroughs clinched its first 
Foothill League championship since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, however, is far from clinching a scholarship. The shot is there. And 
so are the grades; he maintains a 4.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
But college scouts, Calderon said, might be looking over his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now," Calderon said, "height doesn't really matter. But in college it 
might. I'd really like to play basketball if possible. But I study hard, so if 
I can't play basketball, I'll go to a UC school anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"A future is a future, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland, as in clank: As far as sustained excellence goes, few would argue 
that Cleveland has had the best boys' team in the Valley area for a number of 
years. The Cavaliers, 18-2 this season and ranked No. 2 in the state, have 
played in the City Section 4-A Division final twice in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth, here is a report card on recent play: 
</P>
<P>
Defense: Rates an A. The toughest press around. 
</P>
<P>
Offense: B+. Simply explosive at times. 
</P>
<P>
Talent: A-. Ranks among the City's best. 
</P>
<P>
Free throws: C. As in clank. 
</P>
<P>
And the latter is no secret. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell attended the UCLA-Oregon State game at Pauley 
Pavilion on Sunday. While there, he watched a familiar face -- Cleveland 
graduate Trevor Wilson, now a starting forward for the Bruins -- do some 
familiar things. 
</P>
<P>
Despite finishing with 26 points, Wilson made only six of 12 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
For Braswell, watching players miss free throws is fast becoming routine. 
Cleveland players, historically, have not been good free-throw shooters, he 
said. The Cavaliers' last loss, a 63-62 tournament loss to St. Joseph of 
Alameda in December, was due in part to an inability to convert one-and-one 
attempts, Braswell said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's white-line fever has become a running gag. Even Wilson realizes 
that something is, well, amiss. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing he said after the (Oregon State) game is, 'I can't make 'em 
because I'm from Cleveland," Braswell said. "I don't know what it is, but 
sometimes we just don't seem to shoot them very well here." 
</P>
<P>
I was only kidding: San Fernando Coach Dick Crowell groused aloud to Canoga 
Park Coach Joey Nakasone before their teams met in a West Valley League game 
Wednesday. Both teams were suffering from late-season attrition. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando, in fact, was down to seven players. Canoga Park was in similar 
straits. 
</P>
<P>
"They only had eight guys," Crowell said. "I told Nakasone, 'No fair, you're 
one up on me. That's one too many.' " 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, it was all even at seven each. 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park's Mario Rodriguez fell during a warm-up drill and suffered a 
fractured ankle. Crowell said that a Canoga Park statistician apparently 
wandered under the basket during layup drills and Rodriguez landed on him. 
</P>
<P>
Add San Fernando: The Tigers defeated Canoga Park, 79-47, to remain in 
contention for a playoff berth. Third-place San Fernando (9-12, 3-6 in league 
play) will play host to second-place Chatsworth (11-8, 4-5) at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
If San Fernando wins, the same teams will meet in a playoff for second place 
next week, Crowell said. Only the first- and second-place teams in the City 3-A 
advance to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Does San Fernando -- which has played inconsistently all season and lost two 
starters last week when Crowell kicked them off the team for rules violations 
-- still have a fighting chance? 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing the theme to 'Rocky', " Crowell said. "We're on the ropes, but 
we're still trying." 
</P>
<P>
End around: Cleveland running back-safety Sean Burwell, who had orally 
committed to attend Iowa State, pulled an end-around on Wednesday and instead 
signed with Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Burwell, a Times All-Valley selection, said he had been recruited by Oregon all 
along but that the Ducks' running back coach, Gary Campbell, told Burwell he 
must redshirt his first year. It fast became a point of contention, Burwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So Burwell committed to Iowa State -- for a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"(Campbell) called me later that day to tell me I'd made a big mistake," 
Burwell said. "He said I'd have a good opportunity to play at Oregon." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell visited Burwell at the player's home last Friday and told Burwell he 
didn't have to redshirt if he didn't want to. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the main thing," Burwell said Thursday, "I didn't want to redshirt. 
They told me at first that I would, but then they changed their mind." 
</P>
<P>
As did Burwell, who rushed for 1,145 yards last season. Whatever Campbell said 
worked -- Burwell informed Oregon of his decision Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Come one, come all: Five of the Marmonte League's seven teams are still in 
contention for playoff berths in their respective divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley (16-8, 9-3), which is guaranteed at least a co-championship; 
Camarillo (16-6, 8-3), which could tie the Pioneers with a win at Newbury Park 
tonight; and Westlake (14-10, 7-4), which clinched third place Wednesday, are 
locks because they finished in the top three. 
</P>
<P>
On the bubble are Royal (11-12, 6-5), which needs to beat Thousand Oaks tonight 
to finish at .500, and Newbury Park. The Panthers are 4-7 in league play, but a 
strong nonleague showing and 13-9 overall record might be good enough for a 
postseason invitation. 
</P>
<P>
Rained out: Grant's alumni baseball game, scheduled for Feb. 11, has been 
rescheduled because of poor weather. The game will be held March 12 at 11 a.m. 
at Grant.

WESTLAKE TO DISCIPLINE IBRAHIM AFTER TAUNT STARTS POSTGAME FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day after his actions at the end of a basketball game Wednesday night between 
Thousand Oaks and Westlake highs triggered a wild brawl that included players, 
coaches, and spectators, Essam Ibrahim expressed regret while facing certain 
disciplinary measures from Westlake administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a classless act of mine," said Ibrahim, a junior on the Warrior 
team. 
</P>
<P>
After Todd Anderson of Thousand Oaks missed a free throw with no time remaining 
that would have tied the score, Ibrahim ran onto the court and taunted Anderson 
before continuing across the floor toward the locker room. He was dragged down 
from behind by Thousand Oaks players, one of whom Ibrahim identified as 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"I was cheering, heading toward the locker room, and they dragged me down," 
said Ibrahim, who was suspended from school Thursday. "But I didn't swing, and 
I don't think anyone swung at me." 
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked a minute-long fracas. 'It was quite a melee of hitting," 
Westlake Coach Greg Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good kid who used some pretty poor judgment," said Westlake Athletic 
Director Bob Fisher, who was in attendance. "But I take a pretty hard line on 
things like that." 
</P>

COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: LIONS, GAELS HAVE ANOTHER SHOWDOWN -- BETWEEN WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, it's showdown week for Loyola Marymount and St. Mary's in Gersten 
Pavilion. The Gaels go into the weekend holding a one-game lead over Loyola in 
the West Coast Athletic Conference and come to town Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the gym probably won't be packed, and Sports Illustrated won't be on 
hand. This is the distaff battle for first place in the WCAC. While the men's 
team is playing at St. Mary's on Saturday, the women will be in as fierce a 
race of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola is 14-9 overall, 6-2 in the WCAC, while St. Mary's (14-8, 7-1) and 
Gonzaga (11-11, 7-1) are fighting for the title which could result in an NCAA 
or NIT bid. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions are 9-1 at home and get help from the schedule, with four of their 
last six games in Gersten. Gonzaga is one of their two remaining road games, 
next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
While aiming at St. Mary's, the Lions can't stumble tonight against 
fourth-place San Diego (7-11, 3-5). Every game is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the men's match-up, the Loyola women are the more conservative 
team compared to St. Mary's, the highest-scoring women's team in the WCAC and 
one of the most proficient three-point shooting teams in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions don't have a player in the WCAC's scoring top 10, while St. Mary's 
has the top two, Anja Bordt (22.1) and Cheree Tappin (19.5). 
</P>
<P>
However, Loyola has been playing a more up-tempo game lately and has spread the 
scoring around generously. Lynn Flanagan, at 10.9 points per game, Tricia 
Gibson at 10.3, Regan O'Hara at 10.1 and Kristen Bruich at 9.3 are closely 
bunched, and freshman Nicole Taylor, a spot starter the last two weeks, has 
been the leading scorer in two of the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
"We're scoring more points (than earlier)," said Loyola Coach Todd Corman. "Our 
team is different than the others. Every other team has one player in the top 
scorers. We don't. Everybody gets their points and rebounds. We're an equal 
opportunity employer. It's been successful for us. It's been a real team 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola defeated St. Mary's this season, 74-65, before Bordt was eligible. St. 
Mary's returned the favor last week in Moraga, 78-64. Since Bordt joined the 
lineup in December, the Gaels have attempted more three-pointers than any other 
team in the nation. Bordt has the individual high in the conference, 36 points, 
and also leads the WCAC in assists, 6.4 per game. 
</P>
<P>
"St. Mary's is probably the team to beat, and they probably have the player 
with the most influence in Bordt," Corman said. "When she's in the game, it's a 
whole different team. We've got to control her. We hope on the road they're not 
gonna hit those (three-point) shots. Saturday's game should be an up-tempo 
affair. We're 1-1. We want to take the rubber match." 
</P>
<P>
With three weeks to go, however, Corman isn't ready to think about a first-ever 
appearance in postseason play. "That's premature," he said. "The schedule 
favors us. We've just got to go out and perform." 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's Bordt has followed an extensive itinerary on her way to becoming the 
West Coast Athletic Conference's best female player. 
</P>
<P>
The high-scoring guard, who leads the WCAC in scoring and assists, ranks among 
national leaders in scoring, three-point percentage and three-point baskets per 
game. She set a school record with a seven-of-eight performance from 
three-point range against Portland in January. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe her records should be listed as international. The 5-foot-8 native of 
Helsinki, Finland, came to the United States as a high school exchange student 
in Wisconsin in 1983. After graduation she returned to Helsinki for two years, 
playing on the Finnish National Team, before heading to UC Berkeley, where she 
was named to the freshman All-American team for the 1986-87 season. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bordt didn't like the program at Berkeley and returned to Finland to 
help the national team prepare for the European championships and a shot at the 
Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
When the Finns didn't qualify for Seoul, Bordt surfaced at St. Mary's, where 
she enjoys the atmosphere of the small school in Moraga as well as the team's 
up-and-coming status and wide-open style. 
</P>
<P>
Bordt, though only a sophomore, is older than most of her teammates at 23 and 
is married to a San Francisco tennis pro. However, her coach says marriage 
hasn't tempered Bordt's athletic zeal. "Her obvious talent level is a plus," 
said Gaels Coach Terri Rubenstein. "But in addition to that, her level of 
intensity raises the play of the entire team. I have never coached anyone else 
with the amount of competitive drive that Anja has." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday Night Live, Barely -- West Coast Athletic Conference men's basketball 
coaches were upset when the conference shifted from a Thursday-Saturday format 
to Friday-Saturday. After last weekend, visiting teams were 8-8 on Fridays, 
4-12 on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said his team's style may prove to be an advantage 
in the tough travel schedule. "I think we'll play better back-to-back nights 
than most teams," he said, "because of the way our guys extend themselves 
everyday in practice. Teams talk about being worn down that second night, but 
we're used to that."

SASVARY FEELS CONSTRAINTS OF 2-SPORT COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROCKY PINHEIRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Les Sasvary may have picked the wrong year for his soccer team to contend for a 
City Section title. Because City officials changed the start of the season to 
coincide with other winter sports, Sasvary finds himself in a predicament most 
coaches would envy. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish soccer hadn't started so late," the coach said. "This is the first 
year the league officials have started the season after the new year, and I 
don't have time to properly prepare my gymnasts." 
</P>
<P>
Sasvary, boys' soccer and gymnastics coach at Monroe High, has directed the 
soccer team to an 11-1-1 record and a first-place finish in the Valley Pac-8 
Conference. Yet Sasvary believes he has had too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough situation because we have a gymnastics meet March 9 and soccer 
won't end until late February if we go to the finals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Monroe wins the City championship in soccer -- the Vikings open the playoffs 
Tuesday as the favorite -- and duplicate the feat in gymnastics -- the Vikings 
have won 10 City Section gymnastics titles since 1969 -- Sasvary would be the 
first City coach to win back-to-back titles in different sports. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice if we could win the two titles," he said. "It'll be good for 
the school, me and the athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Sasvary spawned the soccer program at Monroe in 1978 after having established a 
dominant gymnastics program for 10 seasons. Sasvary said that he was driven by 
the love of both sports and wanted to pass on his experience and discipline to 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"I played soccer as a child in Europe and continued until my freshman year in 
college," he said. "Then gymnastics took over." 
</P>
<P>
Rewards have been slower in coming for the soccer team, but this year's team 
has the best record in school history and is seeded No. 1 entering the 
playoffs. Last season, the Vikings posted what was then their best record as 
they advanced to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"The team's success is no surprise to me," Sasvary said. "They've worked hard 
and earned every win." 
</P>
<P>
And as long as the soccer season is working out for the best, Monroe gymnasts 
must work out on their own. The gymnasts "practice in the P. E. classes and the 
athletes work on their own a little," Sasvary said. "But it's definitely a 
hindrance."

<P>
Joey Manliguis, the starting point guard for the Valley College men's 
basketball team, has left school and will not compete again this season for the 
Monarchs, Valley Coach Jim Stephens said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Manliguis, who scored 21 points in Valley's 90-74 Western State Conference loss 
to Ventura on Saturday, ranked fourth in the state in assists, averaging 7.6 a 
game. He also averaged 15 points a game. Stephens said Manliguis had attendance 
problems that led to failing grades in classes. 
</P>
<P>
Manliguis, a freshman out of Cleveland High, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>

Valley (17-10 overall, 7-3 in conference play) will play host to Santa Monica, 
ranked No. 1 in the state by the J.C. Athletic Bureau, at 7 p.m. Saturday. GARY

TAL SMITH WILL FILL IN TEMPORARILY IN THE PADRES' FRONT OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With spring training fast approaching and Jack McKeon preparing to doff his 
general manager's cap for a field manager's, the Padres announced Thursday that 
Tal Smith has agreed to temporarily expand his duties with the club to include 
overseeing day-to-day baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
Smith will fill the role from Feb. 22, the day the Padres' first full-squad 
workout is scheduled, until a permanent president is named; Dick Freeman has 
been acting as interim president. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, McKeon's trade talks continue to percolate with no results. Pitcher 
Mark Langston, his target in Seattle, signed a one-year contract with the 
Mariners Thursday. Atlanta outfielder Dale Murphy, also coveted by McKeon, is 
recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery and still waiting to hear if the 
Braves are planning to trade him. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, though, the attention was centered on the Padre front office. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really what I regard as temporary," Smith said from his office in 
Houston. "I'll be pinch-hitting until the Padres select their new president, 
after which time any further delineation of the baseball responsibility will be 
his." 
</P>
<P>
Said Freeman: "He's filling in . . . most of his roles will be as a general 
manager on a temporary basis. The job Jack is leaving to go down on the field 
is a general manager's job, and that responsibility is being left without 
anyone to fill it." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres contracted with Smith after the 1988 season to serve as a consultant 
to Freeman and the club on contract negotiations, trades, arbitration hearings, 
minor league operations and scouting department decisions. Smith also is under 
contract in the search for a new club president. 
</P>
<P>
Smith started his baseball career with the Cincinnati Reds' organization in 
1957. He served as the New York Yankees' executive vice-president from 1973 
through 1975 before becoming the president/general manager of the Houston 
Astros in 1976. He was with the Astros until 1980 and started Tal Smith 
Enterprises in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I've served almost continuously as a consultant for the Padres since May 1981, 
and I have a good working relationship with Jack McKeon, Dick Freeman and 
(minor league director) Tom Romenesko," said Smith, who will also be working 
with his 25-year-old son, Randy, the Padres' director of scouting. 
</P>
<P>
Tal Smith said his new role will not lead to the Padres' presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," he said. "I've had plenty of opportunities to get back with a 
club, but a permanent position (in baseball) is not my preference. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done well as a consultant. I enjoy the diversity and the people, and I 
like the opportunity to do the different things that my independence provides." 
</P>
<P>
Smith will be spending most of his time in Yuma, Ariz., and San Diego while on 
assignment with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
On the trade front, McKeon has had conversations this week with both Seattle 
and Atlanta but hasn't turned up anything. 
</P>
<P>
Langston signed a one-year contract for $1.3 million plus incentives with the 
Mariners, avoiding a Feb. 15 arbitration date. He was looking for a three-year 
deal, which the Mariners say still may be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres and the Mets remain the chief competitors in trying to land 
Langston, who was 15-11 last season with a 3.34 earned-run average and 235 
strikeouts, second in the American League to Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
The same two clubs are also wooing Atlanta General Manager Bobby Cox over 
Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just listening now," Cox said Thursday. "Jack McKeon is very aggressive 
in his pursuit of Dale Murphy. Jack's a hard worker -- he does his job. We've 
bantered about some names, but we're still trying to sort out everything." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' prize bait, catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., doesn't interest Atlanta as 
much as other teams because the Braves have Jody Davis. Atlanta is looking for 
a power hitter and a young center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
As a 10-and-5 man -- 10 years in major league baseball, five with the same team 
-- Murphy has the right to decline a trade. There have been reports that Murphy 
would veto a trade to the Mets and accept one to the Padres. Cox said he hadn't 
spoken with Murphy about that. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to work something out," Cox said. "If it gets close, we'll talk 
to Mr. Murphy and Mr. Turner (Braves' owner Ted)." 
</P>
<P>
All indications are that Murphy is recovering smoothly from arthroscopic knee 
surgery Jan. 31. An Atlanta spokesman said Murphy appeared at a team luncheon 
three days after the surgery without crutches and that he is walking now 
without a noticeable limp. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
A Braves' spokesman said Dale Murphy videotaped his knee surgery in case a club 
interested in trading for him would like to view it. . . . The Padres and new 
pitcher Walt Terrell are scheduled to go to arbitration Feb. 16. . . . Three 
pitchers and three catchers have been invited to the Padre major league 
training camp that opens with workouts Feb. 19. The pitchers are Joe Bitker, 
Terry Gilmore and Joe Lynch, and the catchers are Mike Basso, Greg Hall and Bob 
Lutticken. A total of 42 players have been invited to spring training, 36 of 
whom are on the major league roster.

USD LOOKS TO SPOIL WEEKEND FOR LOYOLA, PEPPERDINE

Virtually eliminated from the West Coast Athletic Conference regular season 
championship, the University of San Diego men's basketball team tries to play 
spoiler when it faces third-place Loyola Marymount tonight and first-place 
Pepperdine Saturday at the USD Sports Center. Both games are at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, USD (6-14, 1-7) plays its two-game series with second-place St. 
Mary's (18-3, 6-2). The Toreros will be trying to build some needed confidence 
before the WCAC tournament March 4-6 at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
USD beat San Francisco, 69-64, for its only conference victory. The Toreros 
lost six games by a combined 23 points before being beaten Saturday by NCAA 
scoring leader Loyola, 139-104. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday against Pepperdine (15-8, 7-1), USD led, 62-60, with 4 1/2 minutes 
remaining but lost, 68-65. USD outshot the Waves from the field (54%-45%) with 
sophomore center Dondi Bell going seven for seven for a team-high 14 points. 
But the Toreros were 13 of 24 from the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday against Loyola (13-8, 6-3), USD trailed, 28-25, with 10 minutes left 
in the first half before Loyola went on a 35-4 run. Junior forward Craig 
Cottrell led USD with 26 points and eight rebounds. Hank Gathers, NCAA scoring 
and rebounding leader, led the Lions with 30 points, 14 rebounds and nine 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros' 104 points was their third-highest total since they switched to 
Division I in 1979-80 (they scored 126 in a loss last season to Loyola and 113 
in a victory over U.S. International two seasons ago). Loyola's 139 points was 
the second-highest opponent total (after last season's 141-126 loss to Loyola).

MAZDA DROPS GARNER TO TRY NEW ROUTE IN COMMERCIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor James Garner's four-year stint as a spokesman for Mazda is about to run 
its last lap. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese auto maker, which is making major changes in its car line, said 
Thursday that it would drop Garner when his contract expires in March. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the cars to be the stars," said Janet Thompson, vice president of 
advertising at Mazda Motor Corp. "Although James Garner really put the Mazda 
name out there, we've decided to now focus on the individual personalities of 
our models." 
</P>
<P>
The move by Mazda has some skeptics scratching their heads. "He's the only 
image that Mazda advertising has going for it," said Jim Hillson, senior 
analyst of the Los Angeles commercial research firm Phase One. "Of course, if 
the only thing you have going for you is a celebrity spokesman, maybe it's time 
to start afresh." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Voice 
</P>
<P>
Also, Mazda's U.S. car sales were up considerably in 1988, while most importers 
saw sizable sales declines last year. 
</P>
<P>
Garner, who was paid an estimated $1 million annually by Mazda, was unavailable 
for comment Thursday. He was outside California, scouting locations for a new 
movie that his production company plans to film later this year. Garner, 61, 
only recently recovered from quintuple heart bypass surgery, which had 
sidelined him not only as promoter of Mazda, but also as a spokesman for the 
Beef Industry Council. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda's current campaign, which features Garner's voice but not his face, will 
be re-shot with a new voice in the background. Those ads will run until Mazda's 
new campaign begins in July, said Mazda's Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
That new campaign is still being created by Mazda's ad agency, FCB/Orange 
County. James F. Barr, executive creative director at the agency, said it will 
be a tough act to follow. "It's sad to see him go," said Barr, "but he 
represents the past, and Mazda has a whole new line to communicate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lag Time' 
</P>
<P>
Mazda's print ads never used Garner. "Without his voice and movements, we 
didn't think he'd be as effective," Barr said. Instead, the print ads focus 
exclusively on the cars -- which is exactly the path Mazda intends to take on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Garner -- who is, perhaps better known for his chatty commercials 
for Polaroid that co-starred Mariette Hartley -- is already considering other 
possibilities in commercials. "He'd like to have some lag time before doing 
another automobile commercial," said Charles Stern, president of a firm that 
represents Garner. "But we're looking at all kinds of things." He declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Just how successful was Garner as a Mazda spokesman? Well, that depends on whom 
you ask. 
</P>
<P>
While Garner's ads for Polaroid and the Beef Industry Council rated highly with 
consumers, his Mazda ads were not particularly memorable to thousands of 
consumers polled by Video Storyboard Tests, a New York research firm that 
tracks TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
But one celebrity broker -- who does not represent Garner -- said Garner was 
extremely effective. "Keep in mind, four years is a long time to be a spokesman 
for anything," said Alann Heldfond, vice president at Los Angeles-based Ingels 
Inc. "Most celebrities would be very happy to be on the air for four years." 
</P>
<P>
The tell-tale sign of problems between a company and its celebrity spokesman is 
when that celebrity lasts less than six months, Heldfond said. The Beef 
Industry Council, for example, dumped actress Cybill Shepherd shortly after she 
admitted in a magazine interview that she didn't eat much red meat. 
</P>
<P>
Garner made no such blunders with Mazda. In fact, the company provided him with 
three sporty Mazda cars and a truck that he drives regularly. Will he now have 
to return them? "No," said Stern, his agent, "they're his."

RESTORATION PLANNED FOR 'MILLION DOLLAR BUILDING'; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPER BUYS DOWNTOWN LANDMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Million Dollar Building, the elaborately embellished structure at 3rd and 
Broadway in downtown Los Angeles, where Latinos have flocked for years for 
movies and live entertainment, has been sold for $6.5 million to the developer 
renovating the neighboring Grand Central Market. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to restore it to a Class A luxury office building, with a fully 
rebuilt interior . . . and full restoration of the exterior historic facades," 
said Ira Yellin, whose Yellin Co. closed the purchase on Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The Million Dollar name, however, will likely be bulldozed. "We'll probably 
rename the building," Yellin said Thursday, "and the name that keeps coming to 
my mind is the Mulholland Building." 
</P>
<P>
According to Yellin, legend has it that William Mulholland, the Department of 
Water and Power engineer who selected the route for the Los Angeles aqueduct 
system, waged some of his political battles in still intact offices and a board 
room on the 12th floor of the Million Dollar Building. The offices housed the 
Metropolitan Water District for more than 30 years until it moved in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
The Million Dollar Theater will continue to operate, Yellin said, under an 
arrangement with Metropolitan Theaters, a Southern California theater operator 
whose 25-year lease on the theater does not expire until 2009. 
</P>
<P>
The building, at 307 S. Broadway, is rich in history and is considered one of 
the most important structures architecturally in Los Angeles. The 
preservation-minded Yellin bought it from Frank Fouce, who moved into the 
building as a tenant in 1950 and bought it 20 years ago in partnership with a 
family trust. 
</P>
<P>
Built by Sid and D. J. Grauman and designed by architect William Lee Woollett, 
the theater opened Feb. 1, 1918, and for decades was a popular first-run movie 
house. Now it features films and live shows from Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
It features a combination of Spanish and Baroque architecture and ornamentation 
and is well recognized as a Latino cultural center not only in Los Angeles but 
also in many parts of Latin America. Mexican vaudeville acts still perform 
monthly in the building's theater. 
</P>
<P>
A 1984 book called "The City Observed: Los Angeles" describes the Million 
Dollar's facade: "(The) exterior drips with outsize . . . ornament, some 
traditionally Spanish, some brazenly Western. Resembling an aging Miz Kitty in 
her dated dance-hall finery, it oozes populist character. Longhorn cattle 
skulls resplendent with life-size bronze horns nuzzle volutes and Spanish 
moldings; bison head corbels support a silent-screen parade of statues 
representing the Fine Arts, including . . . a cinematographer behind his 
camera." 
</P>
<P>
Embedded in the sidewalk are plaques featuring the names of Latino performers 
such as Cantinflas, the actor and comedian. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Corwin, president of Metropolitan Theaters, which operates 80 screens in 
Southern California, said: "We have in the Million Dollar the most successful 
Spanish-language theater in the country. It is to the Hispanic community what 
Radio City Music Hall is to people in New York." Corwin said the theater will 
continue to operate while the rest of the building is being renovated. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Jauregui, a prominent Latino businessman and a member of the Los Angeles 
2000 Committee, recalled going to the theater as a child. "Sometimes my mom 
would send me to the theater while she went next door to Grand Central Market 
to do her shopping," he said. "It conjures up fond memories." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "I think it's a wise investment. They are . . . placing themselves on 
the leading edge of developing that area." 
</P>
<P>
Yellin said plans call for a 450-space garage at 3rd and Hill streets that will 
be attached to the Million Dollar. The garage will house an international 
newsstand and bookstore. In addition, he said, he hopes to locate a "New York- 
or San Francisco-quality" restaurant in a huge basement space that until the 
late 1970s featured a favorite downtown watering hole. 
</P>
<P>
Rents, he said, will be less than $2 a square foot a month, about 25% cheaper 
than in comparable office buildings downtown. 
</P>
<P>
As for how a luxury office building will blend with crowds of shoppers and long 
lines of moviegoers, Yellin said: "We have the opportunity to develop a truly 
integrated society where you will have a lot of Latin, Asian and Anglo people 
working, mixing and functioning together." 
</P>
<P>
Yellin said he intends to begin the restoration, at a cost of as much as $5 
million, no later than April or May. The architect for the project is Brenda 
Levin, who is now working on Yellin's Grand Central Market and is known for her 
restoration of the Fine Arts Building on West 7th Street and the Wiltern 
Theater.

The nation's economy will continue to expand in 1989 but growth will slow 
slightly, according to a report by a panel of economists sponsored by the 
Conference Board. The group projected that real gross national product will 
rise about 2.5% this year, down from about 2.7% in 1988. The group also 
projected that inflation would rise to 5% from 4.2%, the prime rate would hold 
steady at about 10.5% and unemployment would increase slightly to 5.5%.

Braniff Inc. announced Thursday that it will move its headquarters to Orlando 
from Dallas and expand support facilities in Orlando and in Kansas City to the 
tune of $40 million and 1,400 jobs in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City will remain the airline's primary hub, Braniff Chairman William G. 
McGee told a news conference in Orlando. But the carrier wants to participate 
"in one of the most dynamic growth areas of the country" by moving its 
corporate base to Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
The airline, which began operating in central Florida a year ago with the 
acquisition of Florida Express, will build new maintenance facilities at both 
Kansas City and Orlando as well as a headquarters building in Orlando, McGee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This aggressive expansion program coupled with our already announced plans to 
increase our fleet by a net of 22 additional aircraft this year will fuel a 35% 
companywide growth in employment over the next 12 months," McGee said.

COMPCARE SAYS IT'S CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comprehensive Care Corp. of Irvine said Thursday that it has appointed a 
special committee of directors to evaluate strategic alternatives, including a 
possible financial restructuring, asset sale or acquisition by another company. 
</P>
<P>
CompCare, which operates alcohol and drug abuse treatment programs in 193 
hospitals nationwide, has suffered declining earnings over the past few years. 
For the fiscal year ended May 31, 1988, profits fell 26% to $9 million on 
revenue of $212 million. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the company said it believed that its stock was selling for 
less than its true value, which played a role in the decision by its board to 
chart a new business strategy. CompCare stock closed Thursday at $11.75 a 
share, up 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
B. Lee Karns, CompCare's chairman and chief executive, said the 17-year-old 
company has reached "a critical point" in its growth. 
</P>
<P>
"We are starting with a blank piece of paper," he said. "We retained 
Prudential-Bache to decide what would be in the best interest of our 
shareholders and employees." 
</P>
<P>
Karns said he did not know if the company would sell any of its facilities, 
including three in Orange County and one in San Diego. Nationwide, he said, the 
company owns 23 hospitals and provides services under contract in another 170. 
</P>
<P>
Karns said CompCare's earnings have been depressed for three years by a rapid 
expansion program and by continuing repurchases of CompCare stock. In the past 
two years, he said, the company has added seven new hospitals and spent $60 
million to buy back 5 million shares, leaving it with about 11 million shares 
outstanding.

8.89% on Aug. 13, 1987. The bonds will carry a coupon interest rate of 8.875%, 
with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,963.60. A total of $9.5 billion 
in bonds was sold out of bids totaling $17.2 billion.

INVESTORS IN 6 EMBASSY SUITE HOTELS SUE ON FRAUD CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 1,400 people who invested $98 million in limited partnerships to build 
six Embassy Suites hotels in California filed suit Thursday, contending that 
they were victims of a massive fraud scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Four named plaintiffs filed the suit in U.S. District Court on behalf of 
themselves and the other investors across the country who participated in a 
plan to build hotels in El Segundo, Downey, Santa Ana, Oxnard and Napa and 
Burlingame in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit contends that the scheme was masterminded by Robert E. Woolley of 
Irving, Tex., who it said served as general partner of each of the six hotel 
limited partnerships. The lawsuit said Woolley and several associates lured 
about 1,400 investors into the project by distributing memoranda that omitted 
"crucial" facts. 
</P>
<P>
Also named as defendants are Woolley's son, Robert E. Woolley Jr., and his 
construction firm, Rewcon Inc. of Irving, Tex.; Charles M. Sweeney of San 
Mateo, Calif., and Landmark Suites of America Inc., all general partners of the 
Napa limited partnership, and Joseph J. Amoroso of Westlake Village, a general 
partner in the Oxnard development. 
</P>
<P>
None of the defendants could be reached for comment. The suit accuses them of 
racketeering, fraud, unjust enrichment and violation of U.S. securities laws 
and California business codes. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said the defendants falsely represented themselves as experts in hotel 
development, construction and management. Private placement memoranda 
circulated by the defendants "projected great success" in each of the six 
developments and promised significant returns on investments, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
But actual cash distributions to investors -- promised to be about $59 million 
for all six hotels -- fell far short, the suit said. Three of the projects 
generated no return and the three others provided returns of between 3% and 7% 
of what was promised, the suit said.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: FORGET INDUSTRIAL PARKS -- HOTTEST NESTS FOR 
START-UPS NOW ARE IN 'INCUBATORS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past, when it was time to move a fledgling business from the back 
bedroom or garage, the choices were mainly limited to an affordable but bare 
industrial park or perhaps a dreary office building in a marginal neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Once settled, a feeling of loneliness or isolation often sets in. Adjacent 
businesses were established and not experiencing the same growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
But now, savvy real estate developers, knowing that California has 1.4 million 
small businesses, are courting their owners in new ways. 
</P>
<P>
"Most small businesses are relegated to the wooden office buildings on the 
fringe of town," said Fred Ellsworth, chief executive of American Comm Centers, 
a real estate development firm. "Our buildings are marble and glass." 
</P>
<P>
Some developers, like American Comm Center, have built high-tech office centers 
divided into small suites. Others have turned abandoned factories into small 
business complexes that are now being called "incubators." And, still another 
company built a small business venture park on the site of a defunct drive-in 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
The key difference between most small business complexes and a true incubator 
is the amount of low-cost management services offered to tenants, according to 
the National Business Incubation Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can use the term incubator," said Dinah Adkins, executive director of 
the Athens, Ohio group. "It's a sexy term and right now many people are 
glomming on to it." 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for membership in the association, a business incubator must not 
only provide basic services such as telephone answering and a mail drop, but 
offer management and technical services to tenants. The services most 
frequently requested by tenants are business and financial planning, 
accounting, loan packaging, advertising, legal services, tax preparation and 
advice on international trade. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there are about 330 member-incubators in the U.S. and Adkins projects 
that the number will jump to 1,000 by 1991. She said many incubators are 
operated by nonprofit agencies, while others are private, profit-making 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Incubators are especially popular in the East, where a decline in heavy 
manufacturing created a glut of large factories and warehouses, ideal for 
renovation. Pennsylvania alone has 38 incubators, Adkins said. 
</P>
<P>
In California, small business incubators are appearing all over the state, 
according to Oscar Wright, California's small business advocate. "Eighty 
percent of new small businesses fail within the first five years," said Wright. 
"But for companies located in incubators, there is an 80% success rate." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who serves as a liaison between business owners, the governor and the 
state Legislature, said he has found thriving incubators in Santa Ana, San 
Diego, Redding, San Francisco, Chico, San Jose and San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
The San Pedro Venture Center on Gaffey Street is home to 18 businesses, ranging 
from a tile company to a hazardous waste disposal firm. The center was 
originally a drive-in theater. Faced with a lack of business, Pacific Theatres 
initially built a mini-storage building on the 13-acre site. When the 
mini-storage tenants begged to install telephones and desks in their storage 
rooms, the company decided to build the venture park, according to Frans 
Vershoor, project director. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which opened in September, will ultimately include 11 buildings 
with space for retail stores to warehouses. The park also features a day-care 
center scheduled to be operated by a local YWCA. 
</P>
<P>
Services include a fax machine, photocopying and secretarial services, a 
conference room, mail room and a staffed reception area. In the works are plans 
to offer marketing, accounting, tax, legal and business planning services, 
Vershoor said. 
</P>
<P>
A more traditional business incubator opened four years ago in Chico, Calif. 
The former Chico-San noodle factory became available when H. J. Heinz bought 
the company and moved its operations. Heinz sold the building to a nonprofit 
organization for $150,000 and the Business Center was born. Four manufacturing 
companies and four nonprofit organizations are located there. Operating an 
incubator is "more than just being a friendly landlord," said Audrey Taylor, 
executive director. "We need to be there when they feel that entrepreneurial 
terror." 
</P>
<P>
Small business owners seeking luxury and service are moving into two new 
centers operated by American Comm Centers. The Comm Centers, one in Richmond in 
the Bay Area, and the other in Ontario, Calif., cater to small, professional 
business owners such as realtors and insurance agents. 
</P>
<P>
The Comm Center staff not only answers phones and greets visitors, but provides 
tenants with services such as 5,000 words of dictation and 500 free photocopies 
a month. The rent also covers utilities, janitorial service and parking. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so good, I can hardly wait to get to work in the morning," said Terrie 
Marzetta, a realtor who recently moved into the Hilltop Comm Center in 
Richmond. "It's warm, the coffee is made and someone has been answering my 
phone." Ellsworth said the next Comm Center is scheduled to be built at the 
Fluor Corp. complex in Irvine. 
</P>

Yellow Pages Lessons 
</P>
<P>
Last year, American businesses spent $8 billion on Yellow Pages advertising. 
For many small businesses, it was their only form of advertising. Yet many 
business owners are unsure about how to get the most out of the Yellow Pages. 
To help them, Barry Maher, a former marketing representative for GTE 
Directories, has written a practical guide to Yellow Pages advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting the Most From Your Yellow Pages Advertising" is published by Amacom 
Books, a division of the American Management Assn. in New York. The book 
provides insights and advice for small business owners. It costs $14.95 and is 
available through Amacom, 135 W. 50th St., New York, N.Y. 10020.

CHALONE, ROTHSCHILD PLAN TO INVEST IN EACH OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Chalone Inc. of San Francisco, one of America's few publicly held winery 
companies, and Domaines Barons de Rothschild of France announced Thursday a 
joint investment venture between the companies in which they would acquire 6% 
of each other's stock. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a San Francisco news conference by W. Philip 
Woodward, president of Chalone, and Baron Eric de Rothschild, managing director 
the Domaines Barons de Rothschild, which includes Chateau Lafite Rothschild, 
the famed First Growth wine of Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
The parties said they expect the cross-ownership of the companies to rise to 
20% within about two years. Each company initially is to invest about $3 
million in the other. If all contemplated investments are completed, the 
exchange will total about $15 million, said a spokesman for Hambrecht &amp; 
Quist, the San Francisco investment banking house that took Chalone Inc. public 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest Shareholder 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for Chalone Inc. to market some of the wines of the 
Domaines in the United States and for the Domaines to market some of Chalone's 
wines in France. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the cross-investment to the investor is that "a public investor 
now has an opportunity to invest in the Rothschild wine business via an 
investment in Chalone," said Jean-Michel Valette, a principal with Hambrecht 
&amp; Quist, which initiated and consulted on the deal.

Warner Communications Inc. said revenue rose 29% to $423.2 million for the 
year. Revenue rose to $4.21 billion from $3.4 billion. The New York-based 
entertainment concern attributed the gain to record earnings in all three of 
its main divisions -- filmed entertainment, recorded music and music publishing

SEARS 4TH-QUARTER PROFIT FALLS 79%; 
</P>
<P>
HUGE RESTRUCTURING CITED, BUT ANALYSTS SAY IT'S JUSTIFIED

<P>
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the largest U.S. retailer, said Thursday that its 
fourth-quarter earnings dropped 79% to $117.4 million as the company launched a 
massive restructuring to boost future earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based Sears said the fourth quarter included a $500-million 
restructuring charge. In the year-ago period the company earned $554.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the poor appearance of the results, Sears and analysts said they were 
pleased with the retailer's health. Without the restructuring, net income rose 
11% to $618 million. Revenue rose to a record $14.56 billion from $13.36 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Sears shares closed unchanged at $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The huge retailer announced its sweeping restructuring in October after a 
sluggish third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a year of major transition," Edward Brennan, Sears chairman and 
chief executive, said in a statement. "The actions announced last October . . . 
will position Sears to compete more effectively in the future." 
</P>
<P>
"The transitional phase changes are going to help 1989 results and the 
considerable expenses are well justified," added analyst John Landschulz at 
Cowen &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The company's full-year earnings dipped to $1.45 billion from $1.63 billion in 
1987. Revenues rose 9.5% to a record $50.25 billion last year from $45.90 
billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Sears, which also owns Allstate Insurance, Dean Witter Financial Services and 
Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group, said last fall that its third-quarter 
earnings fell 16% amid intense retail competition and slumping securities 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
Sears restructured to avoid being taken over, announcing cost cuts, a large 
stock buyback and the sale of the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago and 
Allstate's group life-health insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sears said it would change its retail strategy of frequent sales 
and promotions to one of "everyday low pricing" to reduce inventories and boost 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Sears Merchandise Group lost $113.5 million in the fourth quarter after a 
$442-million charge from the restructuring. Without the charge, the group 
earned $328.5 million on revenue of $9.52 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The unit, which contributes about 60% of Sears' revenue, suffered from fierce 
competition in the retail industry, but Brennan said the group's revamping is 
proceeding on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Allstate Insurance earned $206.3 million in the fourth quarter, compared to 
$217.2 million a year earlier. Earnings suffered mainly from a $58.6-million 
restructuring charge. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Witter, the company's financial services arm, earned $26.3 million in the 
fourth quarter, versus a loss of $33.8 million in 1987 after the October market 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
Sears's Discover credit card earned $6.7 million in the fourth quarter against 
a loss of $31 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Witter is a "fortress of earnings strength," said Josephthal &amp; Co. 
analyst Janet Mangano, who said the financial unit and Discover were the 
highlights of Sears' results. "They were core to profits in 1988 (and) will 
continue in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Coldwell Banker earned $61.9 million last quarter, in contrast with a 
$5.1-million loss a year ago.

CHAMPAGNE FLOWS AFTER KKR TAKES CONTROL OF RJR NABISCO

<P>
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co. on Thursday took control of RJR Nabisco 
Inc. as the biggest corporate buyout in history flooded money markets with cash 
and credit transfers needed for the record $25-billion buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its huge cost -- about twice the size of any other previous corporate 
transaction -- the deal went smoothly, Wall Street sources and banking 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 people, representing KKR, its lenders, its four investment banking 
firms and legal advisers, crowded into a two-story conference room at Simpson 
Thacher &amp; Bartlett, a New York law firm, to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 10:30 a.m. EST, the transaction closed, and champagne was poured. 
</P>
<P>
The guard changed quickly at the RJR Nabisco conglomerate, with F. Ross 
Johnson, the feisty chief executive who himself had attempted a takeover of the 
giant tobacco company, stepping down. J. Paul Sticht, a former R. J. Reynolds 
chairman, became temporary chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Sticht, 71, will take over as chief executive for the next 60 to 90 days. He 
was lured from retirement to take the post. He had been chairman of R. J. 
Reynolds until 1984. 
</P>
<P>
His successor is being sought in what is being called the biggest corporate 
head hunt in history. Rumored to be in the running are Edward Horrigan, 
chairman of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco and the highest-ranking insider to stay, 
Kraft Inc. President Michael Miles and Beacham Group Chairman Robert Bauman.

<P>
A falling dollar and rising interest rates sent stock prices broadly lower 
Thursday, pinning the Dow Jones industrial index with its largest loss since 
the first session of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Bonds were sloppy, currency was sloppy. It was the first excuse to take 
profits we've had in awhile," one trader said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell 20.17 to 2,323.04, for its biggest point drop since it lost 
23.93 on Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 224.22 million shares, up from 189.42 million on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell in foreign exchange trading, and prices of long-term government 
bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, dropped more 
than $16 for each $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honeywell's Price Jumps 
</P>
<P>
Trading activity on the Big Board was swollen by dividend-related transactions 
in three stocks -- Houston Industries, down 1/4 at 28; Philadelphia Electric, 
unchanged at 20 7/8, and Allied-Signal, down 3/8 at 35. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell Inc. shares jumped 3 points to 67 amid rumors that Unisys Inc. would 
make a bid for the company. Unisys shares closed unchanged at 29 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they were skeptical about such a deal, saying that Honeywell 
could fetch a price of about $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed mixed in active trading 
Thursday after a strong morning rally that propelled the key Nikkei indicator 
to its fifth consecutive record high. The Nikkei 225-share index added another 
13.31 points to close at a record 32,078.43. 
</P>
<P>
On the London Stock Exchange, prices dropped sharply in erratic trading 
punctuated by concerns about interest rates. The Financial Times 100-share 
index closed off 17.1 points at 2,079.1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices plunged amid extremely weak demand in the government's $9.5-billion 
quarterly debt-refinancing auction on 30-year bonds and a slumping dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1 5/8 points, or $16.25 for every 
$1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from 
its price, rose to 8.89% from 8.83% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the weak reception to the Treasury's 30-year bond sale and a 
declining dollar dragged down the price of bonds in the largest slump for the 
benchmark issue since early November. 
</P>
<P>
"The combination of the two was enough to put the kibosh on the long bond," 
said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. "The 
bond market got killed." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said expectations that President Bush's budget message Thursday would 
contain nothing new on eliminating the federal deficit also added a cautionary 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
William V. Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds 
Inc., said the market weakened gradually during the day as it became evident 
that demand was poor, especially from foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are among the biggest buyers of U.S. debt securities, and their 
demand fell far short of expectations in the 10- and 30-year sales in the 
three-part refunding this week. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 9.125%, down from 9.50% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
The dollar dropped sharply Thursday as traders speculated that President Bush 
would say nothing new in his budget message about cutting the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In its biggest one-day decline in weeks, the dollar lost roughly 1.2% of its 
value against such currencies as the West German mark, Japanese yen, British 
pound and Swiss franc. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp drop came after several steady sessions in which dealers had been 
reluctant to trade actively because of uncertainty about what Bush would say in 
his Thursday evening address. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell 0.11 Japanese yen to a closing 129.39 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted 
at 128.53 yen. In New York, the dollar sank to 127.93 yen from 129.38 yen late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7540 from $1.7423 late Wednesday. In 
New York, the pound rose to $1.7645 from $1.7440. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Wednesday's rates, 
included: 1.8475 West German marks, down from 1.8698; 1.5675 Swiss francs, down 
from 1.5895; 1.1836 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1844; 6.2875 French francs, 
down from 6.3640, and 1,347.5 Italian lire, down from 1,363.6.

WHERE REALITY OUTPACED FICTION: A NOVEL ON THE STEINBERG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Waverly Place by Susan Brownmiller (Grove Press: $18.95, 304 pages) 
</P>
<P>
First out of the gate in an inevitable commercial sweepstakes, Susan 
Brownmiller's version of the Steinberg case is presented as fiction, though 
recapitulation might be a more precise description of her method. Beginning to 
write on the day the Steinberg child died from head injuries inflicted by the 
man who had so casually "adopted" her, Brownmiller says, "I wanted the freedom 
to invent dialogue, motivations, events and characters based on my own 
understanding of battery and abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing heavily upon the lore collected for her impassioned study of rape, 
"Against Our Will," Brownmiller struggles to make this case fit a precast mold 
too narrow for the appalling facts. Instead of expanding our perception of the 
tragedy, "Waverly Place" inadvertently shrinks it. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the actual trial, the New York press coverage was exhaustive, 
providing Brownmiller with a daily supply of lurid revelations corroborating, 
rivaling and often exceeding anything she could imagine; turning the project 
into a contest in which fantasy is continually overmatched by reality. Finding 
setting, characters and plot on her doorstep, Brownmiller seems to have taken 
them in with only the most cursory effort to turn the raw elements into 
fiction. Her central characters remain pallid stand-ins for Joel Steinberg and 
Hedda Nussbaum, while the "invented" friends and relatives are hastily 
recruited from a pool of urban stereotypes. Since virtually every incident is 
preempted by the actual scenario, the 'invention' is limited to singularly flat 
dialogue and a disappointingly superficial exploration of motive. 
</P>
<P>
On home ground when she's describing the mental and physical degeneration of a 
vulnerable woman victimized by a vicious man, Brownmiller is less assured when 
she attempts to portray the complex pathology of extreme drug dependence. 
Ultimately, the sordid, numbed world in which Nussbaum and Steinberg lived 
eludes writer and reader. Moderately effective as an account of psychosexual 
dependence, "Waverly Place" falters when it ventures beyond the confines of the 
apartment into the obscure recesses of an addict's mind. 
</P>
<P>
Brownmiller's version of Hedda is a pathetically ordinary young woman named 
Judith Winograd; a Brooklyn College graduate who dreams of becoming a novelist. 
In 1970, when she's picked up at a Greenwich Village street fair by a 
smooth-talking hustler named Barry Kantor, she's 28 years old, stuck in a 
poorly paid job, living alone in a gloomy studio; spending a June morning 
fingering the curios at a sidewalk stall and hoping her desperation doesn't 
show. "Brooklyn gypsy with a ton of hair spray, perky. A type he liked." By 
afternoon she's in Barry's apartment, blissfully stoned; thrilled at having 
been picked out of the crowd by this hip, swaggering lawyer who rolled a joint 
as if he'd just stepped off the set of "Easy Rider." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Romance 
</P>
<P>
At first, he takes her hiking at Bear Mountain and skiing in Vermont, 
introduces her to the Kama Sutra, and she thinks she's the luckiest girl who 
ever crossed the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan. Within a few months, Judith is 
living in Barry's brownstone apartment, blindly catering to his outrageous 
whims, alienated from family and friends; the world well lost for love. 
</P>
<P>
Struggling to learn survival tactics, she tries to avoid doing anything that 
might send Barry into one of his frequent rages, blaming herself whenever she's 
brutalized. Always a dissembler, she becomes an expert liar, explaining away 
the bruises and black eyes as accidents, keeping her distance from the 
busybodies at her office. Their halfhearted advances rebuffed, her colleagues 
leave her alone, telling themselves that her private life is none of their 
business as long as the work gets done. 
</P>
<P>
Barry makes sure there's always a supply of Valium, pot, cocaine and finally 
heroin to take the edge off the anguish. The drugs erode Judith's fragile will 
and vestigial self-respect, effectively dulling the emotional and physical 
pain. Her captor couldn't have found a more malleable subject. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Baby Broker 
</P>
<P>
By 1981, when they acquire the first of the two children, Judith is entirely 
his creature, a zombie programmed to follow his orders unquestioningly. Barry 
Kantor's law practice has never been more than a matter of defending drug 
dealers and users, many of whom paid him with stock in trade. What cash there 
was came from a lucrative sideline as a baby broker. Driven by greed, he tries 
to extort more money from clients by actually auctioning a child to the highest 
bidder, and when both sets of prospective parents back off, he brings the baby 
home to Judith. 
</P>
<P>
For a few years, the role of adoring father amuses him; then it abruptly palls. 
From this point on, Brownmiller seems content to record the nightmare 
essentially as documented by the media; reducing the convoluted social issues 
to an anomalous form that seems a novel in name only.

"The Prize Pulitzer," Roxanne Pulitzer's best seller about her messy divorce, 
will be turned into an NBC movie that the network says will dramatize how she 
"thought she'd been accepted into this fairy-tale world only to be rejected and 
scorned when her marriage became a national scandal." During a highly 
publicized 1982 divorce trial, witnesses testified about cocaine use, sexual 
affairs and occult experimentation. Mrs. Pulitzer lost custody of their twin 
sons to her husband, Peter.

"Diff'rent Strokes" star Gary Coleman is suing his parents and former business 
adviser, alleging they took too big a share of his earnings. A lawsuit filed in 
Santa Monica Superior Court also claims that W.G. and Edmonia Sue Coleman and 
the adviser, Anita DeThomas, caused his assets to be managed unwisely. Coleman, 
who turned 21 Wednesday, started acting when he was 5. Earlier this week, 
Coleman's "Diff'rent Strokes" co-star, Todd Bridges, 23, pleaded innocent to 
attempted murder for a Feb. 2 shooting that police described as a drug-related 
assault. ALEENE MacMINN

NBC program chief Brandon Tartikoff, addressing an industry lunch Thursday in 
New York, had a complaint similar to that of Rodney Dangerfield -- no respect. 
Asked to assess the worst part of this season for NBC, he said it's the 
"sometimes exaggerated" knocks NBC has taken for airing some shows critics 
found tasteless or even sleazy. "I'd just like to see a little respect out 
there from the critical community. I think the only person who's had worse 
press than me has been (executed serial murderder) Ted Bundy." ALEENE MacMINN

Conductor Herbert von Karajan, 80, has asked for a reprieve from his contract 
with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra because of failing health. In a letter 
to Berlin culture authorities, he stated that he cannot keep up with the pace 
demanded by his contract and wants to rest at his home near Salzburg, Austria. 
A Berlin cultural affairs spokesman said that with the letter, Karajan conceded 
for the first time that his ability to conduct has been affected by a stroke, 
failing vision, circulatory problems and at least five operations he has 
undergone in the last 12 years. Karajan has conducted the Berlin Philharmonic 
since 1954 and holds the honorary title of lifetime director. One Vienna music 
critic said of the conductor, "His life is a heroic exertion against illness 
and pain."

Good News/Bad News Dept.: After overcoming objections from residents of Carmel 
who became overdosed on show business during Clint Eastwood's term as mayor, 
Disney Productions this week won permission to film outdoor scenes there for a 
movie starring Tom Hanks and Mare Winningham. But now, Henry Winkler has pulled 
out as director because of "mutual creative differences." In the comedy, 
"Turner and Hooch," a detective's orderly life is disrupted when he's assigned 
a big dog as a partner. ALEENE MacMINN

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: THEATER / NANCY CHURNIN: CHILLING MEMORY OF HITLER WAS THE 
GENESIS OF PLAY 
</P>

Robert Landis was a 16-year-old American schoolboy on a holiday when he saw 
Adolf Hitler rumbling through Berlin. The shock of the adulation the crowd held 
for Der Fuhrer still haunts him. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three years later, Landis has written a play, "The Canaris Enigma," about 
a real German agent, Adm. Wilhelm Canaris, who helped put Hitler in power and 
later plotted to bring him down. The show premieres at the Westminster Theatre 
in Point Loma March 3-19. 
</P>
<P>
Landis, a retired ad executive with the San Diego Union-Tribune, was bicycling 
through Berlin, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Olympics, when he and a German 
friend saw Hitler and staff members Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Goering and Rudolf 
Hess riding in their limousines to the Games. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that I still remember with great clarity was the mass hysteria of 
the crowd," Landis said, taking a break from painting the set of "The Canaris 
Enigma." 
</P>
<P>
"The whole town was festooned in blood red banners and swastikas. They yelled 
'Sieg Heil!' at the top of their voices, thrusting their arms out. As the 
cavalcade went down the neighborhood, you could hear the sound reverberating. 
And, in the distance, you could hear it rising and falling. It was electric. It 
was shocking. It was terrifying because I had no idea people could be so taken 
by a charismatic leader. There was this sense of impending doom and war all 
through the city." 
</P>
<P>
Landis, who later served in naval intelligence, said his German friend did not 
seem to be taken in by Hitler at the time. But, over the years, as they 
corresponded, their friendship eroded as the German's letters grow more 
strident in defense of Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be that he wrote those things because of censorship. The Gestapo was 
reading mail going out to other countries at that time. But it turned me off. 
He did survive. The last letter I had from him was after the war and he was 
begging for clothes and help. I'm ashamed to say I didn't respond. It was the 
close of a very dreadful war, and I was still angry. All of that is background 
for my play." 
</P>
<P>
They did it for Mary Martin, David Bowie, Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, 
Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Liberace, Lily Tomlin, Raquel Welch, Carol 
Burnett, Jerry Lewis, Ray Bolger and Howie Mandel.

Now, Flying by Foy, a company that specializes in flying, swimming and 
weightlifting effects, will be sprinkling the fairy dust on former Olympic 
medal-winner Cathy Rigby when she takes the title role in the Starlight 
production of "Peter Pan," May 24-June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Can a company really make a living making people fly? Since 1950, when 
British-born Peter Foy helped Jean Arthur soar on Broadway as the boy who won't 
grow up, Foy has been the wings behind 3,000 subsequent productions of "Peter 
Pan." (In that 1950 production, Boris Karloff made his American stage debut as 
Captain Hook.) The show didn't become really complicated, though, until 1954 
when it became a musical with Mary Martin. The addition of a 2 1/2-minute song 
to be delivered airborne created a need for flight choreography. 
</P>
<P>
In between soirees to Never-Never Land, Flying by Foy has worked for "High 
Spirits," "The Wizard of Oz," "The Flying Nun," "Hair!" "Funny Girl," "The 
Fantastic Voyage," "Disney on Parade," and "The Ice Capades." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't get the "Superman" account, but they're not complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"We're busy enough," said Garry Foy, who minds the Las Vegas shop while father 
Foy is helping operatic stars in London literally scale new heights. "Half of 
'Superman' is done with wires and half on film. We usually do things of a more 
theatrical nature." 
</P>
<P>
For "Peter Pan," Peter and the Darling children will wear girdles under their 
costumes that include a small eye hook between the shoulder blades. A small 
cable is attached through the hook to a track system 80 feet above the stage 
floor. The track system, operated by as many as three stage technicians per 
actor, allows for vertical and horizontal movement. Happy landings. 
</P>

PEOPLE: "Cousins" opens Friday in San Diego movie theaters, and Old Globe 
playwright Stephen Metcalfe, who wrote the script, utters the one comment that 
screenwriters so rarely say: "I enjoyed it." No wonder. "Cousins" may be based 
on the French film "Cousin, Cousine," but the emphasis on generational family 
interactions in "Cousins" is right out of Metcalfe's "Vikings." The La Jolla 
resident also said he is looking forward to the March opening of "Jackknife," a 
film adaptation of his play "Strange Snow," starring Robert DeNiro and Ed 
Harris. In the meantime, he is working on the film adaptation of his play 
"Emily," as well as a new play. . . . Leon Singer, who plays the cook in the 
"Lonesome Dove" miniseries, took a break from his restaurant duties at El 
Tecolote, his Mexican restaurant, to sigh over how much of his part was lost on 
the cutting-room floor. "After doing 'Burning Patience' (at the San Diego 
Repertory Theatre) and seeing myself here like a shadow on the wall, and you 
don't even know who the shadow belongs to, it was disappointing," he said. He 
had no complaints, though, about the stars, especially Robert Duvall, whom he 
described as "a real gentleman," or the series itself. "The director did a 
beautiful job, and the cast is perfect. It's as if I had played a little part 
in 'Gone With the Wind.' I'm proud of it." . . . Ralph Waite, who played the 
grandfather in "The Waltons" has signed on for Athol Fugard's "The Road to 
Mecca" opening March 4 at the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre Stage. . . . 
August Wilson's latest play, "The Piano Lesson," will have its West Coast 
premiere when it replaces Martha Clarke's "The Garden of Earthly Delights" at 
the Old Globe Theatre May 4-28. "The Piano Lesson" is the fourth in Wilson's 
projected series about the African-American experience. The others were 
"Fences," "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" and "Joe Turner's Come and Gone."

David Atherton, former San Diego Symphony music director, has announced four of 
the principal soloists in his inaugural Mainly Mozart festival June 2-11 at the 
Old Globe Theatre. In addition to pianist Anton Nel, who won the 1987 Naumburg 
piano competition, two former members of San Diego Symphony will be featured 
soloists. Cynthia Phelps, now principal violist with the Minnesota Orchestra, 
and Jerry Folsom, now principal French horn with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, 
will be joined by Atlanta Symphony concertmaster William Preucil. For the 
festival concerts, Atherton promised a 34-member orchestra, drawn primarily 
from outside the San Diego area, to play Mozart's familiar late symphonies and 
concertos. In response to the theme of the popular movie "Amadeus," Atherton 
has included a Triple Concerto by Antonio Salieri. The British conductor, who 
still maintains a San Diego residence, is the BBC Symphony's principal guest 
conductor.

Los Angeles artist Gronk, whose work also appears in "Hispanic Art in the 
United States," makes art that doesn't overtly proclaim its ethnicity. It's 
there, of course, in the angular patterning that activates both walls and skin. 
But there is more wailing human decadence to these paintings from the "Grand 
Hotel" series than belongs to any one culture. 
</P>
<P>
In not too subtle terms, the hotel is hell. All the glitter, silk tuxedos and 
fancy carpets notwithstanding, there is a purgatorial, "No Exit" kind of energy 
to the place. The walls crawl with strange symbols and figures that seem to 
spill out unending stories of sin, private pain and madness. Not since the 
haunted resort in "The Shining" has a hotel seemed so powerfully possessed by 
the shame and crimes of those who dwell there. 
</P>
<P>
Gronk's animated brush work and glowing color gives the scenes an agitated and 
oppressive presence, but it is the work's strange voyeuristic flavor that makes 
it so unsettling. The tight close-ups of the house detective and bellboy, the 
from-the-ceiling look at ballrooms and bedrooms all lend a frightening note of 
sneak-a-peek gratification. 
</P>
<P>
Adding an uncomfortable but telling detail to the show, Gronk has painted a 
cardboard chandelier and hung it in the middle of the gallery. That simple 
device forcefully transforms the space into another limbo for the damned and 
gives the audience the uncanny sense of being spied on. (Saxon-Lee Gallery, 
7525 Beverly Blvd., to March 4.) SUVAN GEER

The old saw that a painting is a window is still a surprisingly stimulating 
observation in the paintings of Ernest Silva and Robert Gil De Montes. Silva's 
interior rooms, decorated with brushy leaf-and water-patterned floors or walls 
are cut open by rough "picture window" paintings. The framed images form a 
neat, round robin kind of internal reference as the artist's studio becomes an 
exploration of the artist as mythical figure, "rogue" outsider and expressive 
volcano pumping up a fluid unconscious from the depths of the painting and the 
artist's own fertile mind. 
</P>
<P>
Silva's paint handling is quick and powerfully direct. When he slaps it over 
furniture sitting in front of a similarly painted "Lighthouse" canvas, there is 
a weird blurring of boundaries between the real and the allusive. That visual 
and conceptual fuzzing doesn't have the same intellectual complexity as the 
paintings, but the simple symbolism of a hollowed out orange life raft caught 
in swirls of blue bent willow has its own poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gil de Montes' paintings are not so much windows as surrealist theaters 
with painted curtains framing symbol-rich landscapes. It is tempting to view 
the paintings strictly from their ethnic roots, because the artist is 
represented in the County Museum of Art's current "Hispanic Art in the United 
States" exhibition. But to do so would be to miss the strength of the 
Gauguin-esque color and the lusty plant life in "Black Lake." And it would 
ignore the artist's enticing ability to use such bold color to subtly solidify 
space so that the various folk art monkeys, masks and transparent leaves fuse 
with their surroundings. (Jan Baum Gallery, 170 S. La Brea Ave., to Feb. 25.)

Helen Flint's paintings pit the frail human spirit against the emptiness and 
confinement of the urban environment. Her unemotional, realistic imagery 
focuses on the abstract blandness of urban architecture, finding pathos in the 
hype and graphic brightness of motel and cocktail signs or the eerie light of a 
television set in one window of a dark apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
Flint has a cinematic flair for image making. In her Chicago subway series, 
each painting recalls a still from a movie that's been tightly cropped and 
dramatically lighted to pump up the claustrophobia. In the current "City 
Paintings," she uses stark daylight to bleed away life and make shadows 
skeletal; night is densely dark and always desolate. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps in keeping with the impersonalization of a social realist observer, 
Flint keeps the painting's surface as slick as fresh concrete. However, this 
makes the imagery somewhat monotonous and reinforces the curious emotional 
anonymity of the scenes. It's as if there is a sheet of clear glass protecting 
viewers from the body heat of the lives on view. (Ivey Gallery, 154 N. La Brea

STAGE BEAT : 'LOVE KILLERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hillbilly caricatures in Gail Baker Shick's "Love Killers" at the Off Ramp 
make the solid authenticity and muscular writing of another Appalachian play, 
the ongoing "A Gift From Heaven" (especially its rewritten version), all the 
more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
"Love Killers" is just over the hill and down Cahuenga Holler from "Gift From 
Heaven" at the Chamber Playhouse, but it's the distance between real and fake. 
"Love" features a lineup of cliches: the inexpressive but protective Ma (Dixie 
King Wade); her troubled half-wit son Bubba (Bill Shick); her other boy, a 
withdrawn Vietnam vet named Ludie (Vaughn Armstrong, the strongest presence in 
the show); the Daisy Mae next door, here named Cora Sue (Melody Rogers, of TV 
fame); and a pair of seductive city slickers (Patrick (Paraquat) Kelley and 
Catherine Rusoff). 
</P>
<P>
The efforts of director Judy Goff and her designers reinforce these 
stereotypes. Shick's script -- though full of dire secrets and offstage 
intrigue -- never achieves the gravity that the events would seemingly dictate. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1953 Cahuenga Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7

'MORE LIGHT' IS LOST IN THE DARK AT THE LEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"So this is heaven!" A line that strikes dread into a theater reviewer's heart. 
It comes in the second act of British playwright Snoo Wilson's "More Light," 
presented by A Directors' Theatre at the Lex Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the scene of the play isn't heaven, but the head of Pope Clement 
VIII, circa 1600. Clement keeps having this nightmare that a Dominican friar 
named Giordano Bruno wasn't burned at the stake for heresy after all, but 
escaped to. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Heaven? Well, you know how confusing nightmares can be. This one also features 
Queen Elizabeth and William Shakespeare, who has turned himself into a woman in 
order to avoid Elizabeth's advances. However, she keeps advancing. 
</P>
<P>
We also meet an alchemist named Dr. Dee, a sharper named Kelly and a barmaid. 
Does any of this make any sense? 
</P>
<P>
Director Anne Drecktrah's production slightly suggests the kind of 
small-theater extravaganza that the Company Theatre used to do, except that 
nothing blends. The light changes are jerky, the set is static, the costumes 
hamper the actors' movements without being visually impressive and only three 
of the company have voices -- Julian Barnes as Bruno, William Utay as Pope 
Clement and Howard Malpas as Dr. Dee. 
</P>
<P>
Drecktrah's program-note about commedia dell' arte is bewildering. Her 
production has one actor with physical skills -- Albie Selznick, of the 
juggling group the Mums, in the role of Kelly. Everybody else moves like a 
civilian. 
</P>
<P>
Shows like this may be a "stretch" for the artists involved, but are a pain for 
the average viewer -- or even the viewer who knows something about the plays of 
Snoo Wilson. I saw "More Light" twice, for my sins, and wasn't surprised that 
half of the second audience left at intermission. If you don't grab them these 
days, they go home. 
</P>
<P>
Plays at 8 p.m. Thursdays-Saturdays and at 7:30 p.m. Sundays, with Sunday 
matinees at 2:30. Tickets $10-$15. 6760 Lexington Ave. (213) 466-1767.

A RESPECTFUL, NO-FRILLS 'RICHARD III' AT ACTORS ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arguably, the most poisonous and outrageous seduction scenes in English 
literature are Richard III's reptilian triumphs over Lady Anne and Queen 
Elizabeth. At the Actors Alley Repertory Theatre, actor Walter Raymond's 
hunchbacked "jolly, thriving wooer" propels "Richard III" onto the track of 
single-minded energy the play demands. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond's lithe serpent of a Richard insidiously worms his honeyed tongue past 
the defenses of Anne and Elizabeth, whose loved ones he has murdered to better 
proffer his own love. These scenes, which bookend icy, bloody intrigues, are 
the production's linchpins, as directed by Jordan Charney in his swan song 
after five years as artistic director of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Charney has not cut a line of the play. Though the running time is three hours 
with two intermissions, events rush headlong. Line readings are clear and 
unpretentious. Nobody in the cast of 22 poses or pauses for a declamation. 
</P>
<P>
Forget spectacle. For a company that had never staged Shakespeare before, the 
result is respectful and accessible, the unadorned, budget-conscious set and 
costumes notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Often productions of "Richard III," for brevity's sake, eliminate a royal lady 
altogether or rob one of them (frequently Queen Margaret) of a harangue. Not 
here. The role of the women, a tight, wailing chorus, is restored to its 
prominence. A contemporary abused wife syndrome even jumps into focus, giving 
balance to the plot's noise and bustle. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond's jaunty villain catches Richard's wit, not to mention his crooked 
body, which Raymond negotiates with deft economy. But Raymond's nasty, ruthless 
wooing could not work without the flashing repartee and convincing, measured 
retreats of Joann DiSano's Anne and Leslie Paxton's Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
This foul king knows psychology and here it's sex that Shakespeare's "toad" 
pushes to the limit. Among the other women, Bobbi Holtzman's joyless, 
embittered dowager Margaret and Joan Benedict's defiant Duchess of York 
(Richard's mother) enliven a nest of squawking talons. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's world, Steven Kavner's Buckingham is sturdy and powerfully 
intoned, and Brian Paul Fornes' Henry VII-to-be is the image of noble heroism. 
</P>
<P>
As a surprise, Charney directs a new ending that is not as jarring as it 
sounds: In an unspoken suicidal act, Richard III plunges Henry's sword into his 
own chest. The moment is designed to complete the unrepentant Richard's final 
haunting of his dream of ghosts the night before battle ("Despair, and die!"). 
We can live with that.

*** 1/2 "Point Blank." 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA. $79.95. 
</P>
<P>
Irresistible rage; immovable object. A haunted, doomed, hard guy (Lee Marvin, 
at his best), shot down during an Alcatraz robbery, tracks down his betrayers 
mercilessly, inexorably -- through gleaming L.A. offices, vast white storm 
drains, sterile penthouses, hillside bungalows -- only to find that his enemies 
are faceless, unaccountable, buried within the recesses of a huge, impersonal 
organization. This movie plays like some weird mixture of Kafka and Jim 
Thompson, Alain Resnais and Don Siegel ("L'Annee Derniere avec les Killers"?), 
and back in 1967, many critics were bewildered by it. It's an obvious morality 
play: five years before "The Godfather," it posits that big business and big 
crime are identical in their methods. It's also a dreamy rumination on anomie, 
film noir, modern architecture, vendettas and the links between desire and 
death. Director John Boorman fills it with haunting, unforgettable, often 
astonishing images. (Wide screen, cropped.)MICHAEL WILMINGTON

Fans of old movie serials are going to consider it Confucian wisdom and campy 
fun. Asian-Americans concerned with stereotyped images may say it's pretty 
dumb. In any case, Key Video is releasing seven Charlie Chan movies from 
1935-1942 this week. "Charlie Chan in Paris," "Charlie Chan at the Opera" and 
"Charlie Chan's Secret" star Warner Oland as the sly sleuth; "Charlie Chan at 
the Wax Museum," "Murder Over New York," "Charlie Chan in Rio" and "Castle in 
the Desert" have Sidney Toler in the lead role. Each $19.98 tape comes with a 
dossier listing the crime, suspects, motives and clues. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to much more recent film works, "The Good Mother" (Touchstone, $89.95, 
R) stars Diane Keaton as a woman whose suitability to raise her six-year-old is 
challenged by her ex-husband when she begins a relationship with a 
free-spirited artist. Based on Sue Miller's novel, the 106-minute drama was 
directed by Leonard Nimoy. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" (New World, $89.95, PG-13), who 
may be unsuitable both as a mother and as a movie star -- if you believe some 
of the reviews TV's horror-film hostess got for her own first excursion into 
cinema. However, fans of the character (played with bouncy wit by Cassandra 
Peterson) may enjoy this campy comedy. 
</P>
<P>
No one seemed to enjoy "Caddy shack II" (Warner, $89.95, PG) when this 
country-club-spoof sequel drove into theaters last year. While the alternately 
kooky and charming original was widely underrated, "II" deserved the 
shellacking it received. Among the missing this time around: Bill Murray, 
Rodney Dangerfield, laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Also high on some worst-of-the-year lists was "Tiger Warsaw" (Sony, $89.95, R), 
a Patrick Swayze-starring action film about a troubled Vietnam vet. "Tiger" 
literally did less than 1/100 the box-office business of Swayze's "Dirty 
Dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Art-house film of the week: "Pascali's Island" (IVE, $89.95, PG-13), a mystery 
about a romantic triangle and deception on an Aegean island; the notable cast 
includes Ben Kingsley ("Gandhi"), Helen Mirren ("The Mosquito Coast") and 
Charles Dance ("White Mischief"). 
</P>
<P>
Other Videos 
</P>
<P>
Those "sports fans" who subscribe to a certain magazine mainly for its annual 
swimsuit issue will be delighted to learn that the first video version of same 
will be in stores this weekend. "Sports Illustrated's 25th Anniversary Swimsuit 
Video" (HBO, $19.99) flaunts 55 minutes of models being selected, prepared and 
shot -- including former subjects like Christie Brinkley and Cheryl Tiegs. 
</P>
<P>
Sports fans who prefer sports may opt for Media's two tapes about this year's 
Super Bowl contestants, the champion San Francisco 49ers ("Team of the Decade," 
$19.95) and the Cincinnati Bengals ("Stars in Stripes," $19.95). 
</P>
<P>
"Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies" (J2, $59.95) struts out 34 of the late 
bandleader's numbers, played by his orchestra (Mercer Ellington conducts). And 
for the kids Children's Circle has "Happy Birthday, Moon and Other Stories for 
Young Children" (four brief stories for ages two through six) and "The 
Mysterious Tadpole and Other Stories" (four stories for ages three through 
eight), 35 minutes and $22.50 each. Information: (203) 222-0002. TERRY ATKINSON

ROADS TO ALL ASIAN CUISINES LEAD TO ORCHID'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Not to be just any Asian restaurant but a hip, '80s California sort of Asian 
restaurant -- that's Orchid's dream. It has food from all over East Asia, 
chopsticks only on demand, no MSG in anything and a ceiling of exposed ducts 
and beams. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect I may already have wrung the last drop of ecstasy from seeing struts 
and air ducts over my food, and by this point I'm almost ready for an 
acoustic-tile revival, but at least it's done well here. The orchid-colored 
ducts are actually entertaining; they end in concentric registers that make 
them look like a sucker-footed extraterrestrial about to stomp us all into 
hot-and-sour soup. 
</P>
<P>
If there's a problem with Orchid, it's that one restaurant is not likely to do 
equally well on all the cuisines it essays -- Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, 
Vietnamese, Malay and Indonesian -- and in any case, these cuisines all involve 
different eating habits. At Orchid, though, everything is dished up the same: 
with lettuce, shredded red cabbage and an orange slice. 
</P>
<P>
So there you are with your order of Vietnamese lemon grass pork, topped with 
sliced ginger and delicious crisp-fried onion. But where's the other stuff that 
always comes with Vietnamese food -- the vinegar and the fish sauce and the hot 
sauce? You can get vinegar with sliced ginger in it if you ask, but there 
probably ought to be a pile of fresh herbs too. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest victim of this standardized service is the Korean barbecued beef. 
It's nice and charcoaly, but the essence of Korean food is the side dishes. 
Without at least some radish salad and cabbage kim chi on hand, this could be 
barbecued beef from anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The cuisine that comes off best, and in the most surprising ways, is Chinese. 
What greater cliches could there be than shrimp toast and chicken chow mein? 
But at Orchid, the shrimp toast is not that rather English appetizer of toast 
spread with shrimp paste, but several large shrimp, each inside a big square of 
wonderfully crunchy breading. And instead of being a heavy stomach filler, the 
chicken chow mein is clean and refreshing with raw green onions and smoky bits 
of grilled chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Indonesian ba-tung beef and Thai shrimp curry are both pleasantly spicy dishes 
with coconut flavoring (the Malaysian mango chicken, though, is not saved by 
its coconut -- it's mawkishly sweet). And there's an appetizer of hot squid 
that has its points, notably fried green onion rings and a sweet, garlicky 
fish-flavored dipping sauce that would be welcome with a couple of other 
dishes. This is not the place to come for mee krob, though. The fried noodles 
aren't very puffy and are badly mixed with the tomato-heavy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Hip and '80s though it means to be, dessert is not Orchid's strong suit. 
There's a nice dish of fresh fruit (kiwi, raspberry, mango) with coconut cream 
and shaved ice (possibly not the best idea in the weather we've been having), 
and sometimes there are French pastries that are made elsewhere. I'm kind of 
glad the place has always been out of the egg pudding with mung beans. I might 
not be hip enough for that one myself. 
</P>
<P>
Orchid, 37 S. Fair Oaks Ave., Pasadena; (818) 796-8787. Open for lunch and 
dinner daily. Beer and wine. Validated parking in the Schoolhouse parking 
structure across Fair Oaks. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food 
only, $22 to $36.

FOCUS ON: JEWELRY: 'BAUHAUS' EXHIBIT SHOWS DUAL ROLE FOR ART, JEWELRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA VALOIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine taking a signed, sterling silver or 18-karat gold sculpture off your 
mantelpiece, attaching it to your necklace or pinning it to your blouse and 
stepping out for the evening. Sound preposterous? Take a look at the touring 
exhibition, "Echoes of Bauhaus," at the Circle Gallery, 2501 San Diego Ave., 
through March 6. 
</P>
<P>
The brainchild of Carol Rosenzweig, a Los Angeles art collector and writer, the 
exhibition of 30 pieces of sculpture-jewelry follows the concept of the Bauhaus 
School -- a 20th-Century school of art where artists of dissimilar media worked 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"I've collected furniture and other works from the period when the Bauhaus was 
formed in Europe," Rosenzweig said. "Even though the artists were painters and 
sculptors, they made furniture, jewelry and ceramics with the idea that art 
could be functional. That's what inspired me. There weren't any museum-level 
sculptors or painters who made jewelry, so that's where my journey began." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenzweig said she crisscrossed the United States in search of established 
artists to participate in her experiment. A two-year search turned up 10 whose 
works are currently being exhibited in museums nationwide. They are Lynda 
Benglis, Fletcher Benton, Joan Brown, Red Grooms, Lysiane Luong, Jim Morphesis, 
John Okulick, Alexis Smith, Dewain Valentine and William T. Wiley. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, many of them were curious," Rosenzweig said. "They all knew of the 
Bauhaus School and were intrigued with the idea of this new medium. Artists are 
curious by nature; many of them work on a large scale and wanted to see if they 
could work small." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher Benton, who designs colossal outdoor sculptures, tried his hand at 
sculpting six pieces of jewelry -- all abstract and geometric. Southern 
California painter Alexis Smith, influenced by the 1932 motion picture 
"Shanghai Express," designed a neckpiece entitled "Sidewinder." The front part 
of the 18-inch, sterling silver necklace resembles the Shanghai train, with a 
ruby and emerald used as lights. The rest of the necklace winds into the tail 
of a snake. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for the jewelry range from $450 to $2,500; up to 350 limited edition 
pieces are available. "All the works are done in either 18-karat gold or 
sterling silver along with the use of small gems," Rosenzweig said. "One of the 
objectives of the edition is that it be affordable to new collectors and 
veterans alike. The paintings and sculptures of the artists are unaffordable; 
this medium is a departure from works being unattainable." 
</P>
<P>
The "Echoes of Bauhaus" went on national tour in 1988 covering Los Angeles, San 
Francisco, New York and Boston. This year's tour begins in San Diego, then 
heads for Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rosenzweig, this yearly event is the largest contemporary art 
exhibition in the Orient, and the only jewelry to be displayed will be that of 
her artists. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, it's been great. It's like letting the genie out of the bottle -- 
collectors seem to have been yearning for a medium like this and we've been 
swamped with by those who want the pieces. But more than anything else, it's 
been exciting." BARBARA VALOIS

2 SCULPTURES COMPLEMENT THEIR LOCATIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a commendable move that counters the odious habit of installing "plop art" 
in public places, two local arts institutions have commissioned works of 
site-specific sculpture. Whether temporary, like the work by Mario Lara for 
Escondido's Mathes Cultural Center, or permanent, like the George Trakas 
installation at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, context plays a 
central role in both the call for these works and their realization. 
</P>
<P>
Reesey Shaw, curator at the Mathes Cultural Center, initiated the Escondido 
project out of a need to keep art in the public eye during the months that the 
center is closed for renovation. Late last year she contacted Lara, a local 
artist trained in architecture, to conceive of a work that would attract 
attention to the site. 
</P>
<P>
"The building itself is understated and tends to get lost," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the gallery's proximity to a public library, many people don't know 
it's there, she said. By commissioning Lara to install a site-specific 
sculpture there while the gallery is closed, Shaw hopes to remind them -- or 
inform them anew -- that the building is a center for art. Lara's work, 
"De-Terminis," is a formal response to the temporary closing of the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"The creative energy of the (center) was going to be displaced, so I wanted to 
do a piece that showed energy in a state of flux," Lara said. 
</P>
<P>
"De-Terminis" will sit on the roof of the cultural center, the site that Lara 
and Shaw agreed would be the most visible from the large adjacent parking lot. 
A wooden cone, fence and wall, all painted red, will evoke a basic 
architectural skeleton, and will be pierced by segments of a pole, painted with 
yellow and black stripes. The pole will interrupt the architectural structure 
like a broken line, Lara said, symbolizing "a state of indeterminacy." 
</P>
<P>
Lara and two assistants will be erecting the work this weekend at the site, and 
the public is invited to observe the construction process. "De-Terminis" will 
be officially unveiled and illuminated Feb. 17, at 5:30 p.m., near the library 
entrance at 239 South Kalmia St. 
</P>
<P>
The sculpture, co-sponsored by the Escondido Public Art Partnership Panel and 
the Felicita Foundation for the Arts, will remain at the site until the 
building renovation is complete, expected to be sometime in April or May. Its 
removal then will correspond with the meaning of the work itself, Lara said, 
for the displaced energy that "De-Terminis" represents will have been restored 
to the cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
While Lara's sculpture assesses its site in formal terms, Trakas' "Pacific 
Union," at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, deflects attention away 
from its own formal attributes to the surrounding landscape and view. 
Officially dedicated last month, "Pacific Union" transforms the narrow tip of 
the museum's garden, wedged between a loading dock and the adjacent streets 
(Coast Boulevard and Cuvier Street), into an inviting area for exploration and 
meditation. The work was made possible by a grant from the National Endowment 
for the Arts, with support from the Arts Promotion Division of the Department 
of External Affairs, Government of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Trakas, an internationally-known artist from Quebec who now lives in New York, 
has been working in the arena of outdoor, site-specific sculpture since the 
1970s, incorporating bridges, pathways and shelters into natural landscapes. In 
"Pacific Union," these elements -- made of wood, stone and steel -- mediate 
between visitors to the site and the expansive coastline beyond. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to several new, narrow ramps, two newly excavated stairways dating 
from the museum's prior life as a private home lead from the adjacent sidewalks 
to the elevated site. Benches, platforms and a block of gray metal 
bleacher-like seating facing the sea invite visitors to remain once they have 
ascended to the grassy plateau. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike traditional sculpture, which is self-contained and object-oriented, 
Trakas' work is decentralized. It sprawls across the irregular site, presenting 
itself and the spectacular vista beyond as environments to be experienced 
gradually, from a variety of perspectives. From two of the platforms, for 
instance, one sees the ocean over the tops of large slabs of granite the shapes 
of which echo the waves' fluid rhythms. Small concrete shelters beneath these 
stone slabs suggest hiding places for children or more intimate spaces for 
private meditation. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, access from inside the museum to "Pacific Union" and another 
garden artwork by Vito Acconci is awkward and not particularly encouraged. The 
museum's pending expansion plans will remedy this problem, according to curator 
Lynda Forsha, and allow a freer flow of traffic between the indoor and outdoor 
art.

BUSH CALLS FOR GROWTH WHILE CUTTING DEFICIT; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS GETS HIS 'REALISTIC' BUDGET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON and JAMES GERSTENZANG, Times Staff Writers

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, unveiling a $1.16-trillion budget that calls for a modest shift 
of funds from the military to social programs, urged the Democratic-controlled 
Congress on Thursday to work with him to "keep America growing while cutting 
the deficit." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't propose to reverse direction," said Bush, who took office last month 
after serving as former President Ronald Reagan's loyal vice president for 
eight years. "We are headed the right way. But we cannot rest." 
</P>
<P>
Offering a rosy view of U.S. relations around the world, Bush declared: "We 
meet at a time of extraordinary hope. Never before in this century have our 
values of freedom, democracy and economic opportunity been such a powerful 
political and intellectual force around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
"Never before has our leadership been so crucial," he continued, "because while 
America has its eyes on the future, the world has its eyes on America." 
</P>
<P>
And on the domestic front, Bush was equally optimistic. His voice occasionally 
cracking from a cold that has dogged him during his early weeks in office, he 
presented what he called "a realistic plan for tackling" the budget deficit 
while addressing some "very clear priorities." 
</P>
<P>
"We can afford to increase spending -- by a modest amount, but enough to invest 
in key priorities -- and still cut the deficit by almost 40% in one year," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Funds 
</P>
<P>
He asked Congress to vote additional funds in a number of areas -- including 
education, the environment and the homeless -- that he frequently mentioned 
during his campaign in calling for a "kinder and gentler" government. 
</P>
<P>
The President's intention to boost domestic spending while achieving deep 
deficit reductions, however, rests on foundations that many in Washington 
consider to be overoptimistic. Bush's new budget, for example, assumes that the 
economy will continue growing even as interest rates tumble -- a combination 
that even fellow Republican Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve 
Board, finds unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats in Congress reacted to Bush's program with keen skepticism, even 
though they joined in repeated applause that punctuated his speech. 
</P>
<P>
"A kinder and gentler America?" said House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) in the 
official Democratic response to the speech, which was broadcast immediately 
afterward. "That's old-time Democratic religion." 
</P>
<P>
"All this sounds fine," said Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.). "But how is he 
going to pay for it?" 
</P>
<P>
Bush, as he has throughout the first weeks of his Administration, asked 
Congress to work more closely with him than it did with the White House during 
the closing years of the Reagan Administration. He urged members of Congress 
"to come forward with your proposals, if they are different." 
</P>
<P>
"Let us not question each other's motives," he said. "Let us debate. Let us 
negotiate. But let us solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Prominent among the problems identified by Bush is the federal budget deficit. 
He proposed to reduce it to about $91 billion in the fiscal year that begins 
Oct. 1, fully $72 billion less than this year's deficit, even as he would 
initiate a variety of social and economic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Economic growth, combined with some judicious spending cuts, would make it all 
possible, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Backs One-Year Freeze 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit," Bush said, "I support 
a one-year freeze in the military budget." After that, he insisted, increases 
above inflation will be required. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not sacrifice American preparedness, and I will not compromise American 
strength," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he urged caution in dealing with the Soviet Union. While the 
United States will continue to work for peace, he said, the Soviets retain a 
powerful military machine with objectives that often conflict with U.S. 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who has faced criticism for delaying a resumption of arms negotiations 
with the Kremlin pending a review of the state of U.S.-Soviet relations, 
defended the delay. "Prudence and common sense dictate that we try to 
understand the full meaning of the change going on" in the Soviet Union, 
"review our policies carefully and proceed with caution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And, he declared, he has assured Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that 
once the review is done, "we will be ready to move forward. We will not miss 
any opportunity to work for peace." 
</P>
<P>
In barely a passing reference to an issue that was central to the Reagan 
Administration, Bush called for firmness in supporting self-determination and 
democracy throughout Central America, "including in Nicaragua." He made no 
reference to supporting the anti-Sandinista rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to domestic policy, the President said that his budget represents his 
best judgment of how to address the nation's priorities. He acknowledged that, 
while there are areas where he would like to spend more than he proposed, the 
nation could not afford it "until we get our fiscal house in order." 
</P>
<P>
But some initiatives, he said, could fit into next year's budget, even though 
he adhered to his campaign pledge of no new taxes. Among his requests was more 
money to prosecute organized crime and drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean to get tough on the drug criminals," he pledged. "Let me be clear: This 
President will back up those who put their lives on the line every day -- our 
local police officers." 
</P>
<P>
Devoting most of his speech to domestic priorities as he laid out his agenda 
for the first time, Bush spelled out his plans for improving education, 
boosting economic productivity and extending American leadership in technology 
as keys to building a better future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Capital Gains Tax 
</P>
<P>
His previously publicized proposal to cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains 
from highs of 28% or 33% to 15%, he declared, would increase long-term 
investments, increase government revenues, encourage savings and create new 
jobs. But the proposal already has run into heavy fire from Democrats who 
charge that it will favor the rich at the expense of the poor and result in a 
loss of government revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who during the campaign said that he would like to be known as "the 
education President," said that the most important competitiveness program of 
all is one that improves education. 
</P>
<P>
Vowing to work to cut the dropout rate and to make America a more literate 
nation, Bush said: "What it really comes down to is this: The longer our 
graduation lines are today, the shorter our unemployment lines will be 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Calling for "a new attitude about the environment," Bush said that he soon will 
propose clean air legislation that will include a plan to reduce by a fixed 
date the emissions that cause acid rain -- "because the time for study alone 
has passed, and the time for action is now." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan had long delayed action in favor of further study. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called for the indefinite postponement of three proposed lease sales that 
"have raised troubling questions" -- two off the coast of California and one 
that could threaten the Everglades in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"Action on these three lease sales will await the conclusions of a special task 
force set up to measure the potential for environmental damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he also is directing the Justice Department and the 
Environmental Protection Agency "to use every tool at their disposal to speed 
and toughen the enforcement of our laws against toxic waste dumpers." 
</P>
<P>
"I want faster cleanups and tougher enforcement of penalties against 
polluters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking passionately about the "scourge of drugs," the President quoted from a 
letter a mother in Pennsylvania wrote him after being struck by his message on 
drugs in his inaugural address. 
</P>
<P>
Not 12 hours before, the woman wrote, she and her husband had learned that 
their son, "bright, gifted, personable," was addicted to cocaine. "Please, find 
a way to bury the supply of cocaine. Get tough with the pushers. (Our son needs 
your help.)" 
</P>
<P>
"My friends," the President said, "that voice crying out for help could be the 
voice of your own neighbor. Your own friend. Your own son. Over 23 million 
Americans used illegal drugs last year -- at a staggering cost to our nation's 
well-being." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he is asking for an increase of almost $1 billion to escalate 
the war against drugs. Some of the additional funds, he said, would be used to 
expand treatment for the poor and for young mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the money, he said, would be devoted to urban schools and much of it 
would be used to protect the nation's borders against drug trafficking, with 
help from the Coast Guard, the Customs Service, the State and Justice 
departments "and, yes, the U.S. military." 
</P>
<P>
Saying that he is "deeply troubled by the plight of the homeless," the 
President told Congress that "the moral imperative to act is clear." 
</P>
<P>
"We in government cannot stand on the sidelines," he said. "We must confront 
this national shame." His budget called for a $165-million increase over 
Reagan's proposal for spending to combat homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Bush expressed support for Puerto Rican statehood and said that Congress should 
move to let the people of the commonwealth express their opinion in a 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first major issue to confront his young Administration -- the 
crisis in the savings and loan industry -- Bush urged Congress to enact within 
45 days the reform proposals he unveiled on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We must not let this situation fester," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that while most of the thrift institutions are honest, punishment for 
the others must be certain. 
</P>
<P>
"Make no mistake: Those who are corrupt, those who break the law, must be 
kicked out of the business; and they should go to jail," he said. A Justice 
Department task force has been established to investigate fraud in the savings 
and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bush described as "massive" the task the nation faces in cleaning up the 
nuclear waste from "decades of environmental neglect" at nuclear weapons 
plants.

JAMAICA VOTE PUTS SOCIALIST BACK IN POWER 
</P>

KINGSTON, Jamaica 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Michael Manley, a one-time radical socialist who led 
Jamaica to near-collapse in the 1970s, swept back into power Thursday with a 
landslide victory in an election marred by sporadic violence and charges of 
fraud and voter intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
With almost two-thirds of the vote counted, Manley's People's National Party 
led the Jamaica Labor Party of Prime Minister Edward Seaga in 43 of the 
nation's 60 parliamentary voting districts. 
</P>
<P>
Seaga, the Reagan Administration's closest ally in the Caribbean, had bitterly 
complained even before the polls closed that the election was "the most 
fraudulent" that he has seen in 30 years of public life. He charged widespread 
vote stealing and intimidation directed against followers of his party. 
</P>
<P>
Manley, a one-time ally of Cuba's Fidel Castro who now says he is a political 
moderate, also complained of voting irregularities directed against his party. 
Manley rejected Seaga's charges as "a pathetic excuse for the anticipated 
defeat of the JLP." 
</P>
<P>
But in a brief speech conceding defeat less than six hours after the polls 
closed, Seaga indicated that he will not contest the results. "We shall take 
our defeat with a smile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Manley asked an exultant crowd at his own headquarters "to 
take this victory with dignity and with humility." 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to remember the election is over. You must not provoke people. You 
must not crow over people," he said, adding that "when an election is over, we 
who win have a special responsibility to respect those who lose." 
</P>
<P>
Manley said he will seek to meet Seaga soon and urged members of both parties 
to work together. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Fatal Victim 
</P>
<P>
A 25-year-old pregnant woman was shot to death in one of a number of election 
shooting incidents in and near the capital city that left at least four other 
people wounded. But the violence appeared to have been confined to relatively 
few urban districts, with the voting proceeding peacefully through most of the 
countryside and along the rich north coast where the luxury tourist resorts are 
concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign journalists and other observers who toured polling places in Kingston 
and nearby St. Catherine parish, or county, reported isolated clashes between 
supporters of the rival parties and some instances of ballot box theft and 
other irregularities. But most of the voting took place in a peaceful 
atmosphere, which made it appear unlikely that the overall results could be 
challenged successfully. 
</P>
<P>
Radio-dispatched security troops of Jamaica's 3,000-man army and 7,000-man 
police force rushed to trouble spots throughout the day, occasionally firing in 
the air to separate rock-throwing and jeering rivals who crowded near polls in 
the poorer areas of Kingston. Eight military helicopters made frequent sweeps 
over the most heavily populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it would be chaos at first, but we got everything under control 
early. Voting at most of the polling places has gone smoothly," said a senior 
officer at the St. Catherine parish police headquarters at Spanish Town, west 
of Kingston. 
</P>
<P>
Both Seaga and Manley circulated throughout the day among polling places in the 
city, at risk of becoming the focus of turbulence as they sought to quell the 
anxieties of voters and poll officials. 
</P>
<P>
At one Kingston poll, Manley and a group of about 30 People's National Party 
followers were virtually besieged in a voting office by twice that number of 
Labor Party supporters, but security forces arrived before trouble erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Seaga tensely thrust a Cable News Network cameraman aside at another polling 
station, knocking him into an angry crowd of Labor Party voters who seized the 
video-cassette from his camera. The prime minister later issued a public 
apology and invited the CNN crew to rejoin his entourage. 
</P>
<P>
Manley, the apparent winner, was prime minister from 1972 to 1980 when he lost 
a landslide election to Seaga after a prolonged election campaign that left 
more than 700 dead. Then a radical socialist, Manley forged close ties to 
Castro, inviting hundreds of Cuban advisers to Jamaica. His economic 
experiments, which included nationalization of some industries, state-run farms 
and rejection of the International Monetary Fund, alienated local businessmen 
and the international financial community. 
</P>
<P>
His support of Third World causes and close ties to Castro led to increasingly 
sour relations with the United States, which virtually cut off aid to Jamaica 
when the socialist prime minister endorsed the dispatch of Cuban troops to 
Angola. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, a self-described "more laid-back Manley" has claimed 
that he has learned from his mistakes and no longer will pursue his radical 
causes of the past. In a measured and deliberate campaign, he has mended fences 
with Washington and the banking community and pledged no more nationalization 
of industry as well as support for private enterprise in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he will establish "moderate" diplomatic relations with 
Communist Cuba, forging solid relations with the Bush Administration in 
Washington will be his first priority. 
</P>
<P>
Seaga has been Washington's closest friend in the Caribbean since he became the 
first foreign leader to visit President Ronald Reagan after his inauguration in 
1981. He boasted of playing a leading role in the formation of Reagan's 
Caribbean Basin Initiative which has been responsible, in part, for Jamaica's 
return to economic solvency following near-collapse under Manley. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, riding a wave of popularity for his support of the U.S. invasion of 
leftist-ruled Grenada, Seaga called a snap election that Manley's party 
boycotted, giving Seaga's Labor Party a clean sweep of the 60-seat Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's election was the first to be contested in Jamaica since the bloody 
1980 Seaga landslide.

AIDS VIRUS INFECTION IN 2 GROUPS IS LOWER IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two new studies indicate that AIDS virus infection rates in childbearing women 
and newborns in California are much lower than those found in other areas, 
including New York and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the state Department of Health Services suggests that only 123 to 
220 of the more than 500,000 babies born in California last year are likely to 
have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The results of the 
anonymous testing also suggest that fewer than one in 1,000 mothers statewide 
is infected with HIV, the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of a related Los Angeles County study suggest that the rate 
of infection in childbearing women may be even less -- about four in 10,000. 
More detailed geographic data to pinpoint HIV infections within California and 
Los Angeles is not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very good news," said Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, the state health director. 
"It is a much lower rate than any of us had anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
The results indicate a "tremendous opportunity" to prevent further spread of 
the AIDS virus into what is generally regarded as a low-risk group -- 
heterosexual women of childbearing age, according to Dr. Peter Kerndt of the 
Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
That spread is primarily thought to occur -- as it has in New York City and 
Newark -- through intravenous drug use and sexual transmission of HIV to women 
who are the sexual partners of intravenous drug users or bisexual men. By 
preventing the spread of HIV to childbearing women, the transmission of the 
virus to newborns can also be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies have shown that 21 in 10,000 childbearing women are infected 
with the AIDS virus in Massachusetts and 74 in 10,000 are infected in New York, 
compared to 8.3 in 10,000 as found in the California study. 
</P>
<P>
The explanation for the differences between the two coasts is not entirely 
clear. They may include differences in the interactions between gay males and 
intravenous drug users as well as differences in the needle-sharing practices 
of addicts. Sharing of contaminated drug injection equipment is a very 
effective mechanism of spreading HIV, hepatitis and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Kizer said that while the new data is encouraging, increased 
voluntary HIV testing for pregnant women remains a priority, particularly for 
those who may be at high risk of carrying the virus. 
</P>
<P>
"The message to the individual continues to be the same, whether it is safe sex 
and monogamy or testing. . . . The fact that population-wise we are not in as 
bad a way as some other places does not lessen the need for individuals to make 
informed and safe decisions,." Kizer said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the country's 16,800 reported AIDS cases in heterosexual intravenous 
drug users and the 1,400 cases in children have occurred on the East Coast. 
Between 1981 and the end of January, there had been 649 intravenous drug use 
cases and 112 pediatric cases reported in California. Half of the pediatric 
cases involved transmission of HIV from infected mothers and half involved 
transmission from contaminated blood products. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer declined to credit the low infection rate in California as "indicating 
something about the success of our educational programs" because "I just don't 
think we have the data to show it." 
</P>
<P>
A positive AIDS antibodies test on a baby indicates that its mother is infected 
with HIV but does not necessarily mean that the baby is also infected. Current 
evidence suggests that only 30% to 50% of the babies who test positive are 
carrying the virus. The other babies test positive simply because they receive 
the antibody proteins from their mother; the proteins are subsequently shed 
over a period of several months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Answers Sought 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are still trying to determine why some of these babies become 
infected and others do not. 
</P>
<P>
State heath officials anonymously tested blood samples for all live births in 
California during July, 1988. Of 43,301 samples tested, the presence of AIDS 
antibodies was confirmed in 36 babies, or 8.3 in 10,000 samples. 
</P>
<P>
From this result, Department of Health Services officials estimated that 
between 410 and 440 babies were born to HIV-infected mothers in 1988 and 
between 123 and 220 babies are likely to have become infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
The testing is possible because, under the state newborn screening program, the 
heel of each baby is stuck with a needle before hospital discharge and spots of 
blood are collected on a piece of filter paper to be screened for three 
inherited, but preventable, forms of mental retardation -- galactosemia, 
hypothyroidism and PKU, or phenylketonuria. Similar sampling is mandated for 
babies born at home. 
</P>
<P>
The newborn screening program prevents a total of 120 to 130 mental retardation 
cases a year -- which is similar to the number of new HIV infections estimated 
to occur in the state each year. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said he does not currently support mandatory non-anonymous HIV testing 
for all newborns, as is done for the other diseases, because there are no 
proven treatments that need to be "implemented immediately." But he added: "If 
something should change where a treatment were to come along . . . then I think 
we would obviously rethink that." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County is separately testing 9,400 consecutive specimens of 
umbilical cord blood samples from babies born at four large hospitals between 
early September and early December, 1988, said Kerndt, the medical director of 
the county's AIDS epidemiology program. Anonymous tests on 7,200 specimens have 
been completed; the presence of AIDS antibodies was confirmed in three babies, 
or 4.2 in 10,000 samples. 
</P>
<P>
Kerndt declined to identify the hospitals, but said that they included the 
facilities in the county where HIV-infected mothers were most likely to be 
cared for. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. George Rutherford of the San Francisco Department of Public Health said 
that it would not be surprising if infections in childbearing women turned out 
to be more common in San Francisco because per capita "there is more HIV 
infection (here) than anywhere else in the state." 
</P>
<P>
Between 15% and 20% of the 10,000 to 12,000 active heterosexual intravenous 
drug users in San Francisco are believed to carry the AIDS virus, Rutherford 
said. By comparison, only about 3% of the estimated 80,000 to 120,000 active 
intravenous drug users in Los Angeles County are thought to be infected, 
according to Kerndt. 
</P>
<P>
In some large East Coast cities, such as New York City and Newark, the 
situation is much different. Recent studies show that as many as 60% of New 
York City's estimated 250,000 intravenous drug users may carry the AIDS virus 
and that one in 77 babies born in the city has AIDS antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next several months, California health officials expect to complete 
testing on an additional 85,000 newborn blood samples from August and 
September, 1988, according to Frank J. Capell, an epidemiologist with the state 
Office of AIDS. The results for July through September will be analyzed by age 
and race of the mother, and the county and ZIP code of the mother's residence. 
</P>
<P>
Similar data will also be collected and analyzed for July through September of 
this year. The cost of the ongoing research project is about $800,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
As of Feb. 6, 85,590 AIDS cases and 48,957 deaths had been reported in the 
United States. As of the end of January, 17,521 AIDS cases and 10,431 deaths 
had been reported in California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HIV INFECTIONS IN CHILDBEARING WOMEN 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Health Services and the Los Angeles County 
Department of Health Services have released data on the rate of human 
immunodeficiency virus infections in childbearing women and newborns. Current 
medical evidence suggests that between 30% and 50% of infants born to 
HIV-infected mothers will become infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
The rates for California and Los Angeles are much lower than rates for other 
areas of the country for which comparable data is available. The statistics are 
based on tests of tens of thousands of blood samples.

<TEXT>
<P>
The budget that President Bush delivered to Congress on Thursday accomplishes a 
bit of fiscal legerdemain: It lops billions of dollars from the federal deficit 
even as it avoids many of the difficult choices that the nation must confront 
in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
In his $1.16-trillion budget and in his nationally televised speech to 
Congress, the President laid out in considerable detail where he would like to 
boost government spending to support his priorities of education, science, drug 
abuse, child care, environmental protection and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush, continuing to rely on his campaign slogan promising a "flexible 
freeze" on most spending programs, remained generally unclear about where he 
would find the savings necessary to pay for his new programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth 'Not Preordained' 
</P>
<P>
"We can afford to increase spending -- by a modest amount but enough to invest 
in key priorities -- and still cut the deficit by almost 40% in one year," Bush 
told Congress. "But to do that, we must recognize that growth above inflation 
in federal programs is not preordained, that not all spending initiatives were 
designed to be immortal." 
</P>
<P>
As he promised frequently while campaigning for the presidency, Social Security 
benefits would not be affected. Bush agreed to keep government payments to the 
elderly and disabled rising with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than embracing many of the unpopular spending cuts that former President 
Ronald Reagan advocated in his farewell budget last month, however, Bush 
singled out only a handful of programs for reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Without saying precisely how, he proposed paring about $5 billion from Medicare 
spending increases and allowing the defense budget to grow only at the rate of 
inflation next year. He also said he would eliminate the cost-of-living 
adjustment for federal retirees for one year. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest of the fiscal 1990 budget, Bush proposed his "flexible freeze" -- 
a cap on overall spending at exactly the same level as the current year, 
without any allowance for inflation. Future negotiations with Congress would 
determine where Washington should extract savings from a host of domestic 
programs defended by hundreds of politically powerful interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the 'Alice in Wonderland' year of budgeting through the looking 
glass," said Carol Cox, head of the Committee on a Responsible Federal Budget, 
a citizens' group. "I'm sure Congress will find many of the add-ons Bush offers 
very attractive. But I don't think they will find the cuts necessary to pay for 
them any more appealing than the President does." 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, 
defended Bush's approach as more politically realistic than Reagan's proposed 
wholesale eliminations of popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is meaningless for the Executive Branch to write down exactly what it 
proposes to cut under those headings. It doesn't happen," Darman told reporters 
during a briefing in advance of Bush's speech. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do is first agree on a cap," Darman said, "and then we can 
have serious negotiations about what goes up and what goes down . . . . It's 
totally unfair to suggest there isn't an enormous amount of specificity in this 
program." 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bush promised those budget talks. "My team and I are ready to 
work with the Congress," Bush promised, "to negotiate in good faith, to work 
day and night -- if that's what it takes -- to meet the budget targets and to 
produce a budget on time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approach Questioned 
</P>
<P>
But even some Republican economists questioned whether Bush's approach would 
accomplish that goal. 
</P>
<P>
"If a larger share of the national output is to go to investment, assistance to 
the poor and education, and if the share going to defense is not to be reduced 
very much, what will get a smaller share?" asked Herbert Stein, chief White 
House economist under former President Richard M. Nixon. "Failure to come to 
grips with this question is at the heart of our budget problem and our national 
priorities problem." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bush's budget blueprint rests on a shaky foundation of 
optimistic economic assumptions and a questionable assertion that cutting 
capital gains taxes for the wealthy will generate higher revenues for the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bush's plan, the economy is expected to plow ahead at a brisk rate of 
more than 3% this year, even as interest rates fall sharply from their current 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Falling Interest Predicted 
</P>
<P>
With four months of the current fiscal year already gone and rates on 
three-month Treasury bills now at 8.5%, Bush is nonetheless forecasting that 
interest rates will average 7.4% for the whole fiscal year. And, according to 
the White House scenario, rates will continue falling for several more years. 
</P>
<P>
Darman defended the projections as credible. "If this program is enacted 
promptly," he said, "we believe there would be a sharp decline in interest 
rates." 
</P>
<P>
Bush asserted that his capital gains proposal -- cutting the maximum tax rate 
on long-term profits to 15% from the current 28% or 33% -- would generate about 
$5 billion in additional revenues next year, another $5 billion the following 
year and lesser amounts in subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
In the short term, the Administration says, the capital gains tax cut would 
encourage more sales of investments. And in the longer term, it says, the cut 
would enhance economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
But many economists dispute those contentions and the proposal already has 
encountered stiff opposition from key Democrats on Capitol Hill. House Ways and 
Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) promised to oppose it 
vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not about to tell the wage earners in Chicago that they should pay a 
higher tax than stockbrokers," Rostenkowski told the National Press Club only 
hours before Bush's address to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Facing Congress and the Administration is the ticking time bomb of the 
Gramm-Rudman budget law, which sets a deficit target of $100 billion for the 
1990 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. If the White House and Congress fail to 
agree by early next fall on a plan to come within $10 billion of that goal, the 
law would trigger automatic spending cuts that would hit defense and domestic 
spending programs equally hard. 
</P>
<P>
Because lawmakers are required to follow the relatively optimistic White House 
economic projections, it is possible that Congress and the President could 
skirt the deficit dilemma this year. In contrast to the White House projection 
that the deficit will fall to $91 billion from an expected $163 billion this 
year, the Congressional Budget Office has projected that next year's deficit 
would reach $120 billion, even if all the cuts Reagan had proposed were to be 
enacted. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, however, the task will be even more difficult.

SENATE REVIVES, OKS ONE ANTI-INSURER BILL BUT REJECTS ANOTHER

<P>
The insurance industry's efforts to hold steady against a tide of anti-industry 
sentiment brought mixed results Thursday as the Senate revived legislation that 
would prevent arbitrary policy cancellations but rejected a bill to keep 
insurers from using a variety of techniques to boost premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures encountered strong opposition from Republicans, who argued that 
their passage would create an anti-business climate in California. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, the Senate, in the absence of several key supporters, narrowly 
rejected the bill, by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys), to severely punish 
insurers that order blanket policy cancellations. On Thursday, Robbins was able 
to pick up the bare two-thirds majority needed to reverse last week's action 
and send the measure to the Assembly on a vote of 27 to 9. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gains Some Support 
</P>
<P>
Robbins revived his measure, in part, by picking up support from three 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
But Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) saw his measure 
defeated on a straight party-line vote, 24 to 12. The bill, which required 27 
votes for passage, was aimed at keeping insurers from forcing new clients into 
more costly policies. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Roberti pledged to bring the bill back for reconsideration, but 
would not say when. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do it as soon as I have the 27 votes," Roberti said. "This was just the 
preliminary gambit. I had to do what Sen. Robbins did last week to see who is 
with me. Now I can work on the other votes." Thursday's split decision 
underscored the partisan tug-of-war that has emerged in the insurance debate 
since voters in November, facing steadily increasing auto insurance costs, 
narrowly passed the Ralph Nader-backed Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be solid majority support in the Democratic-controlled 
Legislature for measures seeking to punish insurers that try to circumvent the 
initiative's restrictions. But because most of these bills are "urgency" 
measures designed to take effect immediately, they require a two-thirds vote 
for passage. 
</P>
<P>
That means Republicans, despite their minority status, can sidetrack the bills 
if they vote as a bloc. 
</P>
<P>
The Robbins bill was introduced after it appeared that some insurers would make 
good on threats to cancel policies and pull out of the state after voter 
approval of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative already bars cancellations except where good cause can be shown, 
which includes failure to pay premiums or a substantial increase in risk. 
Violators are subject to fines of up to $100,000. The Robbins bill would impose 
much stiffer fines, including a maximum penalty equal to half the premiums 
collected in the previous year on all canceled policies. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, few companies followed through on the threats, giving the insurance 
industry much less reason to oppose the bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Travelers Backed Down 
</P>
<P>
Travelers Insurance, the largest insurer to order blanket cancellations, backed 
down under pressure from state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie. On 
Thursday, Gillespie ordered four smaller insurer groups to halt their practice 
of refusing to renew auto policies. The orders were directed at National 
Indemnity Co., AIU Insurance, Central Mutual Insurance and its affiliate All 
American Insurance, and Dairyland Insurance and its affiliate Sentry Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the cancellation provisions, Robbins' measure would close a 
loophole in Proposition 103 under which some drivers convicted of drunk or 
reckless driving could nonetheless qualify for 20% "good driver" discounts once 
the initiative's regulations are fully in force. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Sens. John Seymour of Anaheim and James Nielsen of Rohnert Park 
voted for the bill last week when it fell three votes short of passage and did 
so once again on Thursday. In addition to picking up the votes of two Democrats 
who were absent last week, Robbins garnered an additional Republican vote on 
Thursday from Sen. Newton R. Russell of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Robbins said he would seek to have the bill considered by the 
Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee before the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear what kind of a reception the bill will face in the Assembly. No 
major insurance bill has been put to a floor vote in the lower house since 
voters passed Proposition 103. Legislation to freeze insurance rates until the 
Supreme Court completes its legal review of the initiative narrowly passed the 
Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee and is awaiting a floor vote. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the Robbins bill, the Roberti insurance legislation poses a more 
difficult and complex array of problems for insurers. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would impose tough penalties on insurers who stop issuing new auto 
policies, on those who channel new applicants to affiliated firms that charge 
more for the same coverage, and on those who change their underwriting 
standards so that premiums for new applicants rise by more than 5%. Senate 
sources familiar with the insurance industry maintain that a number of 
companies have used one or more of these techniques to cut their losses or to 
increase revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the state insurance commissioner would be required to revoke 
the licenses of companies found to have "willfully" violated its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy Potential 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Seymour, one of the three Republicans who supported Robbins' bill, said he 
could not vote for the Roberti measure because it has the potential of 
bankrupting the insurance industry and paving the way for a state-operated 
insurance system. "The only thing this bill does is cut the legs off the 
insurance industry and guarantee that someday we will have state insurance," 
Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti countered that without severe penalties, insurance companies may seek 
to punish voters for supporting Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people voted to change the law out of a deep sense of frustration and I 
don't believe they should be penalized because they expressed themselves at the 
polls," he said.

CHANGE FACING DEMOCRATS AS STATE CONVENTION OPENS 
</P>

<P>
The California Democratic Party opens its 1989 convention here today more 
powerful and full of promise than in years. And also more uneasy with itself. 
</P>
<P>
This is a party to which few things come without a fight, certainly not change. 
And change is what the Democrats are here to confront this weekend -- change in 
leadership, change in direction and change in standing. 
</P>
<P>
After welcoming receptions and caucus sessions tonight, the fulminations erupt 
Saturday with the election of a new party chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Comeback-minded Edmund G. Brown Jr. has campaigned for the office with the same 
zing he brought to two successful campaigns for the governorship and two 
Quixotic runs for the presidency. He has built an army of field organizers, 
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, papered the town with buttons and 
banners -- bringing spotlights to what would otherwise be a piddlingly small 
footnote of an election. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is the favorite of the Establishment, which welcomes his pledge of 
Democratic renewal and new purposefulness for the 1990 and 1992 elections. And 
he is likewise the favorite of the star-struck and casual Democrat, those bored 
with the party's withdrawn, club-like existence in the shadows of politics. 
</P>
<P>
"With your help, we'll have the most exciting Democratic party in the country!" 
he enthused. 
</P>
<P>
Few doubt Brown on this particular promise. 
</P>
<P>
Old-line party regulars, however, fear too much change all at once. They have 
backed the rival candidacy of up-from-the-ranks investment banker Steve Westly 
of Menlo Park. Westly does not promise to forestall the make-over of the party, 
only to manage change with less fireworks and with more of a mind to keeping 
current insiders from being trampled in the stampede. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Brown is believed to be a shoo-in, Westly supporters cheerfully 
remind themselves they have beaten the odds and the Establishment before. And 
Westly is not without his own share of Establishment support, with backing from 
14 state lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, everyone agrees the California Democratic Party of 1989 and beyond 
will be different and more important than it has been for several generations. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is simple, as you might expect. Money. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first party convention since voters approved the June, 1988, ballot 
initiative that imposed campaign contribution limits of $1,000 per donor per 
year in state races. No more will kingmakers shell out $10,000 and $50,000 and 
$250,000 contributions. 
</P>
<P>
It is widely presumed, though, that the political party apparatus will be 
enlisted to pick up some of the slack and become a meaningful, independent 
force in the election of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Through fund-raising, by way of voter registration drives and in any number of 
other as yet-unexplored ways, the potential of the parties to influence 
elections emerges as a tantalizing lure. And it has attracted the interest of 
Brown and other politicians who can smell power the way a wolverine smells 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the parties are going to be co-equals in the election process," outgoing 
Chairman Peter D. Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's candidacy is a measure of the party's spirited potential. 
</P>
<P>
The former governor emerged from six years as a near-recluse with a promise to 
transform the Democratic Party into an important weapon in expanding the 
influence of liberals. He hopes to follow the path of conservatives and employ 
modern technology to build large mailing lists and raise millions of dollars in 
small amounts from thousands of contributors. 
</P>
<P>
And beyond that, Brown, always the dreamer, has spoken in private with friends 
about more elaborate ideas -- such as establishing a permanent Democratic Party 
television telethon, full of entertainment and excitement, to try and engage 
more people in politics and raise more money. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this transition to power for the Democratic Party is under way. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the agenda for the 2,802 delegates will be to say thanks and goodby to 
Kelly, a Los Angeles lawyer and twice chairman of the party. Often caught in 
the small wars between party regulars who are suspicious of elected officials 
and vice versa, Kelly nonetheless endeavored to bring Democrats into the modern 
age of fund-raising. In his most recent term, telephone fund-raising resulted 
in expanding the party's list of proven, small-scale donors from 25,000 to 
115,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The next chairman can now count on raising $1 million a year without getting 
out of bed," Kelly said. "We've laid a lot of the groundwork for the future." 
</P>
<P>
The future really begins with the 1990 elections. Democrats might have been 
expected at this convention to show off their bench of talent for the upcoming 
elections. By almost every measure, it is deeper, more experienced and better 
positioned than the Republican lineup. But Brown is expected to dominate much 
of the convention, and rising stars have been cast in lesser roles. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's sister, Kathleen, for instance, will not even address the convention, 
even though her budding candidacy for the office of state treasurer is one of 
the most talked-about topics in Democratic political circles. She is content to 
remain behind the scenes trying to sign up supporters one by one, offering 
herself as a "different shade of Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the Democratic lineup of 1990 contenders remains unexpectedly 
bottlenecked at this convention. State Controller Gray Davis and Lt. Gov. Leo 
T. McCarthy have not yet decided whether to seek reelection or run for 
governor. And this has put a hold on the ambitions of any number of men and 
women farther down the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, McCarthy and Davis will give back-to-back speeches Saturday, 
along with Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, the party's only contender who says 
he has crossed the point of no return in the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein is a fourth would-be Democratic 
governor. Only at the last minute has she decided to attend the convention. 
Officials said she had not yet asked for time to make a speech. Instead, she 
told supporters she just wanted to meet and woo delegates one by one and "make 
her presence felt." 
</P>
<P>
Her relations with Democratic activists are strained, to say the least, as a 
result of the comfort she gave Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson in his 1988 
reelection. In that race, Feinstein took the rare step of refusing to endorse 
the Democratic nominee, Leo McCarthy, and instead expressed her fond feelings 
for Wilson and all he had done for the betterment of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, Wilson seems the likely GOP nominee for governor in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Looking still farther down the election calendar, the Democrats will hear from 
two of their likely 1992 presidential contenders -- Jesse Jackson and Rep. 
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, both losers in 1988. They will also speak 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very hungry group, these Democrats," said convention spokesman Steve 
Hopcraft. "We're going to try here to define the issues of 1990 and 1992 in 
ways that favor Democrats rather than in ways that keep us on the defensive." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, ridicule the party for squandering its agenda at this 
convention, which is one of the few political events of 1989 that is sure to 
attract coverage by California television stations. 
</P>
<P>
Critics point to a scheduled keynote speech from a virtually unknown physicist, 
S.B. Woo, the former lieutenant governor of Delaware. His subject is 
competitiveness. Three representatives of defeated presidential candidate 
Michael S. Dukakis address the delegates. And until House Speaker Jim Wright 
(D-Tex.) canceled at the last minute, he held a prime speaking slot, never mind 
the congressional pay raise fury. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also complain that Kelly has listed himself on the program seven times 
and given his allies roles far surpassing their importance in the upcoming 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a choreography of pratfalls," sniffed one Democratic consultant. "What 
they ought to be doing is more to highlight their candidates for 1990." 
</P>
<P>
In the era of swirling change for the party, however, traditionalists are not 
to be denied entirely. The convention promises a pair of old-fashioned, 
knuckle-busting, sour-stomach resolution fights in the classic traditions of 
the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
One battle sure to raise blood pressures, particularly among Jews, would put 
the party on record favoring a Palestinian homeland. The other reaffirms the 
Democratic Party's pro-choice platform -- a move that stems from Brown's recent 
declaration that he opposes abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're Democrats. It doesn't always look pretty," Hopcraft said. "But that's 
why we're not Republicans."

BAKER MAY BE FORCED TO SELL BANK HOLDINGS; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS RULES STUDIED TO SEE IF HIS DECISIONS COULD AFFECT COMPANIES

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III may be required to divest himself of 
large bank stock holdings under the Bush Administration's new, more stringent 
interpretations of government ethics rules, Baker aides said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But they denied a report in today's Washington Post that President Bush's top 
ethics adviser, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, has been pressing Baker to 
divest the stocks, or that Baker has resisted Gray's advice. 
</P>
<P>
"They have not come to him and told him he has to divest," a senior Baker aide 
said. "There is no decision on that. . . . Should they ever come to him and say 
that, then he has a decision to make." 
</P>
<P>
"If they tell him to sell his stocks, he'll do it," another Baker adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Interpretation 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the proper response to a new interpretation of government ethics 
standards that require officials to avoid making decisions that could directly 
affect -- or appear to affect -- their own private investments. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has owned large blocks of bank and oil stocks since well before he came 
to Washington as former President Ronald Reagan's White House chief of staff in 
1981 -- including a substantial holding in Chemical New York Corp., a bank 
holding company that has more than $4 billion in loans to Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's Chemical stock derives from his family's holdings in a Texas bank that 
his grandfather, James A. Baker Sr., founded and which, as Texas Commerce 
Bankshares, was acquired by Chemical in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
As White House chief of staff and, later, as secretary of the Treasury, Baker 
complied with ethics rules by putting his holdings in a blind trust and by 
recusing himself from policy issues that might affect those companies 
particularly, his aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Before he was confirmed as secretary of state last month, Baker filed new 
letters of recusal to cover his holdings, they said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Justice Department in 1987 issued new, more stringent, 
interpretations of the requirements of the Ethics in Government Act. Under the 
new interpretation, an official can be charged with a conflict of interest not 
only on issues that specifically affect a company, but on general policy 
questions that could have a "direct and predictable effect" on holdings, 
according to lawyers who have advised Baker. 
</P>
<P>
In Baker's case, that could cover an enormous range of policy decisions on 
international economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
There are two possible courses of action for Baker: either divest the holdings, 
or ask Gray for a specific waiver of the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Waiver Authority' 
</P>
<P>
"We think it would be a good idea if he used the waiver authority," a senior 
Baker adviser said. "Under the law . . . the White House counsel can look at 
the holdings and may determine that they are not so substantial as to affect 
the integrity of his decision-making." 
</P>
<P>
Gray discussed the issue with Baker aides last month, before Baker was 
confirmed as secretary of state, and initially said that he was prepared to 
waive the requirement, the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the next day, he said he was not prepared to sign the waiver," the adviser 
said. "It was not a clear decision that a waiver was not appropriate . . . and 
the lawyers are still working on the issue." 
</P>
<P>
"Baker is a very careful lawyer, and he's always relied on the advice of the 
government's lawyers. He has done what the White House told him to do. If 
something more needs to be done, he'll do it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says He Would Sell 
</P>
<P>
"Putting the recusal in effect is what they've advised him to do. If they tell 
him to sell his stocks, he'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's investments are in a "qualified blind trust," a structure that puts the 
assets in the hands of a trustee but allows the owner to know, at least 
generally, what his holdings are. 
</P>
<P>
The value of Baker's shares in Chemical has not been disclosed. In the 
financial disclosure statement he filed this year, it was listed as worth "over 
$250,000," a category that could reach much higher.

Eight Mariel Cubans ordered deported by special federal review panels were 
flown back to their homeland Thursday, the Justice Department announced. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubans were being flown aboard a government plane from Birmingham, Ala., to 
an airport outside Havana, said Joe Krovisky, a Justice Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The eight are among 33 who have been ordered deported since December, when 
Justice Department panels began reviewing the cases of 400 Cubans who entered 
this country illegally during the so-called Mariel boatlift of 1980.

DEMOCRACY FOR PARAGUAY? SIGNALS FROM THE NEW REGIME ARE STILL MIXED 
</P>

ASUNCION, Paraguay 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a street corner across from the presidential palace, a young man was 
purposefully gluing freshly printed posters this week over those that bore the 
visage of the former president, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. 
</P>
<P>
"Real Democracy. President of the Republic Gen. Andres Rodriguez," the new 
poster declares. Below Rodriguez's smiling face is a quotation: "My government 
will fight without rest so that there is a dynamic reality in our country, and 
not a piece of the graveyard." 
</P>
<P>
Those seeking reason to believe that one military strongman has replaced 
another in Paraguay could seize on the appearance of the new posters as one of 
the signs of continuity. Such propaganda dominated nearly every wall during 
Stroessner's era. 
</P>
<P>
But others, yearning to glimpse signals that a new era lies ahead, preferred to 
look elsewhere. Down the block, for example, a newsstand was doing brisk 
business selling El Pueblo, the weekly newspaper of the opposition Febrerista 
Party, which reappeared Tuesday for the first time since Stroessner banned it 
in mid-1987. 
</P>
<P>
The first edition of the eight-page broadsheet, in an editorial entitled "The 
Big Test Has Begun," found reason for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"To have a president who shakes the people's hands is a miracle," El Pueblo 
said. "And who truly smiles. To have a president who is moved by applause, 
because he knows that no one was threatened with dismissal for not applauding, 
is a transcendental event." 
</P>
<P>
In the early, honeymoon days after the end of Stroessner's 34 1/2-year reign, 
everyone is hunting for indicators to determine where Rodriguez is heading -- 
whether he will introduce pluralism, end repression of government foes, crack 
down on corruption and favoritism and allow more civil freedoms -- all of which 
he promised after overthrowing Stroessner in a violent coup last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, his style is different from that of the gruff, tyrannical 
Stroessner. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Stroessner took office after his own coup in 1954, he ordered all 
radio stations to begin the day by broadcasting the "Gen. Stroessner Polka," 
then a patriotic song followed by these words: "The constitutional president of 
the republic, Division Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, salutes the Paraguayan people 
and wishes them a prosperous day with happiness and work. With Stroessner: God, 
country, work and well-being." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meets With Press 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez even met with the press the day after Stroessner flew into exile in 
Brazil. The old-guard functionaries in the presidential palace were baffled 
trying to organize such an rare gathering, and Paraguayan reporters said they 
found the chaos refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government sided with the cautious optimists Thursday, formally 
recognizing the new government a week after the coup. U.S. Ambassador Timothy 
L. Towell said that Rodriguez's declared commitment to democracy and civil 
rights and his promise to suppress drug trafficking were among "a number of 
things that have never happened before. That, in and of itself, is rather an 
optimistic development." 
</P>
<P>
"Their credibility will be based on following through on what they say they're 
going to do," Towell said. "Words are not enough." 
</P>
<P>
The new government still requires all radio stations to broadcast 
simultaneously the day's official pronouncements, including a healthy dose of 
news about the ruling Colorado Party. But Rodriguez's government so far has not 
followed the Stroessner practice of making intimidating phone calls to Radio 
Caritas, the Roman Catholic station that serves as the primary opposition 
outlet, and has virtually approved the reopening of Humberto Rubin's closed 
all-news station, Radio Nanduti, as well as the main opposition newspaper, ABC 
Color. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elections Planned 
</P>
<P>
Yet, like Stroessner did after his coup in 1954, Rodriguez announced that there 
will be elections in three months, and it quickly became clear that he will be 
the candidate for the Colorado Party. So Paraguay is not yet likely to join its 
Latin American neighbors in electing a civilian president. Rodriguez, who was 
Stroessner's No. 2 as the senior army commander, announced the balloting for 
May 1, which the opposition complained was much too soon for them to organize 
an effective challenge. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a century, Paraguay has had two major political forces, the 
Colorados and the Liberals. Under Stroessner, the largest Liberal faction, the 
Authentic Radical Liberal Party, was banned. Its leader, Domingo Laino, was 
arrested more than 100 times during his three-decade-long campaign against 
Stroessner. Laino was beaten up, harassed, vilified and spent time in exile. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after Stroessner surrendered to Rodriguez last Friday, Laino was at the 
Colorado Party headquarters during a rally for its new leaders when a bunch of 
Colorado members grabbed him by the arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were going to hit me," Laino said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they led him to the podium, put a Colorado Party bandanna around his 
neck and cheered his emotional, impromptu speech envisioning a new and 
democratic Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
Under Stroessner, the chances of Laino addressing the Colorado Party had been 
about as remote as Cuban President Fidel Castro speaking to a Republican Party 
convention in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Laino, expected to be the lone opposition candidate for president, held 
constant meetings in his 19th-Century house, a decaying version of an 
antebellum Southern manse which serves as the opposition headquarters. He said 
the three-party opposition alliance will decide whether to participate in the 
May 1 election after receiving the government's reply on demands for a delay in 
the vote and a range of legal changes to ensure a fair election. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't ask for perfection in the elections," Laino, 53, said Thursday. "But 
yes, we seek certain norms of fairness. We ask that the government be flexible, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
The alliance, called the National Accord, plans its first legal rally Saturday. 
However, there were few signs that the opposition, confined for years to 
complaining about Stroessner, was hurrying to build the grass-roots 
organization that will be necessary to challenge the omnipresent Colorado 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the torpor of Asuncion matches the changeless Stroessner years. An 
ancient steam locomotive chugs around the city's freight yard and an old 
trolley clatters down narrow Palma Street, where Koreans sell electronic goods 
-- Paraguay is Latin America's contraband paradise -- and hawkers offer fake 
designer watches. 
</P>
<P>
The tropical afternoon heat is so severe that business begins as early as 7 
a.m., and most stores crank down their metal shutters around noon. During the 
siesta, the searing sidewalks are empty. For a town with more than 500,000 
residents, and with some office buildings going up among the decaying balconied 
houses, Asuncion hasn't yet lost its Spanish colonial atmosphere. In the 
evenings, families in the whitewashed, run-down row houses a few blocks from 
downtown bring their chairs out to the curb and pass the time chatting and 
drinking mate, the local herbal tea. 
</P>
<P>
The fears of the Stroessner years have not vanished overnight. This is a 
society accustomed to giving and receiving orders, not debating and competing. 
Building a culture of democracy, one diplomat said, will not be easy, even if 
Rodriguez lives up to his promise to encourage pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
Stroessner did bring stability to a country where one coup used to follow 
another in quick succession. In 1947, a 15-month civil war saw six presidents 
come and go, and more coups and countercoups followed until Stroessner came to 
power. He stayed by co-opting the Colorado Party, putting faithful allies in 
the right places in the military and suppressing all opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Many Paraguayans find that people are willing to speak more freely now, less 
concerned about informers and police intelligence agents since the rebel forces 
shot up and routed the police headquarters -- a Stroessner stronghold -- during 
the fighting last week. Even if Rodriguez were so inclined, people reason, it 
would take a while to re-establish the apparatus of repression under a new 
command. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it has become hard to find anyone in the capital who ever had been a 
supporter of the previous government, at least in its final couple of years. 
Suddenly, all Paraguayans are democrats, along with Gen. Rodriguez, who says he 
realized a while ago that Stroessner had erred. 
</P>
<P>
However, after the initial vicious condemnation of a fallen dictator, the tone 
toward Stroessner has already changed. Rodriguez used mellow words to describe 
a man he said was manipulated by ill-intentioned advisers, and that has become 
the official line on the Stroessner era. 
</P>
<P>
The new foreign minister, Luis Maria Argana, who had been thrown off the 
Supreme Court by Stroessner, told reporters that the former president had 
governed well for his first, say, 32 or 33 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
Argana said he did not want to dwell on the Stroessner era, adding, "The 
triumph erased the past." 
</P>
<P>
A huge neon sign across the top of the National Bank on Heroes Plaza in the 
center of town used to declare: "Peace and Progress With Stroessner." Soon 
after the coup, the word "Stroessner" came down. Some wondered if "Rodriguez" 
was about to go up in its place. But a few days later, the rest of the sign was 
also removed. So far, nothing stands in its place.

TOWER DELAY WEAKENS PENTAGON'S POLICY-MAKING ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
While John Tower's confirmation as defense secretary is mired in the Senate by 
allegations of possible impropriety, key decisions that the Pentagon chief 
ordinarily would take the lead in making are being co-opted by the White House 
and State Department, senior Pentagon officials complained Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A review of the first critical military decision facing the Bush Administration 
-- how to modernize the nation's arsenal of land-based nuclear missiles -- is 
being directed by National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, not by Tower, 
Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, due next week, will have far-reaching effects on the Pentagon 
budget, on U.S.-Soviet arms control negotiations and on the structure of 
America's nuclear deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Power Ebbing Away 
</P>
<P>
On other central questions, from conventional arms control talks to the 
Strategic Defense Initiative, Defense Department officials say, power is ebbing 
away from the Pentagon and toward Scowcroft, Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III and White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy's taken such a beating, it's going to take a long time to recover," a 
senior Defense Department official who supports Tower said. "Darman's moved in 
on the budget, Scowcroft's moved in on the strategic review and Baker's off 
making policy with the NATO allies." 
</P>
<P>
These Defense Department officials worry that, even if Tower is confirmed, he 
will have difficulty re-establishing the Pentagon's authority over military 
policy-making. 
</P>
<P>
Tower has been working for the last week at a special Pentagon transition 
office and has met regularly with Bush, Scowcroft and other top Administration 
officials. But the intense controversy generated by continuing allegations 
about his behavior have been a considerable distraction, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Full Partner 
</P>
<P>
Tower has joined in substantive discussions about the missile decision and arms 
control talks, but he is not a full partner, Administration sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The government faces an immediate decision on which mobile missile system to 
recommend to ensure that the nation's land-based missile force could survive a 
first strike. Congress has set a Feb. 15 deadline for choosing between putting 
10-warhead MX missiles on railroad cars or building the single-warhead, 
truck-mounted Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has reserved $350 million for research and development on one of the 
two systems and is awaiting the Administration's recommendation on how the 
money should be spent. 
</P>
<P>
During his second debate with Democratic presidential candidate Michael S. 
Dukakis last fall, Bush said that "my secretary of defense is going to have to 
make a very difficult decision (on) which system to go forward with." 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the deadline approaches, Bush has no secretary of defense and the 
decision has been assigned to Scowcroft. Deputy Defense Secretary William H. 
Taft IV, a Ronald Reagan Administration holdover, is acting defense secretary 
but he is not part of this deliberation, Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A White House aide confirmed that Scowcroft is leading the policy review on the 
missile question, but Air Force officials suggested that the decision may be 
postponed until a new defense secretary is installed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favors Midgetman 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Scowcroft was chairman of a commission that concluded that the 
Midgetman was the best alternative for solving the problem of vulnerability of 
land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. He has been an outspoken 
advocate of the Midgetman, although he supported building a limited number of 
the bigger MX missiles also. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republican senators rallied around the embattled nominee in a round 
of television talk-show appearances Thursday. Tower's confirmation has been 
held up by allegations of drinking, womanizing and receiving illegal campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"For those who have known him for a very long time, it's very significant that 
they have never seen him incapacitated, never seen him drunk," Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is 
considering the nomination, said on NBC's "Today" show. 
</P>
<P>
And, speaking on ABC's "Good Morning America," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) said of the nomination: "I don't think it's in a bit of trouble. I 
think that these rumors are going to be checked out, as they should be. They're 
going to be proved false, and we'll confirm John Tower, hopefully in the next 
couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
"The experience of people, including the chairman of that (Armed Services) 
committee, have been that they have never seen John Tower impaired because of 
drinking . . . they have never seen him drunk, they have never seen him unable 
to perform duty, never seen him fail to show up for an appointment," Sen. 
Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) said on "CBS This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
However, Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) said that Tower will be unable to deal 
with the biggest procurement problem in recent years, flaws in the B1-B bomber. 
Pressler noted that, in 2 1/2 years out of government, Tower received more than 
$600,000 in consulting and lobbying fees from defense contractors who worked on 
the bomber program. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said that, if 
Tower eventually is confirmed, he will not be so damaged that he cannot manage 
the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"If the outcome is a green light, then it's my view that he will have gone 
through the most exhaustive process and investigation anyone's gone through in 
my memory in the Senate. It's been painful but, I think, necessary under the 
circumstances," he said.

DEMOCRATS REJECT MEDICARE CUTS, ACCUSE BUSH OF 'VOODOO ECONOMICS'

<P>
Pledges of bipartisanship began to crumble only minutes after President Bush's 
speech to Congress Thursday night when Democratic leaders flatly rejected cuts 
in Medicare payments or capital gains taxes and accused Bush of reviving 
"voodoo economics." 
</P>
<P>
Although House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) renewed his party's commitment to 
cooperate with the new President in devising a budget, the strident tone of the 
Democrats' official response to Bush's speech and budget proposals suggested 
that America's politically divided government was returning to business as 
usual after the heady first days of the new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll give him our sincere cooperation," Wright said in a televised speech 
after Bush's appearance before a joint session of Congress. "That does not mean 
obedience. It does mean our honest help and our very best advice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Desire on Social Causes 
</P>
<P>
Democrats praised Bush's desire to tackle social causes such as improving 
education and health care and combatting drug abuse, but they took the 
President to task for failing to explain what other federal programs he would 
cut to pay for these initiatives without additional taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it was a nice laundry list of problems, sure, but it doesn't really 
speak to the central issue," said Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), a member of 
the House Budget and Appropriations committees. "Where does the money come from 
to pay for all of this? It sounds like voodoo economics revisited to me." 
</P>
<P>
"Voodoo economics" is a term first coined by Bush in 1980 to describe the 
supply-side proposals of Ronald Reagan when both were seeking the GOP 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"He's saying to Congress: 'It's your baby. The hard choices are yours,' " added 
Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), chairman of the House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders viewed Bush's proposals to cut Medicare payments for the 
elderly while trimming the capital gains taxes paid by the rich as evidence 
that the so-called "flexible freeze" would be unfair. Wright emphasized that 
such a strategy is unacceptable to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flexibility for the Rich 
</P>
<P>
"We would have to reject any kind of 'flexible freeze' that would bend with 
flexibility for the rich and powerful, but freeze out the middle-income 
families of America," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright was particularly emphatic in condemning Bush's proposal to trim the 
growth in Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals. "We will oppose attempts 
to cut Medicare," he said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Democrats made it plain that congressional leaders are in no 
mood to accept Bush's contention that a cut in capital gains taxes would 
increase federal revenues by about $5 billion. Capital gains taxes are levied 
on the sales of stocks or other investments. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, 
announced earlier in the day that he would "strongly resist" any changes in the 
1986 Tax Reform Act -- "including the return to a preferential tax rate for 
capital gains." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not about to tell the wage earners in Chicago that they should pay a 
higher tax than stockbrokers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said that cutting taxes would 
be foolish at a time when revenues are in short supply. "When the most serious 
problem we face is the budget deficit, it makes no sense to increase that 
deficit by giving a huge tax break to the wealthiest Americans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski also called on Bush to drop his pledge for no new taxes and "put 
everything on the table" in his budget negotiations with Congress. "Spending 
cuts and revenue increases must be part of any meaningful compromise," he 
emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
He warned that it would be "a mistake to play a game of chicken" between 
Congress and the White House that might risk putting automatic budget cuts into 
effect under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Panetta said that he and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) 
would meet with Director Richard G. Darman of the White House Office of 
Management and Budget early next week to get more details on what programs the 
President wants to trim. Sasser, meanwhile, characterized Bush's approach as "a 
hocus-pocus flexible freeze." 
</P>
<P>
While pledging to cooperate with Bush's efforts to create "a kinder, gentler 
America," Democrats were quick to note that they have long been recommending an 
increased federal commitment to education and health programs. "That's old-time 
Democratic religion," declared Wright. "We embrace it enthusiastically." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Education Effort Hit 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Education and 
Labor Committee, criticized Bush's proposals on education as inadequate, noting 
that the federal government is spending fewer real dollars on education now 
than in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"Adjusted for inflation, Bush's down payment of about $300 million in 
additional spending really amounts to more than a 4% reduction in current 
educational services nationwide," he said. "It is just not enough to provide a 
quality education to all the disadvantaged children who need and deserve one 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins said that education should be treated like defense, with an allowance 
for inflation, which he said would give it a nearly 5% increase -- meaning an 
extra $1 billion for schools. "After eight years of the defense build-up and 
domestic cuts, Bush continues to feed the fat and starve the lean," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on health and environment, said that he was disappointed by the 
President's proposed cuts in Medicare and what he viewed as an inadequate 
commitment to finding a cure for AIDS. Nevertheless, Waxman credited Bush with 
a kinder and gentler attitude toward the Medicaid program. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, praised Bush's approach on the defense budget, which Congress had 
trimmed under Reagan. "A zero increase will be more than Reagan got over the 
last three years," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the criticism, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) predicted 
that the spirit of bipartisanship would be revived once talks begin on a 
compromise budget. 
</P>
<P>
"The American people now expect action, not partisan reaction," he said. "Once 
all the instant criticism dies down, even the critics will realize (that) the 
President has the only budget plan in town. It's not the final answer; its a 
starting point. So let's get started."

20,000 MORE IMMIGRANTS TO RECEIVE VISAS IN LOTTERY

The State Department announced Thursday that 10,000 extra visas will be issued 
on a random basis in both 1990 and 1991 to immigrants from 162 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens of the Soviet Union, Poland and several other countries whose refugee 
quotas are filled will be eligible for the lottery, officials said. The 
application period will be from March 1 through March 31. 
</P>
<P>
The visas will not be issued on a first-come, first-served basis, as they were 
in a similar lottery in 1986. Instead, the applications will be fed into 
computers and the selections made on a random basis. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike refugees, who are generally given haven for political reasons, 
immigrants are required to have close relatives in the United States or have a 
scarce profession. However, the 20,000 to be admitted under the special program 
will not have to meet those requirements. Only screening for mental disability 
or criminal records will be conducted, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Countries excluded are those that used more than 5,000 immigrant slots in 
fiscal 1988. They are China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, 
Guyana, Haiti, India, Jamaica, South Korea, Mexico, the Philippines and the 
United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Also excluded is Taiwan, and natives of Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin 
Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Montserrat, 
Pitcairn, St. Helena and the Turks and the Caicos islands. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department announcement contained strict rules for applicants. Among 
them is that all applications must be typewritten and that husbands and wives 
may apply separately. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in a move to admit more Soviet and East European refugees, former 
President Ronald Reagan decided to increase this fiscal year's quota by 7,000 
by lowering the quota of Vietnamese refugees, many of whom are former political 
prisoners. That decision brought to 25,000 the number of Soviets who will be 
permitted to enter the United States.

PROPOSED ORDER WOULD DENY CLEARANCE WITH NO APPEAL

The Bush Administration is weighing a proposed presidential order that would 
allow security officers to deny clearances -- and thus jobs -- to applicants 
for federal and defense industry posts without stating a reason or giving them 
a right to respond. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed order would eliminate a series of rights accorded government and 
defense workers and job applicants for 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of the proposed order was obtained Thursday night by the Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
David Holliday, spokesman for the Senate Intelligence Committee, said staff 
employees had reviewed the draft and told Administration representatives in 
December that at the staff level "we might have trouble with sections in the 
due process area." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details of Order 
</P>
<P>
The 21-page document was circulated for comment to 30 federal agencies on Jan. 
24. It would authorize security officers to determine whether a worker or 
applicant "has exploitable vulnerabilities or has engaged in any exploitable 
conduct or indiscreet behavior," including "criminal or dishonest activity, 
alcohol or substance abuse, or exploitable sexual conduct." 
</P>
<P>
"Under this order, it's quite conceivable that someone like John Tower could 
not get a security clearance for a Pentagon job, because he would have no right 
to learn about, much less respond to, the allegations of alcohol abuse and 
womanizing that have been made against him," said Allan Adler of the American 
Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
Tower, President Bush's nominee to be defense secretary, has been able to 
respond to the allegations because they have come during his confirmation 
hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed order, if Tower were a new applicant for a Pentagon job 
requiring a clearance, any such allegations uncovered in a normal unpublicized 
background check would not have to be relayed to him. 
</P>
<P>
Adler said the document "is offering up a senseless deprivation of individual 
rights as a substitute for sensible security reforms." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), chairman of the House civil and constitutional 
rights subcommittee, wrote Bush on Thursday urging him not to sign the order. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that a person denied a clearance on the basis of erroneous 
information would never be told what the information was and would never have 
an opportunity to correct it," Edwards wrote. "I do not see how this serves the 
national security." 
</P>
<P>
The order would replace one issued by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1960 
that guaranteed any worker in private industry whose security clearance was 
denied or revoked: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A written statement of the reasons for the action. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An opportunity to reply in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The right to appear personally with a lawyer before the head of the agency 
to contest the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The right to cross-examine either orally or in writing those who made 
statements against him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A written statement of the final decision on each allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department regulations have accorded similar rights to the Pentagon's 
civilian and military workers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed order would guarantee none of those rights to a job applicant 
denied an initial clearance or to a current worker denied a higher clearance. 
</P>
<P>
For current workers whose clearance was revoked, the proposed Bush order would 
guarantee only: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A written explanation of the reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An opportunity to respond in writing and request a review of the 
revocation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Written notice of the results of the review. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An opportunity to appeal in writing to a higher official, whose decision 
would be final. 
</P>
<P>
Even these rights could be denied entirely to employees whose clearances were 
revoked by an agency head who determines "such procedures would not be 
consistent with the national security interests of the United States," the 
order said.

DANGER OF S.F. 'BAY MUD' IN QUAKE TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Data from the 1985 Mexico City earthquake indicates tougher building codes are 
required to deal with an unusually viscous clay ringing San Francisco Bay and 
supporting the city's dense, high-rise financial district, a UC Berkeley 
professor told the state Seismic Safety Commission on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Civil engineering professor H. Bolton Seed said the clay, known misleadingly as 
"Bay mud," is similar to soil beneath the section of Mexico City most damaged 
by the Magnitude 8.1 temblor that killed an estimated 10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, he said, is the only earthquake-prone urban area in the United 
States where this type of clay supports high-occupancy buildings. He said he 
knows of no similar clay near metropolitan Southern California, which 
scientists say is statistically more likely to have a major quake before San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Seed stressed that even on the suspect clay, existing building codes are 
probably adequate to minimize structural damage in a 7.2 temblor, which is 
roughly equivalent to the 1971 Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that a Magnitude 8.2 earthquake, equivalent to the great 
1906 San Francisco temblor, would probably produce damage levels similar to 
those seen in Mexico City. Most at risk in such an unlikely event, he said, 
would be mid-rise buildings between 10 and 20 stories. Because of their 
middling height, he said, they would be most susceptible to quake-generated 
vibrations. 
</P>
<P>
Such a powerful earthquake is unlikely in the near future, Seed added. More 
likely, he told the commission, is a Magnitude 7.2 temblor. The Bay Area has a 
50% chance of experiencing a quake of that strength over the next 30 years, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Lloyd Cluff, a geoscientist at Pacific Gas &amp; Electric 
Co., said the effect of a major earthquake on the clay described by Seed "could 
be catastrophic" but added he thinks that building codes can be rewritten to 
avoid a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"It (Seed's study) is not telling us everything is a mess," he said. "It is 
telling us we need to look at what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Cluff said the commission will reexamine certain structures, 
such as concrete-frame buildings, that if built on this type of clay "may not 
do as well (in an earthquake) as we had hoped." 
</P>
<P>
Before the devastating Mexican temblor, Seed had postulated that waterlogged 
clay would amplify the ground shaking precipitated by earthquakes and transmit 
much more stress to buildings than anticipated. He, Cluff and other earthquake 
experts meeting in San Francisco, said an analysis of Mexico City seismographs 
and damage inventories confirmed his thesis. 
</P>
<P>
"Their clay is different from our clay," he said, "but the difference is minor 
in terms of the things we are talking about." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the effects are likely to be exaggerated because San Francisco is 
between two major faults, while Mexico City was over 200 miles from the 
epicenter of its quake. 
</P>
<P>
According to Seed, certain water-saturated clays -- such as those along San 
Francisco Bay and on the bottom of the dry lake bed on which Mexico City is 
built -- are especially susceptible to earthquake vibrations. The extent of 
this susceptibility was in doubt until the Mexico city temblor. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds applied his clay theory to a U.S. Geologic Survey soil map of the Bay 
area and noted many tracts built atop Bay mud. However, the map did not show 
the clay layer's thickness -- a key variable in estimating quake danger -- so a 
more complete soils survey is needed to fully assess the threat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One good thing was indicated by the map, he noted. Most of the suspect clay 
lies beneath undeveloped land.

ACTON MAN'S BODY FOUND IN CAR AT BOTTOM OF RAVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 30-year-old Acton man was found dead in his car at the bottom of a 60-foot 
ravine Thursday after he apparently lost control during the recent storms and 
went over the edge of Soledad Canyon Road, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Michael Vollman was found by his friend, Los Angeles County 
Firefighter Paul Wenzel, who had been enlisted in the search by a woman friend 
of Vollman's, county Fire Capt. Willard Sparks said. 
</P>
<P>
Vollman's employer called the woman, whose identity was not immediately 
available, when Vollman did not show up for work at an exotic animal ranch near 
Lancaster on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing it was uncharacteristic for Vollman to miss work without calling, the 
woman called Wenzel and they drove to Soledad Canyon Road in Acton, stopping 
every few hundred feet along the road Thursday, looking for Vollman's car. 
</P>
<P>
After several hours, they spotted the car at the bottom of the ravine. The car 
probably flipped over several times, Sparks said, adding that Vollman was not 
wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't have found him for a long time," the fire captain said. "The car 
was hard to see."

MEDIA LAWYERS ASK FOR WIDER USE OF 'PUBLIC INTEREST' LIBEL RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Lawyers for news organizations asked the state Supreme Court on Thursday for 
new legal safeguards against libel suits over reports on matters of "public 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
The justices, in a far-reaching test of the competing rights of a free press 
and protection of reputation, were asked to require private figures to show 
that a newsworthy but false and defamatory report was made with knowing or 
reckless disregard for the truth. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court has established that often hard-to-prove standard for 
libel suits by public figures, such as government officials. But the high court 
has left it to the states to set the standard for private individuals, or those 
who have not sought public attention. 
</P>
<P>
At present, 35 states allow private figures to win damages by merely showing 
negligence -- or lack of reasonable care in publishing or broadcasting a news 
report. Only two states -- Indiana and Colorado -- require them to show malice 
or disregard for the truth. 
</P>
<P>
News media attorneys told the justices Thursday that imposing the 
harder-to-prove standard would encourage full and free discussion of matters of 
public concern and lessen the intimidating burden of defending costly but 
unwarranted libel suits. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not asking for a license to be negligent," said Robert S. Warren, a Los 
Angeles lawyer representing the McClatchy Newspapers, Times Mirror Co. and 17 
other news organizations. "We think free speech about certain matters is so 
important it should not be punished unless it is a knowing or reckless 
falsehood." 
</P>
<P>
However, an attorney for the plaintiff in the case before the court contended 
that private figures -- with fewer resources and opportunities to combat false 
reports -- should not have to meet the same rigorous constitutional standard 
set for public figures. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer, Brenton A. Bleier of Sacramento, discounted any significant adverse 
impact on a free press. 
</P>
<P>
"The communications industry . . . is not easily intimidated," Bleier said. "I 
can't believe that requiring the media to meet a standard of reasonable care 
will have any effect on their future performance or existence." 
</P>
<P>
The justices heard arguments in the first libel case to come before the court 
since the departure of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other court 
members defeated in the November, 1986, election. 
</P>
<P>
The court, acting under newly adopted time limits for deciding cases, is to 
issue a ruling within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in 1984 when Sacramento television station KCRA, in a news 
segment devoted to consumer affairs, aired complaints about allegedly "shoddy" 
work by a local building contractor on a home undergoing renovation under a 
federally funded program. 
</P>
<P>
The contractor, Shirley Brown, brought suit against KCRA, saying that the 
allegations were false and that the station ignored her requests for a 
correction. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was dismissed in Sacramento Superior Court on grounds that the 
broadcasts were protected under state law because they involved an issue of 
"public interest." A state Court of Appeal agreed such protection existed, but 
said Brown could still take the case to trial to attempt to show the station 
acted in reckless disregard for the truth. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's hearing, the justices closely questioned Warren and L. Thomas 
Wagner, a Sacramento attorney representing the station, about the difficulty of 
defining reports of "public interest" and about the propriety of establishing 
new safeguards for the news media at the expense of private individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Marcus M. Kaufman appeared skeptical about applying additional 
protection simply because a news report involved a private figure who received 
public funds or participated in a government program. 
</P>
<P>
"I once had a federal VA loan," Kaufman remarked. "That would be pretty hard to 
take." 
</P>
<P>
Bleier, representing plaintiff Brown, argued that it would be too hard to 
define which reports were of "public interest" and which were not. State libel 
law, he said, should not be interpreted to grant such protection.

PANEL REJECTS MOVE TO HALT NORTH'S TRIAL;

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MAY APPEAL SECRETS ISSUE TO HIGH COURT

<P>
The Justice Department lost a round in an attempt Thursday to halt former Lt. 
Col. Oliver L. North's trial in the Iran-Contra scandal but said that its legal 
challenge could be carried to the Supreme Court, an action that might delay 
proceedings against the former White House aide at least for several days. 
</P>
<P>
The government, deeply concerned about sensitive national security information 
that North's lawyers may seek to introduce during the trial, wants the judge in 
the case ordered to impose tighter restrictions over such evidence. But a 
three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals here denied the Justice 
Department request Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision capped a day of legal maneuvering that resulted in the trial's 
being delayed just as prosecutors and defense attorneys were preparing to give 
their opening statements to a newly chosen jury. Those statements were 
postponed until Monday by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell but may have to 
be delayed further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walsh Opposed Appeal 
</P>
<P>
The appellate judges, in a brief order, unanimously sided with independent 
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who opposed the Justice Department's position on 
classified information and contended that the department had no legal standing 
to intervene in the case at the 11th hour. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said in papers filed with the appellate judges that he -- and not Atty. 
Gen. Dick Thornburgh -- is the court-appointed independent prosecutor and that 
he is satisfied with procedures established by Gesell for handling documents 
and testimony that bear on national security. Walsh suggested that it is 
Thornburgh's duty to withhold certain sensitive information altogether from the 
trial if he believes state secrets are in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh did just that a month ago, with Walsh's concurrence, in a decision 
that forced dismissal of the primary charges of conspiracy and theft against 
North. Thornburgh agreed with government security analysts that documents 
necessary to try North on those charges are too sensitive to be disclosed at 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, as head of the Justice Department, now is contending that Gesell's 
guidelines for the use of classified information are so loose that North may 
force disclosure of top-secret matters during his trial on 12 lesser charges, 
which allege that North destroyed documents and made false statements to 
Congress and a presidential board of inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Explicit Rulings 
</P>
<P>
The department, in its brief, said that Gesell should be forced to make 
"explicit rulings concerning the relevance and admissibility of each item of 
classified information that the defense intends to introduce." 
</P>
<P>
In expressing dissatisfaction with the broad guidelines that Gesell established 
to govern the use of such data, department lawyers said that they might be 
powerless to stop North from disclosing secrets. 
</P>
<P>
After the Justice Department had filed its papers Thursday, Gesell proceeded to 
select a jury of three men and nine women. Then the appellate judges ordered an 
"administrative stay," a ruling that halted the trial while they studied the 
national security dispute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jurors Sent Home 
</P>
<P>
Gesell promptly told the jurors to go home and return on Monday, when he hoped 
the question would be settled. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are going to do is shut down, catch up on our sleep," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, the appellate judges rejected the Justice Department's 
arguments and lifted the stay. But the jurors already had gone home. 
</P>
<P>
After the appellate ruling, Edward S. G. Dennis Jr., chief of the Justice 
Department's criminal division, told reporters that he and his colleagues are 
determined to pursue the issue. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the department has the option of asking the three-judge panel to 
reconsider its decision or of appealing the issue to the full 11-member Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The department could also appeal 
directly to the Supreme Court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to pursuing a stay" in the North trial until the issue can be 
decided on its merits, Dennis said. He suggested that the department might 
select an option by today. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis was asked repeatedly if Thornburgh were prepared to withhold additional 
sensitive material as a last resort, a move that might abort North's trial 
altogether. He replied that such a decision was "premature." 
</P>
<P>
"We have not thought that far ahead," he said, "but we're not leaving any 
options out of consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis described the present situation as "a crap shoot," declaring that "we 
cannot go into this trial knowing we will not have a right to be heard" on the 
subject of possible sensitive disclosures by North's lawyers.

WEEKEND WEATHER OUTLOOK; 
</P>
<P>
COLD WILL FOLLOW THE RAIN, FORECASTER SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Those venturing outdoors this weekend may want to dress warmly, since San Diego 
is in for another chilly weekend. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe you ought to carry an umbrella -- just in case. 
</P>
<P>
The storm that brought showers Thursday is weakening and heading east, leaving 
behind a few showers today. 
</P>
<P>
A cold front from Alaska will arrive this weekend to take its place, causing 
the temperatures to dip several degrees by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Partly cloudy and cooler days are expected for the weekend, with an 
ever-so-slight chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a minimal chance of rain this weekend," Wilbur Shigehara of the 
National Weather Service said. "Right now, it doesn't look too bad for the 
weekend. It's a very slight chance of rain. . . . It would be spotty; light 
showers. We'll have to keep our fingers crossed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooling to Continue 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara said he expects the cooling trend to continue into early next week. 
Farmers may consider frost protection as early as Sunday night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures at the beaches are expected to range from 54 to 57 degrees today 
and Saturday. The coastal strip can expect highs from 56 to 62 degrees Friday 
and Saturday, 55 to 60 on Sunday. Lows tonight are expected to be between 45 to 
50 degrees, dwindling to 40 to 48 degrees Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The inland region will have highs of 59 to 65 today and Saturday, 55 to 60 
degrees Sunday. Nightly lows are to range in the mid- to low- 40s tonight, 
falling to 32 to 42 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain highs of 40 to 45 degrees through Saturday, dropping to 35 to 40 
degrees Sunday, and lows from 27 to 32 degrees tonight, 23 to 29 degrees 
Saturday, are in the cards. Gusty mountain winds up to 35 m.p.h. are foreseen 
for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Desert temperatures are expected to reach 65 to 70 degrees through Saturday, 
dropping to the low 60s Sunday. Lows in the 40s are expected tonight, and 
temperatures ranging from 32 to 42 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Surf will be 2 to 4 feet at 11-second intervals. The water temperature is 
expected to be 54 degrees.

FIELD NARROWS TO TWO IN RACE TO RUN DEL MAR TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state commission narrowed the field Thursday to a pair of finalists for a new 
Del Mar Race Track lease, eliminating from consideration a partnership 
criticized by local residents for its plans to offer concerts along with horse 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
After more than five hours of discussion in a drafty pavilion at the Del Mar 
Fairgrounds, the state Race Track Leasing Commission voted 4 to 1 to scratch 
the Ogden-Nederlander partnership from the competition for the 20-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision left the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, a local outfit 
that has operated the track for the past two decades, and Florida horse-racing 
impresario John J. Brunetti as the remaining contenders for the Del Mar crown. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the six-man leasing commission, which is composed of three 
high-ranking state officials and a trio of Del Mar Fair Board members, the 
finalists will return in one month for a showdown to determine which group will 
get the lucrative lease. 
</P>
<P>
On another 4-1 vote, the board agreed to have the pair respond to several new 
issues, among them the possibility of limiting administrative costs and a 
provision that the lease undergo periodic reviews and potential renegotiation. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner William J. Anthony, a state general services official, abstained 
from the vote, and Commissioner Jan Anton, a fair board director, dissented. 
Anton, already on record in support of the Thoroughbred Club, argued that the 
current operator should be allowed to stay on at the track because the club is 
not a for-profit organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Brunetti would take out millions over 20 years. His proposal is just like the 
Del Mar Thoroughbred Club's, but he'd be taking out profit," Anton said, adding 
that he did not "see any great benefit" to the Brunetti proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Thoroughbred Club expressed surprise at the commission's 
decision to delay a final vote, but remained confident about their ultimate 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have so much more expertise here in running a track," said John 
Mabee, patriarch of the Big Bear grocery store chain and longtime club 
president. "Brunetti has his problems in Florida. And, like they said, if it 
ain't broke, don't fix it." 
</P>
<P>
Brunetti, meanwhile, voiced hope that the commission would favor his proposal, 
despite strong support for the Thoroughbred Club from residents of Del Mar and 
Solana Beach as well as the Fair Board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Proposal Is the Most Creative 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything will substantially change over the next month," said 
Brunetti, a New Jersey construction magnate who owns the Hialeah track near 
Miami. "As a race-track owner and operator, my proposal is the most creative, 
not only in terms of aesthetic values and promotions, but in my idea to add an 
extra, 10th race each day." 
</P>
<P>
The big loser on Thursday, however, was the Ogden-Nederlander partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Jack Parnell, the state's Food and Agriculture Department 
director, said the partnership's plans for an eclectic mix of up to 40 concerts 
ranging from symphony performances to rock 'n' roll threatened to undermine the 
state-mandated role of the Del Mar Fair Board, which operates the seaside 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It would establish a level of control over the operations of the complex that 
is not properly performed by a private entity," Parnell said. "That control has 
historically been vested with" the Fair Board. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture promised to build a 20,000-seat grandstand at the track to 
replace the existing 9,600-seat facility, which is suffering the infirmities of 
old age. But competitors said the partnership would have tapped as much as $140 
million in profits during the life of the lease, money that could go to the 
state or back into the facility. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, dozens of local residents and officials paraded before the 
commission to complain about the potential effects of the concerts, griping 
that they would cause problems with noise, traffic and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attorney's Complaint 
</P>
<P>
Neil Papiano, a Los Angeles attorney representing Ogden-Nederlander, complained 
that the commission "should have told us they didn't want any private 
operators." He also hinted that the decision was a result of power politics, 
saying "they had to find a way to attack us." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we obviously had the best bid, and the best bid didn't win," Papiano 
said, adding that he doubts a new grandstand can be delivered now that his 
group is out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Thoroughbred Club and Fair Board have proposed a 15,000-seat 
grandstand and have already commissioned architectural work on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Leasing Commission gave that effort a boost Thursday, unanimously agreeing 
to set aside 80% of the track's annual revenues until $30 million is raised to 
help defray the financing cost of the stadium, which is expected to run about 
$85 million.

SDG&amp;E VOWS SUIT TO STOP TAKEOVER STUDY; 
</P>
<P>
DISPUTES AUTHORITY OF WATER BOARD, WHICH COUNTERS BY NEARLY DOUBLING ITS BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. plans to file suit today to prevent the County 
Water Authority from financing a feasibility study of a public takeover of the 
utility, an attorney for SDG&amp;E said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Steven S. Wall told the Water Authority's board of directors at its 
Thursday meeting that it has no authority to finance the study. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't spend the taxpayers' money on doing something that you don't have the 
power to do," Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
The board's response was to approve a budget of nearly $1 million -- almost 
double the amount recommended by its general manager -- to investigate the 
takeover possibility as an alternative to SDG&amp;E's planned merger with 
Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, of the law firm Luce, Forward, Hamilton &amp; Scripps, vowed to go to 
court immediately on behalf of SDG&amp;E to obtain a temporary restraining 
order against the Water Authority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$250,000 Offered by City 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor has led the city in its drive to block the 
merger of SDG&amp;E and Rosemead-based SCEcorp, Edison's parent company, since 
the agreement was announced in July. After the city attorney's office suggested 
that a governmental agency might take over the utility, the Water Authority was 
eventually tapped as the most likely candidate. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the City Council voted to lend the Water Authority $250,000 to 
study the feasibility of a takeover, but Water Authority attorney Paul 
Angstrand ruled last month that the agency could finance the study on its own. 
</P>
<P>
In the agenda packet circulated to the board members, Lester Snow, the Water 
Authority's general manager, originally recommended raising the Phase I budget 
from $250,000 to $500,000 and urged the board to approve the increased amount 
immediately so the proposed three-phase study could be completed before the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
But, when Wall told the Executive Committee before the board meeting that 
SDG&amp;E would sue to stop the expenditure, committee member Herb Stickney 
immediately moved to raise the amount to $940,000 in order to defend against 
SDG&amp;E's threats of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-member board, with three members abstaining, voted to adopt the budget 
increase. The single "no" vote was cast by Gordon Luce. 
</P>
<P>
Before voting, Luce, chairman of Great American First Savings Bank, said he is 
concerned about the mounting public debt in the county and said he feels that 
Water Authority staff members' attention was already being diverted in too many 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newly Formed Committee 
</P>
<P>
Luce also is chairman of a newly formed committee on the merger that is made up 
of civic and business leaders. The committee, formed as the result of a meeting 
among O'Connor and officials of the Chamber of Commerce and the Economic 
Development Commission, has taken a stance against the merger, but has not come 
forward in support of municipalization of SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the meeting, Snow defended the proposed expense and said that raising 
the budget to $940,000 will not have an "immediate impact" on water rates 
because the agency has reserves of about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"On every occasion, they (SDG&amp;E) claim to be expressing concern about us 
using taxpayers' money," Snow said. "If 
</P>
<P>
we had their full cooperation, we could probably do this for somewhere around 
$200,000." 
</P>
<P>
Snow said the Water Authority has been forced to continually escalate its 
budget for the takeover study "by the posturing and attitude" of SDG&amp;E. The 
actual feasibility study would take only a fraction of the $940,000 budget, he 
said, but the rest of the money will be necessary to hire lobbyists in 
Sacramento to combat lobbyists from SDG&amp;E and SCE, to mount a 
public-relations campaign in San Diego and to cover the cost of the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the board of directors voted to get the ball rolling on the study, 
as well as to seek an amendment to the County Water Authority Act that would 
explicitly allow the agency to acquire and operate a gas and electricity 
system. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Wall, the Water Authority cannot use money on the study 
unless it has been given power to undertake such an acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the California Legislature has made a determination and the people have 
spoken, it is our position, with regret, that you are acting far beyond your 
power," he told the board members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporary Restraining Order 
</P>
<P>
Wall said he will go to court this afternoon to seek a temporary restraining 
order against the Water Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote was taken, SDG&amp;E spokeswoman Karen Hutchensc attempted to 
explain the utility's position to the water board members. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel a multibillion-dollar organization is more appropriately run by 
private enterprise," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchens said the board was reacting in a "knee-jerk" fashion against the 
merger and urged it to "slow down" and wait for all the facts surrounding the 
proposed merger to be made public before spending money to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you get all the facts on the table without investigating the 
alternative to the merger?" board member Mike Madigan asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that the facts on the table right now (show) there is no way a 
governmental agency could take over . . . and not increase rates," Hutchens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E Director of Finance Malyn Malquist told board members that a public 
takeover would mean a drastic increase in utility rates. Malquist cited a study 
done for SDG&amp;E by the Seattle-based consulting firm of CH2M Hill, which 
concluded that such a move would mean a rate increase of as much as 23%. 
</P>
<P>
The study also found that a debt of $1.3 billion owed by SDG&amp;E to its 
bondholders would not be assumable by a public agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way the utility's present debt could be assumed is if every 
bondholder voted to permit a transfer to the local government agency," Hutchens 
said. "And a unanimous vote would be virtually impossible." 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, a government takeover would also result in a federal 
and state income tax liability of $1 billion, which would not be the case with 
a merger. The total cost of a takeover would be $6.5 billion, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
Several board members cited previous pledges by SDG&amp;E to cooperate fully 
with the Water Authority, and asked why the company was not willing to let them 
proceed with the study. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchens responded, "We would be more than willing to sit down with the general 
manager to go over the numbers we have presented today for your scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Christine Frahm countered, "You can't expect us to accept somebody 
else's version of the facts, yet you won't let us do the minimum amount of work 
to get the facts." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if SDG&amp;E would consider helping the Water Authority conduct 
another study to verify the conclusions of CH2M Hill, Hutchens replied, "We 
feel it would be a waste of taxpayer money." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Water Authority spokesman Jim Melton said the agency has no 
response yet to the takeover cost figures presented to the board by SDG&amp;E. 
"We don't know if the figures are high or low," he said. "They may be 
accurate." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Clay, legislative representative for the Water Authority, said: "Our budget 
was expanded because of saber rattling by SDG&amp;E about going into court. If 
these folks hadn't threatened to go to court and not opposed this in 
Sacramento, there wouldn't be half the money spent. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just scared to death that, if we shed a little light on these numbers, 
there might be a good basis for" a public takeover of SDG&amp;E.

The 16-month-old child, who was discovered among a carload of smuggled illegal 
aliens and whose identity remained unknown for almost eight months, was turned 
over Thursday to the custody of his paternal grandfather, Rene Fernando 
Herrera, a Tijuana tile worker and taco-stand owner. 
</P>
<P>
The move, authorities say, follows an extensive background investigation of the 
grandfather's home by U. S. and Mexican officials. 
</P>
<P>
The reunion of grandfather and grandson -- accomplished after some delays when 
a television reporter found the grandfather in Tijuana and drove him across the 
U.S.-Mexico border -- would appear to end months of speculation about the 
future of the child. Although U. S. immigration officials often find infants 
among the hundreds of undocumented immigrants arrested along the border each 
month, authorities said this was the first case in which a parent or legal 
guardian had not appeared for such a long period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grandfather Stepped Forward 
</P>
<P>
After officials went public with the story last month, however, the grandfather 
stepped forward and the child was identified as Marcos Antonio Herrera, born in 
California in September, 1987. His father is a recovering heroin addict living 
in San Diego. Both natural parents agreed that the grandfather should have 
custody of the child, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We always feel a child is better off 
</P>
<P>
being among his family," said Yolanda Thomas, a spokeswoman for the San Diego 
County Department of Social Services, which has been handling the case since he 
was identified last month. 
</P>
<P>
After he was discovered in May, immigration authorities arranged to place the 
child with a foster family in San Diego. He had been living in the foster home 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to present the child to his grandfather appeared to run into a 
last-minute hitch Thursday when the grandfather didn't appear at a ceremony 
planned at the San Diego headquarters of the U. S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. The grandfather was apparently unaware of the planned 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
However, a television reporter, John Britton of KNSD-TV (Channel 39) in San 
Diego, found the grandfather at his Tijuana home Thursday and brought him to 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In Tijuana, officials said, the child will live with Herrera, 37; his wife, 
Olga, 32, who is a pharmacist's assistant, and the couple's two other children, 
Elsbeth, 12, and Jacqueline, 1. The two other youths are, like Marcos, U. S. 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The grandfather has two other children, including Marcos' father, from an 
earlier relationship, officials said. The family lives in a one-bedroom 
apartment in Tijuana's Zona Norte neighborhood.

 DNA EVIDENCE TO BE USED IN MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner has announced that evidence derived 
from genetic fingerprinting will be used to prosecute two suspects in the rape 
and murder of a Pasadena woman last October. 
</P>
<P>
This would be the first time the county has used the technique, which involves 
matching the genetic makeup of a suspect with blood or semen samples. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Anthony Jones and George Marvin Trone have been charged with kidnaping 
26-year-old Lois Haro at the Plaza Pasadena Mall, raping her and then killing 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Tests concluded that the genetic patterns found in semen and blood samples were 
almost perfect matches for both defendants, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
DNA, found in all cells, carries each individual's genetic blueprint and 
determines everything from hair color to gender. Each individual's genetic code 
is unique, except in the case of identical twins. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for one of the suspects said he will contest introduction of the 
findings at a preliminary hearing scheduled for March 21. Both suspects have 
pleaded not guilty.

 AIDE PROMISED TO KEEP HUDSON SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rock Hudson's secretary did not tell the late actor's homosexual lover that 
Hudson had AIDS because of a promise he made to Hudson, a lawyer told a jury in 
Los Angeles on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court jury and four alternates must decide if Hudson and his 
secretary and friend, Mark Miller, conspired to keep Hudson's illness secret 
from his lover, Marc Christian, so they could continue having sex. 
</P>
<P>
Christian's lawyer contends that Miller kept Hudson's diagnosis secret because, 
in part, he did not want to risk losing any money he was to get from the estate 
when Hudson died. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Banks, Miller's lawyer, said in his closing argument that Miller had 
been Hudson's friend for more than 30 years, his secretary for 13 years, and 
that Hudson had asked him not to tell Christian he had AIDS after learning in 
June, 1984, of the diagnosis. Miller did not know the details of Hudson's will, 
Banks said.

 2 MORE CITIES BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cities of Carson and Lynwood became the third and fourth municipalities in 
Los Angeles County to outlaw semi-automatic "assault weapons," including the 
AK-47 assault rifle that was used to kill five schoolchildren and injure more 
than two dozen others in Stockton last month. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons -- which allow a gunman to shoot dozens of bullets rapidly without 
reloading -- have become increasingly popular among gangs in the southern part 
of Los Angeles County, according to police, and have been banned in Los Angeles 
and Compton. 
</P>
<P>
The Carson ban, which was passed on an emergency basis Wednesday, received 
unanimous support from the five-member council. Councilwoman Vera Robles 
DeWitt, who proposed the ban, said a request by the city for gun shop owners to 
stop selling the rapid-firing weapons had failed to win support from all the 
city's gun shops. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance makes it a misdemeanor to sell or possess semiautomatic rifles 
that accept a magazine of 20 rounds or more. The ban also includes sawed-off 
shotguns that can fire more than six rounds without reloading. 
</P>
<P>
The Lynwood city council passed unanimously Thursday night what Mayor Evelyn 
Wells called a "preventive measure." 
</P>
<P>
There was no debate, and no one in the sparse audience spoke for or against the 
measure, which became effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the ordinance, based on the one recently passed by the Los Angeles 
City Council, were to be sent to surrounding cities and to the Legislature with 
the urging that they pass similar measures. Penalties are six months in jail 
and a $1,000 fine.

LANGUAGE OFTEN A BARRIER TO THERAPISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1984, a gunman named James Oliver Huberty walked into a McDonald's 
restaurant in San Ysidro and murdered 21 people. Fifteen others were wounded, 
and many of them needed psychological counseling -- immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the wounded, whether adults or children, spoke only Spanish. At the 
time, concerns were voiced about San Diego County not having enough 
Spanish-speaking therapists to cope with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Is the situation any different five years later? And what about San Diegans who 
speak only Italian? Or Portuguese? Or Swiss-German? To whom do they turn in a 
crisis? How easily could they find a therapist in the Yellow Pages? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Giant Problem' 
</P>
<P>
Jose Fernando Bayardo, a psychiatrist with a practice in Hillcrest, said the 
lack of psychological help for people of different cultures is "a giant 
problem." From 1972 to 1977, he said, he was the only Spanish-speaking 
psychiatrist in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have seven," Bayardo said, not without a touch of sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
Many psychotherapists attempt to meet the needs of foreign-born patients by 
using interpreters. Bayardo uses that approach with several clients who were 
born in Cambodia and do not speak English. 
</P>
<P>
"For many of these people, life in San Diego is heartbreaking," he said. "The 
change in culture is severe. The meals, the seasons, the customs . . . 
everything is different." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, one of his Cambodian clients put his feet on the waiting-room sofa. 
The patient was admonished by Bayardo's secretary and was embarrassed for 
something that, in his country, is common. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just a small example," Bayardo said. "Many Cambodians here suffer from 
acute depression and cultural-shock deficiencies, which lead to nothing less 
than the breakup of the family." 
</P>
<P>
Reading from a list published by the San Diego Medical Society, Bayardo noted 
that, out of seven Greek physicians in the county, none are psychiatrists; out 
of nine Armenian doctors, only one practices psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
The county offers one Czech-born psychiatrist, none who speak Portuguese and, 
most startling of all, he said, none fluent in Japanese. The language problem 
is especially worrisome to the San Diego Society of Psychiatric Physicians, 
Bayardo said, of which he is a member delegated to address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clinic Recently Opened 
</P>
<P>
The need has become so great that a clinic -- the La Jolla Institute for 
Psychotherapy -- opened recently to serve mainly a non-English-speaking 
clientele. Ina Schmilovici, a therapist born in West Germany, speaks German, 
English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and Romanian. Her superior, clinical 
psychologist Barbara Alvarez, was born in Austria and speaks German, Italian, 
Spanish, English and French. 
</P>
<P>
Schmilovici has been here for eight years, Alvarez for two. They say the most 
obvious -- and arresting -- fact of San Diego life is that the city is growing 
by leaps and bounds, becoming ever more cosmopolitan -- and, in some cases, 
more unlivable for non-English-speaking people. 
</P>
<P>
Schmilovici tells the story of a couple -- a West German woman and a Middle 
Eastern man -- who were seeking a divorce. Life in San Diego had greatly 
complicated the couple's problems, Schmilovici said, and not knowing the 
language had tangled the web even further. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was aided by a therapist who spoke her language. The man, unable to 
find one who shared his language or culture, is now very unhappy, Schmilovici 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing the culture and customs of a place, and the way families are organized 
in such countries, makes a person feel like someone understands," Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
She cited the case of one client, a 38-year-old Mexican-born man who lives at 
home with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"He goes out on dates, and all of the women think he's weird because he shares 
a home with his mother and father," Alvarez said. "In Mexico, that is very 
common. Now he doesn't want to (date) at all, and he's very depressed." 
</P>
<P>
A therapist's inability to understand a patient's language can border on the 
lethal, Bayardo said, noting a case in which a Spanish-speaking man in El 
Centro could not make an English-speaking therapist understand about the "tic" 
in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
"The therapist thought he was saying that he saw ticks -- meaning insects -- 
circling around his neck," Bayardo said. "So the therapist prescribed heavy 
doses of tranquilizers to a man he thought was hallucinating. It's a good thing 
he didn't kill the guy, because he could have. So, you see, this language 
problem can be serious."

ART DEALER FACES 12 COUNTS IN ALLEGED SCHEME TO SELL WIEGHORST FORGERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego art dealer Louis Esquivel Almeida was charged Thursday with 12 counts 
of grand theft stemming from an alleged scheme in which he purportedly sold 
forgeries of paintings by the late Olaf Wieghorst, a famed Western artist. 
</P>
<P>
Almeida, 49, the owner of the Brentwood Gallery, was to be arraigned Thursday, 
but the arraignment was postponed until later this month. According to the 
charges against him, Almeida began his scheme in 1982, when he began selling 
Wieghorst paintings and lithographs on consignment by their owners. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators said that Almeida began to copy the paintings in oil or 
photograph them. The photographed forgeries were then placed on canvas and 
shellacked to give the appearance of oil. Almeida is charged with defrauding 
buyers of about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
A local dentist identified as Frank Pavel discovered the scheme when he became 
suspicious and took a painting that he had purchased to Wieghorst, who lived in 
El Cajon, and his son, Roy, to authenticate it, authorities said. Wieghorst and 
his son declared it a forgery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Wieghorst died in April, but his son assisted the investigation by helping 
detectives authenticate other paintings and lithographs.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURNTS: 2 NEW EATERIES HELP FILL GAPS IN DOWNTOWN NOSHING 
SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just a year ago, the downtown restaurant scene looked like a paint-by-numbers 
landscape that had been daubed by a nearsighted master chef. Judging by the way 
the blanks have been filled, though, it would appear that a pair of bifocals 
were put to use in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
From an eater's point of view, the improvement in quality is an undeniable 
bonus. But what really matters is the greater variety of choices -- any 
downtown worker who can afford to leave his brown bag at home for a few weeks 
can lunch at a succession of places without once repeating his order. Judging 
by the activity on such developing luncheon arteries as C Street and 6th 
Avenue, some high-rise denizens may be doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the places that have come along are utterly outside the style of San 
Diego. The most striking example, which bears the odd but friendly name Good 
Morning America, is a new entry on 6th Avenue, between B and C streets. It 
seems like nothing so much as the moderately priced, multi-cuisine 
deli-restaurants that can be found on nearly every downtown block in Toronto 
and Montreal. It could also be viewed as a late-arriving offspring of the 
all-American short-order eateries that once abounded, but were done in by 
rising rents and the brutal competition of fast-food outlets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quite a Variety 
</P>
<P>
Good Morning America is, in a word, unique. The menu offers about 90 choices 
but many are variations on themes, such as the sliced turkey breast, which 
appears hot in mushroom gravy or cold in sandwiches; a pasta salad, and a 
chef's-style "health" salad. But the menu also ranges widely through such 
cuisines as Hungarian, Italian, German and others by offering stuffed peppers, 
hot hero sandwiches (with spaghetti on the side), knackwurst with sauerkraut 
and a sandwich board that wanders through all the favorites and indulges in a 
few unlikely fantasies, such as roast pork with bacon and American cheese. This 
last item may not sound wonderfully appealing, but, on the other hand, where 
else can such a combination be found? 
</P>
<P>
Form follows function here, since the decor likewise is different from anything 
in San Diego and manages to be semiformal in a manner all its own. The overall 
effect might be termed quaint. 
</P>
<P>
The act of stepping across this restaurant's threshold is unlikely to lead many 
guests into a state of gastronomic nirvana; on the other hand, most should find 
the lunches to be robust, well-cooked and reasonably priced. With a few 
exceptions, dishes are priced in a narrow range that runs from $4.75 to $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
The more formal entrees tend to be old-fashioned and filling, leaning toward 
such Hungarian specialties as beef goulash, stuffed cabbage, and beef and 
chicken paprikash, although Italian-American cuisine takes a bow with spaghetti 
with meatballs, chicken cutlet Parmesan and a saute of sausages and peppers. 
</P>
<P>
The chicken paprikash seemed particularly appealing on a recent blustery day, 
and it was typical of Middle European cooking; small legs and thighs reposed in 
a wonderfully smooth sauce of sour cream, onion and a great deal of paprika. 
Most entrees include a choice of such side dishes as steamed vegetables (these 
were sampled and found excellent), spaghetti and vegetable-enriched rice 
dishes. But the natural pairing with the paprikash is a mound of the pillowy, 
spaetzle-like dumplings. These, of course, would be the best bet with any of 
the Hungarian dishes. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the menu does seem like rainy-day food, which perhaps explains why 
this restaurant seems so in the style of Eastern eateries. The selection of hot 
heroes includes not only meatball and sausage versions, but also sauced chicken 
cutlet and a beef-pepper-onion combo that does indeed sound heroic. The menu 
continues with a profusion of less-daunting but still generously apportioned 
sandwiches, offered on a list so long that one can tire of reading it. 
</P>
<P>
A good rule of thumb when judging a restaurant's sandwiches is to order a hot 
pastrami. If it is lean, juicy, warm and piled high, the place probably is 
sincere. Good Morning America met the challenge on this score, even when the 
server nearly upset the apple cart by asking if a guest wished mayonnaise on 
his pastrami. (Right-minded people would never use anything more than mustard, 
nor would they adulterate corned beef or pastrami with lettuce or tomato or -- 
an abomination that I myself have witnessed in this city -- avocado.) 
</P>
<P>
The place runs to a few other extras that are not widely available, such as 
freshly made lemonade and milkshakes. Most pastries are catered from off 
premises, and those that are made in-house seem amateurish. However, anyone who 
cannot deny his sweet tooth may wish to sample the Hungarian crepes with 
apricot filling. 
</P>
<P>
Around the corner at 7th Avenue and C Street, one finds the Odeum Cafe and Bar, 
a nosherie made novel more by its setting than its menu. 
</P>
<P>
The premises suggest a certain whimsy, possibly misguided, on the part of the 
designer or architect. The concrete floor is painted in odd markings, and the 
ceiling swirls upward toward a sort of dome that suggests, in its overall 
effect, Alice's rabbit hole viewed from the inside. Since the outside street 
scene is readily visible through the picture windows, none of this much 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does the menu matter all that much, since it offers little more than a 
utilitarian selection of unremarkable sandwiches and salads. A plus is the 
selection of specialty coffees and teas, which go hand-in-glove with the poetry 
readings given here on weekend nights. That the restaurant sponsors such 
readings seems not at all unusual when one translates its classical Greek name, 
which means "place of music." 
</P>
<P>
A recent lunch started with a cream of mushroom soup that had been enriched 
with a cheese of the Cheddar type, which did nothing for the soup. The Odeum's 
special seafood sandwich, with shrimp and crab salad on rye, was happy enough, 
if not unusual, a comment that could be applied equally well to a turkey hero 
and a basic club sandwich in which the kitchen, without warning, substituted 
ham for the advertised bacon. The substitution was not particularly annoying, 
although it should have been mentioned beforehand. The sandwiches were 
substantial, and were garnished with mounds of unusually creamy potato salad 
flavored with a good deal of fresh dill.

NHL ALL-STAR GAME A FAMILY AFFAIR FOR THE MULLEN BROTHERS

<P>
When your linemates growing up in Hell's Kitchen are Jose Garcia and Julio 
Quinones, you gain a special perspective that no Canadian skating prodigy could 
inherit. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Mullen wasn't about to pout Tuesday night when Wayne Gretzky won his 14th 
car as Most Valuable Player in the 40th National Hockey League All-Star Game at 
Northlands Coliseum. Mullen had traveled too long and too far from the streets 
of New York to stoop to pettiness. 
</P>
<P>
While the hockey world focused on what Gretzky termed his "extra-special" 
triumphant return to Edmonton, Mullen was enjoying an extra-special night of 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
Mullen had two goals on a line with Mark Messier and Joe Nieuwendyk, including 
the game-winner in the Campbell Conference's 9-5 rout of the Wales Conference. 
Mullen, the Calgary Flames right winger, was buzzing. Smooth. Swift. Bullet 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
While the cameras clicked at Gretzky's wife, actress Janet Jones, and their 
7-week-old daughter Paulina, Tom and Marion Mullen sat unobtrusively watching 
their sons. 
</P>
<P>
Joey was in the white uniform. Brian, from the New York Rangers, was in the 
black uniform. The Mullen family, however, was colorblind this night. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing Brian and I thought when we got named to the All-Star Game was 
that we've got to bring them up to watch this game," Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up at my parents when we came off the ice," Brian said. "Their faces 
were glowing. During the national anthem, I looked across the ice at Joe. A lot 
of things run through your head." 
</P>
<P>
Many observers thought Mullen had outplayed Campbell teammate Gretzky, who 
finished with one goal and three points in his head-to-head duel against Mario 
Lemieux. But if you were on the media panel and more than 17,000 fans were 
standing, cheering and screaming every time No. 99 climbed over the boards, how 
would you have voted? 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to admit that it was pretty nice Gretz got the MVP," said Quebec's 
Walt Poddubny, who also had two goals. "Both Gretz and Joe played great." 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried about any of that," Mullen said. "Glen Sather was great. He 
sent me out there on a line with Wayne and Jari Kurri near the end to try and 
get me the hat trick. It was terrific just to be here for me." 
</P>
<P>
The guys back in New York, however, could do a lot of talking on Joe Mullen's 
behalf. Although he already has five 40-goal seasons and has a shot at 50 this 
year, this was the first time Mullen was selected to the All-Star Game. When 
Boston Coach Terry O'Reilly added Brian to the Wales, the Mullens became the 
first American brothers to play in the same All-Star event. 
</P>
<P>
To all those New York hockey fanatics who pour out their money so they can pour 
out their hearts and souls in the upper reaches of Madison Square Garden, the 
Mullens are heroes. Besides Staten Island's Nick Fotiu, there has been no other 
New York-grown talent in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go back to New York, I see how excited they are for us," Joe said. "A 
lot of people back there are living their dreams through us. You feel you're 
not only doing it for yourself but for them, too. That's a nice feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The Mullens grew up on West 49th Street in Manhattan. Tom Mullen worked in 
Madison Square Garden helping to resurface the ice and paint the lines. Roller 
hockey was the Mullens' sport. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, they turned to ice hockey. There was only one junior team in New 
York, the Westsiders in the Met League that Hartford Whalers General Manager 
Emile Francis helped form when he was running the Rangers. Brian said older 
brothers Tom and Ken were as talented as he and Joe, but New York kids just 
didn't get the chance several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
When Joe was playing for the Westsiders in the 1970s, not many college coaches 
were interested. Eventually, Mullen got a scholarship to Boston College. Brian, 
five years younger, went to the University of Wisconsin. As if geographics and 
finances didn't work against Joe, many people insisted that at 5-foot-9, 175 
pounds, he would be too small to make it as pro. Francis didn't buy it. He knew 
Joe Mullen's roots and signed him to a free-agent contract with the St. Louis 
Blues in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom told me it was worth every dime she ever spent on hockey for us," Joe 
said. "It kept us out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday in Edmonton, Marion Mullen was repaid tenfold.

WITH MAGIC OUT, KAREEM WILL PLAY IN THE NBA ALL-STAR GAME

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar will be playing in Sunday's National Basketball Assn. 
All-Star game in his 20th, and final, professional season, after all. 
</P>
<P>
David Stern, the NBA commissioner, on Thursday selected Abdul-Jabbar as the 
Western Conference roster replacement for Laker guard Magic Johnson, who 
partially tore his left hamstring Wednesday night against the Golden State 
Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, in a prepared statement, said he chose the 41-year-old Laker center 
because he finished with the next-highest vote total from Western Conference 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, however, the league has replaced an injured player with the 
most deserving player at the same position. Stern's action means that the 
Western Conference will play with only one true point guard, Utah's John 
Stockton, and three reserve centers. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley, who will coach the West, had indicated Wednesday night 
that he needed another guard on his roster, the likely candidate being Denver's 
Lafayette Lever. Golden State Warriors forward Chris Mullin could move to 
off-guard, joining Seattle's Dale Ellis and Portland's Clyde Crexler, but Riley 
still has only one ballhandler. 
</P>
<P>
Riley could not be reached Thursday night, but he had said Wednesday night that 
he hoped Stern would select a guard. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, Riley had said that Abdul-Jabbar should have been voted 
onto the team by the coaches because of his contributions to the game. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing Abdul-Jabbar's selection, Stern said: " . . . More importantly, 
his participation in one more All-Star game is a fitting tribute to his 
unequaled NBA career." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar now has been named to the All-Star team in 19 of his 20 seasons. 
He has played in 18 of the games, missing the 1973 game because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lakers said that Johnson underwent treatment on his left 
hamstring Thursday morning and was scheduled to have another electrical 
stimulation treatment Thursday night. Johnson's condition will be evaluated 
Monday in an effort to determine the severity of the injury and probable length 
of rehabilitation.

ICE MAN COMETH;

CHRISTOPHER BOWMAN IS A SHOWMAN, WITH OR WITHOUT HIS SKATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't the greatest performance of his life. After all, Christopher Bowman 
once played a blind boy in "Little House on the Prairie." But it was good 
enough for a Tuesday morning interview with a few of the reporters here for the 
U.S. figure skating championships. 
</P>
<P>
To hear him tell it, life in Van Nuys hasn't been much different from life in 
South-Central Los Angeles. Or Beirut. Figure skating, he said, saved him from 
drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his friends, he said, weren't so lucky. Some of them, he said, looking 
reverently toward the ceiling in the Baltimore Arena, aren't with us anymore. 
</P>
<P>
But he was spared, he said, because of his parents' support. He said that his 
father worked three jobs to pay for figure skating lessons. And spared, too, 
because of his upbringing and service as an altar boy in the Roman Catholic 
church. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the reporters were enthralled. 
</P>
<P>
Others had heard Bowman's act before. 
</P>
<P>
When parts of the interview were repeated to some of Bowman's friends, they 
either laughed or rolled their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"That's Meryl Streep playing Chris Bowman," said Olympic champion Brian 
Boitano, who said that he has visited the home that Bowman shares with his 
parents in a middle-class neighborhood of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
To say that Bowman has a flair for the dramatic is like saying that the sun 
rises in the east. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he's on the ice or not, rarely is he not performing. He usually isn't 
during the compulsory figures, but who can blame him? You wouldn't ask Vladimir 
Horowitz to play scales. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's compulsories at the Mount Pleasant Arena, Bowman finished fourth. 
The only man considered to have a chance to beat him here, Paul Wylie of 
Denver, was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
But it is in the freestyle skating that the true Bowman emerges. Although his 
workouts have been limited because of a deep cut in his left shin suffered 
during an exhibition in December, it is almost a given that he will skate well 
during tonight's original program and even better in Sunday's long program. The 
larger and more enthusiastic the crowd, the more important and pressurized the 
moment, he more he thrives. 
</P>
<P>
"When Christopher goes out there, it's like he's telling the crowd, 'OK, fasten 
your seat belts. You're in for the thrill of your life,' " said Frank Carroll, 
who coaches Bowman at the Pickwick Ice Arena in Burbank. "That has made him a 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, 21, also was injured before last year's national championships, but he 
still finished third, behind Boitano and Wylie. That earned Bowman a berth on 
the Olympic team at Calgary, Canada, where he finished seventh. A month later 
at Budapest, he was fifth in the World Championships. If he is fully recovered, 
he could win a medal at this year's World Championships next month at Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll responded to a question about Bowman's potential by asking a few of his 
own, then supplying the answers. 
</P>
<P>
"Is he a terrific athlete? Yes. Have there been times when his performances 
have been the best in the world? Yes. Is he the most talented man in the world? 
Yes. Do I think he will be a world champion? That depends on Christopher. It 
depends on how much he's willing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman's work habits haven't changed much since he first began working with 
Carroll as a hyperactive 5-year-old. To get his precocious pupil's attention, 
Carroll found that he sometimes had to turn him upside down and drop him head 
first into a trash can. 
</P>
<P>
More questions and answers from Carroll: 
</P>
<P>
"Is Christopher an angel? No. Is he a coach's dream? No. When the curtain goes 
up, can you always expect him to give the very best he has in him? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certainly things I'd like to change about him. I'd like to change 
his ideas about how to train. We all want obedient students. But it's not 
always the obedient students who are the winners. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had kids who do everything I tell them in practice, but when they go out 
there for a competition, their legs turn to water. They literally tremble. You 
don't have to worry about that with Christopher." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, but how the U.S. figure skating community does worry about Bowman! During a 
telecast last year, ABC commentator Dick Button questioned Bowman's commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman was furious, but Button hasn't changed his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of flak because I said he wasn't dedicated enough," Button 
recently told the Baltimore Sun. "It's strictly up to him whether he achieves 
things or not. The whole question is what kind of skating he does. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very talented boy. Is he a skater who will leave the sport different or 
better, or will he just be a hell of a nightclub act? He can win and not be a 
great skater or he can not win and be a great skater. It would be great for the 
sport if he put it all together." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll doesn't disagree with that assessment, but, at the same time, he 
doesn't believe the media have always painted an accurate picture of Bowman. He 
mentioned in particular an ABC "Up Close and Personal" feature during the 
Olympics that showed him at Venice Beach with roller skates on his feet and two 
women on each arm. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the only day he went to the beach all year, and he came across 
looking like a beach bum," Carroll said. "It's not fair to paint Christopher as 
a fun-loving Hollywood flake. He is a very intelligent young man who has a lot 
of talent in many areas and a lot of class about him." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Carroll acknowledged that ABC didn't handcuff Bowman and force him to go 
to the beach with four bikini-clad blondes. "Christopher is a showman," he 
said. "Does he know how to work a room? Yes. He can size somebody up in five 
minutes and know what to say to make them dangle on a string." 
</P>
<P>
His personality, however, sometimes takes on more menacing overtones. On his 
final night in Calgary, he returned to the room he shared with Wylie in the 
Olympic Village at 4 a.m. Now able to laugh about it, Boitano said that 
Bowman's behavior was so strange that a terrified Wylie left immediately for 
the airport, fleeing in such a hurry that he forgot to take his skates. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul thought Chris was a demon," Boitano said. "They're good friends, but I 
don't think they'll ever room together again." 
</P>
<P>
On his left wrist, Bowman has a tattoo of a heart with horns and a tail. He 
keeps it hidden under his watch and said that he wants to have it removed. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he is a practicing Catholic, is not involved in devil worship and 
that most of the other rumors about him are untrue. One that apparently isn't 
untrue concerns the high living that he and Soviet skater Sergei Grinkov, half 
of the Olympic gold-medal pairs team, did last summer during a tour stop in 
London. The Soviets sent Grinkov home. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had my problems, emotionally, physically and every which way," Bowman 
said. "The other things you hear, it's really a misconception. There's been 
things like, 'He's used drugs; he's a (cough) homosexual.' 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is fueled by different things, by curiosity, by jealousy. There's 
a lot of gossip in the skating community. That's their inadvertent way of 
communicating. 
</P>
<P>
"But I've always been myself, an individual. That leads to mystery. Sooner or 
later, you have these National Enquirer type stories." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has ever used drugs, he said, "No, I'm totally innocent." 
</P>
<P>
There are so many stories about Bowman's rampant heterosexuality that no one 
would even bother to ask if he is a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a girl in every port, including most Communist countries," Carroll 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Bowman said that those stories aren't exaggerated, although he insisted 
that they are dated. "There are a lot of groupies in this sport," he said. 
"There was a time when I was younger that I took advantage of it. But I don't 
do that anymore. It makes it too difficult if you want to have a relationship. 
You have too much explaining to do when you get these calls on your answering 
machine." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said that he is living with his parents since he moved out of a former 
girlfriend's house in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is believed that judges will, perhaps subconsciously, mark down a 
skater if they don't believe he represents the sport well, Carroll said he 
doesn't believe that Bowman's active social life will cost him points. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many men in the U.S. Figure Skating Assn.," he said. "They love 
to hear these little womanizing stories about Christopher. There is so much 
gossip in this sport about the men being gay. I don't think there are any more 
gay figure skaters than there are gay gymnasts or gay divers or gay anything 
else. But figure skaters hear it because they're in a performing sport. 
</P>
<P>
"So it's good for the sport for Christopher to have this image. Judges find it 
charming."

CHARGERS GIVE HENNING A CHANCE TO TRY TO CURE AN AILING TEAM

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Chargers hired Washington Redskins assistant Dan Henning Thursday 
to run a football team that might be better served in its immediate future by 
Doug Henning. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Henning is a football coach who compiled a four-year record of 22-41-1 with 
the Atlanta Falcons during his only previous experience as a head coach. Doug 
Henning is a magician who once made an elephant disappear on television. 
</P>
<P>
"Statistics," Dan Henning said, defending his record in Atlanta, " . . . you 
can do anything you want with them. That statistic does not mean I'm not a good 
football coach." 
</P>
<P>
Age, injuries, the end of quarterback Steve Bartkowski's career and apparent 
inconsistent ownership provided by the Rankin Smith family might have prevented 
Henning from doing much of anything with the Falcons. "Let's just say Dan 
Henning has another chance," said Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of 
football operations and the man who recommended Henning to owner Alex Spanos. 
</P>
<P>
Henning's first task with the Chargers will be to pull a quarterback out of his 
hat and turn a 6-10 team into a playoff contender. The Chargers have given him 
five years to do so. But if he doesn't make significant progress before then, 
he probably will disappear just as quickly as his predecessor, Al Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
Significant progress on the fly won't be easy. The Chargers' first-string 
quarterback at the moment is Mark Malone, who compiled the lowest listed 
quarterback rating in the AFC each of the last two years. The most valuable 
member of the Charger defense would appear to be its coordinator, Ron Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn, one of the finalists to replace Saunders, will remain as defensive 
coordinator. Henning had little choice in the matter. Ortmayer and Spanos 
mandated that in the interest of continuity. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said that Lynn's assistants, defensive line coach Gunther Cunningham 
and linebacker coach Mike Haluchek, will probably stay, too. Cunningham, 
though, has talked with other National Football League teams and Lynn said it 
was not certain that Cunningham would return. 
</P>
<P>
Henning's field of expertise is on the offensive side of the football. He has 
coached Don Strock, Bob Griese, Joe Namath and Joe Theismann, among others, in 
a career that began as an assistant at Florida State in 1968 and included a 
stop at Virginia Tech and NFL jobs in Houston, New York, Miami, Washington 
twice, and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
His trademarks are an appetite for work during the season, a craving for 
cigarettes and an undying appreciation for a yarn well spun. His speaking 
accent is part Queens, where he grew up, and part Virginia, where he was 
tutored as William &amp; Mary's quarterback by a skinny backfield coach named 
Lou Holtz. 
</P>
<P>
Henning, 46, won the Charger job over a group of candidates that included Lynn, 
former California and Illinois coach Mike White, Chicago assistant Johnny 
Roland, and Wayne Sevier, the Chargers' special teams coach. "He was the right 
man for the job," Ortmayer said. "The continuity factor was a big factor and 
his previous head coaching experience in the NFL was very important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer was especially enamored of Henning's contribution as an offensive 
assistant to the 1982 Washington Super Bowl victory. Henning left to coach the 
Falcons, got fired after four years and returned in 1987 to the Redskins. 
Washington won a second Super Bowl that season.

The women's basketball teams of USC and UCLA will play tonight at 7 at Pauley 
Pavilion in a game that has more meaning as a sputtering rivalry than in 
determining postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins are 9-10 and have lost their last three games. In the Pacific 10 
Conference, they are in fourth place with a 5-4 record, one game out of third. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has shot only 36% from the field in its last three games. The leading 
scorers are freshman center Molly Tideback (12.7 points) and junior forward 
Sandra vanEmbricqs (12.5 points). 
</P>
<P>
USC, which is 3-6 in conference play, is in a three-way tie for sixth. Cherie 
Nelson is USC's leading scorer at 25.2 points.

Loyola Marymount possibly can move back into a tie for the West Coast Athletic 
Conference lead with basketball games tonight at the University of San Diego 
and Saturday at St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, 13-8 overall, are 6-2 in the WCAC, tied with St. Mary's in second 
place a game behind Pepperdine, which plays at St. Mary's tonight. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, 6-14 and 1-7, will probably try to slow the tempo. The Lions are 
averaging 114.3 points, No. 1 in the nation, and its top scoring trio of Hank 
Gathers, Jeff Fryer and Enoch Simmons is accounting for nearly 78 points a 
game. San Diego is led by freshman Gylan Dottin's 12.9-point average. ALAN

AUSTRIAN TAKES DOWN NAMES IN SLALOM; 
</P>
<P>
ZURBRIGGEN, TOMBA, GIRARDELLI, STENMARK CAN'T CATCH UP WITH NIERLICH 
</P>

<P>
The so-called Big Three -- Marc Girardelli, Pirmin Zurbriggen and Alberto Tomba 
-- went head-to-head on Vail Mountain Thursday in a giant slalom that was also 
one of the last stops on Ingemar Stenmark's farewell tour. 
</P>
<P>
None of them, however, could head off blond, wiry Rudolf Nierlich, who gave 
Austria its second gold medal of the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Zurbriggen, who won this event in the 1987 championships on home snow at 
Crans-Montana, Switzerland, managed to escape with the bronze, just behind 
Nierlich's roommate, Helmut Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
As for the others, Girardelli finished fourth; Stenmark came in sixth, and 
Tomba, the 1988 Olympic giant slalom gold medalist, wound up seventh after 
bouncing up from a near-spill in the first run. 
</P>
<P>
So, Zurbriggen, who was second in Wednesday's super-G race, Tomba and Stenmark 
have just one more shot left at a gold medal, in the slalom on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Nierlich will be in that race, too, and his rise to prominence here 
is not really a surprise, since he has won two World Cup races this season -- a 
giant slalom at Kirchberg, Austria, and a slalom at Wengen, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Schranz, Austria's two-time World Cup champion in 1969-70, said, "Nierlich 
is one of the new skiers. His skis don't chatter or slide from side to side. He 
just gets on and off his edges with very little wasted effort. When you watch 
him race, he doesn't look like he's going very fast, but he is." 
</P>
<P>
Nierlich, who will turn 23 later this month, was indeed very fast in the first 
run, almost a full second ahead of the field in 1:17.07. In the second run, 
Mayer was quickest, in 1:20.14, but despite a problem near the middle of the 
course, Nierlich was only 0.45 seconds slower and ended up getting the gold by 
a 1.62-second margin with a total time of 2:37.66. Zurbriggen was another 0.10 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great lead," Nierlich said, "and I felt confident, so I decided to 
just go for it in the second run, too. I was aggressive but made a mistake and 
almost fell, so I decided to be more cautious in the bottom half and just try 
to finish my run. 
</P>
<P>
Between runs, Nierlich said, he and Mayer went back to their room, "and we 
talked about a lot of things, but very little about the race." 
</P>
<P>
What most people here were talking about between runs was Tomba's spectacular 
recovery. Italy's "La Bomba" fell over on his right side in the top portion of 
the first course, skidded along in the snow on his elbow, then sprang back onto 
his skis and barely squeaked around the next gate. The mishap cost him valuable 
time and any chance for a medal as he finished the first run in 15th place, 
2.75 seconds behind Nierlich. 
</P>
<P>
He had the second fastest second run but could climb only eight places. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just unlucky," Tomba said. "I was going really fast and I am not quite 
sure what happened. Maybe I am running out of luck, because I had too much of 
it last year. Anyway, my second run showed that I am in great shape, and I am 
looking forward to the slalom." 
</P>
<P>
Some Italian ski officials and journalists have complained for 6 months that 
Tomba spent too much time on the party circuit last summer after winning two 
Olympic gold medals at Calgary, but he seems to be on his way back. Tune in 
again Sunday for Part II of the miniseries, "La Bomba or La Bum-ba?" 
</P>
<P>
Girardelli, who has already won a gold medal for Luxembourg in the combined, 
said, "Tomba should be favored in the slalom, but I am making progress this 
week and am ready to go, too." 
</P>
<P>
Stenmark, the great Swede who will retire just a few days before his 33rd 
birthday next month during the World Cup Finals at Shigakogen, Japan, after 
posting a record 85 victories on the circuit, skied two even runs, the sixth 
fastest each time, for his sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
Zurbriggen, who turned 26 last Saturday, is also planning to retire, but not 
until March 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I am skiing for my own pleasure now," he said after earning his second medal 
in 2 days. "Every year, it is getting harder to train and to motivate myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy just to be in the top three. Today, there are 15 skiers who can win 
in each race. So, you have to ski to the limit and can't afford to make a 
mistake. You need a little bit of luck to win." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there are sometimes more than 15 who must be considered contenders. 
Tomaz Cizman of Yugoslavia came from No. 22 for the bronze medal in Wednesday's 
super-G, and Thursday, Kyle Wieche, 21, of Farmington, Conn., came in ninth for 
the highest U.S. placing, after starting No. 27. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible," said Wieche, whose best finish in his first World Cup season 
was a 26th at Kirchberg, "to be able to do this here, with everyone cheering 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
Wieche is part of the U.S. Ski Team's youth movement. Two of the older hands, 
Felix McGrath and Tiger Shaw, didn't fare as well. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath finished 21st but said he is "looking forward" to his favorite event, 
the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw fell on the last steep pitch before the finish in the second run and tore 
a ligament in his left knee. He's not looking forward to the slalom, but rather 
to a recovery of three to four months, as predicted by Dr. Richard Steadman, 
who will perform arthroscopic surgery on Shaw Tuesday at South Lake Tahoe, 
Calif.

CANDIDATES NARROWED TO 2 FOR DEL MAR TRACK LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state commission narrowed the field Thursday to a pair of finalists for a new 
Del Mar Race Track lease, eliminating from consideration a partnership snubbed 
by local residents for its plans to offer concerts along with horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
After more than five hours of discussion at the Del Mar Fairgrounds, the state 
Race Track Leasing Commission voted, 4-1, to scratch the Ogden-Nederlander 
partnership from the competition for the 20-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision left only the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, a local 
outfit that has operated the track for the past two decades, and Florida horse 
racing impresario John J. Brunetti as the remaining contenders. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the six-man leasing commission, which is composed of three 
high-ranking state officials and three Del Mar Fair Board members, the 
finalists will return in one month for a showdown to determine which group will 
get the lucrative lease. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner William J. Anthony, a state general services official, abstained 
from the vote, and Commissioner Jan Anton, a fair board director, dissented. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Thoroughbred Club expressed surprise at the commission's 
decision to delay a final vote, but they remained confident about their 
ultimate chances. 
</P>
<P>
The big loser was the Ogden-Nederlander partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Jack Parnell, the state's Food and Agriculture Department 
director, said the partnership's plans for an eclectic mix of up to 40 concerts 
ranging from symphony performances to rock 'n' roll threatened to undermine the 
state-mandated role of the Del Mar Fair Board, which operates the seaside 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of local residents and officials appeared before the commission to 
complain about the potential impact of the concerts, contending that they would 
cause problems with noise, traffic and pollution.

ANOTHER HORSE RUNNING AT SANTA ANITA TURNS UP WITH POSITIVE COCAINE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trainer Laz Barrera, whose son, Albert, ran a horse last week at Santa Anita 
that tested positive for cocaine, said Thursday that someone would have to be 
"very stupid" to try to win a race that way. 
</P>
<P>
"They would have to be very stupid . . . to use cocaine," said the elder 
Barrera, who is in racing's Hall of Fame. "Because you know that if you use it, 
they're going to pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press, Albert Barrera denied knowledge of how the 
cocaine got into the system of the horse when he was questioned by a California 
Horse Racing Board investigator. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent detection is at least the third since a horse trained by Roger 
Stein tested positive for the drug after a race last October at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Len Foote, executive secretary of the CHRB, said that the state lab has found 
two other cocaine positives recently. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Barrera, 34, trains Coastal Commission, a 4-year-old filly who ran next 
to last after going off as the 2-1 favorite in a race at Santa Anita last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A California state investigator said that a search of Albert Barrera's barn at 
Santa Anita turned up nothing illegal. BILL CHRISTINE

THIRD IN JUVENILE IS LUCKY SPOT FOR DERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Christine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Horses that finish third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile have a better record in 
the Kentucky Derby than horses that have won the $1-million fall race for 
2-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, when the inaugural Breeders' Cup was run at Hollywood Park, Spend a 
Buck was supplemented into the Juvenile for $120,000. His owner, Dennis Diaz, 
fell $12,000 short of breaking even when Spend a Buck ran third. But the next 
May, the colt won the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Alysheba, the Derby winner in 1987, ran third in the Breeders' Cup the previous 
year. The winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile has never won the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Last November at Churchill Downs, Tagel, a French-raced 2-year-old, ran third 
in the Juvenile, finishing 9 1/4 lengths behind the winner, Is It True, and 
trailing Easy Goer, the runner-up and 3-10 favorite, by eight lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Francois Boutin, the French trainer who has Tagel, was at Santa Anita last 
weekend and said that the 3-year-old son of Cox's Ridge is being prepared for 
the Kentucky Derby on May 6. 
</P>
<P>
Tagel, bought at a Kentucky yearling sale for $725,000 by Allen Paulson, was 
sent back to France after the Breeders' Cup. Boutin said that Tagel will run 
only one race there -- either in late March or early April -- and return to 
Churchill Downs the week of the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Although he seemed to be overmatched by Is It True and Easy Goer, Tagel 
actually ran an exceptional race in the Breeders' Cup. It was his first race on 
dirt, the first time he has run counter-clockwise, and he went into the race 
with a sore mouth. Tagel was undefeated before the Breeders' Cup, having won 
twice on the grass at Longchamp. 
</P>
<P>
Bold Arrangement, an import from England, ran second to Ferdinand in the 1986 
Derby. The week before the Derby, Bold Arrangement finished third at Keeneland 
in the Blue Grass, his first American start. Canonero II won the 1971 Derby 
coming off prep races in Venezuela, after running a couple of times as a 
2-year-old at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Noel (Spec) Richardson, the last remaining principal from the controversial 
match race between Seabiscuit and Ligaroti at Del Mar in 1938, died last week 
at 75. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson rode Ligaroti, who was nosed out by Seabiscuit in a $25,000 
winner-take-all race. Ligaroti was owned by singer Bing Crosby and his son, 
Lin. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson and George Woolf, Seabiscuit's jockey, were locked in physical 
combat through the stretch. In a 1983 interview, Richardson said that if there 
had been head-on camera angles, as there are now, the stewards would have 
disqualified Seabiscuit and Woolf. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Mills of Murrieta Hot Springs was an assistant starter who handled 
Seabiscuit in the gate that day. 
</P>
<P>
"The gate was pulled into the infield after the start, and that's where the 
assistant starters were until the horses passed the eighth pole," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, I stepped out onto the track to see the finish from behind. 
What I saw does not agree with what Spec Richardson remembers. 
</P>
<P>
"Just past the eighth pole, when Seabiscuit started to move ahead of Ligaroti, 
Spec reached over and took hold of Seabiscuit's saddle cloth, pulling him back. 
As the two horses neared the finish line, apparently Woolf realized what was 
happening and reached out and took hold of Ligaroti's bridle rein." 
</P>
<P>
Peg Grueneberg's unusual picture of jockey Nate Hubbard clutching his horse's 
neck after he was jolted from the saddle at Golden Gate Fields last week is 
similar to a prize-winning shot taken at River Downs near Cincinnati in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In the River Downs shot, the horse went down on a sloppy track and was sliding 
across the finish line with jockey Bernie Sayler still aboard. Tom Baker, the 
photographer, received an Eclipse Award at a dinner in Miami Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks before the dinner, Sayler called the Eclipse organizers, asking if 
they were going to pay his way to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"Without me, there wouldn't have been a picture," Sayler said. 
</P>
<P>
He had a point, but he still didn't get a free trip to the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron, who rode his first winner at Bowie in Maryland 15 years ago 
Thursday, is eligible for the first time to be voted into racing's Hall of Fame 
in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. McCarron won a record 546 races in 1974 and has about 
4,500 lifetime. Another jockey who may be new to the Hall of Fame ballot this 
year is Eddie Delahoussaye. Sandy Hawley was on the ballot last year, but Angel 
Cordero was the only jockey who polled enough votes. 
</P>
<P>
Cutlass Reality, who hasn't run since the Breeders' Cup, has been assigned 124 
pounds for Sunday's $250,000 San Antonio Handicap at Santa Anita. Other 
probable starters are Super Diamond, 121 pounds; Cherokee Colony, 120; Payant, 
118; Stalwars, 115; and Stylish Winner, 112. 
</P>
<P>
A 2-year-old doesn't win world-champion quarter horse honors very often, but in 
a close vote, Merganser won the horse-of-the-year title for 1988. Merganser won 
three major races, including the $2.5-million All American Futurity. . . . 
Sunshine Forever, champion male turf horse in 1988, makes his debut as a 
4-year-old on Saturday in the Canadian Turf Championship at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
If Dixieland Brass goes on to win the Kentucky Derby, his trainer, Charlie 
Peoples, will be called a genius because he added blinkers back in September. 
Dixieland Brass has won four of five starts since the equipment change. . . . 
It wasn't well known that Easy Goer suffered sore shins after his second-place 
finish in the Breeders' Cup, but the winter-book Kentucky Derby favorite is 
training splendidly in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The site for the 1990 Breeders' Cup is expected to be announced on Kentucky 
Derby day -- May 6 -- at Churchill Downs. Some Breeders' Cup directors are 
uncomfortable with a return to the West Coast -- because Hollywood Park had 
operational glitches when the races were held there in 1987 and because of the 
recent criticism of Santa Anita's grass course. The favorites for 1990 are 
Churchill Downs and Belmont Park. This year's races will be held at Florida's 
Gulfstream Park on Nov. 4.

WILLIAMS SITS AND CLIPPERS LOSE TO SUNS, 120-113

<TEXT>
<P>
Don Casey, who in his short tenure as a National Basketball Assn. head coach 
has sometimes been critical of his own maneuvers, dismissed any second-guessing 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
In the closing minutes of the Clippers' eventual 120-113 loss to Phoenix 
Thursday night before 11,089 at Veterans Memorial Coliseum, Reggie Williams had 
as much chance of getting into the game as the Suns' gorilla mascot. 
</P>
<P>
Forget that he is the best three-point shooter on the team -- and, with Quintin 
Dailey on the suspended list, the biggest outside threat. 
</P>
<P>
With the Clippers surprisingly in the game and looking for their second 
straight win after losing 19 in a row, Williams wouldn't get a chance on 
offense because of his defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time he was guarding a man, the guy scored," Casey said after the 
Clippers dropped to 11-37. "I think there's a trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
So Williams will continue to get minimal playing time until his defense 
improves? 
</P>
<P>
"That would be a good supposition," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Other assumptions could be made after the Clippers lost for the 31st time in 36 
games: None of the Clipper guards had much success on defense, as Kevin 
Johnson's 34 points and 18 assists will attest. 
</P>
<P>
And Williams, who played only 12 minutes against the Suns, all in the first 
half, after just 22 the night before in the victory over Houston, is becoming 
despondent. 
</P>
<P>
"That (the knock on his defense) is the same stuff Gene Shue talked about," 
said Williams, who is shooting 43.8% this season after just 35.6% as a rookie. 
"I play good defense, I rebound, I pass. I guess they have to find some excuse 
not to play me. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why they benched me all of a sudden. Everyone else gets the 
chance to get into a rhythm and feel good. I'm out there, and if I make a 
mistake, I'm out. I need the minutes to look good just like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm being shortchanged. I work hard during the games and at practice and 
should be able to get the playing time." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had 14 assists in the first two quarters, setting a franchise record 
for the most in a half. He finished by scoring 13 points in the fourth quarter, 
mostly on free throws, to help hold off the Clippers, who had rallied from 20 
points down in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin scored a season-high 29 points for the Clippers, while Ken 
Norman, after scoring 32 against Houston, had 27. . . . Danny Manning, three 
weeks after his knee operation, said he wasn't able to follow the just-ended 
Clipper losing streak very closely, although he is considering coming to a game 
soon. "Right now, I'm kind of in my own world," Manning said, referring to his 
concentrated efforts on rehabilitation.

HORNETS SURPRISE HAWKS, 110-108

The Charlotte Hornets are keeping their home fans buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Reid sank a 15-foot jump shot with 10 seconds left Thursday night at 
Charlotte, N.C., as the Hornets beat the Atlanta Hawks, 110-108. The expansion 
team rallied from a seven-point deficit in the fourth quarter to improve its 
home-court record to 10-14. The Hornets are 13-35 overall. Two of the last 
three wins have been against top teams. Last week the Hornets beat the Seattle 
SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
The winning shot was the climax of Reid's best game of the season. He was 7 for 
10 from the field in the fourth quarter to help wipe out the seven-point 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Wilkins sank a jumper with 30 seconds remaining before Reid made his 
go-ahead shot. Kelly Tripucka made one of two free throws to make it 110-108. 
At the buzzer, the Hawks' Moses Malone missed a 12-foot jumper. 
</P>
<P>
"This may not have been the best game we've played," said Hornet Coach Dick 
Harter. "But I don't think we ever played any harder. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite that, we were down seven. Reid got hot, but we had to work for every 
point." 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks were missing injured forwards Antoine Carr and Cliff Levingston, so 
Jon Koncak opened at center and Malone shifted to forward. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 108, San Antonio 103 -- In another game in which the opposition kept 
the ball away from Michael Jordan, Craig Hodges came through to end the Bulls' 
three-game road losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges scored 14 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter to keep the Spurs at 
bay. His three-point shot with 38 seconds left ended the Spurs' hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, still bothered by a sore knee, had 23 points, nine assists, six 
rebounds and six turnovers.

Dallas 94, Utah 87 -- Mark Aguirre blows hot and cold. When he's hot, the 
Mavericks are a match for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Salt Lake City, Aguirre was sizzling. He scored half of his 32 
points in the second quarter to help the Mavericks build a 47-40 lead by 
halftime. They never trailed in the second half despite a 30-point performance 
by Karl Malone. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks have won three of their last four games. In the three victories, 
Aguirre, rumored to be on the trading block, had 36, 24 and 32. In the game 
they lost, Aguirre scored seven points in 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 142, Golden State 117 -- Just 24 hours after beating the Lakers at 
the Forum, the Warriors ran into a group of sharpshooters at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings sank a record 16 three-point shots, going 16 for 31. Ricky Berry made 
seven, one shy of the NBA record. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 108, Indiana 99 -- For a team that came into the game at Richfield, 
Ohio, with a 1-21 road record, the Pacers proved very difficult for the club 
with the best record in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers played the Cavaliers on even terms until Mark Price and Larry Nance 
each scored eight points in a 20-5 spurt midway through the fourth quarter to 
break the game open. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers had four more field goals than the Cavaliers, but Cleveland was 31 
of 37 from the free-throw line to 13 of 20 for Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 110, New Jersey 103 -- The improving Nets led, 82-71, late in the 
third period at Landover, Md., before Harvey Grant and Darrell Walker led a 
rally by the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Each scored six points in a 14-0 spurt that enabled the Bullets to end a 
four-game losing streak. Jeff Malone topped the winners with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 113, Portland 110 -- Otis Thorpe made a three-point play with 51 
seconds left and Eric (Sleepy) Floyd scored 25 points to lead the Rockets at 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler scored 36 points for Portland and center Sam Bowie, making his 
first appearance after 2 1/2 years of injuries, had six points in 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 117, Miami 92 -- Fat Lever scored 32 of his career-high 38 points in the 
first half at Denver as the Nuggets coasted to victory. Miami has lost 14 in a 
row on the road. DAN HAFNER

Wade Boggs will fight Margo Adams' $12-million lawsuit in court rather than try 
to reach a settlement with his longtime mistress, the Boston Red Sox star said 
after giving an eight-hour deposition at a hearing in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs admitted in testimony that Adams was his companion on team trips. Their 
affair ended last year during a storm of angry allegations. The five-time 
American League batting champion said that there was never an agreement on an 
amount that Adams would be paid in compensation for her time.

THE ROCK ACTIVIST; 
</P>
<P>
DANNY GOLDBERG IS ON A ROLL, COALITION-BUILDING FOR A DAZZLING ARRAY OF CAUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a typical morning for Danny Goldberg, rock entrepreneur and political 
activist extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
In a Universal City office that looked as if a mild earthquake had just rolled 
through it -- the gold albums and celebrity-inscribed photos of Don Johnson, 
Sheena Easton and other clients all slightly askew, and wads of paper and loose 
cassettes scattered on the floor -- Goldberg was glued to the phone. 
</P>
<P>
One minute he was talking to an agent in Denmark about whether Johnson, the 
"Miami Vice" star who recently launched a singing career, should do a concert 
tour in Europe; the next minute he was calling Joan Baez about an upcoming 
awards dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Then he switched gears and moved to politics, agreeing to set up a meeting for 
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos with two local Democratic bigwigs: "Irving" (as 
in Irving Azoff, the MCA Entertainment head and Democratic contributor) and 
"Stanley" (as in Stanley Sheinbaum, the influential economist, publisher and 
lion of the political left). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Intense Investigator 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, Goldberg was trooping up and down the antiseptic corridors of 
MacLaren Hall, Los Angeles County's emergency shelter for abused children in El 
Monte, with a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union and a five-member 
welcoming committee of top administrators. He was intent on getting a handle on 
the kinds of children who wind up there -- and whether MacLaren needs any 
prodding to serve them better. A few months earlier, he had toured the jails 
with the same intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't golf, I don't ski, I don't play tennis," Goldberg, a tall man with a 
slight paunch and longish, tousled hair, said recently. "The time other people 
put into what they would call their hobby, I put into this stuff" -- by which 
he meant an array of social and political issues that concern him, from 
stopping U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and fighting censorship of rock 
lyricists to stumping for the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg is president of Gold Spaceship Management, which manages stellar rock 
and pop names such as Belinda Carlisle, Bonnie Raitt and Johnson. He also is 
president of two record companies: Gold Castle, aimed at the "Big Chill" 
generation reared on Joan Baez, Judy Collins and Peter, Paul and Mary; and Gold 
Mountain, which features newer artists such as ex-Sex Pistols guitarist Steve 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
But, as his recent morning schedule indicates, Goldberg is not just a 
successful rock 'n' roll entrepreneur. At 38, he is fast becoming the Norman 
Lear of the baby-boom generation, an outspoken activist who is marshaling the 
resurgent activism of Hollywood's brightest young stars behind progressive 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Goldberg was reelected to a second term as chairman of the Southern 
California American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, the youngest person ever 
to hold the position with the ACLU's legal and educational arm. 
</P>
<P>
Some who have witnessed Goldberg's rapid ascent in local and national political 
circles say he has carved out a niche for himself as someone who not only can 
put money and celebrities together for a candidate or cause but who has some 
fresh ideas about communicating the progressive point of view to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Lear -- the television producer who founded People for the American Way, the 
liberal lobbying group formed nine years ago to counter the influence of the 
Fundamentalist Right -- calls Goldberg one of Hollywood's new leaders who is 
encouraging social and political involvement by young entertainers, including 
the "Brat Pack" crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a terrific role model for that generation of young performers . . . the 
Meg Ryans, Rob Lowes and Ally Sheedys," Lear said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg -- with film producer Patricia Duff-Medavoy, deputy chief city 
attorney John Emerson and Betsy Kenny, vice president for public affairs at Act 
III Communications, Lear's TV production company -- is a founder of the SHOW 
Coalition, an entertainment industry network for the baby-boom-and-younger 
generations. The coalition sponsors educational forums on political issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recruiting New Blood 
</P>
<P>
He has already begun to reinvigorate the ACLU foundation board, recruiting, 
among others, actor Richard Dreyfuss and "Family Ties" television producer Gary 
David Goldberg (no relation). 
</P>
<P>
The rock manager's under-40 status was a major reason, members say, why the 
board of the ACLU foundation picked him two years ago as its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sheinbaum, an ACLU stalwart who nominated Goldberg for the chair Sheinbaum 
held for almost a decade in the 1970s: "The ACLU membership and leadership had 
gotten to be as old as I am, which is 68. It was time to reinvigorate the 
organization with younger people, who were showing signs of (shedding) the 
apathy of the '70s and the yuppiedom of the '80s. Danny, with his wide range of 
contacts and the stature he has with younger people inside and outside of 
entertainment was a natural choice" to lead the group into the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Sheinbaum added, "He's one of the smartest people I have ever known." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg has been "tagged as a guy who can put celebrities and money together," 
said Rick Allen, who was former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart's California primary 
campaign manager. But it is mainly Goldberg's chairmanship of the ACLU, Allen 
said, that puts him on "every (liberal politician's) short list" of influential 
Hollywood leaders to call when in town. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear from damn near all the guys who are thinking about running for 
President," said Allen, an executive in a Beverly Hills development company, 
"and there isn't a single one who doesn't have Danny Goldberg in his top 10." 
</P>
<P>
By his own reckoning, Goldberg was not always a go-getter. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, "I was pretty unmotivated," keenly interested in politics, less 
than absorbed by studying, he said during an interview in a noisy bistro 
downstairs from his office. 
</P>
<P>
A New York native, Goldberg attended Fieldston, a liberal prep school where 
"you didn't have to wear a tie." In the seventh grade, he took part in his 
first political act: With his friend, Joel Goodman, he boycotted the air raid 
drills ordered by the school's officials. Soon after, Goldberg recalled, the 
school dropped the drills. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from high school in 1967, he enrolled at UC Berkeley. But he 
dropped out after a week and "got caught up in the whole hippie life style" in 
Berkeley and later back in New York, immersed in the culture of "Vietnam, Bob 
Dylan, the Beatles, long hair, psychedelics, civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Music Brought It All Together 
</P>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll was the cord that tied it all together for him. 
</P>
<P>
"My fantasy of what rock 'n' roll was," he said, "was that it was part of the 
same cultural change as Martin Luther King, Lenny Bruce and the Village Voice. 
It was this tapestry of new consciousness," and he flowed right along with it. 
</P>
<P>
He worked at odd jobs, hanging chandeliers in a store and delivering messages 
on a bicycle for a courier service. He got a job at Billboard, the music 
industry magazine, as a clerk in the charts department and later as a reviewer. 
But he was fired, he said, because he was always coming in late. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 22, he started to get serious about work "because I just got 
nervous about not making money," Goldberg said. So he free-lanced for the 
Village Voice and Rolling Stone for a few years. Then, putting his journalism 
contacts to use, he went into public relations -- first at the New York firm of 
Solters &amp; Roskin, where his main client was the British band Led Zeppelin, 
and later at his own company, Danny Goldberg Inc. 
</P>
<P>
His political consciousness lay dormant for most of the '70s, he said, while he 
concentrated on "inventing myself as a professional." 
</P>
<P>
The turning point, he said, came in 1980, when he was asked to produce the "No 
Nukes" concerts (and later the documentary by the same name), a series of 
benefits in New York, Washington and Los Angeles by anti-nuclear performers, 
including Bonnie Raitt, Bruce Springsteen and Jackson Browne. That then-Gov. 
Jerry Brown came to a screening of the movie made a lasting impression on 
Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so excited that the governor of California was coming to this little 
movie," he said. "He . . . gave us the feeling that there was room for us in 
the political arena. No one had reached out to my generation that way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest Was Rekindled 
</P>
<P>
Producing the "No Nukes" concerts and film "reactivated a part of me that cared 
about political issues. At the same time, it gave me a glimpse of the fact that 
people from the entertainment business could have some impact on what went on. 
It was the first time it occurred to me that . . . by dint of what I did for a 
living, I could have an influence on what was going on politically." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Goldberg produced voter registration spots that ran on MTV -- little 
mini-music videos featuring rock luminaries as diverse as Twisted Sister, Jimi 
Hendrix and Cyndi Lauper exhorting fans to "feel the power" by registering to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he joined forces with the national ACLU to form the Musical Majority, 
a coalition of rock artists and industry figures opposed to attempts by a group 
of prominent Washington wives to impose a rating system on rock lyrics. Led by 
Tipper Gore, wife of Tennessee Sen. Al Gore Jr., the Parents Music Resource 
Center pushed for an industry-wide agreement to place warning labels on albums 
with sexually explicit language. Goldberg said such a system smacked of 
censorship and enlisted the ACLU's help. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no one else to call," he said. "My friends in politics were not that 
interested in this, and the record company people were sympathetic but (their 
hands were tied) because they were all publicly owned corporations that were 
part of bigger corporations." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Zappa was the only prominent music industry figure who was trying to 
answer the attacks, but Goldberg felt "someone more mainstream" was needed to 
focus the debate. 
</P>
<P>
The Musical Majority mobilized a diverse group of managers and artists, such as 
Don Henley and John Cougar Mellenkamp, to oppose what they perceived as an 
attempt to muzzle rockers' creative freedom. Ira Glasser, executive director of 
the national ACLU, said the group became "a very popular means of organizing on 
behalf of First Amendment rights, which are often not popular." 
</P>
<P>
(Jennifer Norwood, the Parents Music Resource Center executive director, said 
that since 1986, 35 albums -- less than half the number targeted by the group 
-- have been released with the warning labels.) 
</P>
<P>
By 1986 -- further building on what sympathetic observers were starting to call 
a unique talent -- Goldberg teamed with such improbable allies as Atty. Gen. 
John Van de Kamp and heavy-metal rocker Ronnie Dio to produce two dozen 
30-second anti-drug spots called "Rock Against Drugs." Broadcast statewide, the 
spots featured rock stars speaking out against drug abuse in a way teen-agers 
could understand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Snarling Party Boy 
</P>
<P>
Motley Crue's Vince Neil, for example, posed on a motorcycle, snarled that he 
doesn't take drugs but still can "party with the best of them." Van de Kamp's 
office provided $50,000 to help cover production costs, but the performers 
donated their services and MTV gave $3 million in air time. 
</P>
<P>
A Van de Kamp aide said the spots produced voluminous mail from teen-agers who 
liked the message. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unusual tack to take," Van de Kamp said, "but in my view, it was the 
way to go. You don't use Nancy Reagan or a coat-and-tied attorney general" to 
get teen-agers to listen. 
</P>
<P>
The spots also raised Goldberg's profile in the political community. Allen, the 
former Hart campaign aide, said the anti-drug campaign was a "remarkable 
indication" of Goldberg's ability to explain an issue in a way that could be 
easily understood by all kinds of people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Jumped at It' 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, who moved to Los Angeles from New York about five years ago, said it 
took little persuading to get him to accept the ACLU foundation chair the first 
time he was nominated, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I frankly jumped at it," he said. "I was overwhelmed by the vision of how (the 
ACLU used) the court process as a tool of political activism. And, for me 
personally, it was a great step because it wasn't just rock and roll. 
Everything I had done before then was in the context of 'Could I put together a 
concert to raise money for a particular issue?' . . . This gave me a chance to 
get involved with a wider range of issues." 
</P>
<P>
In a business driven by the bottom line, Bonnie Raitt said, Goldberg is unique: 
"He cares about making the world a better place and not just about making 
money. . . . He's not slick, ruthless or shallow (and) he has a refreshing lack 
of interest in the latest trends. His political sensibility," she said, "is the 
real reason why I'm with him (as a client) now." 
</P>
<P>
He is a voracious reader of nonfiction -- he rushed to buy Taylor Branch's 
history of the civil rights movement and Neil Sheehan's chronicle of the 
Vietnam War -- and his language is an odd combination of '60s lingo and 
old-fashioned sayings like "God bless you." 
</P>
<P>
"He is very funny and voluble and his ideas sort of splatter out at a high 
rate," said the national ACLU's Glasser, who met Goldberg about four years ago. 
"He's not a wallflower." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Immediately Likable 
</P>
<P>
In fact, people "don't always like Danny on the first meeting," said Colleen 
O'Connor, ACLU national director of public education, remembering her first 
encounter with Goldberg before he became the Southern California chairman. 
</P>
<P>
It was at a meeting with ACLU officials to discuss ways to counter the campaign 
against suggestive rock lyrics. O'Connor said Goldberg arrived late, having 
just gotten off a Los Angeles-to-New York red-eye flight. He was dressed in 
tattered jeans and appeared on the verge of falling asleep. Then he proceeded 
to dominate the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"Danny has a way of invading a room and taking it over," O'Connor observed. "He 
was a bit obstreperous, far too willing to tell everyone his opinions in lieu 
of listening to theirs. . . . He's like fine wine -- he's better the older he 
gets." 
</P>
<P>
She sees him now as a perceptive and articulate ambassador for the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting the Message Out 
</P>
<P>
Sheinbaum says what he likes most about Goldberg is that he has "a clearly 
worked out set of values . . . that are obviously similar to my own or I 
wouldn't be impressed by them." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg says a long-term goal is to play a major role in communicating "the 
progressive message" to the public, especially through the vehicle of political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said Goldberg began to demonstrate a knack for that as a key member of a 
media advisory group for the short-lived Hart campaign. It was Goldberg who 
proposed a format for television ads in which Hart would talk directly into the 
camera -- a technique known as "breaking through the fourth wall" -- and say 
something to acknowledge that an amount of staging was occurring. He hoped that 
approach would help create an intimacy that the aloof Hart had difficulty 
establishing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the candidacy foundered and Goldberg's ideas were never put to the 
test, Allen said Hart and the campaign staff were impressed by Goldberg's 
attempts to find a way to "package" a candidate who resisted being packaged. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg has been thinking a lot lately about how to effectively communicate a 
political message. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole goal is to turn Reagan-esque communication on its head and try to use 
the flag and Thomas Jefferson and Elvis Presley and the Beatles and all these 
symbols for our point of view," he said recently, perched on the edge of a 
white sofa in his fairly Spartan office. "I hope they (Democrats) are waking 
up. There are a lot of things Democrats have to think about and one of them is 
being committed to communication." 
</P>
<P>
His most immediate challenge is to reshape the ACLU's image, which, many agree, 
President Bush effectively painted in his campaign last year as a left-wing 
group more concerned about criminals than victims. 
</P>
<P>
In a TV counteroffensive launched last fall, conceived jointly by Goldberg and 
Southern California ACLU executive director Ramona Ripston, actors Burt

like having a base of priorities. It's a real exciting time to be involved in 
political activity. I'm very stimulated to be a part of it."

Eagle Poem 
</P>
<P>
To pray you open your whole self 
</P>
<P>
To sky, to earth, to sun, to moon 
</P>
<P>
To one whole voice that is you. 
</P>
<P>
And know there is more 
</P>
<P>
That you can't see, can't hear 
</P>
<P>
Can't know except in moments 
</P>
<P>
Steadily growing, and in languages 
</P>
<P>
That aren't always sound but other 
</P>
<P>
Circles of motion. 
</P>
<P>
Like eagle that Sunday morning 
</P>
<P>
Over Salt River. Circled in blue sky 
</P>
<P>
In wind, swept our hearts clean 
</P>
<P>
With sacred wings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joy Harjo 
</P>
<P>
Born in Tulsa, the first child of a Creek father and a Cherokee-French mother, 
Joy Harjo spent her earliest years in a troubled and impoverished household. 
She doesn't want to talk very much about that time, when she was "so insecure 
and so shy . . . a child who was afraid to speak." 
</P>
<P>
Harjo's writing is often dark. Her poetry draws on American Indian history and 
contemporary problems as well as on Indian mythology and her own life and 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Harjo's heritage is extremely important to her, and she's sensitive about 
discussing problems that can arise from her ethnic background. She also knows 
that, being light-skinned, "I can pass (for white) easily, and sometimes I 
think, you know, this is too hard. It would be easier to not be Indian at all. 
It's hard enough to be one or the other, and it's harder to be both" white and 
Indian. 
</P>
<P>
Being Indian is "very tiring and painful and frustrating and sad and angering, 
given the history," she says. Yet "I'm not trying to bitch and whine and groan, 
because the other side of that is a lot of incredible beauty and insight." 
</P>
<P>
The positive side of being Indian, Harjo says, is the knowledge of a rich 
cultural heritage, a sense of community and connection to the land. "This is 
our land, it's the homeland," she says. "The homeland affects you directly, it 
affects your body, it affects the collective mind, and the collective heart and 
the collective spirit. And so we (Indians) feel it, because there's no 
separation." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, she adds, "I don't like this romanticization of Indian people in which 
Indian people are looked at as spiritual saviors, as people who have always 
taken care of the land. We're human beings. But I think different cultures have 
developed different aspects of humanness." 
</P>
<P>
Harjo lives in a pink building on the outskirts of Tucson, in a unit also 
inhabited by a wistful yellow cat named Custer, two gerbils, a black rabbit, 
three fish and her 20-year-old son, Phil. Her 15-year-old daughter, Rainy Dawn, 
goes to boarding school in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The author of three books of poetry, Harjo, 37, moved here last fall from 
Colorado, where she'd taught for three years at the University of Colorado in 
Boulder. She's now a tenured associate professor of English at the University 
of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always loved the desert," she says. "I've spent most of my life in the 
Southwest. It's certainly influenced my work. I used to dream about it when I 
was young," growing up in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the desert as barren at all, I see it as full and ripe. It doesn't 
need to be flattered with rain. It certainly needs rain, but it does with what 
it has, and creates amazing beauty," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The same could be said for Harjo, who has taken the material of a difficult 
life and created poetry of great power. (She will read some of that work on 
Feb. 18 in the Laguna Poets Winter Poetry Festival, at 2:30 p.m. at the Forum 
Theater in Laguna Beach.) 
</P>
<P>
Harjo lost her shyness on stage in school plays, and early in life she 
demonstrated talent in drawing. At 16, she began attending a New Mexico 
boarding school, the competitive-admission Institute of American Indian Arts in 
Santa Fe. "I was lucky to end up going to school there. In a way it saved me. I 
think if it hadn't intervened, I probably wouldn't have lived very long," she 
says. "I mean, it's hard being an adolescent anyway, but I had a lot of wars 
going on" at home. 
</P>
<P>
She graduated at 17 after participating in one of the first all-Indian drama 
and dance troupes in the U.S. Briefly married, she had her son Phil soon after 
graduation. "Then I spent three years working in a hospital, cleaning rooms, 
working in a health spa, pumping gas in a mini-skirt in Santa Fe, all those 
kind of jobs. And I decided I wanted something more," she says. 
</P>
<P>
With a grant from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and student loans, she attended 
the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, starting out as a pre-med student 
and quickly switching to art "because I couldn't keep away from that." At 22, 
she began writing poetry, and in her last year of school she changed her major 
to creative writing. 
</P>
<P>
During this time she also married the well-known American Indian poet Simon 
Ortiz, with whom she had her daughter, Rainy Dawn. The marriage lasted only 
about two years, but Harjo and Ortiz are still close friends. 
</P>
<P>
She raised her two children while supporting herself, attending school (she 
later earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in poetry at the Iowa Writers 
Workshop) and learning to be a writer. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, she took part in "a lot of protests and marches for Indian 
rights," including demonstrations on behalf of the Indians 
</P>
<P>
who occupied Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973. This political awakening would infuse 
her writing. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a memory. 
</P>
<P>
It swims deep in blood, 
</P>
<P>
a delta in the skin. It swims out of Oklahoma, 
</P>
<P>
deep the Mississippi River. It carries my 
</P>
<P>
feet to these places: the French Quarter, 
</P>
<P>
stale rooms, the sun behind thick and moist 
</P>
<P>
clouds, and I hear boats hauling themselves up 
</P>
<P>
and down the river. 
</P>
<P>
My spirit comes here to drink. 
</P>
<P>
My spirit comes here to drink. 
</P>
<P>
Blood is the undercurrent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 -- (from "New Orleans," by Joy 
</P>
<P>
Harjo, in "She Had Some Horses," 
</P>
<P>
Thunder's Mouth Press, 1983) 
</P>
<P>
Harjo is more than a little leery of the written word, because "there's a lot 
of leeway for lying, because when you have something written down you can't 
look at the person, you're not looking at the person's eyes, you're not in the 
person's presence," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Indians come from an oral rather than a written tradition, Harjo points out. 
"The knowledge was kept by remembering. And that's one of my theories about 
alcoholism among Indian people, that we're basically coming out of an oral 
culture, where you're taught to remember everything. And it can be hard to 
forget" yet painful to remember stories of that culture. 
</P>
<P>
Being a writer who thinks writing things down is dangerous is a little 
quixotic, Harjo admits, but she says: "There's an irony in being a human being. 
There's an irony in writing. I feel that all the time. Maybe that's why I've 
been trying to play a lot more music. I get so frustrated with words, and their 
limitations." For the last four years, Harjo has been learning to play the 
saxophone, which she would eventually like to incorporate into her poetry 
readings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scripts Are Produced 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, Harjo has also written six screenplays, dramatic stories centered 
on American Indian characters. Half those scripts have been produced by small 
film companies and state agencies. In addition, Harjo has written the text to 
accompany the photographs of an astronomer, Stephen Strom, for a book called 
"Secrets From the Center Of the World," to be published by the University of 
Arizona Press this fall, and she is gathering work together for an anthology of 
North American and South American women's writing and starting to write short 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
In her most recent work, Harjo is apt to mix surreal images, as in this prose 
poem from her new manuscript, "In Mad Love And War," to be published by 
Wesleyan University Press in 1990: 
</P>
<P>
 The wind blows lilacs out of the east. And it isn't lilac season. And I am 
walking the street in front of St. Francis Cathedral in Santa Fe, from Denver. 
Oh, and it's a few years earlier and more. That's how you tell real time. It is 
here, it is there. The lilacs have taken over everything: the sky, the narrow 
streets, my shoulders, my lips. I talk lilac. And there is nothing else until a 
woman the size of a fox breaks through the bushes, breaks the purple web. She 
is tall and black and gorgeous. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 -- From "Santa Fe" by Joy Harjo 
</P>
<P>
She likes to be "surprised" by images while writing, Harjo says. 
</P>
<P>
"The world is not necessarily a logical progression, and the way your mind 
works is not linear. The dream world is not linear. The real world is not 
linear." 
</P>
<P>
Her poetry is not strictly autobiographical, she adds. "Of course there's 
always autobiographical elements, but I elaborate, I make things up, I expand 
the truth." She also incorporates details from her dreams, which she feels are 
not just night-time imaginings. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a dream life in which there are certainly more possibilities" than in 
waking life, Harjo says. "Creation in it is much swifter. It's much more 
elastic. And I can see better in this world. You can call it dream world, but I 
don't mean it's a world that's just dreaming, like you go to sleep and there it 
is. It's also a world that's simultaneous to this world." 
</P>
<P>
She believes in poetry's transformative power, Harjo says. "I want my work to 
be regenerative. I want it in some way to be a praising, and I want it to give 
back. One of the principles of the universe is that if something is not 
regenerative, if it does not give back life, then it dies. So if you look at 
what's going on with human beings, I really wonder what will happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Human beings are a very young species and probably won't last that long, 
either. I think we're near the end of it. Because in order to be a viable 
species you have to be giving something back to the ecosystem. And we're not 
doing that." With her own work, Harjo wonders, "Am I going to leave something, 
not necessarily important, but something? Or am I going to add to the 
confusion? I don't want to add to the confusion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reluctant to Talk 
</P>
<P>
Discussing such things -- like talking about elements of her past -- isn't 
easy, Harjo says, because Indians believe "you just don't tell people 
everything. It's like, too, with the Indian people, with their history, there 
are things that probably you don't want said, because you don't want to call 
them (the events) back. You don't want them to appear again. And then of course 
there's also things you aren't supposed to reveal, there's certain tribal 
secrets, they're not written down, they're meant to be kept within the people." 
</P>
<P>
Yet when she writes, Harjo says, she draws on her own "secret" places: "There's 
a sort of ecstatic sadness. It's not always sadness, but there's a point of 
letting go at which I know I can do what I want, and it feels good, and I'm 
playing, I'm touching language, and I'm touching places I haven't touched 
before. It doesn't work if I know where I'm going and how I'm going to get 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a poem has to have a huge amount of risk, and it has to have some 
danger, because there's danger in the universe." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

SONG FOR THE DEER AND MYSELF TO RETURN ON 
</P>
<P>
BY JOY HARJO 
</P>
<P>
This morning when I looked out the roof window 
</P>
<P>
before dawn and a few stars were still caught 
</P>
<P>
in the fragile weft of ebony night 
</P>
<P>
I was overwhelmed. I sang the song Louis taught me: 
</P>
<P>
a song to call the deer in Creek, as in hunting 
</P>
<P>
and I am certainly hunting something as velvet as deer 
</P>
<P>
in this city far from the hammock of my mother's belly. 
</P>
<P>
It works, of course, and deer came into this room 
</P>
<P>
and wondered at finding themselves 
</P>
<P>
in a house near downtown Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Now the deer and I are trying to figure out a song 
</P>
<P>
to get them back, to get all of us back 
</P>
<P>
because if it works I'm going with them. 
</P>
<P>
And it's too early to call Louis 
</P>
<P>
And nearly too late to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 (for Louis Oliver)

WHAT'S DRIVING 'RAIN MAN'? WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Look around at the audiences pouring into theaters to see "Rain Man," 
Hollywood's hottest film: If MGM/UA's research results are on target, most of 
them will be women and a lot of those women will be over 25. 
</P>
<P>
For years, a Hollywood rule of thumb has held that blockbuster movies need to 
draw most of their audience from the young male crowd -- teens who bring along 
dates or groups of friends, and consider repeat viewings as a kind of pubescent 
badge of honor. The success of such hits as "Jaws," "Star Wars" and "Raiders of 
the Lost Ark" can be traced directly to men under 25, said Ed Mintz, president 
of the research firm CinemaScore. "Younger males generate the biggest films." 
</P>
<P>
But with the rapid success of "Rain Man," as well as female favorites like 
Disney/Touchstone's "Three Men and a Baby," Hollywood studios in the late 1980s 
are rediscovering the potential of female moviegoers. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority (of 'Rain Man's' audience) were and continue to be female," said 
Greg Morrison, MGM/UA's outgoing marketing president. "The film is being driven 
by this solid core; there's no question about it. Obviously, Tom Cruise 
accounts for a lot of it." 
</P>
<P>
"Rain Man" opened to packed houses during the Christmas holidays -- typically a 
better time for action and comedy films aimed at young men -- and quickly 
steam-rolled past its competition. The film will pass the $100- million mark 
this weekend, and Mintz predicts it will gross at least $150 million at U.S. 
theaters alone. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, while MGM/UA officials knew that Cruise and co-star Dustin Hoffman 
would appeal to women, they would have preferred "Rain Man" to draw more men. 
</P>
<P>
"As you open a movie, you would like very much to have the interest reversed, 
with 60% men and 40% women, because that's the standard," Morrison said. "You 
won't find a lot of mega-hits that are female-driven." 
</P>
<P>
But "Rain Man" is fast becoming just that. Three separate MGM/UA research 
studies found that the film's average audience was 55% female and 45% male, 
Morrison said. Two-thirds of the audience were over 25, another departure for a 
hit movie. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA, like all Hollywood studios, tracks audiences to gauge the effectiveness 
of its marketing campaigns. In the case of "Rain Man," the studio's research 
included exit polls in eight cities on opening night, said Morrison, with 
follow-up surveys the weeks after it opened. 
</P>
<P>
What surprised Morrison was "Rain Man's" fast start. Historically, he said, 
older women are not as effective as young men in generating word of mouth for a 
film. "Rain Man's" success, he said, suggests that this is changing. 
</P>
<P>
"Rain Man" is not the first -- nor is it likely to be the last -- hit generated 
by women in the late 1980s. Mintz surveyed the initial audiences who attended 
"Three Men and a Baby" when it opened in late 1987 and found that 61% were 
female. When asked to grade the movie according to how much she liked it, the 
average woman gave the film an A, while men gave it only a B-plus. No matter: 
"Three Men and a Baby" went on to gross more than $167 million at theaters in 
this country alone. 
</P>
<P>
Disney/Touchstone struck gold with the female audience again last summer by 
putting Tom Cruise in "Cocktail." According to CinemaScore, females accounted 
for a huge 69% of "Cocktail's" audience share when it opened, and they scored 
it higher than did men. With box-office receipts above $77 million, "Cocktail" 
was one of last year's top earners. 
</P>
<P>
The box-office performance of these films isn't at the levels of such 
male-driven hits as "E.T." ($327 million in its first release); "Star Wars" 
($287 million in the first release), or its sequel, "Return of the Jedi," ($252 
million). But they are among the highest earners in the market today. 
</P>
<P>
Other hit films popular with women include "Working Girl," (in which 54% of its 
initial audience were female, according to CinemaScore); "Big" (56% female), 
and " 'Crocodile' Dundee II" (54% female). Paramount expects the initial 
audiences on "Cousins," (See review on Page 1) a romantic comedy opening this 
weekend, to be largely female, though the studio hopes that will even out over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that women and young girls love the movies," said Sidney 
Ganis, president of Paramount's motion picture group. But, he cautioned: "Make 
no mistake about it, there are still real strong male moviegoing demographics." 
</P>
<P>
Independent producer Jere Henshaw of Apollo Pictures, said he noticed the 
potential of female audiences during his regular rounds to neighborhood 
theaters a few years ago, when he began to notice groups of teen-age girls and 
young women waiting in line for movies at shopping malls. The movement of 
theaters from urban centers -- which became increasingly crime-ridden in the 
1960s and 1970s -- to shopping malls "has made young girls and older women feel 
as if they can safely go to the movies without a date or husband," Henshaw 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The rise of shopping-mall theaters enables Hollywood to recapture a segment of 
the female audience that was lost when mothers stopped taking their children to 
afternoon matinees in the 1960s -- a result of rising divorce rates, women 
entering the work force and an increase in crime, said Henshaw, a 30-year 
veteran in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Henshaw said, most of the stores surrounding theaters in shopping 
malls are oriented toward women. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk down any shopping mall in America," Henshaw said, "and they're all 
designed to get women to spend money." 
</P>
<P>
With that audience in mind, Henshaw produced a low-budget feature in 1987, a 
teen love story called "Can't Buy Me Love," and convinced Disney to distribute 
it. The film went on to become a moderate hit at the box office, grossing 
nearly $32 million -- recouping many times the film's production costs.

MINISTER, LEADING FILM MAKERS TO PRODUCE MAINSTREAM MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT H. BROESKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angered by what he sees as the lack of "uplifting and inspirational" Hollywood 
movies, a nationally known television and radio minister says he is going to 
lead his flock into the film business. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. D. James Kennedy, whose Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church is based in Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., cited Martin Scorsese's "The Last Temptation of Christ" as 
the catalyst in his decision to use his ministry to make the kinds of movies 
Hollywood won't. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of sex and blasphemy and immorality, of sadism and influencing 
people for ill," Kennedy said. "We believe there are people who would like to 
watch something other than drugs and sex. Now, I know that there are various 
kinds of reality in this country, including the reality of the toilet . . . 
Well, how about the realities of morality and courage and devotion?" 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said his ministry's aim "is not to make religious movies, but 
mainstream films" along the lines of "Chariots of Fire," and to involve leading 
Hollywood film makers who share their concerns. He said Howard Kazanjian, who 
produced "Return of the Jedi," will produce the ministry's first movie. No 
project has been selected yet, he said, but a tentative budget has been set for 
$13 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he hopes to begin raising approximately $225,000 in "seed money" 
for script development by appealing to his weekly TV audience. The first 
appeal, which will follow the formal announcement of the film-making plans, 
will be delivered in a broadcast in early March. The one-hour show is seen on 
about 200 stations in the United States. It airs in the L.A. market at 5 a.m. 
Sundays on CBN, and again at 8 a.m. on KTBN Channel 40. 
</P>
<P>
In a transcript of the already-taped broadcast, Kennedy describes Clark Gable's 
closing line in "Gone With the Wind" ("Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.") 
as the "crack in the dike." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything began to flow gradually from that," he said, "until we've come to 
the day when nothing is held back." 
</P>
<P>
To help stem the tide and return movies to higher moral ground, Coral Ridge 
Ministries, the church's television/radio broadcast arm, is forming a 
for-profit corporation. Dan Scalf, executive producer of organization, said 
Coral Ridge will own a majority, if not all, of the stock in the company, and 
that most of the money will come from private investors. 
</P>
<P>
"And at this point, it does not appear that (raising) the $13 million is going 
to be a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his televised appeal, Kennedy will tell potential donors that money 
sent in for the development costs are tax-deductible. Those who send in $50 or 
more will receive a videocassette of "Ben Hur." 
</P>
<P>
With the money raised by the ministry, non-profit Coral Ridge will purchase 
stock in the new for-profit corporation, which in turn will use $225,000 for 
the development of the script, Scalf said. 
</P>
<P>
Scalf said the ministry is going into the film business with the same objective 
as established production companies: to make money. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Penland, a born-again Christian who left his marketing consultant post with 
Universal Pictures last year to join the protest against the studio's "The Last 
Temptation of Christ," has been instrumental in teaming Coral Ridge with 
members of the film-making community. 
</P>
<P>
Among the film makers who have agreed to become involved, according to Penland: 
production manager Wally Worsley (whose credits span decades and include 
"E.T."); two-time Oscar-winning composer Al Kasha ("The Morning After" and "We 
May Never Love Like This Again"); assistant director Daniel P. Kolsrud ("Bird," 
"Top Gun"), and production supervisor Fran Roy ("The Blues Brothers"). 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's put their credibility on the line," said Penland, adding that he 
will act "in an executive producer-type capacity" on the church's first film 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Penland said he will help oversee the selection of the property, watch over the 
production and supervise the marketing of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to go through a major-studio distributor," Penland said. 
"That's one of the reasons we aren't going to make a preachy film. We want to 
make a movie that will appeal to the widest audience possible -- which means it 
will have entertainment value. But it will also have integrity, and it will 
underline certain important qualities. The idea is that this will be the first 
of many films from Coral Ridge." 
</P>
<P>
Kazanjian, whose current film projects include an adaptation of the popular 
Japanese comic strip "Lone Wolf and Cub," said he is giving the Coral Ridge 
movie the highest priority. 
</P>
<P>
"I happen to be a Christian. I also happen to want to make morally positive 
films," he said. "I have three young children. I don't want them to see 
gratuitous violence. I don't want them to see chain-saw films. Or movies with 
heavy sex or drugs. I don't want them coming home using some of the language 
that's used in today's movies. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't want them seeing movies that will warp their minds about 
Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
Kazanjian said he never saw "The Last Temptation of Christ," but doesn't think 
it should have been made: "I think it's wrong for any company to make a film 
that brings down anyone's deity." 
</P>
<P>
Kazanjian said it won't be as hard as people think to find spiritually 
uplifting scripts and added that by cleaning up the language and cutting one 
unnecessary bedroom scene, he believes the current hit "Rain Man" would fit the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Coral Ridge settles on for its first movie, Kennedy said it will not 
be a filmed sermon. 
</P>
<P>
"Our desire is not to curse the darkness but to light a candle -- maybe a 
string of candles," he said. "The title that keeps coming up is 'Chariots of 
Fire.' That's the kind of uplifting movie we'd like to make." 
</P>
<P>
But, if there were more of those projects around like "Chariots of Fire," 
wouldn't Hollywood be making them? 
</P>
<P>
"In that area," Kennedy said, "I think it's safe to say that maybe we know 
something they don't."

Edie Brickell's album, "Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars," continues to 
surprise. It's up to No. 4 on the Billboard magazine pop chart. When it came 
out, this album was a good bet not to make the Top 100 or sell 100,000 or even 
get any airplay -- too quirky and not mainstream enough, industry observers 
insisted. Recently it passed the million-units sold mark. Debbie Gibson's 
"Electric Youth" album charged up to No. 11 in just two weeks. Fast-rising 
albums: Rick Astley's "Hold Me in Your Arms" (No. 19) and New Order's 
"Technique" (No. 41). "The Trinity Session," by the critical favorites Cowboy 
Junkies, jumped 12 notches to No. 58. Paula Abdul's "Straight Up " is still the 
No. 1 pop single. 
</P>
<P>
* The late Roy Orbison's last album is off to an impressive start, debuting on 
the pop album chart at No. 55.

ISBIN HARMONIZES WITH A HIGHER VISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who's heard Sharon Isbin play classical guitar cannot help but note the 
water-smooth clarity and penetrating intelligence she brings to her music. 
</P>
<P>
Isbin, who plays tonight at Occidental College, is never dry in the name of 
rectitude, never coasts through one part of a piece in order to speed on to a 
brilliant highlight. Which isn't to say that she doesn't have fun up there. In 
fact, the past couple of appearances she's made in Southern California have 
been with Laurindo Almeida and Larry Coryell. That isn't the company kept by 
anyone who enshrines the classical guitar as an icon of votive authority. 
</P>
<P>
"I put on a Carnegie Hall festival in 1985 called 'Guitarstream,' which 
involved all different forms of music from classical to jazz, folk, Middle 
Eastern and flamenco," Isbin said on the telephone from New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It was extraordinary to see how the guitar has figured in so many cultures and 
in so many periods . . . It's amazing how many ways the guitar has been 
meaningful to people." 
</P>
<P>
This combination of openness and discipline has drawn a variety of musicians to 
her side. One of the few female guitarists on the concert tour, she's worked 
with Antonio Carlos Jobim. The exacting Leo Brouwer sent her, unsolicited, the 
Ballades for tonight's program. Joseph Schwantner wrote his "fantasy for 
guitar," "From Afar . . .," which she premiered with the St. Louis Symphony. 
Lukas Foss is writing a concerto which she will introduce at Avery Fisher Hall 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Still, classical performance has been Isbin's distinction since she won the 
Toronto International Festival in 1975, and it's in the classical mode that she 
will play here, in works by Bach, Brouwer, the Brazilian Isais Savio, Rodrigo, 
Britten and Augustin Barrios. 
</P>
<P>
One member of the local guitar cognoscenti, James Smith, director of the 
classical guitar program at USC, remembers Isbin from Toronto: "She beat out an 
impressive roster of players who have gone on to important careers, such as 
Eliot Fisk, Manuel Barrueco and David Leisner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember her playing as elegant, polished, poised and refined. I don't know 
what happened to her after that. For a while you didn't hear about her. But I 
think her association with the harpsichordist Rosalyn Tureck helped her a great 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
Isbin wasn't a natural. "I was very directed as a child," she said. "If it 
hadn't been for music, I'm sure I'd be a brain surgeon or a research scientist 
today. I was a serious kid. Music loosened me up." 
</P>
<P>
Isbin's father was a Minneapolis chemical engineering professor who was hired 
for consulting work in Italy, and took his family in tow. 
</P>
<P>
She started on guitar as a 9-year-old. Five years later, back in Minnesota, she 
was dutiful but unconvinced. After all, what were bar and arpeggio exercises 
compared to "launching rockets 300 miles an hour behind the school yard? We 
sent up a lot of grasshoppers and worms in nose cones. My father was my 
greatest problem when he'd say, 'You can't launch your rockets until you 
practice an hour.' " 
</P>
<P>
An appearance with the Minnesota Orchestra at 14 changed that: She began to 
discover the seriousness and importance of the guitar. She spent summers 
studying with Oscar Ghiglia in Aspen. At 18, she won Toronto. At 19, she won 
the Munich competition and began the career that took her through Europe, the 
Middle East, Japan and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
What happened in the meantime is that she went to Yale to complete her studies 
in music and languages -- she stayed long enough to get her master's degree -- 
and joined the faculty at the Manhattan School of Music. But she also hit a 
snag. 
</P>
<P>
Isbin had done well in the austere environment of competitions and was making 
her way as a musician. 
</P>
<P>
But an old familiar, Bach -- who seems so accessible to the ordinary listener 
-- wasn't yielding the sweets of revelation that keep a composition alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I was frustrated by what I'd heard of Bach on guitar," Isbin said. "The whole 
issue of Baroque embellishment and trills, the true technique, eluded and 
frustrated me. The original concept of the music was unclear to me." 
</P>
<P>
Then Isbin met and began working with Tureck, "one of Bach's greatest 
exponents, who has an extraordinary knowledge. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
All that may seem esoteric in the overall scheme of things, but it was a key 
toward opening up Isbin's expansive musical personality. 
</P>
<P>
She has been given an unprecedented teaching post -- head of the first guitar 
program at Juilliard. When she's away from music, she likes to ride horseback, 
hike, or ski, anything to remind herself "there's another world out there," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"TV and movies are replete with the grim reality of our culture. They offer so 
little hope, or the possibility for transcendence. I believe there is such a 
thing as artistic responsibility. I want to achieve as much depth as possible, 
to communicate as much as possible."

Angola accused South Africa of sending troops back into southern Angola in 
violation of peace accords signed last December. South Africa immediately 
denied the allegation. An Angolan communique, signed by Defense Minister Pedro 
Maria Tonha, said the South African forces shelled Angolan army units south of 
Caiundo in Cuando Cubango province. It gave no details of any casualties.

Israeli soldiers rounded up about 175 Palestinians in the West Bank and forced 
them to sit blindfolded and bound for up to 16 hours in a soccer stadium, Arab 
and Israeli witnesses said. Many were in their pajamas after being seized 
overnight in Hebron, apparently on suspicion of planning an action against 
Israeli authorities, Israeli sources said. Dozens of the Arabs were later moved 
to detention centers while the rest were sent home, the witnesses said. At the 
United Nations, a spokeswoman said the Security Council, acting on a request by 
Tunisia, will meet today on the continuing violence in the occupied 
territories.

Despite a last-minute offer by Marxist guerrillas to talk directly with the 
government, El Salvador's army chief of staff as well as President Jose 
Napoleon Duarte indicated that there is almost no chance that they would accept 
a rebel peace plan to end nine years of civil war. The Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front said it will send a high-ranking delegation to San Salvador to 
discuss the plan. But Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, the nation's most powerful 
military officer, said the plan is "aimed at creating chaos." Duarte also was 
not optimistic, pointing out again that a key part of the plan, a postponement 
of elections now set for March 19, is unconstitutional.

A fire broke out during taping at a television studio in southern India, 
killing at least 36 people and injuring 55, including one of India's best-known 
actors. The fire destroyed the six-story Premier Studios building in Mysore, 
about 75 miles southwest of Bangalore. Among the injured was Sanjay Khan, a 
well-known actor and director, who was burned over 60% of his body, the United 
News of India news agency said. Many of the film workers were burned to death 
when they were unable to open a door that had been locked to keep out 
spectators, police and hospital officials said.

CIA Director William H. Webster said West European companies have knowingly 
played a key role in developing chemical weapons not only in Libya but also in 
Iran, Iraq and Syria. Webster also told the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee that foreign firms are helping Third World nations develop ballistic 
missiles to deliver chemical and biological weapons. He did not identify any of 
the firms. However, The Times reported earlier that U.S. officials have 
concluded that Messerschmidt-Boelkow-Blohm, a West German firm, and SNIA-BPD, a 
subsidiary of the Italian industrial giant Fiat, played a key role in an 
Argentine-Egyptian project to develop a medium-range ballistic missile. A 
spokesman for SNIA-BPD denied any transfer of missile technology to Egypt, 
Libya or Iraq and said its Argentine program ended in 1985.

BOY USES DRUG CASH FOR SPREE

A 14-year-old Berkeley boy took $120,000 in drug money and treated himself and 
friends to a three-day spending spree that ended with a trip to Hawaii, 
authorities said. The three teen-agers' life of leisure ended when Kauai 
police, alerted to their flight, picked them up on a beach Jan. 10 and 
recovered $111,000, police and school officials said. According to Oakland 
Municipal Court records, one of the boys said he found the money and two bags 
of what he said was cocaine in a false-bottom drawer at a relative's home. The 
14-year-old left the drugs but took the money, he told police. The teen-ager 
and some schoolmates rented a limousine to go to San Francisco, where they 
persuaded the driver to rent a room at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, the Oakland 
Tribune reported. After their San Francisco fling, some of the students 
returned home, and several recounted their adventure to school officials.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson flatly denied any interest in running for mayor of 
Washington and said he would never move to unseat Mayor Marion Barry. "I've 
expressed no interest in the job," Jackson said after leading an anti-drug 
rally at a city high school. "Under no condition would I run against Marion 
Barry." Asked later if he would run if Barry decided not to seek reelection in 
1990, Jackson responded: "I have expressed no desire to be mayor."

Supplies are so short in Veterans Administration hospitals that nurses are 
scrounging the little souvenir bars of soap and shampoo bottles from hotels to 
bring to VA patients, a nurse told Congress. Supply accounts are frequently 
raided to pay salaries and avoid layoffs, an outside medical administrator told 
the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Claudette Morissey, a nurse at the 
Brooklyn, N.Y., veterans hospital and president of the Nurses Organization of 
the Veterans Administration, said in testimony submitted to the hearing: "At 
one VA hospital in the South, nurses were frustrated by the refusal of (the) 
prosthetics (department) to supply wheel chair cushions for patients on the 
long-term care unit. The nurses obtained a $25 donation, went to the local 
upholstery store and purchased a large foam mattress, and with an electric 
knife borrowed from the mother of one of the nurses, cut the foam to make wheel 
chair cushions for their patients." She did not identify the hospital.

POLICE ARREST 23 IN ANTI-GANG SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A police anti-gang task force of two dozen officers arrested 23 people in a 
sweep of the Venice area, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the suspects arrested during the seven-hour operation that ended 
early Thursday were gang members, Sgt. Robert Tumas said. 
</P>
<P>
The sweep was conducted despite a storm that drenched the region. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, the rain keeps people inside. (But) when you're talking narcotics 
and gangs, weather doesn't keep them in," Tumas said. 
</P>
<P>
The operation involved officers with the department's Pacific Division and 
anti-gang investigators. The 23 suspects were arrested on a variety of charges 
including possession of narcotics and outstanding warrants. Officers also 
confiscated a double-edged dagger from a gang member, Tumas said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, police ran two similar task-force operations in Venice and 
have arrested a total of about 60 people in the area since Jan. 1, Tumas said. 
</P>
<P>
The operations are much smaller than the highly-publicized sweeps in South 
Central Los Angeles involving as many as 1,000 officers. But the goal is the 
same -- "To keep the gang element off balance," Tumas said. 
</P>
<P>
Gang-related violence in Los Angeles County claimed a record 452 lives in 1988, 
surpassing the previous record 387 killed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Daryl Gates named 1988 "The Year of Gang Enforcement" and sent 
hundreds of officers on weekend sweeps through gang-infested areas of the city. 
In a series of sweeps from February 1988 through last November, police arrested 
more than 24,000 people, including about 13,500 gang members.

FBI agents carried their investigation of the Orange County Republican Party's 
use of uniformed security guards at polling places to the state capital this 
week, interviewing at least one person who worked on Assemblyman Curt Pringle's 
1988 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) confirmed that two FBI agents interviewed one 
of his aides, Dave Gilliard, on Wednesday. Royce said he was not interviewed by 
the agents and did not participate in their discussions with Gilliard, who 
worked for several weeks last fall as a press aide in the Pringle campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Republican Party spent $4,000 to hire 20 security guards to 
monitor the polls on Election Day last November in 20 heavily Latino Santa Ana 
precincts in the 72nd Assembly District. The guards were hired, Republican 
officials have said, because of rumors that non-citizens -- who may not legally 
vote -- might be bused into the district to cast ballots for Pringle's 
Democratic opponent, Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Guards Were Removed 
</P>
<P>
Party officials have said that the guards were instructed not to stop anyone 
from voting and that they were removed by midday at the request of county 
Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, of Garden Grove, said he also was aware that the agents were in the 
capital. He said Carlos Rodriguez, the Sacramento-based political consultant 
who directed Pringle's campaign, had told him he expected to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle added, however, that he had not confirmed that such an interview had 
taken place as of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County GOP Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes has said it was Rodriguez who 
requested that Republican Party funds be used to hire the guards. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gilliard nor Rodriguez could be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Neilson, an FBI spokesman in Los Angeles, would say only that the incident 
of the security guards is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosures are the first public confirmation that the FBI is actively 
pursuing the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A separate, civil lawsuit aimed at overturning the result in the 72nd District 
election has been filed in federal court in Santa Ana. On Monday, U.S. District 
Judge J. Spencer Letts refused to dismiss that lawsuit, saying its allegations, 
if true, are "an outrage." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, who defeated Thierbach in the Nov. 8 election by fewer than 900 votes, 
said no FBI agent has approached him or his staff about the incident. But he 
said he would gladly speak to federal authorities if asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind this investigation," Pringle said. "Let them do it fast. If they 
want to talk to me, fine. I want to get this over and concentrate fully on 
doing the job I was elected to do." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said he believed that the agents were doing no more than conducting a 
routine review based on complaints filed by Latino groups. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my understanding that whenever there is a complaint filed, the FBI 
follows through on it," Pringle said. "I'm sure they're just covering all the 
bases." 
</P>
<P>
Royce said the agents apparently interviewed several people involved in the 
Pringle campaign. But the only interview he could confirm was the one with 
Gilliard. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has contacted me," he said. "I know the reason they talked with Dave 
Gilliard was that he was involved for several weeks in the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
But Royce added that Gilliard was not involved in the decision to hire the 
security guards and was "back here" working in the capital by Election Day.

DREAM OF ACCIDENT TURNS REAL; CHILD HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who said he had a dream about running over a child with his car a few 
nights ago hit an 8-year-old boy who was crossing a street Thursday, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, identified as Mauricio Romo Cervantes of Anaheim, suffered a broken 
leg and moderate scrapes when he was hit by a car driven by Peter Mark Feist, 
23, also of Anaheim, according to CHP officer Leslie Ann Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred shortly after 8 a.m. on Gilbert Street in unincorporated 
territory between Garden Grove and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Feist told officers that in his dream, he hit a child on the way to work, and 
he had been so frightened by the image that he changed routes, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
As he was approaching the crosswalk on Gilbert Street near Pacific Place, he 
told officers, he looked down at his speedometer. It was only when he looked up 
that he saw Romo as he was crossing the street with a crossing guard, who was 
holding up his hand to stop traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Feist was not cited or held pending further investigation, Hill said.

$100,000 IN TOYS, GIFTS ARRIVE FOR NEEDY YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A truck filled with about $100,000 worth of toys and gifts to be distributed to 
needy children in the county pulled into the Anaheim Plaza on Thursday 
afternoon, courtesy of a prison inmate and a toy company. 
</P>
<P>
The delivery of gifts, which will be distributed by local social service 
agencies, was arranged by Rick Rowe, who is serving a life sentence in a New 
Jersey state prison for kidnaping. New Jersey-based Russ Berrie Co. Inc. 
donated the toys. 
</P>
<P>
The Thursday delivery from the company's Anaheim division was one of two 
scheduled shipments, said Steve Swaim, manager of community services for the 
city of Anaheim. A truck with a second shipment from the San Francisco Bay Area 
had a flat tire and was delayed. It probably will arrive Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two shipments are worth more than $200,000, said Robert Kundee, a general 
manager of Russ Berrie. Transportation was arranged by the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
The toy shipment is the second such donation to local Anaheim agencies by Rowe 
and Russ Berrie. The last one was at Christmastime. 
</P>
<P>
The toys will go to Salvation Army offices in Orange County, the Indian Center 
of Orange County and the Orangewood Children's Home. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe has been in prison for 15 years and will be eligible for parole for the 
first time later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe, who is the founder of the Juvenile Awareness Program, the controversial 
prison encounter sessions featured in the award-winning film "Scared Straight," 
denied Thursday that parole is a motivation for his project. 
</P>
<P>
"I had 24 hours of nothing to do," he said. "It helped me keep my sanity."

MAN'S RETURN FOILS ROBBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN and STEVE EMMONS, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An armed robbery attempt was foiled Thursday night when a Santa Ana Heights man 
arrived at his house to find his parents bound and gagged, Orange County 
sheriff's deputies and neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
The young man, identified as Steve Balogh, was taken to College Hospital Costa 
Mesa with minor head injuries received in his encounter with the two robbers, 
according to Cal Farmer, who lives across the street from the Balogh home on 
Kline Drive near Pegasus Street. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer said the younger Balogh and the parents, Steve and Rosa Balogh, told him 
the intruders entered the house and tied up the couple in a room upstairs. When 
the son arrived shortly after 9 p.m., unaware that his parents were upstairs, 
the intruders apparently attacked him, Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in my study and heard some cries in the street -- 'Help me! Help me!' " 
Farmer said. He then stepped out onto his porch and saw the younger Balogh in 
the street, his head severely beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer and his wife called the Sheriff's Department, and arriving deputies 
scoured the area for the two assailants, using police to try to sniff them out. 
The search was called off after about an hour when no suspects were found, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Balogh, described as being in his 20s, told Farmer that the two 
robbers were tall, wore ski masks and were armed. Balogh jumped out of a window 
to get away from them, he told Farmer. 
</P>
<P>
When the two fled, apparently without taking anything, the elder Balogh, a 
tailor, and his wife went to the Farmer home, their hands still tied, according 
to officers at the scene.

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO MAY SET UP SHUTTLE SERVICE TO AMTRAK DEPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to alleviate the congestion in downtown San Juan Capistrano's 
Amtrak commuter parking lot, city development officials are considering setting 
up a shuttle service to the depot. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, more than 100 passengers have said they would be interested in 
the morning and evening park-and-ride service planned for the Capistrano Depot 
by city and Orange County Transit District officials, said Brian Fisk, 
community development assistant. Fisk said sign-up sheets have been posted at 
the depot for interested commuters to choose one of the three designated pickup 
stops. 
</P>
<P>
Dial-a-Ride has been working with the city to design routes for three vans that 
could shuttle up to 51 passengers -- 17 in each van -- from satellite parking 
areas in San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, Dana Point, Monarch Beach and 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
At least eight passengers per van are necessary for the service to be 
self-sufficient, Fisk said. Each commuter would pay $1.60 for the round-trip 
service from each parking area to the Verdugo Street depot. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle vans would deliver passengers to the 6:41 a.m. northbound train to 
Los Angeles and return them to the parking areas after the arrival of the 6 and 
7 p.m. trains. John Snodgrass, operations manager for Mark IV Charter Lines 
Dial-a-Ride division, said at least 150 southern Orange County commuters travel 
north on the trains daily. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed morning routes for the three van shuttles are: 
</P>
<P>
A 6:18 a.m. stop at the northern Marguerite Parkway entrance to Mission Viejo 
Mall, a 6:25 a.m. stop at the park-and-ride lot on Junipero Serra Road at 
Interstate 5 in San Juan Capistrano and a 6:30 a.m. depot arrival. 
</P>
<P>
A 6:15 a.m. stop at Monarch Bay Plaza in Monarch Beach, a 6:23 a.m. stop at 
Violet Lantern Street and Coast Highway in Dana Point, and a 6:30 a.m. depot 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
A 6:20 a.m. stop at Grant's Plaza in San Clemente and a 6:30 a.m. stop at the 
depot. 
</P>
<P>
Fiske said the service is expected to start this spring, as soon as enough 
passengers commit themselves to the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
The city also plans to lease 100 commuter parking spaces in a multilevel 
parking lot under construction at the Franciscan Plaza, across from the 
station. Commuters will have to pay for the spots. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk said the parking complex -- which is scheduled to be completed this summer 
-- and the shuttle vans should alleviate the parking problems.

CHANG UPSETS CONNORS IN TIEBREAKER AT CHICAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

CHICAGO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixteen-year-old Michael Chang of Placentia outslugged second-seeded Jimmy 
Connors from the baseline and capitalized on numerous unforced errors Thursday 
to win their second-round match, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2), at the $350,000 Volvo Chicago 
tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
After losing his serve in the 11th game of the second set to go down 5-6, Chang 
broke back to force the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Connors took the first two points, but Chang reeled off the next seven, ending 
the 2-hour 3-minute match on a call that even Chang thought was bad. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball I hit I felt was long when it left my racket," Chang said. "But it 
was called good. Sometimes in the heat of a match, people get nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Ranked 29th in the world and fresh from two Davis Cup victories against 
Paraguay, Chang pulled off his biggest upset, beating the world's 
seventh-ranked player. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, top-seeded Ivan Lendl, No. 4 Tim Mayotte and No. 7 Kevin Curren posted 
straight-set victories. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl defeated Johan Kriek, 6-4, 6-3; Mayotte downed Roger Smith of the 
Bahamas, 6-3, 7-5, and Curren eliminated Nicolas Periera of Venezuela, 6-4, 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Making his debut, third-seeded John McEnroe defeated Dan Goldie 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
Chang ran Connors all over the University of Illinois Circle Pavilion Supreme 
Court surface. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Connors asked Chang, "Are you 16 or 17?" Another time, Connors 
yelled, "Remember, I'm an old man. I'm 36." 
</P>
<P>
With both players playing from the baseline, Connors took the first two games, 
breaking Chang's service in the second. But the teen-ager broke Connors in the 
third and fifth games to take a 3-2 edge. 
</P>
<P>
After Chang increased his lead to 5-3, he broke Connors again in the ninth game 
as the veteran hit three balls into the net. 
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Connors scored the first service break in the seventh game 
to grab a 4-3 edge. After Connors held serve in the eighth game, Chang won the 
next two games, squaring the set at 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
They then traded service breaks to force the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said beating Connors "is an honor. He'll be in the Hall of Fame someday. 
He played great and he made me work hard." 
</P>
<P>
In the tiebreaker, Chang said, "I think after going up 2-0, he felt he could 
gamble on my second serve and play some returns short. After all, he wasn't 
serving."

THE RESURGENCE; 
</P>
<P>
PACIFICA BOYS' BASKETBALL TEAM HOPES LOSING IS ALL IN THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every time he sits at his desk at Pacifica High School, basketball Coach Rhett 
Heckel stares into the face of incentive. 
</P>
<P>
It looks something like this: a wrinkled piece of notebook paper, marked with 
the results of Pacifica's games during the 1987-88 season. Below that, in bold 
ink, are the team's final overall and Garden Grove League records: 7-14, 5-9. 
</P>
<P>
For many coaches, memories like these would be put in the wastebasket, not on 
the wall. But Heckel, in his third year as Mariner head coach after four years 
of coaching the junior varsity, is passionate about remembering the past, no 
matter how dreary. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 13 years since Pacifica finished a boys' basketball season with a 
winning record. And it has been 18 years since a Mariner team gained entrance 
to the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
As Heckel notes matter-of-factly, "No, there hasn't been a whole lotta success 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Until lately. Pacifica is 14-7 and 9-4. For Heckel and his players, improving 
upon Pacifica's rather lackluster basketball history is incentive enough. But 
the real inspiration is trying for a spot in the Southern Section playoffs, and 
once there, winning a game -- something no Pacifica team has done. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 6, the Mariners finish their Garden Grove League schedule against 
league-leader La Quinta, featuring Scott Campbell, Orange County's scoring 
leader who is averaging 30 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners need to win tonight to be guaranteed a spot in the Southern 
Section 3-A playoffs. If it loses, Pacifica, with an overall record above .500, 
would be considered for an at-large entry, determined by a Southern Section 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
There are several factors that have led to the Mariners' success this season. 
First, the players: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dustin Bonham, a senior guard, is the team's scoring leader, averaging 18.9 
points a game. Bonham, who was hampered by a severly sprained ankle last 
season, also averages six rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill Mauer, a senior point guard, provides the spark for the Mariners' 
fast-break offense. When the team's not running, Mauer's not smiling. "We 
didn't utilize Billy's talents last year; we didn't have the athletes who could 
handle his passes," Heckel said. "We try to run at every opportunity. (Mauer) 
gets really upset when things slow down." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jason Brodowski, a senior forward, is a talented all-around player, 
supporting Bonham with eight points and seven rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Randy Schulze, a junior forward, is the team's best shooter (62%). A quiet, 
introspective type, Schulze plays piano and writes music when he's off the 
court. On the court, he has been the team's best player during the league 
season, improving each game and averaging 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy's going to be great, he's an outstanding athlete," Heckel said. "His 
only weakness is that he's not as aggressive or intense as he should be 
sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Maher, a junior center, is the complete opposite of Schulze in the 
aggression department. At 6-feet-5 and 230, Maher is big, strong and, according 
to Heckel, the most aggressive player he has ever coached. 
</P>
<P>
As a team, the Mariners have been successful because of strong rebounding -- 
which fuels their fast break -- plus good defense and conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
During the preseason, the players ran as much as eight miles twice a week, did 
sprints of 220 and 440 yards and maintained a heavy-duty weight-lifting program 
in Pacifica's new basketball weight room. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from the improved skills and conditioning, a key difference in 
Pacifica this season has been the development of pride and enthusiasm, both in 
the players and in the student body. 
</P>
<P>
"The students have been fantastic," Heckel said. "The gym's been packed. Some 
crowds have gotten to the point where we can't get more cars in the parking 
lot. Some kids paint their faces black and blue. It's great." 
</P>
<P>
The new enthusiasm is a welcome sight for Heckel, as well as a few former 
Pacifica basketball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pacifica teacher Dave Reid, who in 1976 led the Mariners to their most 
recent winning season (13-11): "I'm very pleased to see it happen. I hear 
student conversations about the team all the time, and there's lots of positive 
announcements over the PA system. The future looks very bright." 
</P>
<P>
But even with a promising future, Heckel wants to make sure no one forgets the 
past. Establishing a Mariner basketball tradition has been an important 
priority with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be when you walked around this school, you knew absolutely nothing 
about Pacifica basketball -- other than it had been horrendous," Heckel said. 
</P>
<P>
And so, after weeks of research through school archives and newspaper 
microfiches, Heckel created the Mariner Pride basketball record board, complete 
with career, season and single-game records since the school opened in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt, even if a program's not successful, you need to know where the 
program's been. You need incentives." 
</P>
<P>
Heckel has started an annual alumni game, revved up the once-sagging booster 
club, and raised enough funds through free-throw-athons to buy much-needed new 
uniforms, athletic bags and practice and game sweats. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them if we make the playoffs this year, next year's team will travel to 
Hawaii or some place like that," Heckel said. 
</P>
<P>
The extra incentives seem to be working. Mariner players don't hesitate when 
asked about their top priority. 
</P>
<P>
"To make it to CIF and win our first game," Schulze said. "Right now, there's 
not anything more important than that."

CAL POLY POMONA COMES OUT COLD AFTER HALFTIME AND CHAPMAN ROLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona's poor second-half shooting helped Chapman College run away 
with a 97-71 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. victory Thursday night 
Pomona's Poly Pavilion. Chapman forward Russ Ortega led all scorers with 27 
points 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos made only 12 of 40 shots from the field in the second half. Chapman 
made 18 of 30 attempts in the same period. Rog Middleton had 16 points and 
Bryan Richetto 15 for the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman (12-10 overall, 5-4 in conference play) never surrendered the lead it 
took when Dean Balcao made a three-pointer with 18:13 remaining in the first 
half to put the Panthers ahead, 5-4. Pomona is 6-15, 0-9.

CATTLE HERD REPORT HURTS FUTURES PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A government report showing a larger-than-expected U.S. cattle herd knocked 
cattle futures prices to the mat Thursday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 
but analysts were skeptical of the report's accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, cotton futures prices fell sharply, grains and soybeans were 
mixed, precious metals futures declined, and energy futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for all cattle futures except the February live cattle contract plunged 
the permitted daily limit of 1 1/2 cents at the opening bell and stayed 
limit-down for the rest of the session. The contract for February delivery of 
live cattle settled 1.40 cents lower at 73.97 cents a pound while the 
near-month feeder cattle contract, for delivery in March, settled at 82.92 
cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Pork futures prices fell in sympathy with the cattle market. Live hogs finished 
.50 cent to 1.05 cents lower with February at 41.90 cents a pound; frozen pork 
bellies were .12 cent to 1.13 cents lower with February at 37.57 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The sell-off was triggered by Wednesday's semiannual USDA cattle inventory 
report, a head count of the nation's cattle herd. The USDA reported that there 
were 99.5 million cattle and calves in the United States as of Jan. 1, only a 
few thousand fewer than the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The industry consensus expectation was for the herd to total fewer than 98 
million cattle. The USDA report implied that after 6 years of thinning cattle 
numbers, producers were starting to rebuild their herds. 
</P>
<P>
But many analysts said they did not believe the report, especially its 
implication of an extremely high birth rate in the second half of 1988.

OVERTIME DISPUTE SPURS TALKS BY EASTERN AIRLINES, MACHINISTS

<P>
Eastern Airlines management and Machinists union officials Wednesday discussed 
a mandatory overtime dispute that led to a walkout. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Robin Matell said that there were two small, short-lived 
walkouts Wednesday morning by groups of Machinists workers but that operations 
were continuing normally. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 1,000 Machinists walked off the job Tuesday afternoon at Miami 
International Airport. The job action lasted about 3 hours, and management 
personnel used to replace baggage handlers and other ground services workers 
enabled the airline to run its flights with minimal delays. 
</P>
<P>
Machinists leaders said they didn't call for the walkout and said it was 
spontaneous. Matell blamed it on "public posturing" by the Machinists, whose 
16-month-old contract dispute with management has a March 3 deadline for 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Matell said the meeting Wednesday continued discussions from Tuesday on the 
suspensions for 3 days each of eight to 10 Machinists who refused to work 
overtime required by their contract. The Machinists said the company failed to 
show a need for the extra work. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a decision management interprets, when there is a need," Matell said. 
</P>
<P>
A union member said the strike was a spontaneous action from the rank and file.

if no settlement is reached by March 3 in the 16-month dispute. Pilots 
indicated that they might honor the picket lines. Meanwhile, the airline 
suspended 100 machinists who staged a walkout. United Press International

HYUNDAI MOTOR TO PAY $27 MILLION FOR FOUNTAIN VALLEY FACILITY, 18 ACRES

Hyundai Motor America said it will pay $27 million for a 216,000-square-foot 
building on 18 acres at Talbert Avenue in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Selling was QB Cos. of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The building formerly housed ITT Cannon, Hyundai said. Hyundai will remodel 
that building, and early next year 525 employees will move in from seven leased 
buildings in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company will build a five-story, 175,000-square-foot office 
tower on the site. Construction is expected to begin in 1991 and finish in 
1993. Hyundai will also build a four-level parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai America spent 3 years looking at "many attractive sites" in Orange and 
Los Angeles counties and in nearby areas, said President H.W. Baik. 
</P>
<P>
The Korean car manufacturer opened its U.S. sales and marketing headquarters in 
one building in Garden Grove in 1985.

HOME PRICES DIP A BIT IN JANUARY DOLDRUMS

Home prices took a slight dive last month as the Orange County housing market 
went through its annual January slowdown, said TRW Real Estate Market 
Information. 
</P>
<P>
The average price for all homes sold in the county during the month was 
$218,251, down 0.7% from December's $219,774. The average price a year ago was 
$179,895, or about 21% less. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other studies, the Colton company's market survey includes both new and 
used houses and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Sales fell 27.6% during the month, from 4,639 units in December to 3,362 in 
January, TRW said. 
</P>
<P>
That seems like a lot, but it's about the same drop as last year, when sales 
fell 28.2% between December and January. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, January home sales were about the same as a year ago, when 3,498 units 
were sold in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The winter months are traditionally a slow period for home sales, which then 
pick up in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors are now watching the market closely to see if last year's extremely 
heavy demand for housing will reappear. So many people were in the market for a 
house last year -- and so few houses were available -- that local home prices 
soared to among the highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Many experts, however, say that while 1989 home sales should remain strong, 
they won't be as frenzied as last year. Price increases, they say, should stay 
well below 20%.

Daum-Johnstown American -- which also landed in the news recently -- said it 
has moved its Newport Beach office to larger quarters in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles commercial real estate broker, Daum made news late last year when 
50 or so of its employees and brokers -- who work on contract -- left the 
Anaheim office to join a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
The brokerage took 9,000 square feet in a 12-story building at 1920 Main St. in 
Koll Center Irvine North. Daum contends it's doing fine and just needed more 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers there said they recently closed one fair-size deal: The purchase of two 
industrial buildings near John Wayne Airport by RHB Investments of Beverly 
Hills from Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co. for $6.2 million.

Eldorado Bancorp in Laguna Hills, holding company for Eldorado Bank in Tustin, 
reported record net income of $3.3 million for last year, a 41% increase over 
$2.3 million of the previous year. Revenue climbed 21% to $25.9 million from 
$21.4 million the previous year. For the fourth quarter, the company's net 
income was $895,000, an increase of 65% over $544,000 earned in the last 
quarter of 1987. Quarterly revenue rose 27% to $7 million from $5.5 million in 
1987's last quarter. The company's total assets increased 26% to $250.4 million 
at the end of December from $199 million a year earlier. Part of the growth was 
attributed to the acquisition in May of American Merchant Bank in Newport 
Beach. The bank's total deposits grew 24% to $220.5 million at the end of the 
year from $178 million a year earlier, while its loan portfolio increased 35% 
to $163.1 million from $120.7. The company recently announced a 10% stock 
dividend to shareholders of record today.

WONDERFUL VIETNAMESE FOOD SERVED AMID MONDO BIZARRO DECOR

One of Orange County's greatest cultural resources is the collection of noodle 
houses, pate shops, bookstores, herb sellers and other emigre-run emporiums in 
Little Saigon, situated in Westminster and parts of Santa Ana and Garden Grove. 
Heading the list of attractions in my guidebook is a restaurant (naturally) 
called Thien Thanh. It is among the best places to eat in the neighborhood, and 
it's great for people watching too. 
</P>
<P>
The procession of Vietnamese passing in and out of Thien Thanh is a fascinating 
gamut: New Wave youths in leather pants and sunglasses, globe-trotting Asian 
businessmen in Savile Row suits, subtly costumed grandmothers and sleek, 
fashionable mothers toting wide-eyed babies. 
</P>
<P>
Habits here aren't much different than at any all-American diner -- only the 
details are different. Afternoons, a young crowd lingers over noodle soup and 
filter coffee as the penetrating rhythms of Le Thu, a Vietnamese pop singer, 
play on the sound system. Evenings, a calmer mood prevails as families and 
friends gather for the restaurant's more elaborate specialties. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh means, literally, "thousand blue," an allusion to the ever blue 
skies of the Vietnamese homeland. That undoubtedly is why the glass-topped 
tables are bright blue, but there is no explanation for the lipstick-red floor 
-- it's a mondo bizarro combination that comes straight from Melrose Avenue. I 
don't blame the New Wavers for wearing sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
The food, though, is wonderful, a dizzying melange of herbs and tropical fruits 
that employs both Chinese techniques and French sensibilities. It takes several 
visits just to scratch the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Even the simple act of eating cha gio, Vietnamese egg roll, becomes a sensual 
experience here. Cha gio are peppery, bite-sized cylinders filled with minced 
pork, crab, celery, carrot and clear noodle thread; little lettuce cocoons with 
mint leaves, bean sprouts, ngo gai and aromatic parsley are wrapped around each 
roll, and then you dip the whole thing into the sweet fish sauce called nuoc 
mam. This dish is to the generic egg roll what cognac is to grape juice. 
</P>
<P>
I began with the cha gio on my first visit and then proceeded to muc lan bot, 
an incredible platter of squiggly fried squids astride a fiery chile dipping 
sauce. After washing the squids down with soda sua hot ga, an orange-flavored 
milk soda whipped with beaten egg, I could eat no more. I promised to pace 
myself the second time. 
</P>
<P>
And I brought several friends. We procured a round table (the better to fit 
more food on) and dug in. Cua rang muoi, cooked salted crab served in its 
batter-fried shell, was an unqualified hit. You might wonder why the kitchen 
bothers serving the shell with the crab but as you crack the shell, little 
flakes of batter fall off and mix with the fried onions and spices ringing the 
plate. Do not waste these batter flakes; they are delicious and surprising. Bo 
dam, described on the menu as "roasted beef centered with garlic," turned out 
to be an extra-tender New York steak blackened on an iron grill, with a 
medium-rare center. The operative word in the description is garlic, so take 
note. I think the dish is fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
Some dishes at Thien Thanh are clones of better-known Chinese equivalents, with 
a few native twists. Com thien duong chan is a lot like Yangchow fried rice but 
the addition of peas, corn, carrots, baked egg cake and Chinese sausage make it 
one of the most colorful rice dishes I've seen. Five-spice roast chicken, ga 
ngu vi huong, is sauteed with celery and green pepper, with the overpowering 
taste of anise. Heo xao chua ngot, sweet-and-sour pork, tastes exactly like its 
popular Cantonese namesake, however. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the noodle dishes are familiar too. The Vietnamese prefer rice noodles 
over wheat noodles but the toppings -- barbecued pork, duck, char-broiled beef, 
various seafoods -- are strictly non-threatening. Only a few -- such as bun 
moc, which comes with the oddly spongy pork balls that south Asians love, or 
bun oc, which uses cooked snail -- could be called outre. Any of the noodle 
dishes would make a satisfying lunch for less than $3. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more unusual items, I didn't care for banh xeo. Similar to an omelet, 
it was stuffed with al dente bean sprouts and an occasional morsel of pork. The 
outside was a greasy mass of rice gluten and the inside was nearly raw. Canh 
chua ca gia can -- sweet-and-sour catfish soup with large, vulgar looking 
chunks of pineapple and tomato floating in a pungent broth -- was another dish 
I could have lived without. Even without the MSG I wouldn't have liked it. 
</P>
<P>
(If you object to MSG, consult your waiter. There are more than 150 dishes on 
this menu, and the waiters inform me that most are MSG-free.) 
</P>
<P>
Make it a point to save room for the strangely appealing desserts, especially 
the icy suspensions known as sinh to. These are best described as fruit 
freezes, but the appeal is that they are made from rare Asian produce such as 
durian, jackfruit and custard-apple. All are wonderfully light and refreshing, 
not to mention exotic. The strong filter coffee with condensed milk goes down 
pretty well too. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh is inexpensive -- one of the best values around. Rice noodle soups, 
rice noodle and rice dishes are $1.50 to $4.50. Beef specialties are $4.50 to 
$12.95. Other specialties are $4.95 to $14.95. Desserts are $1 to $1.50.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Almagreb, 23700 El Toro Road, in the Saddleback Valley Plaza, El Toro. (714) 
859-9393. Open for dinner only, Tuesday through Sunday from 6 to 10 p.m. All 
major cards. 
</P>
<P>
Almagreb, a Moroccan restaurant in El Toro, has one of the most dramatic dining 
areas anywhere. Meals are taken in the traditional style, with no utensils, and 
are finger-licking good. Among the better offerings the evening will bring are 
b'stilla (a sugar-dusted chicken pie), couscous (cracked semolina wheat in a 
savory vegetable stew), and Tanya, belly dancer extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh, 5423 W. 1st St., Santa Ana. (714) 554-7260. Open 7 days, from 10 
a.m. to 10:30 p.m. on weekdays, 10 a.m. to 3 a.m. weekends. All major cards. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh is more than just one of the area's best restaurants: It is a 
crossroad of Vietnamese and American culture. The crowd is as diverse as the 
menu. Cua rang muoi (cooked salted crab) and bo dam (garlic centered beef) are 
two dishes not to miss, but lighter appetites can indulge in more than 50 
noodle dishes. 
</P>
<P>
McCharles House, 335 South C St., Tustin. (714) 731-4063. Open Mondays through 
Saturdays 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. for lunch, 2 to 6 p.m. for tea; Thursdays through 
Saturdays 5:30 to 9 p.m. for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
If you have never experienced a proper English tea, then now's your chance at 
this converted Victorian house, built circa 1885 in old town Tustin. You'll 
even get heart-shaped scones. Lunch is a choice of salads and little tea 
sandwiches. Dinner is simple and sweet. Don't miss a tempting array of 
home-baked goodies, like the rich chocolate cake served with clotted cream.

PASCOE SKIPS OVER STONEHENGE TO STAGE 'NORMA' IN 1831 STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Productions of "Norma" often set the scene at Stonehenge with singers running 
around in togas. But don't expect to see any of that in John Pascoe's staging 
of Bellini's Druid opera, which opens Saturday at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"Stonehenge is in England. 'Norma' is set in France -- Gaul," the British-born 
Pascoe said in a recent interview. "The first records we have of Druid 
practices (predate) Stonehenge by many thousands of years. (Stonehenge) has 
nothing to do with Druids at all." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added, "Bellini knew absolutely zip about Druids." 
</P>
<P>
For the Opera Pacific production, Pascoe has taken his cues from the original 
1831 production instead of from later stagings. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be an authentic production in terms of visual style -- scenery, 
costumes and the temple. But it is not what people will expect when they come 
to a 'Norma' production. Usually, people do it in kind of rags, around 500 BC. 
That's fine. But it is not what Bellini did, and not what I'm particularly 
interested in. . . . I've tried to be honest to what he thought." 
</P>
<P>
Pascoe said that the Opera Pacific program booklet will reproduce engravings of 
some of the original costumes and scenery that inspired Pascoe. Hence the 
run-down look of the temple. "One thing that we do know absolutely definitely 
about the Druids is that they didn't have an architecture of stone," Pascoe 
said. "They used natural phenomena or ruins as the focus for their rites. 
</P>
<P>
Pascoe came to these ideas late, beginning his stage directing career only 
after designing sets and costumes for operas (beginning with Handel's "Julius 
Caesar" for the English National Opera, with Dame Janet Baker, and conducted by 
Sir Charles MacKerras, in 1979). 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, however, the directing bug bit. "I thought I would like to see 
if I could direct," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For his first venture, he chose a situation that was "not too exposed" -- 
Puccini's "La Boheme" for the Northern Ireland Opera in Belfast in 1984. But 
the experience turned out to be "a baptism by fire" managing the busy stage 
traffic in the Cafe Momus scene. 
</P>
<P>
But it was successful enough for him to go on to stage Handel's "Solomon" for 
the Gottingen Handel Festival in Germany in 1984, Rameau's comedy "Platee" at 
the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston, S.C., in 1987 (transferred to the 
Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1988) and Donizetti's "Anna Bolena" for Sutherland 
at the Royal Opera House in London in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Pascoe has not directed any of opera's "big war horses," though he hopes to. 
But when he does, he doesn't envision radically reinterpreting them the way 
some better-known firebrands do to make them more "relevant." 
</P>
<P>
"If someone were to be hypercritical of the way opera productions have gone in 
the last 15 years, in some cases, a few directors will have come to an opera 
thinking, 'Oh, God, what can I do with it?' . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I want to try to do what the music and the drama is calling out for. . . . One 
day, I would like to be considered the composer's champion: If you want to do 
it as the composer writ, get Pascoe."

HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: ROLLS LIST MORE LATINOS, ASIANS

The numbers of Latino and Asian students in Orange County schools are still 
climbing, while the number of Anglo students continues to fall, according to 
figures released recently by the county Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The total enrollment for this school year in the 28 school districts in the 
county is 350,903, up from 344,969 for last year. Anglo students represent 
58.6% of this year's total, down from 61% for the previous year. Their number 
decreased to 205,505 from 211,080 in 1987. The number of Latino students 
increased 11% over last year, the reports shows, and the number of Asian 
students increased 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, when the Orange County Department of Education first began 
collecting figures on the racial and ethnic composition of its enrollments, 
Anglos represented 85.9% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
The trend in Orange County, which has been apparent for several years, mirrors 
what is happening statewide. The State Department of Education reported last 
September that for the first time, Anglo students were no longer the majority 
in California schools. Their numbers this school year make up 49.2% of the 
state total, according to a tally made just after the start of the 1988-89 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
In a competition against 48 others, Saddleback High School senior Rodelee Cruz 
won the title of Miss Drill Team California in a pageant at Aviation High 
School in Manhattan Beach. She placed first in modeling and in drill team 
routine to take the title. She will compete for the national title April 1 in 
Los Angeles.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO BREAK YOUR WORST HABIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever sit next to someone who chews his gum with his mouth open? Or maybe 
someone who taps her pencil on her desk top or twirls her hair around her 
finger? These and other idiosyncrasies, performed day in and day out, can 
become habits. Some habitual behavior is good, but most is simply annoying. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Topics wonders, "What is your worst habit and what are you doing to try to 
break yourself of it?"

"Staying up late. I won't go to sleep until at least midnight. I know I can't 
get up in the morning, but out of habit, I stay up. I am making myself be in 
bed by 10 p.m. If I am even one minute late, I punish myself. I will take away 
something I like . . . TV, food, etc. It is helping to do better in school 
because I am more rested and I can think more clearly."

GOOD MEN ARE HARD TO FIND, UNLESS YOU GO TO GREAT LENGTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Frances Reps was looking for a few good men. There were the usual requirements: 
single, straight, warm, caring, good sense of humor, someone who listens. 
Handsome couldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
But Reps couldn't find a few good men. Or even one good man. Not in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
So Reps put on her thinking cap. Surely there were other women out there -- 
successful, fabulous women like herself -- who pondered this quandary with some 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
"And I thought, 'There must be something I can do,' " she says. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out there was. Seems that Reps, a Newport Beach travel agent, has made 
plenty of connections beyond your average LAX-DFW-JFK variety. 
</P>
<P>
And so, for a mere $3,275 per person, double occupancy, Reps plans to open up a 
whole new world for 40 American single women. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking men here. Real men, Reps explains. We're talking Aussies. "What I 
say to people is, come in and and look at my file," Reps says. "They are just 
terrific. I have a big game hunter that you would die for. He is so handsome! I 
have a dental surgeon, lawyers -- they call them barristers -- doctors. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Reps is talking about the 375 Australian men who wrote to her after she 
appeared last year on three Australian talk shows scoping out the possibility 
of arranging her Single Ladies Tour to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
This will be Reps' second Single Ladies Tour. The first group went to Alaska 
last September in search of the bearded, flannel-shirted variety of rugged 
Americana. That, too, was fabulous, Reps says, adding that most of the golden 
moments were captured on film by a crew from the television show "USA Today." 
</P>
<P>
"I took 20-some, and two or three (couples) are already married," she says. 
"Then there are other women that are writing, so I don't know how many of them 
will end up getting married." 
</P>
<P>
And that's what the Aussies want too, Reps says. Commitment. They've sent 
photographs of themselves. Six of them even sent pictures of their houses and 
another six of their yachts. 
</P>
<P>
How's that for commitment? 
</P>
<P>
Now don't get Reps wrong. She says it's not that there's anything wrong with 
the men of Orange County -- it's just that there aren't too many of them. 
</P>
<P>
Reps relayed the grim news as conveyed to her by Cosmopolitan magazine: 
Eligible women in the United States outnumber eligible men by a ratio of about 
8 to 1. And it is worse in most cities. 
</P>
<P>
"There just aren't enough men to go around," says Reps, who is 55. "And for the 
women in the 50-year-old group, all the men are dying early. And of what's 
left, all the 60-year-old men want the 20-year-olds." 
</P>
<P>
What's a Cosmo girl to do? 
</P>
<P>
One woman leaving nothing to chance is LaVonne Propes, 34, a senior legal 
secretary in Dallas who has already signed up for the Men of Australia tour, 
which leaves Los Angeles on March 26 (although everyone must be ticketed by 
Feb. 15). 
</P>
<P>
Propes, who describes herself as a "country girl" from East Texas, is what Reps 
describes as "absolutely gorgeous." 
</P>
<P>
Propes dates a lot of lawyers and business types in Dallas but says she can 
hardly wait to get her hands on the Aussies, a sub-genre she describes as 
well-built, down-to-earth with (she hopes) plenty of hair on their chests. 
</P>
<P>
She also says she's looking for men of more substance than those she knows in 
Dallas, ones who don't spend all their time at work or "polishing their BMWs." 
</P>
<P>
"Not that they wouldn't have BMWs," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
For the Single Ladies Tour, Reps has arranged sightseeing in the Outback, 
Melbourne, Sydney and Cairns, bordering the Great Barrier Reef, as well as 
cocktail parties, a gala ball and even a dinner-dance in the bush. "Dress for 
that is casual," she says. 
</P>
<P>
So who knows? This could work. Seems there already are all sorts of women 
signed up for the tour, most of them in their 20s, 30s and 40s, but Reps adds 
that a 70-year-old also is considering it. "A young 70," she says.

A table that appeared in The Times Wednesday comparing 1988-89 salary scales 
for teachers inaccurately reported what the pay range would be in the Los

The new minimum salary would be $25,316, and the maximum, paid to those with 
the equivalent of a doctorate degree, would be $46,594.

HUSBAND STILL GUARDIAN OF COMATOSE WIFE; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVISTS LOSE APPEAL TO BLOCK ABORTION

<P>
New York state's highest court today denied an appeal by anti-abortion 
activists seeking to prevent a Long Island man from having an abortion 
performed on his comatose wife. 
</P>
<P>
Even before today's decision by the New York Court of Appeals, a lawyer for the 
activists had said he would turn to the federal courts if the state court 
rejected the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The seven judges of the Court of Appeals, without comment, refused to hear the 
appeal of a lower court's ruling that appointed Martin Klein as guardian of his 
32-year-old pregnant wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
Klein has said he wants the abortion in the hopes that it will save the life of 
his wife. The anti-abortion activists have sought to be appointed guardians of 
Nancy Klein, saying her emotional health is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm begging the American people to please help us," Martin Klein said Thursday 
after he was rebuffed a second time in his battle to act as guardian of his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Strangers ... Intruding' 
</P>
<P>
"We're torn up," he said. "These strangers have come off the street and are 
intruding in our lives. We don't know what to do about it." 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, a state appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that made 
Klein, an accountant from Upper Brookville, his wife's guardian. Two members of 
the anti-abortion group, John Short and John Broderick, immediately appealed to 
the state's highest court, which placed a stay on the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just something you can't set aside," said Short. "Our concern is of the 
psychological and emotional state of Nancy Klein if she wakes up. 
</P>
<P>
"Under our plan, we say the baby's down at the neonatal clinic getting the best 
care possible. Under their plan, they've got to tell her they've killed her 
baby. Emotionally, that would kill her," he contended. 
</P>
<P>
In its ruling, the five-member appeals court panel had found that "ultimately 
the record confirms that these absolute strangers to the Klein family, whatever 
their motivation, have no place in the midst of this family tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Klein, who is approximately 17 weeks pregnant, has been in a coma at 
North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset on Long Island since a Dec. 13 car 
accident.

Interstate 5 -- closed since Tuesday night -- was reopened this morning after 
California Department of Transportation crews cleared away the remains of 
5-foot snowdrifts in the mountains north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
About 4,500 residents in the Tehachapi mountain communities of Lebec, Gorman, 
Holiday Valley and Frazier Park, stranded by one of the heaviest snowfalls in 
decades, began digging out this morning as the sun broke through shortly after 
dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Four lanes of I-5 were opened with California Highway Patrol escort at 6 a.m., 
and by noon, traffic flowed freely in both directions.

Jose Canseco, named most valuable player of the American League last year for 
his speed on the baseball diamond, was cited for the speed of his 1989 Jaguar 
in Miami early today. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Cuban-born Canseco was stopped after his bright red car was 
spotted going an estimated 125 m.p.h. on Interstate 95 in south Broward County. 
Troopers caught up with him in north Dade County at about 1:25 a.m., said 
Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Tim Betts. The Oakland A's right fielder 
was cited for reckless driving and allowed to drive home, Betts said. "He was 
very reasonable. He did not deny it or say he did it," said Betts. "He just 
accepted his ticket." 
</P>
<P>
The penalty for reckless driving could be imprisonment for up to 90 days, or a 
fine of $25 to $500, or both, Betts said.

City officials, citing health and fire code violations, today evicted the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service from a building where it processes 
thousands of political asylum applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The city fire marshal and police cleared the building of INS personnel and 
immigrants at about 10 a.m. and chained and padlocked two main entryways. 
Another door was sealed with duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
"We are finally forced to take this drastic action," Mayor Bill Card said. 
"It's a situation where we have not been able to get the cooperation and the 
attention of the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
The City Commission also voted to sue the federal agency. Card said his city 
will seek a state district court injunction to keep the INS building closed. 
Both votes were unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what is happening," said Juan Francisco Mayrena, a Nicaraguan 
amnesty applicant who was waiting in a van packed with about 15 other Central 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
On some nights, scores of Central Americans sleep outside the INS building and 
the grounds are strewn with litter. Nearby vacant lots are dotted with human 
waste, Card said. 
</P>
<P>
Seating inside the building exceeds a maximum set under city fire codes, Card 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unsanitary. It's a nuisance. And we're not going to allow it to be 
operated any further." 
</P>
<P>
The INS has been processing about 2,000 primarily Central American political 
asylum applicants weekly in this city 25 miles north of the border city of 
Brownsville. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Central Americans began piling up at the southern tip of Texas 
after Dec. 16, when the INS began a policy of restricting asylum applicants to 
the INS' Harlingen district while their cases were being reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela in Brownsville on Jan. 9 issued a temporary 
restraining order forcing the immigration service to once again allow asylum 
applicants to travel on to their U.S. destinations to pursue their claims for 
refugee status.

Ron Brown was elected the first black chairman of the Democratic National 
Committee today, and the former aide to Jesse Jackson promptly urged his party 
to unite behind its traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a few months ago, our friends in the press said this contest would leave 
us divided and shattered," Brown told hundreds of committee colleagues who 
elected him by acclamation at a downtown hotel. "Instead, we stand here today 
shoulder to shoulder and arm to arm. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to dwell on, but we cannot ignore, the history of this 
moment," he acknowledged. "In choosing the first American of African descent to 
lead one of America's major political parties, you have made history." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he insisted, the election does not signal a rejection of the 
party's more centrist elements and does not mean that the chairman is tied down 
to the most liberal Jackson faction. 
</P>
<P>
"I accept this responsibility beholden to no individual, afraid of no faction, 
and pledged to no institution except the Democratic Party and our members," the 
47-year-old lawyer assured his audience. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who served as deputy chairman from 1982 to 1985, was assured of the top 
spot last month when four other men dropped out of what had been foreseen as a 
bitter battle to succeed retiring Chairman Paul G. Kirk.

QUAYLE LAUDS ISRAEL, BUT CHIDES IT FOR KILLING ARABS

Israel remains the most reliable U.S. ally in the world, but it must recognize 
that the killing of Palestinian civilians in the strife-torn West Bank and Gaza 
Strip is "clearly unacceptable," Vice President Dan Quayle told an American 
Jewish group today. 
</P>
<P>
The uprising by Palestinians in those regions "has resulted in nearly 400 
Palestinians being killed and many more injured," Quayle told a conference of 
the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
<P>
"Some may say that by the grisly standards of some of Israel's neighbors, a few 
hundred people killed in the course of a yearlong uprising is not a very 
staggering figure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, Israel should be judged not by those standards but "on the basis 
of standards which prevail in the democratic West. And on the basis of these 
standards the status quo on the West Bank and Gaza Strip is clearly 
unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Quayle said, the recent first-ever talks between 
representatives of the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization 
do not indicate any fundamental change in attitude toward the PLO or its 
leader, Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the cautionary stance taken by officials in the Ronald Reagan 
Administration who began the dialogue in the last days before President Bush 
took office. 
</P>
<P>
"Simple prudence obliges us to monitor Mr. Arafat and his organization very 
carefully, and to probe his words very closely before arriving at a final 
determination," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that while Arafat has recognized the state of Israel and renounced 
terrorism, factions within the PLO hold opposing viewpoints.

The U.S. dollar rallied in late European trading Friday after news of a 
higher-than-expected January U.S. producer price index rekindled speculation of 
a rise in U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar initially weakened because of market disappointment that President 
Bush's projected deficit for fiscal 1990 turned out to be little different from 
the Reagan Administration's projection last month. 
</P>
<P>
However, afternoon news that the U.S. producer price index rose 1%, far higher 
than an expected 0.4% rise, triggered a dollar rally.

Police have identified two motorists who died Thursday in traffic accidents, 
one of which officials blamed on rain-soaked roads. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Cecil Calvert, 64, of Riverside was killed when a man driving north on 
Pacific Coast Highway about 2 miles south of Cameo Shores lost control of his 
Corvette, spun into the southbound lanes and smashed into Calvert's Mercury 
Cougar, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Calvert was pronounced dead on arrival at Hoag Hospital Presbyterian in Newport 
Beach. CHP Officer Mark Mudrick said the accident, which occurred about 1:10 
p.m. was caused by the weather. Walid M. Albinali, 22, of Irvine, the driver of 
the Corvette, remained hospitalized Thursday with a chest injury and facial 
cuts. Albinali was not cited, Mudrick said, and police are still investigating 
the accident. Two other vehicles were involved in the accident, but neither 
driver was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County coroner's office identified Linda Dianna Kinwald, 39, of 
Fountain Valley as the woman who was killed Thursday when she ran a red light 
and struck an empty Orange County Transit District bus at Harbor Boulevard and 
Sunflower Avenue in Santa Ana, authorities said. She was pronounced dead at the 
scene. The bus driver, 45-year-old Gloria Novotny of Anaheim, was not injured. 
No passengers were aboard the bus, which was out of service.

Almost 800 pounds of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $40 million, 
was seized in Orange and four people were arrested, Torrance Police Lt. David 
Marsden said today. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure was the result of a two-year investigation by Torrance police and 
federal drug agents. Three men were arrested Thursday at a liquor store parking 
lot in Orange where officers found 40 pounds of cocaine in a car. After 
obtaining a search warrant, police later went to a house in the 77400 block of 
Russell Drive, about a mile from the liquor store, where they found almost 800 
pounds of cocaine and arrested a fourth man, Marsden said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects are Erwin J. Gonzalez, 35; Fernando N. Andrade, 37; Gabriel N. 
Andrade, 41, and William Arias, 33, all Colombian nationals, Marsden said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a significant seizure of cocaine by anybody's standards," Marsden said.

The Army said today it has again raised its reliance on competitive bidding for 
the award of procurement contracts. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to Congress on fiscal 1988 actions, the Army said $18.45 billion -- 
or 61.6% of its total $29.94 billion in procurement dollars -- was awarded to 
contractors after competitive bidding. This was an increase from 58.8% in 
fiscal 1987 and a jump over the 41.2% awarded on a competitive basis in fiscal 
1983, a year before the Army began a drive to limit the use of sole-source 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
More than 93% of the individual contracts signed during fiscal 1988 were 
awarded after competitive bidding, up from 88% in fiscal 1987 and 48% in fiscal 
1983, the Army said.

TOSHIBA DEVELOPS CHIP TO REPLACE FLOPPY, HARD DISCS

Toshiba Corp. said today that it has developed a new thumbnail-size memory chip 
that may replace floppy and hard discs within three years and drastically 
reduce the size of computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba officials said the breakthrough device is the "world's first 4-megabit 
electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) chip -- the 
highest level of integration ever attained in this kind of memory device." 
</P>
<P>
They said the large-capacity chip provides an ultra-fast readout time of 1.6 
microseconds, more than 1,000 times faster than floppy discs. It takes one 
microsecond to erase or program data, equivalent to or faster than conventional 
chips of that type, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba said the new chip may replace much larger computer memory storage 
mediums like floppy or hard discs in three years. 
</P>
<P>
It also has the advantage of not requiring any rotary-drive mechanism. This may 
lead to sharp reductions in the size of computer systems, the company said.

W. R. Grace &amp; Co., the leading U.S. maker of specialty chemicals, said 
today that it plans to sell minority stakes in its far-flung specialty units 
and energy holdings to generate funds to expand its profitable chemical 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based company expects the sales to generate at least $300 million, 
a spokesman said. Grace's specialty businesses include cocoa, specialty 
textiles and specialty agricultural activities. 
</P>
<P>
Grace, which has sold $2 billion in assets in the last two years, said it is 
considering the partial sale of a minority interest in Grace Specialty 
Businesses and the sale of a minority stake in Grace Natural Resources Group. 
</P>
<P>
Grace said it would use proceeds from these sales to support both its core 
specialty chemical business -- which has high capital requirements -- and its 
nonspecialty chemical business in a restructuring that hopes to boost 1989 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
Grace has been shedding businesses to improve profits and to thwart potential 
takeover attempts. The conglomerate focuses on specialty chemicals, natural 
resources, specialty businesses and chemicals.

Cliff Buck, the former president of the United States Olympic Committee who 
boosted the city's bid for the 1976 Winter Olympics, is dead at 88. 
</P>
<P>
Buck, who during his tenure as USOC president supervised activities at the 1972 
Winter Olympic Games in Sapporo, Japan, and the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, 
West Germany, died Wednesday night at the Heritage Park Care Center in 
Carbondale, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
As an international sports figure, Buck traveled to 80 countries while boosting 
Denver as the site for the 1976 Games. State voters later rejected the games, 
which were held instead at Innsbruck, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
According to Don Carlton, a close friend and associate, Buck was devastated 
when Denver turned the games back to the International Olympic Committee for 
reassignment. 
</P>
<P>
Buck was an administrator in amateur sports for more than 30 years, including 
service to the Rocky Mountain Amateur Athletic Union, the national AAU and the 
USOC from 1969 through 1972.

Solicitor Joe Watson said today that no criminal charges will be filed in a 
fight involving several Clemson basketball players and two campus security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to submit it to the grand jury," Watson said in a telephone 
interview from his office in Greenville. "It's over as far as a criminal 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Saying that both sides share the blame for the fight, Watson added that the 
security guards acted "unprofessionally," cursing at and chasing the students 
after police arrived. He said the two security guards eventually had to be 
subdued by police. 
</P>
<P>
The fight occurred Jan. 21 in the parking lot of an apartment complex that 
serves as the basketball players' dormitory. Watson declined to identify the 
players involved, but sources said 6-foot, 11-inch junior center Elden Campbell 
was among those who took part in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
The two Crowe's Inc. security guards involved in the fight suffered minor 
injuries. The fight, which Watson said lasted two or three minutes, occurred 
shortly after Clemson downed Western Carolina at Littlejohn Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"It was basically a case where both sides acted immaturely. Basically, there 
were aggravating points on both sides," Watson said. "I'm not pointing blame at 
any one of them." 
</P>
<P>
The fight prompted the Clemson Police Department to ask for help from the State 
Law Enforcement Division. Watson said that probably neither he nor the state 
officers would have been involved in the investigation had athletes not been 
involved in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the thing that made it bigger than it was, because some Clemson 
athletes were involved," he said. "The Police Department wanted someone who was 
independent to look at their findings." 
</P>
<P>
Watson said statements were taken from 20 to 25 people during the probe, which 
took longer than expected because those involved initially lied about what 
happened.

3 OKLAHOMA U. FOOTBALL PLAYERS ACCUSED OF RAPE

<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors charged three Oklahoma football players with first-degree rape 
today in an alleged gang rape at a university athletic dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
Nigel Clay, Glen Bell and Bernard Hall are accused of raping a 20-year-old 
woman at the dormitory Jan. 21, District Atty. Tully McCoy said. 
</P>
<P>
Clay and Hall were also charged with two counts each of furnishing alcohol to a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
The charges are the result of an investigation into an Edmond woman's report 
that she was gang-raped at the athletic dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
None of those charged is a starter for the football team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No More Charges Seen 
</P>
<P>
McCoy said no additional charges are expected from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time across town, the university's board of regents adopted a 
recommendation that any student athlete charged with a crime be prohibited from 
participating in sports at the school while charges are pending. 
</P>
<P>
That was one of a series of recommendations David Swank made in light of the 
alleged gang rape and a shooting that occurred recently at the university. All 
the recommendations were approved. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the charges filed today, a football player was accused last 
month of shooting and wounding a teammate in an argument in an athletic 
dormitory.
