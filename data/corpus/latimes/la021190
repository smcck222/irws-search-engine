SLOUCHING TOWARD THE MILLENNIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a teacher, parent and concerned citizen, I wish to respond to Vartan 
Gregorian's opinion on education. The last sentence of his second paragraph -- 
"More and more, the first two years of college resemble the last two years of 
high school" -- strikes me not as just a fact but as a solution to the problem 
of school drop-outs, truancy, apathy, teacher shortage, overcrowded classes and 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
Why not adopt the European method of testing students and graduating them at 
16, thereby offering them the opportunity of starting college earlier or 
entering a vocational program or training as apprentices on the job? 
</P>
<P>
Industry needs to become more involved by beginning in the junior high schools 
to promote its needs for skilled employees and then providing opportunities for 
observation-participation days. 
</P>
<P>
Vacations should be emphasized as well. Students who travel learn more about 
geography, history, math, sociology, psychology, English and other languages by 
exposure rather than enforced study for a grade. 
</P>
<P>
The time has come to not just wring our hands but review, revise and reduce the 
number of years that students are supposed to stay in school.

<P>
Your collection of predictions was interesting but largely superficial and 
insular. Mention of the interconnectedness of our country and the world was 
minimal, and nothing was written that addressed the basic problem: too many 
people. Too many people seeking the high standard of living now enjoyed by the 
few developed nations, and those few already too many in relation to 
consumption of world resources.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: DECONSTRUCTION SITE; 
</P>
<P>
IT MAY NOT MEAN WHAT IT WAS MEANT TO MEAN, AND IT MAY NOT MEAN ANYTHING AT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
MY CALTECH FRIEND Herb Henrikson has sent me a copy of "ProfSpeak" (Regnery 
Gateway), by journalist Charles J. Sykes, calling my attention specifically to 
a chapter on "deconstruction." 
</P>
<P>
In general, Sykes indicts the American university "professoriat" as a 
bureaucracy of greedy, vain, selfish, pretentious, slothful mutants who speak 
only in jargon and despise their students. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of education have rounded up the usual suspects, he says: "the students 
themselves, television, the federal government, capitalism, public grade 
schools, high schools, teen-age sex, German philosophers Nietzsche and 
Heidegger, and, for good measure, the Walkman radio." 
</P>
<P>
All fail to identify the real villain, he alleges: "Almost single-handedly, the 
professors -- working steadily and systematically -- have destroyed the 
university as a center of learning and have desolated higher education, which 
no longer is higher or much of an education." 
</P>
<P>
But I am most interested in that faction of the professoriat that preaches 
deconstruction, an esoteric critical methodology that seems to undermine my 
temple and my reason for being. 
</P>
<P>
I have read about deconstruction, but I don't understand it. As Henrikson says, 
"I have a book by the 'Decons' but it is absolutely unfathomable -- obviously 
only the most enlightened can appreciate the intricacies of the emperor's new 
clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Deconstruction has been called a highly abstract critical theory "in which 
words and phrases are methodically scrutinized for multiple meanings, most of 
them contradictory and unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever it is, it frightens me. The ignorant are always frightened by what 
they do not understand. I believe the deconstructionists hold that, to put it 
very simply, in my own words, literature is meaningless or ambiguous, since 
words don't mean what they appear to mean. Sykes says many of the hierarchy 
hold that words have no meaning at all. Thus, the written word is beyond the 
author's control, and literature is invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Deconstruction evidently means whatever its various proponents want it to mean. 
Consider this paragraph from a story by Lynn Smith in The Times: "A feminist 
deconstructionist . . . would find that a feminist argument containing the 
words, 'Do you see my point?' undermines the speaker's purpose since the figure 
of speech has phallic symbolism." 
</P>
<P>
Imagine what a variety of meanings might be drawn by deconstructionists from 
the phrase "keep off the grass" or the title line from the Leo Robin-Julie 
Styne song, "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend." 
</P>
<P>
Sykes notes the posthumous discovery that Paul de Man, the late Yale professor 
who was adulated as archdeacon of the movement in America, had written nearly 
200 pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic articles for collaborationist Belgian newspapers 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Of course De Man's colleagues could hardly hold him to answer for his wartime 
prose since it couldn't have meant what he meant it to mean and, in fact, 
didn't mean anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
Sykes sees in deconstruction, a branch of "post-structuralism," the death of 
reading. As one deconstructionist professor put it, reading is "distinct from 
hallucination insofar as it describes a sequential encounter with signifiers." 
Jargon like that is the movement's lifeblood. 
</P>
<P>
"So what is to become of reading?" Sykes asks. "Of literature? Of the legacy of 
more than 20 centuries of Western civilization?" He asserts that Shakespeare 
couldn't get a job teaching beginning drama in an American university because 
he wouldn't know the jargon. 
</P>
<P>
Deconstruction is hard to define, since one must try to define it in words that 
are intrinsically suspect. One might say that "deconstruction is the theory 
that literature is meaningless," but of course that doesn't mean what one means 
it to mean. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder what the deconstructionists would make of John Donne's passage that 
ends: "And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for 
thee" or, for that matter, of Ernest Hemingway's book, "For Whom the Bell 
Tolls," which seemed to me to be about courage, dedication and love in a 
sleeping bag. 
</P>
<P>
I have no doubt that our Southern California institutions of higher learning 
have been heavily infiltrated by the high priests of this bizarre movement, and 
I would not be surprised to be showered by abstruse protests that I ought not 
to be criticizing that which I don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
I have no defense. I have knocked at the door of deconstruction and found no 
one there who speaks my language. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Gertrude Stein was on the right track when she wrote: "Rose is a rose is 
a rose is a rose."

MOVIES OF THE WEEK

<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Close Range (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is strong stuff, but poorly told, 
about how two teen-age half brothers (Sean Penn, Christopher Penn) are beguiled 
by their dangerous, long-absent father (Christopher Walken). 
</P>
<P>
Miracle Landing (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie starring Wayne Rogers 
and Connie Sellecca, is based on a true story of a near-air tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Verhoeven's 1987 RoboCop (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is ferocious comic-book 
fare, starring Peter Weller as a slaughtered Detroit cop whose head and heart 
are mounted in a robot, the ultimate crime-stopper. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 Hamburger Hill (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) pays heartfelt, richly 
deserved tribute to one of the Vietnam War's bloodiest battles only to lapse 
into a preachy attack on the anti-war movement without ever questioning U.S. 
involvement in the war in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The Love Boat: A Valentine Voyage (CBS Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie in 
which the regulars of the popular series (Gavin MacLeod, Ted Lange, Bernie 
Kopell, Jill Whelan) reprise their roles. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewel of the Nile (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) reunites "Romancing the Stone's" 
Kathleen Turner, as the dowdy romance novelist who blossoms when confronted 
with real-life adventures, and a dashing Michael Douglas, but it's not as much 
fun as the original. 
</P>
<P>
George Miller's 1979 Mad Max (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) tells us how Max's 
mythic saga began, as a highway cop defends his family against a biker gang. 
It's a crude but energetic Aussie tribute to American International Pictures, 
and it launched Mel Gibson as an international star. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is the ultra-violent 1979 Walter 
Hill movie about a gang daring to cross a rival gang's turf; Michael Beck 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
Smart, funny, touching and sensual, Dirty Dancing (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), the 
phenomenally popular 1987 musical/love story set in the Catskills in the early 
'60s, stars Patrick Swayze as as a sexy vacation resort dancer and Jennifer 
Grey as the bright student beguiled by him on the dance floor -- and off. 
</P>
<P>
The Princess Bride (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a delightful 1987 heroic 
fantasy with bracing humor and foolery, finds beautiful princess Robin Wright 
kidnaped by vile prince Chris Sarandon. In hot pursuit are her lover (Cary 
Elwes) and one-time kidnapers (Mandy Patinkin and Andre the Giant). 
</P>
<P>
Crimes of the Heart (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), Beth Henley's play about 
three kooky Mississippi sisters (Sissy Spacek, Diane Keaton and Jessica Lange) 
is somewhat more palatable on the screen than it was on the stage, but it's 
still a tedious Southern Gothic comic caricature. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Coppola's 1979 Apocalypse Now (Channel 5 Thursday at 7 p.m.) is a bold, 
daring attempt to rework Joseph Conrad's "The Heart of Darkness" as a Vietnam 
saga. Even though it finally succumbs to the bewildering madness of war it so 
dazzlingly depicts, it is nonetheless a rich, challenging experience. Martin 
Sheen and Marlon Brando star. 
</P>
<P>
Krull (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is that lethally ponderous 1983 
sword-and-sorcery adventure, a sort of unsuccessful cross between "Star Wars" 
and "Excalibur" starring Ken Marshall and Lysette Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 American Flyers (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.), which told of two 
brothers competing in a bicycle marathon, is not nearly as good as writer Steve 
Tesich's earlier effort, "Breaking Away," but it does present a Kevin Costner 
clearly headed for stardom. 
</P>
<P>
Rent-a-Cop (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.) is pleasant, by-the-numbers genre fare 
which finds endangered hooker Liza Minnelli hiring ex-cop Burt Reynolds to 
protect her. 
</P>
<P>
As in "War Games," Matthew Broderick is once again an impassioned youth taking 
on the dastardly military in Project X (Channel 11 Friday at 8 p.m.), but the 
1987 film, which deals with a crazy Air Force experiment with chimps, 
overreaches and strains credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Seidelman's endearingly hilarious 1985 Desperately Seeking Susan (Channel 
13 Friday at 8 p.m.) stars Rosanna Arquette as a repressed New Jersey housewife 
who, after a conk on the head, wakes up thinking she may be Susan, a gaudy 
adventuress in thrift-shop finery (Madonna, in a sensational screen debut). 
</P>
<P>
Ridley Scott's Legend (Channel 5 Saturday at 6 p.m.) is a gorgeous but 
exceedingly slight fairy tale, in need of both humor and invention and starring 
Tom Cruise and Mia Sara, both of whom are sweet and brave. 
</P>
<P>

listings service.

Hester Street (A&amp;E Monday at 1 p.m.): Joan Micklin Silver's charming 1975 
film, set in a meticulously re-created 1896 Lower East Side and starring Carol 
Kane, who comes from the Old Country only to discover her husband (Steven 
Keats) has taken on American ways. (2:00) 
</P>
<P>
Lonely Hearts (TMC Wednesday at 4 p.m.): Paul Cox's 1981 Australian film is a 
miracle of loving, bemused observation. Norman Kaye and Wendy Hughes play two 
lonely people who have lived their lives for others and who meet through a 
dating service. (1:35) 
</P>
<P>
Camille (TNT Friday at 9 a.m.): Arguably, Greta Garbo gave her greatest 
performance as Dumas' "lady of the camellias" under George Cukor's flawless, 
compassionate direction. (2:15) 
</P>
<P>
Danton (A&amp;E Saturday at 1 a.m.): Ardrzej Wajda's beautifully and richly 
detailed 1982 film on the French Revolution is an electrifying depiction of a 
society hurtling toward chaos; Gerard Depardieu is the boisterous, earthy 
Danton. (3:00)

THE 7.1 EXPERIMENT; 
</P>
<P>
FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, THE LOMA PRIETA TEMBLOR WAS A NATURAL DISASTER. FOR 
SCIENTISTS, IT WAS THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME -- AND AN EARTHSHAKING 
SURPRISE.

<P>
GEOLOGIST TOM HOLZER looked through red-rimmed blue eyes at the two dozen 
rumpled men and women slumped in chairs before him. He was standing in a 
conference room in the steamy, windowless heart of the U.S. Geological Survey 
complex in Menlo Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"Has anyone seen faulting?" Holzer asked wearily. He spread his hands, palms to 
the ceiling. "Anywhere?" 
</P>
<P>
No one in his audience -- the exhausted scientists of the USGS branch of 
engineering seismology and geology -- responded. 
</P>
<P>
It had been 50 hours since the 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake convulsed Northern 
California a few seconds after 5:04 p.m., Tuesday, Oct. 17, 1989. Holzer, 45, 
and the engineering group that he directed could count on one hand the hours of 
sleep they had sneaked since crawling from beneath their desks after the 
tremors jolted Menlo Park. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after the earth ruptured 10 miles east-northeast of Santa Cruz and 60 
miles south of San Francisco, the group had been among a contingent of about 
500 earthquake scientists who had swarmed into frenzied action. Riding 
excitement the way surfers ride waves, researchers in Japan, West Germany, 
Chile, the Soviet Union and Australia dashed madly to their computers to 
observe the long undulations coursing through the earth to their seismographs. 
About 50 others from universities and regional USGS offices in Hawaii, New 
York, Colorado and Southern California grabbed their instruments and headed for 
the USGS in Menlo Park, the nation's premier earthquake research facility, only 
30 miles north of the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's great!" a seismologist gushed at one point in the USGS press 
room and then attempted to swallow his words. "Well, not great, but . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that he didn't recognize the sobering destruction, the lives lost, 
the financial ruin or the paralyzing fear a major earthquake causes. It was 
just that the same violent shaking that meant disaster to most people meant an 
opportunity for him and his colleagues to gather data impossible to obtain any 
other way. Their grand-scale seismic experiments always erupt courtesy of 
Nature, unplanned and uncontrolled. 
</P>
<P>
Although they can't put earthquakes into bottles or re-create them, researchers 
did snare this temblor, and its echoing aftershocks, in their own fashion -- 
they trapped it in a vast, worldwide network of instruments. In the weeks 
following the earthquake, they set out to identify the beast they had already 
named after the most prominent geographical feature near the epicenter, 
3,791-foot Loma Prieta, the highest point in the Santa Cruz Mountains. They 
began their pursuit puffed with confidence. They had forecast this particular 
animal -- magnitude, locale and time frame -- 18 months earlier. They were 
armed with assumptions and theories built on decades of studying California's 
700-mile San Andreas Fault system, which surely was the locus of Loma Prieta. 
</P>
<P>
Holzer's group was responsible for measuring, mapping and analyzing the 
physical effects of the quake, including liquefaction (where usually solid 
ground had turned to mush), surface cracks and landslides. They had returned to 
Menlo Park after a day in the field, crawling into sand-filled basements, 
peering out of low-flying aircraft, bushwhacking through the Santa Cruz 
Mountains. The bushwhackers had expected to find the surface expression of the 
rupture: a disjointed but orderly series of cracks running along a 25-mile 
segment of the San Andreas Fault. Instead, the fault-line team told Holzer in 
puzzled voices, the hundreds of cracks they found -- some large enough for a 
person to stand in, some only 1/8-inch wide -- ran perpendicular to the fault 
or broke in a direction opposite of what was expected. It just didn't make 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
As the frustrated engineering group met, Andy Michael, 30, a round-faced, 
normally cheerful seismologist, frowned over his computer screen a few doors 
away. He and the other nine seismologists in the USGS seismology branch, had 
expected their computers to produce a map showing a fairly straight line of 
aftershocks echoing and tracing the main rupture along the San Andreas. But the 
Loma Prieta aftershocks spread in a cloud across two minor faults nearby, the 
Sargent and the Zayante. 
</P>
<P>
Another anomaly was showing up on his screen as well: The epicenter -- the 
point on the earth's surface directly over the buried hypocenter where the 
rupture began -- was nearly 4 miles west of the San Andreas instead of right on 
top of it. 
</P>
<P>
And what was this speculation coming from the USGS regional office in Pasadena? 
The land mass known as the Pacific Plate, the scientists in Pasadena suggested, 
had shoved into and over the North American Plate. C'mon, Michael thought. 
Everyone knows the San Andreas is a strike-slip fault: The Pacific Plate creeps 
north and the North American creeps south along a vertical plane, which is the 
fault itself. One day, all this creeping will make Los Angeles a suburb due 
west of San Francisco. But no one expected the San Andreas to behave like a 
thrust fault, an entirely different beast. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, so much of the seismic information was unexpected that Michael and his 
co-workers were wondering whether the computers had been knocked silly by the 
earthquake. They had spent hours double-checking everything. The night was 
dragging on. Nothing was changing. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the conference room, a geophysicist named Will Prescott, head of the 
USGS tectonophysics branch, quietly slipped in to hear the latest from the 
engineering group. A slim, bearded 44-year-old, with brown eyes hidden behind 
thick glasses, he had already heard about the data that had Michael perplexed. 
It would be at least another day before his team of geodetic scientists -- 
geophysicists, geologists and technicians who measure and study changes in the 
earth's crust -- could analyze the data it had collected so far and offer a 
good picture of exactly how the area around Loma Prieta had shifted. But even 
the geodetic group's preliminary data indicated something strange was going on. 
Just hours before, a geophysicist reported that the quake had moved a mountain 
only a few inches north. An earthquake the size of the one Prescott had felt on 
Oct. 17 should have generated displacement that was, well, a little more 
earthshaking. 
</P>
<P>
Holzer ended the meeting after assigning the next day's tasks and settled down 
to paper work. Fifty-two hours gone, and still the scientists hadn't grasped 
the essence of Loma Prieta. If their assumptions were correct, they would have 
known what the beast they had trapped looked like. It was becoming clear that 
the San Andreas wasn't what they thought it was. "It wasn't fitting our model," 
Holzer said simply. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the Earth had fooled them again. 
</P>
<P>
ON FRIDAY MORNING, Holzer's fault team trudged back into the mountains to look 
for the fault-line cracks they thought had to be somewhere. Along the way, they 
set out instruments to measure the creeping that usually occurs after an 
earthquake. Holzer had asked the geologists to pinpoint and study as many 
effects of the quake as possible before they were plowed under or washed away 
by expected weekend rains. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Hough, a 28-year-old seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty 
Geological Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., had left her husband in charge of 
their two young children and flown west on Thursday, Oct. 19, with five 
colleagues. They came bearing the latest high-tech portable seismographs that 
measure how different types of soils shake during an earthquake. Volunteering 
their services and their equipment, they were sent by Holzer to a spot his 
group had yet to inspect on foot: the area around the collapsed section of 
Interstate 880, the Nimitz Freeway, in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Early Friday, Hough -- a soft-spoken woman with deep-set hazel eyes -- walked 
along side streets near the pancaked freeway and looked for surface signs of 
the quake. In the warm morning sun, she saw rescue workers frantically digging 
for survivors in the concrete rubble. "I used to live in this area," she 
thought. "I used to drive this freeway and think about earthquakes. I used to 
think it was a coffin." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the detours set up by rescuers, Hough and two colleagues zigged and 
zagged around the collapsed section, comparing an Oakland street map against a 
soils map drawn by USGS engineering seismologist Roger Borcherdt in 1976, 
nearly 20 years after the double-decker structure was built. The soils map was 
the first produced to identify areas that would be particularly unstable during 
an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Hough was astonished to see just how closely the boundaries of the destruction 
coincided with the change in soil types. The collapse began where the freeway 
crossed from relatively solid sediments to fill that covered San Francisco Bay 
mud. It looked like a textbook example of why the map had been drawn in the 
first place. Now all she had to do was prove that the collapse was related to 
the unstable ground below. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Hough and her colleagues placed five seismographs throughout the 
area, including one on the fill above Bay mud and one on the more solid 
sediments. For the next six days, the seismographs recorded all strong 
aftershocks. Later, Hough would transfer the data to a computer disk and run it 
through a computer program that translated the bytes into pictures of jagged 
lines showing horizontal motion (side to side and forward and back) and 
vertical motion (up and down). On Saturday, Hough put a sixth seismograph on an 
uncollapsed section of freeway for 15 hours. 
</P>
<P>
When the Loma Prieta earthquake ruptured nearly 12 miles underground, the earth 
was responding to the still-mysterious forces in the asthenosphere where rock 
flows like warm plastic. Riding this subterranean goo are continent-sized 
jigsaw pieces of crust. Four miles to 40 miles thick, these tectonic plates 
do-si-do past each other in a continuous square dance around the Earth. The 
Pacific Plate moves past the North American Plate at an average rate of nearly 
4 centimeters each year. In some segments, tons of compressed rock on the edges 
of the plates get caught on some subterranean snag for years. When enough 
pressure builds, they suddenly rip free and slam into adjacent rock, setting 
off waves of different sizes and shapes that ripple, tear, undulate and 
ricochet through the earth. 
</P>
<P>
The first waves emanating from an earthquake, called the primary waves, act 
like the waves coursing through a Slinky that is stretched out on the ground 
and jerked at one end. The wave doesn't move up and down; it contracts and 
expands the material through which it moves. These are the "What was that?" 
waves, Holzer says. These waves break through the surface at about 4 miles per 
second to disturb the air and create the terrible primeval roar heard as the 
earthquake's slower, but more damaging, second waves come careering along at 
about 2 miles a second. These secondary waves, called shear waves, wrench 
buildings from side to side, toss desks into the air and fling refrigerators 
across kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
It was the shear waves from Loma Prieta that Hough wanted to measure. As the 
waves traveled from the hypocenter, they weakened, until they encountered 
loosely packed soils, which have room to shake more intensely than compacted 
soils and bedrock. Bay mud was one of those soil types that could be expected 
to amplify waves. Not only did Hough want to ascertain how much the mud 
amplified the shear waves in contrast with the more settled sediments nearby, 
she also wanted to see if the freeway resonated to those amplified waves. That 
is, she wanted to see whether, in an aftershock, the freeway's normal vibration 
pattern or frequency matched that of the amplified earthquake waves. If it did, 
the increased frequency would cause the freeway to shake harder and harder. 
</P>
<P>
While Hough was working around the collapsed freeway, dozens of others in 
Holzer's group were chasing Loma Prieta's shear waves elsewhere. Seismologist 
Paul Spudich headed a group placing seismographs along the tops, sides and 
bottoms of ridges in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The destruction had been 
incredible there -- houses twisted and thrown off their foundations, redwoods 
snapped in half. David Boore, another seismologist, was awaiting results -- 
gathered by hand from old-fashioned, non-computerized instruments -- from 
another type of seismograph called a strong-motion detector. Designed to record 
jolts that would knock other seismographs off the scale, more than 120 
detectors had been tucked into structures all over the Bay Area. When he 
obtained the records from each one, Boore would see the pattern of the strong 
jolts and how the various structures housing the instruments had responded. 
</P>
<P>
Geologist John Tinsley coordinated the search for liquefaction in the Monterey 
Bay area. On Friday, and every day for four weeks, he recruited a dozen people 
to hunt down telltale miniature gray "volcanoes" -- sand boils. Wet and loose 
sandy soils or fill not only amplify a shear wave, they also can be shaken so 
severely that they liquefy. Sand particles collapse into each other, lose the 
strength to support themselves and anything above them, and behave as if they 
were fluids. The sand boils form when water, squeezed from between collapsing 
sand particles, shoots to the surface, taking sand with it. Hundreds of sand 
boils erupted during the Loma Prieta earthquake -- between Oakland 
International Airport runways, at the Alameda Naval Air Station, at the east 
end of the Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge and in San Francisco's Marina 
District. 
</P>
<P>
In the Marina, another liquefaction team headed by geologist Tom Hanks found 
bits of tar paper and pieces of old glass -- ironically, detritus from the 1906 
quake that had been used for landfill -- that also spurted to the surface. In 
some cases, sand boils erupted with enough force to break through thin concrete 
floors of basements and fill them with sand. 
</P>
<P>
The liquefaction teams, once they found the sand boils, began taking aerial 
photos, measuring displacement, drilling for soil samples. They also placed 
seismographs to measure the aftershocks to determine how Loma Prieta had 
transformed terra firma into melting Jell-O. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a few more weeks before the engineering group slowed down enough to 
begin analyzing the data. But a few things were becoming clear. 
</P>
<P>
The assumptions they had made about the way soils would respond in a major 
quake had been confirmed, with some minor surprises centering on how vigorously 
the loose soils had shaken. What they were turning up now was enough data to 
help create more and better maps and to tweak their early conclusions on the 
way land around Loma Prieta responded when the San Andreas snapped. They were 
already telling the news media and state and county engineers a mild version of 
"I told you so." 
</P>
<P>
But there was still the matter of those cracks. A week after the quake, the 
fault-line search had petered out. There were simply no cracks that demarcated 
the rupture of the San Andreas Fault. Unlike every other major San Andreas 
quake ever studied, there was no place where you could stand on one side of the 
fault line and see displacement on the other side. What emerged indicated a new 
phenomenon. Although many of the cracks were landslide cracks indicating 
shifting topsoil commonly seen in any earthquake, others were inexplicable. The 
geologists were stumped. 
</P>
<P>
At first Dan Ponti and his team of researchers theorized that the cracks 
outlined huge blocks of ground that had rotated during the temblor. Later, they 
proposed that perhaps the mountain ridges were spreading the way a loaf of 
French bread splits in the oven. 
</P>
<P>
Although they expected landslide cracks from shifting topsoil and rifts where a 
fault ruptures to the surface, they didn't expect such dangerous fissures -- 3 
feet wide and 10 feet deep. Nor did the researchers expect to see them so far 
away from the fault line. Whatever the mechanics and the ultimate meaning of 
the cracks, it looked as if they had discovered a new effect of earthquakes, 
and a new hazard as well. 
</P>
<P>
WHILE THE engineering team measured cracks and set out seismographs Friday, a 
jubilant Andy Michael, parked once again in front of a blinking computer 
screen, cheered silently. There was no doubt about it. The data were clean. 
Something new had occurred on the San Andreas Fault, and he was part of the 
team that discovered it. 
</P>
<P>
What he was looking at was massaged data from a network of seismographs all 
over the area that painted a cross-section of the aftershocks. On his screen, 
the aftershocks appeared as a smattering of tiny octagonal dots whose diameters 
increased with magnitude. The pattern showed plainly that the earth didn't 
rupture along a neat vertical slice of the San Andreas as expected. Instead, 
the dots showed a fault plane that tilted at a 70-degree angle. The Pacific 
Plate, as it had moved north, pushed up and over the North American on that 
angle; "it shows thrust," Michael said. This segment was an oblique fault -- a 
combination of strike-slip and thrust faulting -- something unheard of on the 
San Andreas before the Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
An angled San Andreas Fault plane also would explain the unexpected location of 
the epicenter. Most of the San Andreas is like a vertical wall plunging miles 
beneath the surface of the earth. Earthquakes begin to rupture somewhere along 
the bottom of that imaginary wall. That rupture point, the hypocenter, is 
usually found directly below the epicenter. In fact, before Loma Prieta, the 
hypocenters of San Andreas Fault earthquakes were always located directly below 
the epicenters. But Loma Prieta's epicenter was 4 miles from where the top of 
the San Andreas wall ran through the Santa Cruz Mountains. That meant that the 
wall in this case was tilted, as if the Pacific Plate was leaning against the 
North American. And when seismologists drew a straight line from the hypocenter 
to the surface, the epicenter was 4 miles away from the top of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Creating a detailed picture of what happened on the Loma Prieta segment of the 
San Andreas Fault was what the seismology branch was all about. The puzzle 
pieces these scientists were looking for were location (epicenter and 
hypocenter), length of rupture, magnitude and the mechanics of the faulting 
itself. Like the seismologists in the engineering group, they relied on 
seismographs to provide them with wave data to analyze the earthquake. But 
unlike the engineering group, their seismographs recorded only the primary 
waves -- the first clean shivers that look so familiar when they're depicted as 
jagged lines on a rolling drum of paper. 
</P>
<P>
Today, those drums are old technology, and seismologists refer to them only 
occasionally. Computers, with their ability to crunch massive amounts of data 
quickly, collect and process the seismic data now. 
</P>
<P>
In the basement of the USGS complex, about 100 technicians maintain the 
seismology branch computers. They are hooked to a network of about 500 
seismographs at 400 California sites. When Loma Prieta struck, the computers 
automatically began processing the stream of data to change the bytes into dots 
on the computer screen. The biggest dot was the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
Location is one of the first things the seismologists look to the computers to 
discover. They used to calculate it off the printed jagged lines of the primary 
and shear waves, using a formula developed in the 1890s. It's so simple that it 
can be computed in your head, as long as you live far enough away from the 
epicenter to feel the primary waves and the stronger shear waves separately. 
(Close to the epicenter, the waves erupt right on top of each other and feel 
like a jumble of violent tossing and turning.) All you have to do is multiply 
the seconds between the first shake and the second by five. During the Loma 
Prieta quake, a Sacramento resident, for example, could have multiplied the 20 
seconds between the first jolt and the second by five and come up with an 
epicenter that was about 100 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
At Menlo Park, only 30 miles from the epicenter, so few seconds lapsed between 
the first rumble and the second, that the researchers in the seismology branch 
barely had time to crawl under their desks to avoid flying books and bookcases. 
They raced to the computer room seconds later when they discovered that the 
quake had knocked out their personal computers. Although backup power kept most 
of the main computers in the basement running, the quake had also cut off about 
20 seismographs near the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason they believed their initial data was suspect, Michael said. 
That first night, he and his colleagues in the seismology group, who were 
accustomed to working on mostly self-assigned projects in their own offices, 
were thrown together in the basement computer room, watching dot patterns of 
aftershocks till dawn. 
</P>
<P>
David Oppenheimer, a seismologist who specializes in calculating probabilities 
of earthquakes, watched with some concern the computerized pictures of the 
aftershocks creeping up the San Andreas Fault toward the San Francisco 
Peninsula. For a while, he and the others thought another big earthquake might 
be getting ready to occur. 
</P>
<P>
They determined later that they used 38 seismographic stations to arrive at the 
location of Loma Prieta. They relied on 267 to figure out the focal mechanism 
-- exactly how the earth moved. But because their instruments were too 
sensitive to record the enormous impulses coming from such a large quake, they 
let the USGS National Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo., 
determine the magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
The method of determining relative magnitudes of earthquakes was developed by 
seismologist Charles Richter in the 1920s. Richter's scale compared the size of 
the largest shear wave -- the highest crest on a seismogram -- and the distance 
from the epicenter the wave was recorded. His scale is logarithmic: Each 
increase of one in the rating indicates a tenfold increase in the amplitude of 
the seismic wave, and about a 32-fold increase in total energy released. 
</P>
<P>
The first Loma Prieta magnitude issued by the USGS seismologists in Golden was 
6.9, based on four seismographs in Alaska. For the next week, however, 
magnitudes poured into Golden from many of the 2,000 seismographic sites around 
the world, including those of the World Wide Standardized Seismograph Network 
the U.S. Department of Defense installed in the 1960s during the height of the 
Cold War to monitor Soviet underground nuclear tests. Since the earth's crust 
isn't uniform -- the speed and size of the earthquake waves vary at each 
station -- not every seismograph calculates the same magnitude. The USGS 
averaged hundreds of magnitudes, which ranged from 6.5 in Tahiti to 7.5 in 
Eastern Europe, and one week after the quake, revised the magnitude to 7.1. 
</P>
<P>
But the puzzle of Loma Prieta was missing one important piece: How close to the 
surface did it come? For most earthquakes of this size, it would have been easy 
to determine where the rupture ended because there would be a visible rift in 
the ground. But because scientists weren't finding any evidence of a surface 
break, Michael looked to the geodetic scientists in the USGS tectonophysics 
branch for the answer. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE THINK we have a great job," said geologist Karl Gross, 38, field 
operations manager for Will Prescott's group of global surveyors, the geodetic 
scientists. Gross, a former U.S. Marine who did embassy guard duty in the 
Middle East, spends most of his time now measuring the great outdoors to a 
tolerance of an eyelash. "They see us outside on top of mountains, in beautiful 
places with great views. Of course, they're not up here when there's 30 knots 
of wind and a temperature of 5 degrees." Or hunched over computers at 2 a.m. 
fitting the measurements into a model that explains what happened 12 miles 
under the earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
When the Loma Prieta earthquake hit, Gross and most of the other members of the 
Menlo Park geodetic group were measuring other parts of California in a 
continuing project to determine how the surface of the western United States is 
changing shape. After hurrying back to the Bay Area and checking on families 
and friends, the nine geodetic scientists and technicians began a schedule that 
could have been a study in sleep deprivation. They arose at 4 a.m. to drive to 
mountaintops as far as three hours away, took measurements until sunset, drove 
back to Menlo Park to rest, changed equipment, went back out at midnight for 
nine hours and returned to process data. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was to remeasure the distances from Loma Prieta to several other 
mountains in the San Francisco Bay and Monterey Bay areas. Placed on a map, the 
measurements look like a black spider web with Loma Prieta in the center. After 
gathering figures, with two types of instruments, on how much the earth had 
moved during the quake, the scientists would begin to monitor the smaller 
increments of post-quake creep. 
</P>
<P>
Geophysicist Mike Lisowski and physical science technician Gary Hamilton, 
bundled against the cold, dry air atop Loma Prieta, aimed a laser beam from a 
contraption called a geodolite toward Mt. Allison 26 miles away through holes 
they had cut long ago in a chain-link fence at a television station antenna 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We've measured this line every month for the last five years," said Lisowski, 
who gulped a bite of cold oatmeal as he waited for Gross to find the benchmark 
on the other mountaintop. The USGS or the National Geodetic Survey has been 
planting benchmarks -- round brass plates -- on virtually every prominent spot 
in the nation since the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Gross set up a panel of reflectors that looked like numerous car tail lights on 
a stiff board, radioed that he was in position and flashed a mirror against the 
sun to help Lisowski aim the laser. 
</P>
<P>
Lisowski peered through a telescopic sight on the side of the 100-pound white 
geodolite, which was perched on a tripod above the Loma Prieta benchmark. He 
made gentle adjustments until he could see a tiny red dot -- the laser beam's 
reflection -- on the far mountain. He looked in the sky and spoke into a 
walkie-talkie: "Tom, we're ready when you are." A Cessna 182 swooped overhead, 
banked and flew from the top of Loma Prieta toward the mountain where Gross, 
walkie-talkie in one hand, binoculars in the other, watched carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"The airplane flies along the laser path to measure the temperature and 
humidity," said the tall, hefty Hamilton. He munched on a bag of Corn Nuts. 
"There's a delay in the signal that's caused by the density of the atmosphere." 
They needed to know that delay to make accurate distance readings. 
</P>
<P>
Lisowski, binoculars to eyes, guided the plane as a computer recorded the time 
it took for the laser pulses to travel from Loma Prieta to the other mountain 
and back. "A little left. A little up. Looking good." Soon the plane was out of 
sight, and control passed to Gross. After the plane flew over Gross, it banked 
and flew back to Loma Prieta on a second pass. 
</P>
<P>
The work continued throughout the day as crews dragged reflectors to six sites, 
from Mt. Allison in the East Bay to a low hill in Watsonville. At one point, a 
woman with a benchmark on her property asked Gross how much her land had moved 
during the earthquake. Lisowski consulted his computer and radioed back: "Tell 
her she's 7 inches closer to Loma Prieta than she was two weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
At 2 the next morning, yellow and white lights glimmered brightly in the cold, 
windless air from San Jose to Oakland. The soft machine hum of civilization 
rose 2,659 feet to Mt. Allison, where geologist Jerry Svarc set up the latest 
in surveying equipment: a small, white satellite receiver -- "the conehead," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The receiver works with the U.S. Global Positioning Satellite System, which was 
designed as a military navigational aid. The essence of the system is that it 
can tell people instantly where they are on the planet, to within a couple of 
feet. With solar panels extended and plump bodies canted toward Earth, the 
satellites resemble 1,500-pound fruit flies the size of Volkswagen bugs. Svarc 
had to track four of them as they orbited 12,000 miles overhead, from 3 a.m. to 
9 a.m., continually broadcasting radio signals indicating the time and their 
location. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 a.m., Svarc's conehead picked up the satellites' signals and transmitted 
them to a computer in the back of a USGS truck. By pinpointing its position 
relative to all four satellites, the computer calculated where it was -- 
longitude, latitude and altitude. 
</P>
<P>
Once the computer locked into the satellites, Svarc sat in his truck and 
waited, under orders not to abandon the $150,000 equipment. Just before dawn, 
he watched car lights multiply on the freeways far below. This was the future. 
In the past few months, geodetic scientists have shown that the satellite 
system is in many ways as accurate as geodolites, and it doesn't require two 
teams in the mountains or clear days. The satellites can be used day or night 
in any weather. 
</P>
<P>
With the geodolite and global positioning system, Lisowski and Prescott took 
the data that they and the other geodetic scientists had collected and provided 
the missing piece of the puzzle: how far below the surface of the earth the 
earthquake stopped. They did this by working backward -- putting all the 
surface changes in a computer and determining which model of a rupture fit 
best. The answer they came up with was 3.7 miles. 
</P>
<P>
So, two weeks after the earthquake, the seismologists and geodetic scientists 
offered this description of the Loma Prieta earthquake: Eleven-and-a-half miles 
below the surface of the earth, a 25-mile-long segment of the Pacific Plate 
lumbered 6.2 feet north and pushed 4.3 feet up and over the North American 
Plate. Even though the rupture stopped 3.7 miles from the surface of the earth, 
the ground level uplifted as much as 14 inches and, in some spots, moved as 
much as 7 inches north. 
</P>
<P>
THE DECEMBER MEETING of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco was the 
place in 1989 for geologists, geophysicists, seismologists, volcanologists, 
meteorologists, physicists, oceanographers, hydrologists, geochemists and 
engineers to swap theories and data. The gathering was especially exciting 
because the earthquake scientists had a new temblor to show off: Loma Prieta. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen Loma Prieta scientists delivered 15-minute synopses of their 
observations to colleagues packed into San Francisco's Civic Auditorium. Andy 
Michael presented the seismology branch results. Will Prescott delivered the 
geodetic scientists' conclusions. David Boore discussed preliminary data from 
the engineering group. Sixty additional presentations were relegated to a 
packed afternoon "poster" session, where researchers tacked their papers to 
giant bulletin boards in a hangar-sized hall. Hundreds of scientists jammed the 
aisles to read about liquefaction, aftershock warning systems and the way 
helium in soil acted before the quake. Some scientists decorated their bulletin 
boards with photos, elaborate illustrations and bold headlines; others 
augmented their presentations with videotapes or slide shows. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Hough preferred the subtle approach. Among the paper and photos tacked to 
her bulletin board was a small plastic bag full of Bay mud. Her seismographs 
had indeed shown that aftershocks had shaken the fill over the Bay mud harder 
than the older, relatively solid sediments. It also looked as if the pancaked 
section of the freeway resonated to the amplified earthquake waves, and thus 
may have shaken even harder. 
</P>
<P>
Like all the information coming out from the engineering group's research, 
Hough's has a direct connection to life in the fault zone. She had already sent 
her findings to Caltrans, which had to decide how and if it would rebuild the 
collapsed freeway sections. "Last I heard, they were putting in a proposal for 
a single-deck freeway," Hough said with a sigh. "As a seismologist, I'd like to 
see them go in a little further onto stronger soils, but there are problems in 
displacing communities." 
</P>
<P>
The USGS liquefaction teams had their data posted in the hall, too: pictures of 
sand boils and slumped buildings, and preliminary maps pinpointing problem 
areas. "A sizable contingent of practicing engineers believes that once a 
(soil) deposit liquefies, it doesn't do it again," drawled John Tinsley. "We 
were eager to see if the same areas that (had problems in 1906) suffered 
liquefaction. We found that generally to be true." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Ponti stood around talking about cracks. The state, he said, may need to 
zone some areas for what should be considered an earthquake engineering hazard 
as serious as liquefaction and amplification. It was a hazard with a silver 
lining, though. There's pretty good evidence, he said, that the ground had 
cracked this way before, during previous earthquakes. That means, Ponti said, 
that by "trenching" the cracks -- conducting an archeological dig in the area 
-- geologists may be able to obtain a historical record of when and how other 
earthquakes had occurred. And that is one step in predicting the next one. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the question of prediction was a hot topic at the poster session. 
David Oppenheimer stood amid the billboards discussing probability studies. His 
own research into the effects of Loma Prieta on other segments of the San 
Andreas was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquake probabilities are based on the theory that the longer a segment of 
the San Andreas goes without an earthquake, the more likely it is to break and 
break big. There had been three forecasts -- prediction is too strong a word -- 
for the segment where Loma Prieta ruptured. They varied in probability from 30% 
to 47%, over 30 years, and in segment length, from 18 miles to 45 miles. They 
all agreed on the magnitude: 6.5. With the 7.1 temblor (six times larger than 
the forecasts), seismologists consider the chance of another quake in that area 
small. But what happens on the northern end of the segment? In the days 
following Loma Prieta, while Oppenheimer was watching aftershock patterns, he 
noticed a strong jolt under Daly City, on the next segment north from the Santa 
Cruz area. He began a new research project, arranging for more instruments to 
be placed on the peninsula segment. "Loma Prieta clearly loaded that section of 
the fault," he said. But when will an earthquake occur there? 
</P>
<P>
"Some models predict an earthquake in five years; some models say 50 years," 
Oppenheimer said. "It's really speculative stuff. We just don't understand the 
process." 
</P>
<P>
As the poster session drew to a close, Andy Michael looked forward to pursuing 
his science at a slower pace, perusing some of the 100,000 individual records 
of aftershocks. And he planned to finish the report he was writing when Loma 
Prieta hit -- an analysis of the Whittier Narrows earthquake in Los Angeles in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
The geodetics group was heading back into the field to finish its interrupted 
terrain measurements in Mammoth and the Tehachapi Mountains while it continues 
to monitor the Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Holzer and the USGS engineering seismologists and geologists planned to 
finish their analysis in San Francisco's Marina District and the Santa Cruz 
Mountains and present their reports to city and county officials early in the 
spring. Holzer anticipated some controversy. The earthquake threw the 
engineering group into the middle of discussions about whether residents in the 
mountains would be allowed to repair or rebuild their homes, and the Marina 
soils report promised to raise a political brouhaha as well. Many of the 
repairs to homes and underground gas and water pipes are just "quick fixes," 
said USGS structural engineer Mehmet Celebi. 
</P>
<P>
While the poster researchers packed up, dozens of scientists and engineers 
swapped business cards and arranged to obtain raw data from the instruments 
that had snared Loma Prieta's primary and secondary waves to do further 
research. Researchers would be studying the effects of Loma Prieta and 
producing scientific papers for years. 
</P>
<P>
"There are probably things about this earthquake that we'll never understand," 
Ponti said. "The Earth doesn't want to tell us all of its secrets. But that's 
the nature of the beast." 
</P>
<P>
LOMA PRIETA: WHAT HAPPENED. 
</P>
<P>
THE CAUSE 
</P>
<P>
The Loma Prieta quake was both a strike-slip, (horizontal) rupture and a thrust 
(vertical) rupture. Starting about 11.5 miles underground and extending to 
within 3.7 miles of the Earth's surface), an angled segment of the San Andreas 
fault broke as the Pacific Plate moved northwest in relation to the North 
American plate and thrust up and over it. The angled, thrust motion never 
before associated with the San Andreas, explains why the epicenter was miles 
off the San Andreas Fault line. At the surface, the ground was pushed up 14 
inches and north about 7 inches. At the rupture point or hypocenter, the Earth 
moved up about 4 feet and north about 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
THE EFFECTS 
</P>
<P>
Liquefaction and amplification which increase a quake's destructive power, 
occurred widely during the Loma Prieta quake. In San Francisco's Marina 
District, for instance, surface eruptions of liquefied deposits-sand boils-told 
the tale. Amplification contributed to the collapse of Oakland's Nimitz 
Freeway, which killed 42. Other physical effects included large cracks and 
landslides near the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
Liquefaction: When seismic waves hit loosely packed deposits that contain 
water, the waves increase in strength and cause the deposits to liquefy. 
Liquefied deposits can erupt in a sand boil. 
</P>
<P>
Amplification: When seismic waves hit loosly packed deposits-which have room to 
shake more intensely than compacted deposits-the waves increase in strength. 
</P>
<P>

These probabilities were calculated 18 months before the Loma Prieta quake hit. 
The quake fulfilled the forecast for Segment III; it also may have "loaded" 
Segment II, increasing the chances for a major earthquake there.

THESE ARE TREACHEROUS times. The men and women who attend the brainstorming 
session have taken a vow of secrecy. The printed agenda is for their eyes only. 
The results of the research project they've just completed will not be divulged 
outside this anonymous conference room, in one of the faceless office buildings 
that line Jefferson Boulevard in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At stake? The loyalty of the midscale American diner -- the customer who dines 
out but not up, who often reads the menu from right to left. Thanks to a weak 
economy and strong competitors, it's a pitched battle; there are not enough 
customers to go around. The nine people in this room work either for the 
Sizzler chain or for its advertising agency, BBDO. Their mission is to protect 
Sizzler's position as the most profitable player in the "casual dining room" 
segment of the market. 
</P>
<P>
With more than $845 million in sales in fiscal 1989, the 646-unit Sizzler chain 
is where middle America eats most of its restaurant meals: As many as 7,000 
people visit each one of the chain's 135 California outlets in any given week. 
But Sizzler's sales over the past eight months, along with the rest of the 
industry's, have eroded a bit as its core customers -- working singles and 
families in their 20s and early 30s -- have chosen to ease the economic pinch 
by eating cheaper or eating at home. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Minchin, executive vice president of Collins Foods (which runs Sizzler as 
well as 209 Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises on the West Coast), says that 
Sizzler's most formidable enemy in the past year was the adjustable-rate 
mortgage. When rates go up, people cut back. The weekday business-lunch crowd 
saves by eating at McDonald's or Jack in the Box, and the families who come in 
as a treat on the weekends opt for home cooking. As for the sudden 
proliferation of Souplantations and Soup Expresses, Minchin is used to a 
crowded field that includes Bob's Big Boy and Marie Callender's. "Anyone who 
puts food in somebody's stomach is keeping us from putting food in somebody's 
stomach," he says. 
</P>
<P>
To maintain its place at the head of the pack, Sizzler must make its food 
irresistible. The purpose of the meeting, one of the two major strategy 
sessions held each year, is to decide how best to tempt the American palate. 
Secrecy is essential: Today's good idea, seasoned with indiscretion, can become 
tomorrow's success for the competition. 
</P>
<P>
The gustatory conscience of the chain, 36-year-old Stacey James, sits at the 
head of the table. Her formal title is director of menu development, but, 
practically speaking, she is Sizzler's premier taste bud. A dish has to satisfy 
James to get out of the test kitchen, and she is not an easy mark. 
</P>
<P>
In a year's time, maybe 400 dishes will be suggested in a series of menu idea 
meetings. Most never get any further: Either they don't sound good, are too 
hard to prepare in volume or don't conform to the received wisdom, supported by 
extensive market research, that Sizzler should offer what BBDO account 
supervisor Jim Ward calls "good, substantial American food, similar to what you 
could do at home but with a twist that makes you want to go out and get it." 
</P>
<P>
James and Jim Scharf, director of field marketing, present the candidates that 
survive this meeting to Minchin, who decides which ones will run the gantlet of 
the product development process. Those that make it through James' in-house 
tastings, the focus groups and the test-market trial runs may win a place on 
the Sizzler menu, from which they can be unceremoniously yanked if they don't 
perform up to expectations. Only two or three of the year's candidates will 
make it onto the regular rotation of about 80 items. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the myth of Sisyphus," says James. "You push these rocks up the hill inch 
by inch, and a dish that makes it is one that rolled up to the top and stayed 
there instead of rolling back down." 
</P>
<P>
THE PROCESS BEGINS with the basic question: What do diners want? 
</P>
<P>
James' response is authoritative and enigmatic, as befits a woman who has spent 
the last five years attempting to define and satisfy desires. "It's this line," 
she says: "It's got to be new but familiar. It's got to be interesting but not 
off the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Huh? 
</P>
<P>
The experts she has called together -- Sizzler representatives from purchasing, 
advertising, marketing and the test kitchen, along with the three BBDO 
executives -- understand the challenge. The typically schizophrenic Sizzler 
customer talks cholesterol out of one side of his mouth while he pops a fried 
shrimp into the other. Minchin loves to tell the story of the Encino doctor -- 
"a heart specialist," he crows -- who explained that it was OK to eat a platter 
of fried food because he'd taken a run that morning. James may be the creator 
of Sizzler's lemon herb chicken, a good-for-you skinless number flavored with 
herbs, but she also knows her way around a corn fritter. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of Sizzler's sales come from its all-you-can-eat dishes -- the 
wildly successful salad bar and America's favorite crustaceous vice, the fried 
shrimp -- and steak. Twenty rcent of the customers are less addicted and more 
selective, which means they might get bored and choose another restaurant. No 
one, in either camp, is what you'd call daring. The goal is to keep the 
faithful shrimpers happy while finding new items to interest, but not 
intimidate, the pickier eaters. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, Sizzler customers want food that tastes good but may not be good 
for them, prepared in ways that will surprise but not shock them. In the 
geopolitics of food service, it's all a question of whether a dish is 
"pre-Melrose," "Melrose courant," or "post-Melrose." Pre-Melrose is so boring 
it doesn't even deserve to be discovered; Melrose of the moment is too 
avant-garde, and post-Melrose runs the risk of being passe even to people 
who've never ventured onto the street. The trick is to grab a recipe just as a 
newer food phenom nudges it aside, but before it becomes the bell-bottom blue 
jeans of popular cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Take a particular beef dish, one of the first items on the afternoon's agenda, 
which must go unnamed in the interest of national Sizzler security. Is it still 
hip? 
</P>
<P>
"I had it last night," Jim Scharf says. "That makes it hip." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, in terms of Melrose, it's no longer hip," says BBDO's Ward, who 
dutifully lunched at the Marina del Rey Sizzler on his way over and has alerted 
James to a "bad bun-to-tuna ratio" on his grilled sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on La Brea, not Melrose," Scharf says. 
</P>
<P>
"But La Brea is the new Melrose," says Robin Adams, who runs the Sizzler test 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," persists Ward, "we're pushing Southwestern, and that was over last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
But James thinks the dish is a trifle old, recommends rejecting it, and moves 
on to a complicated steak preparation she likes even less. 
</P>
<P>
The dish might work at what she calls a "white-tablecloth restaurant," but an 
assembly-line kitchen would mangle it. Her much-beloved "Sizzkabobs," skewers 
of steak, chicken and fish, met an untimely death three years ago because 
kitchen workers groused about how long it took to impale those chunks of 
protein. She gazes down the table, almost daring anyone to contradict her. No 
one does. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken with pesto sauce dies undefended. "Nice, but I remind you that it would 
be green," James says in a tone of voice that might be used to describe mildew. 
"Do Sizzler customers want to see something green?" Apparently not. The dish 
gets a B-minus. It will not be mentioned again. 
</P>
<P>
MOST MENU DEVELOPMENT executives (and all of Sizzler's competitors have them) 
are food technicians -- home economists or number crunchers. But Stacey James 
is the sensual exception, a "hands-on cook" who talks about food the way Erica 
Jong writes about sex. 
</P>
<P>
James' idea of a good time is to turn out a turkey dinner, complete with side 
dishes, for no reason except that she, her husband and son have to eat 
something for dinner. In this era of the quick culinary fix, she is one of the 
few people who can utter the words "I cooked for days" with a beatific smile. 
</P>
<P>
Like the heroine of E. M. Forster's "A Room With a View," James discovered the 
meaning of life during a sojourn in Florence, Italy. After studying art history 
at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in the early 1970s, she moved to 
Los Angeles and worked at Sotheby's auction house and a rare book dealer's. She 
was dabbling in cooking on the side when a friend told her his mother needed a 
cook at her villa outside Florence. 
</P>
<P>
"She hired me," recalls James, "because she had lots of guests all the time 
from other parts of Europe, and museum people, so she wanted someone who could 
cook these nice little dinner parties and impress people. 
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, during the day there was this old peasant woman who was the 
housekeeper who did all the cooking for the midday meal. She was 80 years old 
and had worked in that house for 50 years." James' saucer eyes grow to 
salad-plate size at the memory. "She was cooking very old-style stuff. It 
really changed the way I started thinking about food. When I came back, I 
pursued it. It just seemed like the way to eat." 
</P>
<P>
To eat, but not necessarily the way to live. James made pastries at Il Fornaio 
for a year, then spent another year as a sous-chef at Prego in Beverly Hills 
before the premium placed on uniformity started to get to her. "I was stuck in 
that restaurant mode where the goal is to make food taste exactly the way it 
tasted the night before," she says, "and I was in danger of burning out." She 
applied at a private club for a job that never materialized. A month later, she 
got a phone message asking her to send her resume to Sizzler headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a friend playing a joke," she recalls. It turned out to be 
Minchin, who belonged to the club where James had applied and had heard about 
her from the chef there. It wasn't the job she'd been looking for, but it did 
promise creative freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Sizzler, although a formula restaurant, was known for its flexibility. (The 
chain's profitability can be traced, James believes, to a "repositioning" in 
the early 1980s that recast Sizzler the Family Steak House as Sizzler -- Steak, 
Salad, Seafood.) There was a certain corporate devotion to inventive ideas, and 
uniformity would be somebody else's worry. 
</P>
<P>
James decided to find out if her notion of good food would trickle down to the 
mass market. 
</P>
<P>
IT WASN'T LONG before she started having shrimp nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
Shrimp is coin of the realm for the mainstream dining public because it is a 
food that has the magical effect of making people feel special. It has an 
upscale gestalt. "Shrimp is extremely popular," James says. "I am called upon 
to develop shrimp endlessly." 
</P>
<P>
She has constant shrimp anxiety. Can she come up with a recipe? Is there any 
ethnicity that Sizzler has yet to exploit? 
</P>
<P>
Given the volume she's dealing with, a mistake can be devastating. A single 
four-week special promotion of a three-shrimp platter -- planned for March and 
limited to Southern California -- will require 280,000 pounds of tiny cocktail 
shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
And there's never any guarantee, even on what would seem to be a low-risk 
venture. The American Sampler introduced last year looked like a shoo-in, since 
it combined fried shrimp, Cajun popcorn shrimp and New England-style boiled 
shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, no one considered the gap between East Coast work ethic and West 
Coast pleasure principle. The boiled shrimp were served in the shell, as is 
traditional in the land where people are used to overcoming nature's hardships. 
But sybaritic Californians, whose greatest climatic challenge is to remember 
how to turn on the car windshield wipers, let it be known that they preferred 
their shrimp undressed. 
</P>
<P>
"People here do not like to have to peel their own shrimp," James says glumly. 
"They just said: 'Phooey. We don't want to have to do this.' " The dish didn't 
last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, though, the development process ensures the success of the end 
product, and disappointments can be salvaged. James recently introduced her 
latest sea baby, a grilled barbecued shrimp with a sauce she invented that was 
"very smoky and mesquite-y with bacon in it and everything." 
</P>
<P>
The pre-release response was a dream, James says. "Everybody -- unanimously -- 
in all three focus groups, said, 'We love this; where can we buy it?' " 
</P>
<P>
The post-release response was deadly. "It didn't do anything," says James. "The 
name just wasn't describing what it was. Pacific-Style Barbecued Shrimp. What's 
that?" James pressed for a new marketing plan. The dish was renamed Mesquite 
Shrimp, slapped on a Southwestern Grill platter with steak and Santa Fe chicken 
and turned into a hit. 
</P>
<P>
THE BALDWIN HILLS SIZZLER, a new 226-seat pastel prototype for Sizzlers to 
come, is one of James' laboratories, an outlet she uses to try out new 
products. This Sizzler features a grand experiment -- the Buffet Court, a maze 
of all-you-can-eat offerings designed to keep the chain's more fickle customers 
coming back. The salad and tostada bar is still the centerpiece, but it's 
surrounded by a dessert bar, a hot appetizer bar and a pizza and pasta bar. 
</P>
<P>
James is particularly proud of the pizza. She couldn't serve "what in Italy is 
considered a nighttime pizza" -- a delicate, thin-crusted version -- because 
"it would be limp after five minutes on the steam table." She wanted to serve 
"an Italian daytime pizza, the kind with the thick crust that people in Italy 
buy at room temperature," but she knew Americans wouldn't pay good money for 
cold pizza. With a supplier, she worked up "a homemade-looking product" with a 
chewy crust that can stand up to sitting around, and the response in Baldwin 
Hills has been "terrific." 
</P>
<P>
She knows firsthand: Focus groups are nice, and sales figures are the bible, 
but James regularly visits Sizzlers around the country to make sure a dish 
isn't dying of sloppy execution. She and her co-workers can launch a grilled 
tuna sandwich with confidence at a few select Sizzlers. But let one employee 
start serving broiled tuna that lacks those attractive grill marks, and the 
dish can fail, unless someone who knows right from wrong sees the goof in time. 
And James can't afford to let a good idea succumb. 
</P>
<P>
"I always keep thinking that it's going to get easier next month," she says. 
"But it doesn't. I can show you a list of new products I've come up with, but 
OK, after those are out, then what are we going to do? What about next year? 
You always have to be thinking way out there. It never ends." 
</P>
<P>
AS THE MEETING drags on, and the M &amp; Ms James supplies to jump-start the 
collective imagination disappear, as a debate about a stuffed chicken breast 
deteriorates into jokes about topless chicken, James reaches beyond Sizzler's 
standard vocabulary for an idea. The group has already rejected duck, served 
any way at all, as too weird. But how about turkey? 
</P>
<P>
"The turkey people have been knocking down my door," she ventures, hope in her 
voice, perhaps thinking about the nice job she did on that turkey at home the 
week before. The news is greeted with a collective groan. 
</P>
<P>
She perseveres. How about smoked turkey, which has everything going for it? 
It's new, it's fashionable but not cutting-edge, and it's healthful. 
</P>
<P>
The groans only get louder. 
</P>
<P>
"If blackened food is post-Melrose, then turkey is still pre-Melrose," says Jim 
Ward. "I think we've got to wait until it gets over that hill." 
</P>
<P>
The group settles on a less controversial topic. Perhaps there's something they 
haven't tried with -- you know -- a shrimp.

OLD ROSES ON THE RISE; 
</P>
<P>
THEY GROW ALONGSIDE OTHER FLOWERS IN THIS PASADENA COTTAGE GARDEN, BUT THEY ARE 
DEFINITELY IN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
DAY-TO-DAY life is orderly; the garden shouldn't be," says Alan Mittelstaedt, a 
Pasadena gardener who favors the casual, even disorderly look of a cottage 
garden to more formal plans -- and who prefers the rumpled look of an old rose 
to the just-pressed look of a modern hybrid tea. Mittelstaedt has filled the 
yard of his 1920s cottage with more than 50 cultivars of roses, about 
two-thirds of them antique varieties, some centuries old. "I love the special 
fragrance of the old roses, especially the musks and rugosas," he says. And he 
appreciates their informal flowers, casual arrays of petals that are far 
different from modern hybrid tea roses, which he describes as "arrogant plants 
with their picture-perfect flowers. Some aren't even fragrant," he says 
indignantly. "How could anyone breed a rose that is not fragrant?" 
</P>
<P>
Old roses are on the rise. Several specialty nurseries now carry them in 
Southern California, and in the new Wayside Gardens Rose Catalog (Hodges, S.C. 
29695-0001), old roses are listed before new roses -- hybrid teas are at the 
very back of the book -- a sign of changing times for roses. 
</P>
<P>
In front of the Mittelstaedt cottage is a classic cottage garden, which, by 
definition, is a casual mix of flowers. "I've tried to make the garden look as 
far from manicured as possible," says Mittelstaedt. "It should be as natural as 
it can be." 
</P>
<P>
To ensure the absence of straight lines, he laid out the large planting areas 
with a garden hose, letting its curves determine the outline of the beds. 
Inside the outline, he dug out the existing St. Augustine lawn and generously 
amended the soil with bags of redwood compost to give the roses a good start. 
Mittelstaedt soon found that even those beds were not big enough. 
</P>
<P>
In California's mild climate, most old roses grow much larger than they do 
elsewhere. "The catalogue said that 'Souv. de la Malmaison' would grow to 3 or 
4 feet. But mine was soon over 8. Four-foot roses such as 'Boule de Neige' grew 
to 12 feet." Mittelstaedt's remedy for exuberant growth was to train the 
tallest roses like giant blackberries, on rustic but sturdy trellises made of 
8-foot poles, 3 inches in diameter. More of the same poles were used to make 
crosspieces, to which and the roses are tied. The roses growing on these posts 
are mostly Bourbons (such as 'Souv. de la Malmaison,' developed in 1843) and 
Hybrid Perpetuals (such as 'Frau Karl Druschki,' a 1901 German rose). Every few 
years, he cuts off, in a casual manner, the top 2 or 3 feet. Otherwise, he does 
little to the old roses. (The modern roses get a once-a-year pruning.) 
</P>
<P>
Old roses are not pest- or disease-free, though many gardeners erroneously 
reason that if the plants lasted this long, they must not be susceptible. "I 
almost took out 'Deuil de Paul Fontaine' (moss rose, 1873) because it had black 
spot all year long," Mittelstaedt says. "It also flowered all year long, so I 
figured if he could live with it, so could I." 
</P>
<P>
Another venerable rose myth is that they only flower once, in the spring. 
That's true with a few, but in the Mittelstaedt garden most roses flower off 
and on all year long. " 'Mme. Hardy' (white Damask, 1832) and 'Rosa Mundi' (a 
red-striped Gallica of unknown but ancient age) are the only two that bloom but 
once in spring that I know of, but then 'Boule de Neige' (a Bourbon from 1867, 
pure white, strong fragrance) blooms all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Mittelstaedt started with 20 favorite roses, and he now grows more than 40 
roses in the front garden, another dozen in back. Rugosas outnumber the rest -- 
Peter Beales' book "Classic Roses" describes them as "able to grow almost 
anywhere without mollycoddling, and (will) provide flowers throughout the 
summer." 
</P>
<P>
However, Mittelstaedt still has a long way to go to catch up with his father's 
collection. "My father was a Lutheran minister, and there was a great deal of 
land behind the parsonage in Tujunga where he grew three or four hundred 
roses," Mittelstaedt recalls. "Most of these came from his friend, John H. van 
Barneveld, who would show up in the middle of the night with a station wagon 
full of roses that hadn't sold well." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the leftovers he brought were old roses, which in the 1950s -- the 
golden age of the modern hybrid tea -- were under-appreciated. Van Barneveld 
was one of the first to grow old roses commercially in California, and he 
listed several hundred in his 1955 California Roses catalogue under the heading 
"Roses of Yesterday but of Great Value Today." 
</P>
<P>
Growers again agree with Van Barneveld's assessment. His nursery is gone, but 
gardeners intrigued by the imperfect blooms and sweet scents of old roses can 
find them at places such as Sassafras in Topanga, Limberlost in Van Nuys, 
Burkards in Pasadena and Country Bloomers in Orange.

BALZER ON WINE: THE GREAT SOIL DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Lawrence Balzer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE LOCATION OF A VINEYARD is of basic importance in wine making. Different 
soils give different tastes to the wines, which echo the regions of their 
birth, the places where the grapes were grown. Climate is also important, but 
wine makers don't agree on whether it is the soil in which the grapes are grown 
or the regional climate of the area that accounts for a wine's excellence or 
distinctive characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
The ubiquitous explanation for the excellence of any French wine is its gout de 
terroir, an idiomatic expression that defies translation. Literally, it means 
taste of the earth. Jean-Paul Gardere, manager of First Growth Chateau Latour, 
asked to explain the excellence of his Cabernet, responds: "It is the soil, the 
soil, and, finally, the soil." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Monterey wine maker Bill Jekel took issue with the French soil theory 
in a Decanter magazine article. Jekel said that "soil components, themselves, 
do not, as often inferred by the French phrase gout de terroir, contribute 
identifiable flavors to the wine." Bruno Prats, owner of the celebrated St. 
Estephe claret Cos D'Estournel in Bordeaux, who was touring the United States 
at the time, responded by giving an elaborate definition of the phrase. Gout de 
terroir, he said, encompasses sun, slope climate and exposure to the elements. 
Jekel apparently was not aware of this broad definition. At one time, the 
semantic quarrel blew into a full-scale public debate before the Hollywood Wine 
Society. The argument is still not resolved, but Jekel is conducting an 
experiment to determine who is correct. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, on a visit to Jekel Vineyards, I toured the winery with wine 
maker Steve Passagno. As I was leaving the fermentation hall, my attention was 
caught by an unusual rack holding nine 5-gallon glass jugs, technically known 
as carboys, topped with gas-locks to allow carbon dioxide to escape but not 
allowing air to enter. "What's this?" I asked. Passagno explained that it was 
an experiment that went back to the 1983 Jekel-Prats debate. Each of the jugs 
was filled with a 1989 Monterey County Chardonnay, fermented in stainless 
steel. But to each jug was added pulverized soil, 5 grams per liter, from one 
of 10 locations -- the Rutherford Bench and nine vineyards: Martha's Vineyard, 
Stag's Leap Vineyard, Oakville, Far Niente, Yolo County, Sierra Foothills, 
Santa Clara Valley, Jekel's Monterey Gravelstone Vineyard and Jekel's Monterey 
Sanctuary Vineyard. The last-named jug had broken, so only nine remained. I was 
not permitted to taste the contents, but Passagno told me that each had "a very 
different and unique taste." 
</P>
<P>
At lunch, Jekel told me that he now understands the full French meaning of gout 
de terroir. But lingering doubts about the soil and its role in defining a wine 
prompted him to conduct the test. It so happens that when fermentation tanks 
are drained, in the sludge at the bottom is always a measure of silt, 
microscopically fine earth from the vineyard. The presence of soil that late in 
the wine-making process implies that soil could well be an important factor. 
Jekel's experiment so far does nothing to disprove that likelihood. Robert

PACK RAT HEAVEN

IN THE MARKET for hundreds of 1960s-era baby dolls with glass eyes and 
synthetic, haylike hair? How about chalky slabs of fossil-imbedded Texas 
limestone, speckled bowling balls or slabs of pink alabaster? You'll find all 
of this and more at Ventura's Art City, one of the West Coast's largest 
sculpture-supply businesses -- and certainly its most surreal. 
</P>
<P>
The brainchild of Ventura sculptor Paul Lindhard, Art City is also a working 
studio where sculptors from all over come seeking inspiration and a recharging 
of their creative batteries. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the place looks like the result of a pack rat run amok. But 
somehow there's a Zenlike order about the place; the jumbled rocks, the metal 
objects, the driftwood and the cacti take on the serenity of a Japanese garden. 
</P>
<P>
A born scavenger, Lindhard collects Mexican onyx and California marble from 
desert quarries, and avocado and cypress wood from abandoned orchards. But keep 
a lookout for the metal coils, old tires and red-vinyl booths -- all industrial 
artifacts from Ventura dumpsters. 
</P>
<P>
"I like creating order out of chaos," Lindhard says. "I think of the whole 
place as theater."

MAKE MINE MEISSEN

<TEXT>
<P>
ONE OF THE EARLIEST, and arguably the finest, hard-paste porcelains was 
produced in China as early as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 to 906). Made of kaolin, 
a fine white clay mixed with feldspar, it was fired at high temperature. And 
the ingredients fused to make the hard, white non-porous pottery that was 
sought after far and wide. Export porcelain from China was enormously popular 
in the West, and by the 18th Century, Europeans were importing a million pieces 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
It took a long time for European manufacturers to learn the secret of making 
hard-paste porcelain. A viable formula was developed in 1709 by J. F. Bottger 
and others in Meissen, a small town outside Dresden in Saxony (now part of East 
Germany). And soon after, the first true porcelain factory in the Western World 
was established by one Frederick Augustus, elector of Saxony. Production began 
in 1713. 
</P>
<P>
Meissen porcelain compared favorably with Chinese models, both from a technical 
and an artistic point of view. The first designs were close to the Chinese in 
inspiration, although after the 1720s, a form of German rococo became popular. 
By then, Meissen perfected the characteristic brilliant-white paste, enamel 
colors and graceful styles on which the factory's reputation rests today. 
Painted decoration was derived from many sources: from Japanese enameled 
pottery, for example, and from Chinese famille verte porcelain. To these were 
added innumerable European scenes -- landscapes, harbors and groups of urban 
and rural figures, often set in panels on colored grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Meissen's famous crossed-blue-swords logo was known and respected 
around the world. The firm's most talented sculptor and designer, J. J. 
Kandler, virtually created the European porcelain figure. Among the most 
popular pieces produced were the models of children and mythological characters 
made between 1860 and 1890 and the models of soldiers that appeared after 1870. 
Designs from the 18th Century continued to be produced, and to this day remain 
in vogue. 
</P>
<P>
For today's collector, Meissen work is generally scarce and expensive. But 
because such a wide variety of artifacts was produced -- baskets, plates, 
bowls, tea caddies, candlesticks, figurines, scent bottles, snuff boxes, dinner 
services, tureens, vases and more -- bargains occasionally appear. Examples 
from recent auctions include: a cane handle, circa 1743 ($9,000), a teapot and 
cover, circa 1725 ($9,000), a figure of a jay ($17,500) and a figure of a 
rhinoceros ($2,300), both modeled by Kandler, circa 1745, and a circular snuff 
box with a solid-gilt interior, circa 1770 ($27,500). 
</P>

Robert Stewart Reed, (213) 657-3644, in Los Angeles; Speidel Antiques, Pacific

THE BEST TABLES IN TOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
ALL OUR TABLES are "good" tables, promise those who take restaurant 
reservations. But don't believe it. At Spago, for instance, the rich and famous 
knowingly scramble for the front-window seats. 
</P>
<P>
At Citrus, the coveted tables are the ones near the glass doors at the 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
For those of us who have more ambition than fame, we begged maitre d's from 
such hot L.A. restaurants as The Bistro, Citrus, MaBe and Spago to share their 
secrets for getting a good table. 
</P>
<P>
Their tips: 
</P>
<P>
Dine on a Tuesday or Wednesday instead of a busy weekend evening. 
</P>
<P>
Make reservations and arrive on time. If you want a particular table or 
location, ask for it when making the reservation, not after arriving. 
</P>
<P>
Be a repeat customer. 
</P>
<P>
Never offer the maitre d' money for a table. They all said that. Honest. JUDITH

'SNOWFLAKED' CERAMICS

<TEXT>
<P>
THE CRYSTALS IN Philip Freeman's crystalline ceramic glazes are reminiscent of 
snowflakes on a moist woolen glove -- crisp, perfect and unique in this world. 
In fact, customers have refused him commissions when they discovered it wasn't 
possible for him to produce two identical pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman's technique hails from ancient China. A single coat of glaze is fired 
to a peak temperature of cone 10 (2,350 degrees), and crystals start to form 
much as frost forms on a windowpane. All the color is then pulled into the 
crystal, leaving a lesser strength of color in the background and creating a 
multicolor effect. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman achieved one of the highest scores at last summer's Laguna Arts 
Festival, but he wasn't exactly a long shot. The semiretired Saddleback College 
sculpture and ceramics teacher has participated in the festival for the past 33 
years. He primarily throws vases and bowls, though he does produce an 
occasional sculptural piece such as marvelously realistic-looking Japanese koi, 
which are glazed to mimic the flash of colors caused by the carp slipping 
through the water. Freeman's koi are expensive treasures: $3,000 for each 
22-inch sculpture. His small plates, bowls and trivets start at $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Freeman works out of his home studio in Dana Point, (714) 496-1488.

INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT DEFENSE FIRMS, LET'S REBUILD OUR TATTERED 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If ever a writer was guilty of ignoring the forest for the trees, Jon B. Kutler 
must stand convicted ("Downsizing America's Defense Industry," Jan. 21). Kutler 
argues that with the prospect of a shrinking defense budget, aerospace 
corporations should consider ways to "consolidate" their research and 
production efforts with each other. 
</P>
<P>
He bemoans the fact that the Reagan Administration did not encourage this 
trend, and now the defense industry will find itself shut out in the face of 
the new social and economic realities of a world moving toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
If that is indeed the case, the issue is not how to "downsize" the defense 
industry, but how to recycle the billions of tax dollars wasted on destructive 
weapons into productive, politically responsible spending on social needs. 
</P>
<P>
Military spending has made a serious casualty of domestic social and structural 
needs. While the weapons makers were busily experimenting with their new 
formulas and destructive toys, the nation's infrastructure was going to pot; 
schools, hospitals, libraries, highways, bridges and transportation systems 
were decaying. The industrial work force was rapidly shrinking as $18-an-hour 
auto and steel workers suddenly found themselves competing for lower-wage 
service and fast-food jobs. This in turn spawned a wide array of social 
problems from drugs and crime to illiteracy that plague us today. 
</P>
<P>
With the window of peace opening wider each day, the defense industry has a 
golden opportunity to channel at least a portion of its prodigious technical 
skills and resources toward reconstruction of our nation's social institutions 
rather than destruction of mythical enemies.

ALICE KAHN: THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF YUPPIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They've died a thousand times and still they are with us. So the time has come 
once again to ask: Whither the yuppies? 
</P>
<P>
It was in early 1983 that I discovered the first North American yuppies: Dirk 
Miller and Bree Wellington. I found them wandering lost in the parking lot of 
Bay Gauche, a rambling condominium complex. They had misplaced their Beamer and 
were exploring what that meant to their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks ahead, I will be speaking to them again and seeing where they have 
been, where they are going and who they think they are now. This, part of a 
special series: Yuppies in the '90s -- Has the Dream Become a Nightmare or 
What? 
</P>
<P>
They are no longer young. They are no longer urban. And they have changed 
companies at least twice in the past five years. They care more about fighting 
drugs than finding them. They give less to the homeless. But they do care about 
the planet. 
</P>
<P>
They've changed but they still possess a certain quality that I will call 
yuppitude, a combination of style and attitude. I can call it that because I 
made these people up and I can break them. 
</P>
<P>
Every year since those yuppies crawled out of their condo and into our lives, 
the press has been reporting their demise. But rumors of their death seem to be 
greatly exaggerated -- mainly by their cohorts. The fall of the house of yuppie 
represents a yuppie death wish on the part of peers unable to enter the crowded 
job, first-home buyer and produce market. 
</P>
<P>
I offer as evidence of the unstoppable life force of the yuppie movement a 
yuppie sighting in Tijuana, Mexico. It is a town not normally associated with 
upscale movements. But there in a children's shoe store, I found a poster with 
large Day-Glo pink letters. It said: Yuppies Estan Super! Translation: Yuppies 
Are Great! 
</P>
<P>
It turns out "Yuppies" is the brand name of a line of children's shoes made in 
Mexico. Yuppies are little penny loafers, wing tips and black pumps. These are 
shown in the poster along with a photo of Los Yuppadores -- children dressed in 
stylish clothes and dancing in a disco. The music is supplied by a rock band 
composed of other stylish children playing an electric guitar, electric 
keyboard and drums. On the big drum is the name of the group: The Yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
The message for our yuppitos to the South seems to be: If you want to be cool, 
wear these little leather business shoes and get out there and part-tee. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? What parent doesn't want to see her child get ahead? What Third 
World parent wouldn't be proud to see his child go from poverty to luxury? 
</P>
<P>
Only in Los Estados Unidos would we dare criticize the sin of ambition -- the 
quality yuppies have been mercilessly teased about. 
</P>
<P>
We want poor folks to have ambition. That's our beef with the homeless. But we 
laugh at ambition in the middle class, because getting ahead in a world of 
plenty -- plenty of cars, VCRs, salad bars -- seems to mean just keeping up 
with the latest fads. 
</P>
<P>
So the yuppies of the '80s must get a make-over in the '90s. As fad hags, they 
know they've had it. Yuppies are sick of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
How do I know? 
</P>
<P>
Hey, cultural promiscuity is my life. 
</P>
<P>
Next: Keeping up with Dirk and Bree: an exclusive interview.

ERMA BOMBECK: DREAM HOUSE CAN IRON OUT HASSLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Family Circle magazine recently surveyed 22 million female readers to find out 
what features they wanted most in a dream house. Their ideas are incorporated 
in a house being built in suburban Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the things the women suggested, I held out for in a home we built seven 
years ago. Our utility room is not off the kitchen; it's near the bedrooms so I 
can "dunk shot" my sheets into the washer. There is a walk-in pantry where you 
walk in at your own risk, but my kitchen looks great. No doors cover my 
cabinets. I always felt like a game contestant standing in front of my old 
ones, wondering which door held the brown sugar and which one the ant traps. 
</P>
<P>
There are no draperies in the house and no shower curtains. All I ever did 
anyway was to cut off the mildew periodically until all I had was a valance. 
</P>
<P>
My ironing board is attached to the wall of the utility room and is up all the 
time. This way I can tell people, "I'd take my ironing board down, but it's 
attached to the wall." 
</P>
<P>
I had a greenhouse window installed in the kitchen for "sick" plants that need 
TLC and more sun. It holds every live plant in the house. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like an enchanted cottage, doesn't it? Wrong! 
</P>
<P>
Given a second chance, I'd make a lot of major changes. I don't mean just the 
doggie door we cut through an eight-inch wall and the dog ran away from home. I 
mean more technology. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen table would go. In its place I'd have a trough centered over a 
drain that you would just hose down between meals. 
</P>
<P>
I'd install a conveyor belt from the garage to the pantry so I'd never again 
have to make eight trips on grocery day. 
</P>
<P>
There would be a timer in the bathroom; at the end of an hour, the water would 
shut off, the lights, blow dryers and curling irons would go dead, and the door 
would swing open. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't worked out all the bugs on this one, but I'd like a chute off the 
utility room for hand-washables. Anything left in the chute for three years 
would drop into a compost, and when broken down with a chemical, would turn 
into mulch for roses. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with most homes is that men design them and women clean them. I'll 
never forget the first time I visited Monticello, the Virginia home of Thomas 
Jefferson. The greatest statesman of all time, who had one of the most creative 
minds in the world, was a do-it-your-selfer. He introduced bunk beds to America 
(did God give us orangutan arms?), a dumbwaiter for wine (the food came from a 
kitchen a mile away), and just inside the hallway, he built a clock that 
measured time by a weight that went down the other side of the door. There is a 
hole in the floor because he misjudged the minutes. 
</P>
<P>
I'm years ahead of my time.

ON VIEW: CELEBRATING THE GASTRONOMIC LIFE

<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Hennessy always comes up with an opener for the Confrerie des Chevaliers 
du Tastevin white-tie dinner. This year, le grand senechal said, "Bless this 
dinner in which we share a delectable cuisine beyond compare." He also 
implored, "May the bubbles, the whites and burgundy reds enliven our hearts, 
not lighten our heads." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Magnin, owner of Ralph Lauren in Beverly Hills, chaired the festivities 
at the Beverly Wilshire, home of the late hotelier Hernando Courtright, a 
Chevaliers founder. Before dinner, Magnin and William L. Martin II (l'officier 
cellier of Chevaliers) inspected the wines to be served. Grand Connetable 
Louis-Marc Chevignard flew in from France for the occasion to oversee with 
Thomas W. Trainer (la commanderie d'Amerique) and John H. Hadley and Hubert F. 
Laugharn Jr. (la sous commanderie le Los Angeles) the grand inductions of les 
candidats Robert C. Boffa, Lee Danielson, Peter J. Doumani, Clifford A. Miller, 
Peter W. Mullin and Nelson C. Rising. They swore "to lead a good gastronomic 
life." 
</P>
<P>
For the night, cares were shrugged off in favor of the grape vine. Having a 
jolly time in La-La Land were many, including Hadley and his wife Barbara, 
honored for 33 years of leadership in the group. Cheering him -- Roger and 
Billie Converse, Z. Wayne and Cynthia Griffin (down from Sun Valley) and 
Chevaliers Jon Masterson, John Maher, Henry Singleton, Donald Crowell, Stephen 
Griffith, Desmond Hinds and Daniel Ridder. 
</P>
<P>
MILE HIGH: Bill Shoemaker stood a mile high for the tributes Santa Anita Park 
bestowed the night before "The Legend's Last Ride." Santa Anita chairman Robert 
Strub called the evening "a once-in-a-lifetime occasion" and spent a pretty 
penny to honor the Shoe. 
</P>
<P>
What made it nice were all the tender kisses wife Cindy bestowed on her husband 
and the quips from Amanda, their 9-year-old daughter, who was one of the stars 
on the Ralph Edwards' "This Is Your Life" production put on at the affair for 
Shoemaker. Amanda appeared on stage in racing colors and broke up the audience 
when she commented, "When my mother and I go shopping for my dad, she always 
tells them he's 4 feet, 11 inches, but he's well-built in the shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Robert and Betty Strub and some greats of racing -- trainer Charlie 
Whittingham, jockey Johnny Longden, Dr. Robert Kerlan -- sparked the night 
along with videos of the great scenes of racing. Applauding were Frank and 
Margarita Kanne, and Felix and Barbara McGinnis, among others. 
</P>
<P>
VITAL NEEDS: Many of the city's most prominent Catholic families turned out for 
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony's award dinner at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Kenney chaired the award committee and Pamela Mullin the dinner. Honored 
were long-time philanthropists Sir Daniel Donohue, Mrs. G. Allan (Marian) 
Hancock, William Hayden, Mrs. Thomas (Dorothy) Leavey and Cyril Nigg. Hancock 
and Hayden were unable to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the affair will go to DARE (the LAPD's Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education) in Catholic Schools and for aid to archdiocesan homeless shelters -- 
the Long Beach Family Shelter, the Good Shepherd Center for Homeless Women and 
the St. Vincent de Paul Men's Center. 
</P>
<P>
It was a night that called for the Los Angeles Police Department Honor Guard, 
the Pledge of Allegiance by L.A. Chief of Police Daryl F. Gates and songs by 
Vikki Carr. 
</P>
<P>
KICKOFFS: Parties have been abundant to kick off major fund raising. National 
Medical Enterprises' chairman and CEO Richard K. Eamer were hosts of the 
reception at the Regency Club this week to rally support for the Senior Health 
&amp; Peer Counseling Center dinner-dance in April. Eamer is chairman of the 
Santa Monica center's $6-million development campaign . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Stewart and Robert Wagner, who wasn't there because he was playing in the 
Pebble Beach golf tournament, were hosts of the celebrity cocktail party at the 
Hotel Bel-Air to kick off the 1990 Jimmy Stewart Relay Marathon for Saint 
John's Hospital and Health Center. Linda Hartwick, Jim and Mary Hesburgh, and 
Charles G. Cale were in the crowd . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Director Franco Zeffirelli, a patron of Italian culture, has the nod to be 
honored by the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's Italian Renaissance Ball March 
8, says co-chair Carolyn Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
PAST PERFECT: The Vienna Culture Club's (and club president Robert Propst's) 
opera ball at the Regent Beverly Wilshire with Mayor of Vienna Dr. Helmut Zilk 
and his operetta-singing wife Dagmar Koller the star attractions. The night

I personally think the problem lies with our educational system, in that the 
Afro power structure will not demand that black history and true-to-real-life 
job training be taught to all students on an equal basis from junior high 
through graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
I am of the opinion that if this were to be done, the stigma of color would 
eventually fade away and all people would be accepted on the basis of their 
character and ability and not on the circumstance of their color.

Best wishes to Bean for upward mobility and success in fighting racism at every

To be sure, Bruce Bean's "To Be Young, Black and Endangered" touches a 
sensitive public nerve. Granted, the condition exists. More positively, what do 
we do about it? If blame is to be assigned, we all must confess a share. 
</P>
<P>
Often, I have declared that if I had been born black, I would have been the 
most obnoxious of the racial protagonists. Now, it would seem, the worst course 
would be to finger blame. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest hurdle to overcome is the universal human inclination to 
stereotype. . . . To cancel out the effects of aggregate or stereotypical 
impressions, we have to focus on positive racial intercourse and experience. 
This requires that blacks soft-pedal blaming their fate on the accident of 
their birth -- which they have every right to do, but, that's a given, not 
subject to change. Too, they must brush off misguided whites who exhort them to 
a course of confrontation and violence. One course might be to resist a 
tendency to regard every affront or restraint as racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
I hope Bruce Bean realizes that the vocation he's chosen, the printed word, is 
the strongest weapon yet known to address inequity.

Bean's article reminded me of an incident that occurred recently to me and four 
students. I am the principal of Mid-City Alternative School, and I took four 
students to an art store to buy supplies because they were involved in the 
"King Boulevard Memorial Project Poster Contest." 
</P>
<P>
As we entered the store, the manager approached the four black boys with arms 
outstretched, blocking them at the door. "Can I help you fellows," he asked. He 
apparently didn't see me talking with the young men because he completely 
ignored me. Of course I was dressed in a shirt and tie, and am light of skin. 
Amazed, I turned to him and said, "They're with me." He responded with "Do you 
have them under control?" 
</P>
<P>
Here we had four black young men involved in a project to improve their lives 
and the community who were winners: One was a first-place winner in the 1986 
Water and Power Conservation Poster Contest (citywide) and has won 14 honorable 
mentions in the last four years in art; one was an honorable mention in another 
contest and one was a first place winner this year in the 1990 Water and Power 
Poster Contest (city-wide) whose poster is illustrated in their 1990 calendar. 
He also won the "Be a Winner -- Reach Out and Care Poster Contest," which he 
received a trophy and other prizes. 
</P>
<P>
This illustrates so vividly, so painfully, how black children are judged by the 
color of their skin, not by the content of their character. This, no matter 
what they achieve.

Bruce Bean's article was well done and raises our sympathy. We all must agree 
that the Stuart case in Boston was in great error, but when the seeming victim 
of a violent double crime describes his assailant, the authorities cannot be 
blamed for searching for the person so described. 
</P>
<P>
For most of my adult life I have been giving to Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the Urban League, 
Southern Poverty Law Center. The last time I had an unusual kindness done me by 
an Afro-American male was 25 years ago. Since then I have had two cars stolen 
and recovered in black areas after having been stripped and vandalized. I have 
been mugged and robbed by blacks. I have been robbed at gunpoint once by an 
Afro-American who said, "You and your kind have been taking from me my whole 
life. Now I'm taking from you." Another time I escaped two robbers. 
</P>
<P>
I give everyone "common courtesy and respect" but am tired of being a victim.

COMPROMISE PLAN UNVEILED FOR MELROSE; 
</P>
<P>
PARKING: COMPLICATED SYSTEM WOULD ALLOW SHOPPERS TO PARK IN THE DAYTIME AND 
RESIDENTS TO PARK AT NIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For three years, neighbors of the radically trendy boutiques and restaurants 
along Melrose Avenue have been locked in a pitched battle with the area 
merchants over parking. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side has wanted to budge, until now. Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, 
playing the mediator, unveiled a compromise arrangement last week that 
apparently is acceptable to both sides. It calls for a complex system of 
changing parking zones in the blocks surrounding the most congested stretch of 
Melrose, a stretch of about a mile, from Gardner Street to Highland Avenue. The 
aim is to allow shoppers to park in the daytime and residents to park at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how significant this day is," Yaroslavsky told members of the 
council's Transportation Committee in announcing the proposal on Wednesday. 
"Months ago, odds are that this (council) room would be filled (with 
protesters). But people on both sides -- the residents and the merchants -- 
have worked with the spirit of the betterment of the community in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Melrose Avenue, a monument to neon and glass, emerged during the 1980s as one 
of Los Angeles' premiere walking streets, attracting an eclectic mix of 
jet-setters, tourists and locals. 
</P>
<P>
Its growing success, however, was accompanied by a crescendo of complaints from 
residents of the side streets that the shops and restaurants create a 
horrendous parking problem, as well as too much noise and congestion. Petitions 
have circulated calling for a permit parking system or other arrangement that 
would provide residents with a place to park when they get home from work. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants have bitterly opposed plans to restrict parking, saying it could put 
them out of business. They have spent more than $15,000 in legal fees in 
preparation for taking the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
To avert a messy legal battle, the merchants and the residents have now agreed 
in principle to Yaroslavsky's complicated package of parking reforms, which has 
taken more than a year to negotiate. It is so complicated that when Yaroslavsky 
presented it to the Transportation Committee members Wednesday, they scratched 
their heads, looked at the zoning maps and asked few questions. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the members said they trusted Yaroslavsky, as well as the Melrose 
residents and shop owners who offered nearly unanimous support for the package. 
The committee's two members present -- Mike Woo and Nate Holden -- voted to 
approve the measure. With the backing of the city Transportation Department, it 
now goes to the full council for approval. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is complicated because it tries to address the schizophrenic nature of 
Melrose Avenue -- a busy commercial area by day and a residential area by 
night. As Melrose has blossomed over the past decade, the narrow side streets 
have become favored parking sites for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
But because many of the shops and most restaurants are open well into the 
night, residents have complained that they come home from work and have to 
scout around for a place to park, often blocks away. Merchants, for their part, 
blame the city for not constructing parking garages. 
</P>
<P>
The plan sets forth three different sets of parking regulations for designated 
areas: 
</P>
<P>
The area from La Brea Avenue to Highland Avenue south of Melrose would have 
two-hour unrestricted parking from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., with only residential 
permit parking after that on all days except Sunday. An exception was made for 
Hope Lutheran Church, which will be allotted 60 visitor permits for the steady 
stream of people coming for Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous meetings, choir 
practice and other church-sponsored activities. 
</P>
<P>
The second plan would apply to the side streets north and south of Melrose from 
Alta Vista Boulevard to Gardner Street. These streets would have unrestricted 
two-hour parking from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. After 8 p.m., a split-street system 
would take effect, in which parking on the east sides of the streets would be 
only for residents with permits, while the west sides would stay unrestricted. 
</P>
<P>
The third plan would apply only to Detroit Street and Formosa Avenue. On these 
streets, the plan calls for two-hour unrestricted parking during the day, but 
residential permit parking starting at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that when you look at it for the first time, it's a mishmash," said 
Yaroslavsky. "But I looked at every block . . . and where there is a problem, 
we have addressed the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Yaroslavsky received praise at the hearing from both residents and 
merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say Zev put in a tremendous effort to bring both sides together," said 
Arturo Martinez, president of the Melrose Neighborhood Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Jejebian, president of Merchants on Melrose, said the consensus among 
the 200 or so store owners he represents was to support the plan. At the 
hearing, he offered praise not only for Yaroslavsky but for residents as well, 
saying they were generous for accepting less residential parking than they 
initially wanted in order to help keep Melrose a thriving business area. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very difficult situation, one that is very emotional," said 
Jejebian. "Nobody wanted to give in at all, but it works out for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer representing the merchants, Carl Grumer, said he believes a lawsuit 
will no longer be necessary, but that he will keep his options open until the 
final package is approved. 
</P>
<P>
"I am aware that a proposal has come down that seems close to acceptable, one 
that we can work with," Grumer said. "It's in the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city is exploring ways to alleviate the parking crunch that will 
be exacerbated by the increase in residential parking. Options include setting 
up a shuttle bus system from the parking lot at Fairfax High School at Melrose 
and Fairfax avenues and constructing additional city-owned parking lots using 
parking meter revenues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MELROSE PARKING PLAN 
</P>
<P>
The compromise plan sets forth three different sets of parking regulations for 
designated areas: 
</P>
<P>
The area from La Brea to Highland Avenue south of Melrose would have 
unrestricted two-hour parking from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., with only residential 
permit parking after that on all days except Sunday. An exception was made for

during the day, but residential permit parking at night.

JPL TENTATIVELY OKS PAYING $3 MILLION IN CLEANUP OF WELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory has tentatively agreed to pay more than $3 
million to help clean up four contaminated wells. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials said they could make no formal statement about the 
agreement, Deputy City Manager Edward K. Aghjayan said the details should 
become final within the next two weeks. By then, he said, officials of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which oversees operations of the 
lab, should have approved the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement had been in the making throughout the 1980s, since pollution in 
the wells was discovered decades after the contamination from industrial 
solvents occurred. JPL has acknowledged that it probably played a role in 
polluting the wells. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the wells were closed about five years ago, and the others have since 
been shut down. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel real positive about it," said JPL spokeswoman Elizabeth Stetz. "It 
represents a good solution for Pasadena's problem." 
</P>
<P>
The city's negotiations with JPL yielded a two-part plan: 
</P>
<P>
The lab tentatively agreed to make a lump sum payment "in excess of $750,000," 
Aghjayan said. This will help compensate the city for its costs in coping with 
pollution near the facility, along the northwestern edge of Pasadena and the 
city's Arroyo Seco. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the laboratory tentatively agreed to pay $750,000 
annually for three years to finance a new treatment facility designed to solve 
short-term pollution problems. 
</P>
<P>
City officials approved the plans at the Board of Directors meeting Tuesday and 
at the zoning board Wednesday, Aghjayan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're quite pleased," Aghjayan said, calling the agreement and pollution 
cleanup approach "a very creative solution." The lab, he said, "has shown a 
great deal of public spiritedness." 
</P>
<P>
"Many times in situations like this you have to go to court," he said, "but I 
think we have an exciting conclusion to this." 
</P>
<P>
The planned water treatment facility will start at once on decontaminating the 
four wells, while further tests are performed to determine how best to solve 
the long-term impact of the pollution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best of both worlds," Aghjayan said. "We solve our problems now. 
And then on a more accurate basis we can decide how to solve our long-term 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
As water pollution has worsened during the last five years, the city has spent 
as much as $850,000 a year to replace the water that would have been drawn from 
the polluted wells, Aghjayan said. The new treatment facility will eliminate 
that expense, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena area's Raymond Water Basin is distinct from the San Gabriel Valley 
Water Basin, which suffers from one of the most complicated ground-water 
pollution problems in the West and is a federal Superfund cleanup site.

STORE OF HOMEY WISDOM IS LOST;

<P>
PRIZED MONTEREY PARK PHARMACY LEAVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is one of those old-fashioned neighborhood drugstores with a chipped 
plaster Venus de Milo on the cosmetics case, a couple of racks of greeting 
cards in one corner and a pharmacist in a white jacket who, stepping out of his 
cluttered work space, personally takes your prescription slip. 
</P>
<P>
"Flu?" said Sam Perlman, 63, a balding man in oversized bifocals, dolefully 
considering the piece of paper he's holding. "Yeah, it's going around." 
</P>
<P>
There aren't many places left like the Midtown Pharmacy in Monterey Park. In an 
age of mega-pharmacies that can spit out 600 or 700 prescriptions a day, 
Perlman and his customers at the Midtown still address each other by their 
first names. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of them were there the other day -- talking with an easy, joshing 
familiarity bred from Perlman's gentle influence during countless bouts of 
bronchitis and tooth extraction and rubella -- when Perlman dropped a 
bombshell. After more than 30 years at Garfield and Garvey avenues, he said, 
the Midtown is closing. 
</P>
<P>
"You're kidding!" said Celia Arcos, wide-eyed with disbelief. "Nothing can be 
done?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's the point of no return," Perlman said soberly. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam, this is ridiculous. I'm so mad." 
</P>
<P>
Perlman's landlords, maintaining that the pharmacist is paying a fraction of 
the prevailing rate for downtown Monterey Park commercial space, have almost 
doubled his rent, from $3,100 a month to $6,000. They have given him until the 
end of February to sign a new lease or vacate the store, an unreinforced 
concrete structure that needs to be bolstered against earthquake stresses. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do anything on earthquake reinforcement until he moves out," said a 
spokeswoman for the Lancet Investment Co., the Chinese partnership that bought 
the building last year. "It's the main reason we want him out." 
</P>
<P>
But Perlman said that, besides raising the rent, the landlords want to shut his 
business down for three months while the building is under repairs. "And they 
wanted me to sign a release, absolving them of any responsibility for anything 
that might happen in the store," he said. "How can I do that?" 
</P>
<P>
Many of the customers see the demise of the Midtown as part of the radical 
transformation of Monterey Park in the last decade from a sleepy, ethnically 
diverse small town to a bustling San Gabriel Valley dynamo where a majority of 
the population is Asian, the nation's first suburban Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been inundated with Chinese restaurants, inundated with gift shops," 
said longtime resident Joy Rowe. "That's OK. But now the merchants who have 
been here so long are being pushed out." 
</P>
<P>
"What can you do?" asked DeEtta Roberts, a retired retail clerk, shrugging her 
shoulders. "If you don't like it, move to Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real touchy situation," said Mayor Patricia Reichenberger, who last 
week was working to relocate the Midtown. "For the past six or eight years, 
investors have been coming in, raising rents, forcing people out. Or refusing 
to renew leases. It's a long sad story." 
</P>
<P>
Perlman's store has been especially coveted, Reichenberger said. "It's the best 
spot in town," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Though some whites were quick to broadly implicate "the Chinese" for the 
closing of the Midtown, Perlman denied the issue was racial. Almost a third of 
his clients are Asian, Perlman said. "They're hard-working people, 
family-oriented," he said. "Their checks don't bounce. They're very honorable 
in business." 
</P>
<P>
But the headlong rush to buy real estate in Monterey Park has wiped out the 
small-town business district, he said. Perlman will be one of the last to go. 
Gone are the haberdasher, the shoe repairman, the barber and, 14 months ago, 
Paris' Restaurant, the Garvey Avenue gathering place of politicians and 
businessmen for 37 years, which has been turned into a Chinese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"You start feeling like a stranger in a strange land," Perlman said. "Even the 
taco stands are Chinese now." 
</P>
<P>
In the 37 years since he got his license from the State Board of Pharmacy, the 
soft-spoken druggist has seen some big changes in the drug-dispensing business, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
When Perlman took over the Monterey Park store in 1959, he became part of a 
vast network of neighborhood pharmacists, dispensing medication to American 
families. That was a more innocent time, Perlman said. "We used to keep the 
condoms under the counter, and sanitary napkins were wrapped in plain brown 
paper." 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest changes since then have been in the industry's economics, he 
said. "Suddenly there were prepaid health care plans directing patients to 
their own pharmacies," he said. "Or patients were sent to the chains, where 
there were fee arrangements. The community pharmacist is gradually being forced 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The Monterey Park real estate boom couldn't have come at a worse time for him. 
"Overhead is increasing just as the margin of profits is decreasing," Perlman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The real danger of the closing of pharmacies such as the Midtown, civic leaders 
say, is the loss of the resources and personal touch from people such as 
Perlman. After so many years in one store, Perlman has a fix on his patients' 
chronic maladies and an old pro's understanding of medical side effects. 
</P>
<P>
Joy Rowe, a registered nurse, gives an example. "One of my neighbors has been 
taking a heart medication called Inderal for years," she said. "She goes to a 
new doctor, a hematologist, who tells her to stop taking all medication. Now, 
you don't just suddenly stop taking Inderal. It can trigger a reaction. You 
have to be weaned." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Rowe's neighbor had enough confidence in Perlman to ask him about 
it. "Sam told her she had better go back to her cardiologist, who told her not 
to stop the Inderal," Rowe recounted. "You don't get that in the big 
pharmacies. All they're doing is filling a prescription. You go to one window 
with your prescription slip and another window to pay." 
</P>
<P>
Perlman takes what he calls his "pro-active role" seriously. He warns his 
customer about side-effects from medication or drug interactions. "For example, 
you don't take aspirin together with Coumadin (an anti-coagulant), because it 
can cause internal bleeding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also steps out of his work space to explain how to administer medications. 
You don't take a particular anti-inflammatory drug on an empty stomach, for 
instance, and you avoid dairy products when taking an antibiotic. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, the physician doesn't have enough time to explain things," Perlman 
said. "Or else, the patient doesn't listen. You're in the doctor's office, and 
your mind is going in so many different directions. Anybody can forget what the 
doctor told them." 
</P>
<P>
The task is made more difficult because of the diversity of languages. 
Perlman's clerk, Hortensia Zaldivar, talks to the Spanish-speaking customers. A 
pair of Vietnamese students who work part-time handle the non-English-speaking 
Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Perlman digs out a well-thumbed copy of "Say It in Chinese," a 
phrase book that can lead him haltingly through such questions as, "Do you have 
a cold?" 
</P>
<P>
"The real problem is with my pronunciation," Perlman said. 
</P>
<P>
The pharmacist, whose wife, Myrna, and two daughters have occasionally staffed 
the store, had to give up his delivery service a few years ago. But he himself 
still delivers medicines to homebound customers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been over on our street several times this year," Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, the patients in Perlman's store last week were lamenting the 
prospect of losing a friend. "I'll tell you what kind of a pharmacist Sam has 
been," said the recently widowed Gwen Bacon, standing near the prescription 
counter. "He told me to call him whenever I needed him. When my husband was 
running a temperature of 104 one night and he needed some medication, I called 
Sam. He said, 'Meet me at the store,' and he came down and met me here at 9 
o'clock at night." 
</P>
<P>
She wiped away some tears. "Where are we going to find another pharmacist like 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
Perlman said it's too late to think of relocating. "It's the 12th hour, so to 
speak," he said. He has sold his inventory and records to another druggist and 
made plans to retire. "I didn't expect to be going out this way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Celia Arcos picked up her prescription and headed for the door. "Now, you take 
care," she said, giving Perlman a last appraising look. 
</P>
<P>
She stopped near a case of toothpaste and deodorants and turned back. "It's 
funny," she said. "I'm telling you that now. It used to be you telling me."

FLYTRAPS CAPTURE BUGS AND MORE -- STUDENTS' ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Questions erupted the moment Teri Uyemura's sixth-graders opened their science 
books Monday morning and saw the color photo of a Venus' flytrap devouring a 
housefly. 
</P>
<P>
"How does it kill the fly?" 
</P>
<P>
"Will it bite my finger off too?" 
</P>
<P>
"Does the bug ever escape?" 
</P>
<P>
While the accompanying essay, "Insect eaters of the plant world," did its best 
to explain the phenomenon, Uyemura looked around her class and saw more than a 
few doubters. 
</P>
<P>
What would really drive her science lesson home, Uyemura thought, was a live 
demonstration of how bladderworts, pitcher plants, sundews or the exotic Venus' 
flytraps actually captured and gobbled down their prey. 
</P>
<P>
That afternoon, on her way home from Washington Middle School, a sprawling, 
1920s building in northwest Pasadena, Uyemura stopped at a local nursery. On 
Tuesday morning, she marched into class carrying five bona fide Venus' flytraps 
she had purchased for five dollars each. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get reimbursed for things like that, but I feel the kids have to see 
how it happens, so it's not just something they read in a book," Uyemura 
explained. "If that makes it more exciting for them, then it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Uyemura thought it especially important to grab her students' interest this 
week because it marks the beginning of the spring semester and a new lesson 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
All fall, the sixth grade had studied health science, learning about hearts, 
brains and human reproduction. From now on, they would focus on the natural 
sciences. Uyemura believed that carnivorous plants, which lured insects to 
their death by secreting drug-like poisons, were loaded with enough 
science-fiction-type drama to capture her students' imagination as surely as 
the Venus' flytrap captured bugs. 
</P>
<P>
First came the book lesson. Uyemura called on students to read aloud while she 
wrote down key facts on the blackboard, her chalk slap-slapping against the 
greenish-black surface, her letters as neat and rounded as a sample in a 
penmanship book. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd better be writing down all these facts because you're going to need them 
for your reports," Uyemura admonished the class. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh man, I thought you said we only had to write down three facts," grumbled a 
voice from the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I didn't say that," Uyemura answered evenly, and kept writing about how 
the Venus' flytrap had hinged leaves with reddish centers that secreted a 
sweet-smelling liquid to attract insects. The plant also had tiny trigger hairs 
that caused the leaves to snap shut when the Venus' flytrap sensed prey. 
</P>
<P>
Once ensnared, the plant secreted juices like stomach acids to break the insect 
down into needed nutrients. Botanists who sliced open these plants had found 
leftovers -- tiny undigested insect parts, Uyemura told the class. 
</P>
<P>
In the front of the room, Margaret Gonzalez and Lupe Jaramillo scrunched up 
their faces and exchanged looks of disgust. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those plants are nasty," added 12-year-old Miesha McCall, who wore a 
pink jacket and fashionable red shoes embossed with gold trim. "I think it's 
gross how they eat those flies." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd put the bug on the end of a straw and stick it near the plant," she added. 
"I don't want it to bite my finger off." 
</P>
<P>
Her friend Aisha Owens, wearing a pink warm-up suit, her long hair braided in 
cornrows, looked at her askance. 
</P>
<P>
"Nuh-uh, it's just a plant. It doesn't hurt if it touches your finger," Aisha 
advised her friend. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither girl had ever seen a Venus' flytrap before, they were familiar 
with the concept thanks to a Nintendo video game called Super Mario Brothers. 
In the game, players lead a little character through a danger-strewn path to 
rescue a princess. One of the recurring obstacles is a voracious Venus' flytrap 
that pops up at unexpected moments to swallow the character. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, it was time to feed the flesh-and-blood flytraps. Uyemura 
divided the students into groups of six and placed a plant in front of each 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Next, she sent a five-student expedition into the woodsy corners of the 
sprawling campus to hunt down aphids, ants, pill bugs and whatever else they 
could scavenge. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the girls were aghast to learn that ladybugs also might be sacrificed 
as plant chow. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, don't kill the ladybug. It's pretty and it's a good bug," begged Tonique 
Delaney, when one of her fellow hunters captured one of the round, red insects 
on a grassy slope. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Camea Gholar balked at touching bugs. But egged on by the others, she 
was soon poking into bushes in pursuit of more insects, as she cradled a lone 
pill bug gingerly in her hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I got me a whole family," said Shahe Demirjian, opening his palm to show a 
cache of rolled-up gray pill bugs, also known on the playground as roly-polys. 
</P>
<P>
As the kids returned, bearing their bugs in firmly clenched fists and 
scoop-shaped pieces of paper, the excitement mounted. 
</P>
<P>
"The students who captured the bugs get to feed them to the plant," Uyemura 
announced, to a chorus of disappointed moans. 
</P>
<P>
But there were plenty to go around. 
</P>
<P>
"Oooooh, get in there," the students exclaimed, helping the pill-bugs into the 
Venus' flytraps with the tips of pencils. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going in." 
</P>
<P>
"Where are the trigger hairs?" 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, somebody, give me some insects." 
</P>
<P>
For a moment they were silent. Then, a chorus of howls left from their throats, 
as group after group watched the plants snap shut, trapping the unfortunate 
insects inside. 
</P>
<P>
One plant closed around an insect's upper half, leaving the other end wriggling 
while the children clustered around in fascinated horror. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, your plant is hungry." 
</P>
<P>
"That plant tried to bite Chris' finger off." 
</P>
<P>
Uyemura explained that the Venus' flytraps would take at least half a day to 
digest their meals. Then they would reopen. Seven kids were so taken with the 
strange plants that they promised to bring $5 to school the next day if Uyemura 
would buy them each their own pet plant. 
</P>
<P>
Just then, the lunch bell rang and, still flushed with excitement from their 
botany lesson, the sixth-graders of Room 115 headed off to eat their own meals. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Uyemura would assign the class to write essays about what they had just 
witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
Gerardo Frayre would phrase his thoughts most eloquently. 
</P>
<P>
Carnivorous plants, wrote Frayre, "are a death wish for insects."

A LITMUS TEST FOR UCLA CREDIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA has misrepresented its Hospital Hotel proposal in two recent letters to 
the editor. UCLA claims that it is abiding by the new plan for the community; 
it is not. Hotels are not permitted on this property. Calling it a guest house 
does not change what it is -- a hotel. Furthermore, the density permitted on 
the land is 48 units, not the 88 units (with a total of 100 rooms) proposed. 
</P>
<P>
It is not easy for me to disagree with UCLA. I have a double relationship with 
the university, as a faculty member of the School of Public Health, and through 
my husband, who is on the molecular biology faculty. But as president of 
Friends of Westwood, I along with all Westwood homeowner association leaders, 
spent five long years helping to plan Westwood's future through new Community 
and Specific plans. The bottom line is that this project is in flagrant 
violation of those plans, and UCLA is playing a semantic game by calling it a 
guest house. 
</P>
<P>
These plans were designed to protect the adjacent residential community from 
commercial development in the Village, and to keep Tiverton Avenue traffic as 
free-flowing as possible, since Tiverton is the emergency access route to UCLA 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, there is a real need to find housing for patients and their families. 
UCLA has a choice: It can find another location where this use and density are 
permitted, or provide vouchers for below-market rates for the existing hotels 
right on Tiverton Avenue (the Tiverton Palace or the Claremont Hotel). Special 
patient services can be provided at these locations much as visiting nurses, 
occupational therapists and social workers are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
As is often the case, this dispute represents more than the immediate question 
of housing medical visitors. It is the litmus test for UCLA's credibility with 
the community, and the flagship for its Long Range Development Plan to build an 
additional 4.2 million square feet in Westwood. If Westwood is to survive as a 
residential community, UCLA must learn to co-exist with its neighbors and 
follow the rules set out for planned development.

'KING OF THE HILL' IS A BLIGHT ON THE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I live four blocks below the "King of the Hill." Every time I look north, this 
house hits me in the face. 
</P>
<P>
I work in Santa Monica. Every time I look north, this house hits me in the 
face. I cannot get away from it. And, when I don't look at it, I know it is 
there -- looming down at me like some great dinosaur ready to devour its kill. 
The King of the Hill is a blight in our neighborhood -- a pimple on a flawless 
complexion. 
</P>
<P>
The only way Mr. (Dennis) Tito can redeem himself is to plant enough trees to 
obscure his ugly, overindulgent monument to himself from the rest of the 
populace.

WHAT IF EVERYONE BUILT EGO-MANSIONS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My childhood music teacher was a wise philosopher. Included in her wisdom was a 
"measuring stick" she used to evaluate my -- and other people's -- actions. 
</P>
<P>
"What," she would question me, "would the world be like if everyone did or 
behaved just as you do?" 
</P>
<P>
It is this measure stick I now use to evaluate Dennis Tito and his 
30,000-square-foot ego-mansion. If every human being (5.3 billion) built a 
30,000-square-foot monster, then solid houses would cover almost the entire 
land area of the United States and Canada. There would be no yards, no trees, 
just houses. 
</P>
<P>
If every human being had 60 telephones, that would be 265 billion phones to be 
produced from finite resources. And 20 TV sets per person would be 106 billion 
sets. And add eight cars per person: that would be 42 billion cars made from 
whatever resources might still be left. 
</P>
<P>
If everyone had the eco-morality that Tito has, then our natural world would be 
hopelessly polluted and probably destroyed.

UCLA GUEST HOUSE MEETS PATIENT NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a volunteer member of UCLA Medical Center's Board of Advisors and chairman 
of its facilities committee, I have been involved for some time in the planning 
for the medical center's proposed patient-family guest house featured in your 
Jan. 18 article. Having carefully reviewed the proposal, I believe that this 
facility is very important in order that the UCLA Medical Center may meet the 
humanistic needs of its patients. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a hotel, but a patient-family guest house. It will provide unique 
services to meet the special needs of those patients and their families who 
must travel great distances to receive care at UCLA Medical Center. Many of 
these people cannot afford to stay in a local hotel close to the medical 
center. Additionally, these people are uprooted from their regular routine 
during a most stressful time of illness, and the patient-family guest house 
would offer special counseling and support services. 
</P>
<P>
I urge the community to support UCLA Medical Center's efforts to improve the 
quality of life for its patients and their families in the proposed 
patient-family guest house.

CREDIT ON THE HOUSE: USE CAUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD SCHNEIDER, Schneider is an Ojai free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of Southland residents have found that they don't have to sell their 
homes -- most people's biggest financial asset -- to turn their equity into 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by aggressive bank marketing and tax benefits, homeowners increasingly 
are taking money out of their houses through home-equity credit lines and 
second mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Home-equity loans are easy to get and have lower rates than credit cards, but 
homeowners should be aware that they are pledging their houses as collateral to 
get cash today. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are unable to make your monthly payments, you could be forced to sell 
your home," notes a Federal Reserve Board publication. 
</P>
<P>
But that risk doesn't seem to be hurting demand for home-equity loans. 
</P>
<P>
Home-equity lending has grown 30% to 40% each year for the past three years, 
said Cindy Cesena, consumer loans product manager at Home Federal. She said 
Home Federal expects to grant 4,000 to 5,000 of these loans this year. 
</P>
<P>
Home-equity loans make up "a substantial portion of our overall consumer 
lending this year," says Scott Allen, a Bank of America vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Some banks -- such as Wells Fargo -- lend more through home-equity loans than 
by credit card, according to a report issued last year by SMR Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
This rise in home-equity lending is fueled by the gradual loss of tax 
deductions for interest payments not related to home ownership. By 1991, only 
mortgage-related interest will be deductible on tax returns.

"People are borrowing against their homes to buy a car," said John Lindgren 
Jr., director of the Center for Financial Services Studies at the University of 
Virginia's McIntire School of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Lindgren notes "a phenomenal growth rate" of home-equity lending among eight 
California banks he surveyed last year, and he predicts that 1989 figures 
should be even higher. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of total home-equity loans outstanding nationally are estimated to 
be at least $210 billion, according to the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
Two main types of home-equity credit are available: 
</P>
<P>
Most popular now are home-equity credit lines. Secured by a second trust deed 
on the homeowner's property, these loans give borrowers a credit limit that 
they can draw against by writing checks. 
</P>
<P>
Minimum payments generally cover only interest for 10 years. At that time, the 
borrower might have to make a "balloon payment" for the entire balance. 
</P>
<P>
Second mortgages, or closed-end loans, are the other type of home-equity loan. 
They work like a homeowner's first mortgage: Principal and interest are paid 
off together over a set period, generally not more than 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
More efforts to market home-equity lending can be expected from banks, said 
Chris Wallner, vice president of asset production management at Security 
Pacific Bank. 
</P>
<P>
But although Wallner cites the California real estate market as a force behind 
the loans, others are concerned about the ability of borrowers to repay. 
</P>
<P>
"I get four to five mailings every month" from banks touting their home-equity 
products, said Gary Stroth, executive director of the nonprofit Consumer Credit 
Counseling Service of Los Angeles. "I can have $25,000 immediately," he added. 
"Boy, it's tempting." 
</P>
<P>
Lenders generally allow homeowners to borrow up to 75% or 80% of their equity, 
or the profit they would realize if they sold their home now. 
</P>
<P>
Stroth is concerned about individuals with credit card debt who use a 
home-equity credit line to "pay off their bills and then get a feeling of 
comfort. Can you control yourself," he asks, and not go back to using charge 
cards recklessly? 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Credit Counseling sees about a dozen people each month who are in 
trouble because of home-equity debt, Stroth said. About 800 people come to the 
organization for counseling each month. 
</P>
<P>
The eight large California banks in Lindgren's survey report that only about 
.25% of their home-equity loans are delinquent, compared to a 1.5% delinquency 
rate on all consumer credit. But most home-equity delinquencies won't show up 
for a few more years, according to Lindgren, since nearly 40% of those loans 
were granted last year. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers report national delinquency rates of 1.22% on home-equity loans, 
according to the Consumer Bankers Assn., a trade organization representing 
banks and S&amp;Ls that serve consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"People believe," Stroth noted, that the bank already knows whether or not they 
can handle a home-equity loan. The bank "wouldn't mail (the promotion) to me if 
I couldn't" afford it," they think. 
</P>
<P>
"A two-edged sword" is how home-equity lending is described by Fritz Elmendorf, 
vice president of communications at the Consumer Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
With a credit line, the homeowner has a "lot of flexibility," Elmendorf said. 
But it "puts the responsibility in the hands of the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
Convenience in obtaining money was the most-frequently cited advantage to 
home-equity loans, according to a 1988 survey of borrowers by the University of 
Michigan's Institute for Social Research. Eleven percent of all homeowners have 
a loan secured by their home equity, in addition to first mortgages, the survey 
found. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40% of the respondents said they were using the money for home 
improvements. Elmendorf suggests that home improvements are "the best possible 
use" of a home-equity loan. "It plows money back into the equity of a home." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, debt consolidation and major purchases -- such as for automobiles 
or college educations -- are the most-frequent uses of home-equity credit. 
</P>
<P>
Besides considering the value of the home backing a loan, lenders also want to 
make sure each borrower has enough income to meet all his debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific's Wallner said the bank strives to ensure borrowers are "not 
strained" by their payments for first mortgages, home-equity loans and other 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
But because home prices historically appreciate well in California, lenders 
here are more liberal than in other areas of the country. Bankers find that if 
home prices decline, delinquency rates on first and second mortgages rise. 
</P>
<P>
Someone with $100,000 in annual income can get a home-equity credit line even 
if the payments will force him to spend half his income to meet his total debt 
payments, says Drew Tanaman, senior vice president in the mortgage lending 
division at Wells Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
But around the country, most lenders won't grant a home-equity loan if the 
total debt would equal more than 40% of a borrower's income, Elmendorf said. 
</P>
<P>
When shopping for home-equity credit, your first consideration should be 
whether you need a second mortgage or a credit line. Second mortgages are used 
by a "traditional borrower with a specific need in mind," said Home Federal's 
Cesena. 
</P>
<P>
Because they have set payment schedules for principal and interest, second 
mortgages offer less chance for a borrower to overextend himself than a 
home-equity credit line. In addition, interest rates on second mortgages now 
are about 1% below credit-line rates. 
</P>
<P>
A line of credit is more useful for someone who wants access to money at 
different times. Having this established line of credit means the borrower 
doesn't have to keep making loan applications and paying fees, explained Terri 
Chamberlain, a branch sales manager for Imperial Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Interest is paid only on the amount of money used, much like the way credit 
card finance charges are figured. But interest rates on credit lines vary over 
time, just as an adjustable-rate mortgage does. 
</P>
<P>
Combinations of second mortgages and home-equity credit lines, such as Security 
Pacific's "Equity Maximizer," are useful in certain situations. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, someone making home improvements who does not know the final cost 
might use this product. Most of the home-improvement debt can be paid with a 
low-rate second mortgage, with additional money available, if needed, through 
the line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
When shopping for home-equity credit, Elmendorf said to ask about up-front 
fees, interest rates, repayment terms and annual fees. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure regulations that went into effect in November require that lenders 
tell credit-line applicants what the current interest rate is and how high it 
could go. 
</P>
<P>
Fees and potential balloon payments also must be disclosed up-front, said Peggy 
Miller, a legislative representative at the Consumer Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that the law keeps lenders from raising their rate structure or 
canceling credit lines without cause. She suggested that anyone with a credit 
line established before November check the contract for so-called "escape 
clauses" that give lenders the right to make future changes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the new regulations, earlier contracts stand as written. Borrowers 
should "renegotiate" with lenders, Miller said, or shop around for a new credit 
line to replace the old one. 
</P>
<P>
Before choosing one, try to determine how you will use a credit line. If you 
will be using it for years, consider picking a lender that doesn't charge an 
annual fee. Even if you pay higher up-front costs, you can save money over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
You might also want to anticipate how a credit-line rate will adjust. Banks 
that peg their interest charges to certificate of deposit (CD) rates often have 
lower credit-line rates. 
</P>
<P>
However, they fluctuate more than loans tied to the prime rate. CD rates are 
adjusted as often as every week, while some prime-based lenders adjust their 
rates quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important element in shopping for a home-equity loan is 
knowing before you use it how you will make the payments. As borrowers 
throughout history have found, it's often easier to get a loan than it is to 
pay it off.

HOT PROPERTY: LIZ SAYING ADIOS TO PUERTO VALLARTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ELIZABETH TAYLOR is selling her Puerto Vallarta properties. 
</P>
<P>
The actress put the two-house compound that she and actor RICHARD BURTON 
purchased in Mexico in the early 1960s on the market, along with a penthouse 
that she bought there about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Puerto Vallarta holds many special memories for me," she said. "Though the 
town is still as inviting and beautiful today as when I first visited it, my 
children all have families of their own, and with all the traveling I do, I 
have had very little time in recent years to return." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and the late actor bought the hacienda, known as Casa Kimberly, while 
co-starring in the 1964 movie "Night of the Iguana." They were also married 
while filming the movie in Puerto Vallarta. That marriage lasted 10 years; they 
were remarried in 1975 and divorced again in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
During their first marriage, they created the Puerto Vallarta compound by 
joining two houses, across a street from each other, by a bridge modeled after 
the Bridge of Sighs in Venice, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor first put Casa Kimberly on the market in 1987 at $1 million. She's now 
asking $350,000, including furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
"She really wants to sell it now," said a spokeswoman for Fred Sands Realtors, 
which has the listing. Other than caretakers, nobody lives in the home, which 
the spokeswoman termed "sprawling" with its seven bedrooms, seven baths, 
swimming pool, atrium and two kitchens. "It would be good as a restaurant or a 
bed-and-breakfast," she suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor also listed her nearby penthouse at $250,000. She bought it new about 
the time she first listed the hacienda. The condo has four bedrooms and four 
baths and is in a 156-unit building that has tennis courts, spas, maid service, 
a restaurant, golf course and views of a new marina. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Dannenberg and Roger Wall of Sands' office in Beverly Hills -- where the 
actress lives most of the year, share the listings. 
</P>
<P>
The SULTAN OF BRUNEI recently dropped plans to buy a house in Bel-Air because 
radon was discovered there, industry sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Radon -- a radioactive, gaseous chemical element believed to be a cause, at 
high levels, of lung cancer -- is more commonly found in homes on the East 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-bedroom, 36,000-square-foot estate was in escrow when the radon was 
discovered. The home had been quietly marketed at $25 million but was in escrow 
at $18.5 million for eight months, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
While in escrow, a home inspector hired by representatives of the buyer called 
in a consultant who conducted a test for radon and found higher than normal 
levels of it in part of the house. That discovery and the facts that the owner 
has cancer and her husband died of cancer discouraged the sultan from buying 
the property, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
George D. Baral, president of Reliance Home Inspections in West Los Angeles, is 
the inspector who hired the consultant, but Baral, who has a master's degree in 
chemistry and has extensively studied the radon issue since the Bel-Air 
discovery, said, "There was no reason for that escrow to have fallen through. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"To do radon mitigation, you just blow air into the building . . . or you can 
drill a hole in the foundation and vent it with an outside fan." 
</P>
<P>
The consultant estimated the cost to solve the radon problem at $250,000, 
according to Baral, but Baral figured it at $50,000 at most "and probably just 
a few thousand dollars." 
</P>
<P>
SANTA CLARITA STUDIOS, described as "Hollywood's first new studio to be built 
from the ground up in over 60 years," is expected to open in April. 
</P>
<P>
The $14-million project is in the new city of Santa Clarita, next to the 
37,000-acre Newhall Ranch, which is regularly used as a back lot for ABC-TV's 
"China Beach" and CBS-TV's "Tour of Duty." The studio is also near Magic 
Mountain, just north of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The studio -- which has six 15,000-square-foot sound stages and an 
18,000-square-foot production center with a commissary, offices and other space 
-- was conceived by Herman B. David, who developed it with a group of private 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
David, now the studio's president, is a 30-year industry veteran. He was once 
director of operations for the Burbank Studios and was studio manager for 20th 
Century Fox when he left in 1987 to build the Santa Clarita Studios. 
</P>
<P>
RON KOSLOW, who created the former CBS-TV show "Beauty &amp; the Beast" and is 
now developing new programming at ABC-TV, has purchased a Brentwood home that 
was gutted and redesigned to look like a Provencal farmhouse with an English 
country garden. 
</P>
<P>
The four-bedroom, four-bath house -- with maid's quarters -- has weathered 
wrought-iron balcony grills and door handles, an antique butter churn and a 
wheat grinder. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Love and her Alco West Designs sold the house to Koslow for $1,635,000, 
and Love also designed the home to include such items as 17th- and 18th-Century 
doors that she says she bought from Gypsies in France and a wood-burning oven, 
which is her trademark. 
</P>
<P>
Actress/singer LORNA LUFT, Liza Minnelli's sister and Judy Garland's daughter, 
and Luft's husband, rock musician-composer JAKE HOOKER, have just purchased a 
house in the Hollywood Hills for a bit more than $1 million, and they've listed 
their Coldwater Canyon home for $935,000. 
</P>
<P>
Rory Barish of June Scott &amp; Associates represented Luft and her husband in 
buying the larger house and has the listing.

<P>
If you don't care for a museum exhibit, a movie, concert or play you are 
attending, you can leave. If you are bored by a book you are reading, you can 
put it aside. So much for the visual, performing and literary arts. 
</P>
<P>
But the design arts are something else. Whether it is labeled architecture, 
planning, redevelopment, graphics, interior decoration or furniture making, and 
whether it is defined as a profession, craft or calling, design, without a 
doubt, is the most pervasive of human endeavors. It is nearly impossible to 
avoid or ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, how our man-made environment is shaped -- how we design the places we 
live, work, shop and play, and how we connect them -- shapes, defines and 
colors our lives. 
</P>
<P>
It is these shapes that over time have provided the most enduring record of our 
civilization, reflecting more than other creations of man the social, economic, 
cultural and political values of our fleeting societies. Hence the popular, if 
pompous, definition of architecture as history set in stone. 
</P>
<P>
No one understood and communicated this better than Lewis Mumford, the cultural 
commentator and architecture critic who died two weeks ago at the age of 94. 
</P>
<P>
His writings on life, letters and the arts, and how they come together in that 
most stupendous and threatening creation of man -- the city -- influenced 
generations of urban planners and designers, mine included. He was, if not the 
father of city planning, its sage. 
</P>
<P>
In thousands of essays and reviews, principally in The New Yorker magazine from 
the 1930s through the '50s, and dozens of books, including "The Culture of 
Cities" (1938) and "The City in History" (1961), Mumford displayed a 
penetrating and prescient intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
With a refreshingly direct style free of academic jargon, Mumford warned 
against the increasing dominance of the automobile, highways cutting up 
neighborhoods, the heedless dependence on machines, buildings that shadow 
streets and the overcrowding of cities -- years before they were issues. 
</P>
<P>
But he was not an arrogant curmudgeon. If anything, Mumford was a utopian, 
sketching a highly personalized vision of a better, more moral and humane 
tomorrow. For emphasis, he often would quote his favorite line of poetry from 
Tennyson's "Ulysses": "Come my friends, 'tis not too late to seek a newer 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Mumford's urgings included more user-friendly, modestly scaled buildings, 
traffic-free neighborhoods focused on parks and playgrounds, 
pedestrian-friendly downtowns, the preservation of landmarks and generally an 
environmentally sensitive approach to land use. 
</P>
<P>
His lessons are germane as ever, particularly in such emerging megalopolises as 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that Mumford would in spirit be among the staunch supporters 
of current efforts here to stop the rending of South Pasadena by the 710 
Freeway, the march of mini-malls, housing developments on lobotomized mountain 
tops, the demolition of landmarks and the deterioration of parks and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Mumford's ideal community was one that combined "the dynamism and diversity of 
the city with the enduring values of the village -- order, neighborhood 
stability and community closeness," according to his biographer, Donald Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Mumford's view grew out of the philosopher's embrace of the "garden city" 
movement pioneered in Britain in the late 19th Century as an alternative then 
to sickly industrial cities. 
</P>
<P>
Mumford in his criticisms stressed context. He argued that, say, for books or 
buildings to be properly understood, they had to be perceived in relations to 
the varied social, economic and political forces that produced them. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, he viewed the design of a building not as an isolated aesthetic 
object, to be judged for its play of materials and shapes and labeled "Modern" 
or whatever -- as is the tendency today in trendy design schools and 
publications promoting signature buildings and their architects. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Mumford stressed that architecture was a social art, and that buildings 
should be primarily evaluated as places where people live and work; that they 
had to be both functional and appealing, and be fitted properly into an 
appropriate setting. 
</P>
<P>
Mumford viewed cities similarly, within a wider cultural context, and forever 
looking for interrelationships. For him, planning and architecture was a 
puzzle, with thousands of pieces to be fitted together with the common goal to 
create "a home for man." 
</P>
<P>
Although he never graduated from college, Mumford was very much an 
intellectual, and generally more interested in ideas than people. 
</P>
<P>
His books are not bogged down with indulgent portraits of transient 
personalities and temporal designs that mark much of the present popular and 
professional writings. As a result, they persevere, with some two dozen of the 
more than 30 he wrote still in print. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike most intellectuals, Mumford was an activist. He was, among other 
things, one of the founders and theoreticians of the Regional Planning Assn. of 
America. He lived in an experimental cooperative housing project for years, and 
involved himself in a variety of social and political causes, ranging from 
protesting local redevelopment projects to nuclear testing and the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
A resolute, Olympian figure, Mumford believed strongly that intellectuals, 
artists and writers, indeed anyone who cared about the environment and the 
human race, had a moral obligation to work for reforms. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, as architecture and the nation went on a hedonistic binge, 
Mumford's pleas for the good and simple life, of family and community, in 
harmony with nature, faded. He was viewed sadly as an anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
But one only has to witness the accelerating deterioration of the quality of 
life in Los Angeles, as well as other cities, to see that the need for 
Mumford's inspirational words and thoughts, and his passion, persists.

SPEAKING OUT: WHAT REAL ESTATE ADS REALLY MEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY STEVENSON, Stevenson is a free-lance writer who lives in Rancho Palos 
Verdes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Look, honey, here's a good one," I said to my husband, pointing to an ad in 
the Sunday newspaper. "Priced below market . . . Decorator perfect. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," he reminded me, "I remember the last one we looked at that was 
'decorator perfect.' That was the one with the leopard-skin fabric on the 
master bedroom walls, the crystal chandelier in the laundry room and the pink 
marble entryway." 
</P>
<P>
"You're right," I sighed. "I'm sure it's a dud." 
</P>
<P>
I's happy with our family home and we're not looking for a new one. But my 
husband and I still love to look at the real estate ads. We have bought and 
sold several properties in the past 10 years, so I consider myself fairly aware 
of the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is one aspect of home buying that still keeps me guessing. I 
always get hooked by those newspaper ads that describe the properties and their 
attributes. You know, those cute little blurbs that leap out and catch your 
eye, starting you thinking that this has got to be too good to be true. And it 
usually is. 
</P>
<P>
I have been fooled by those devious descriptions enough times now that I am 
getting to know exactly what they really mean. So I'll share with you my 
definitions of some of the more commonly used descriptions: 
</P>
<P>
Perfect for handyman. The place is barely standing. This is the kind of house 
the movie "The Money Pit" was based on. 
</P>
<P>
Almost new. Kind of like almost pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Real charmer. Something your grandmother would have loved. Everything is old 
and original, including the wiring, plumbing and the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Motivated seller. Desperate to get out of this dump and into some place decent. 
</P>
<P>
Cute as a button. A perfect house for the Care Bears to live in. 
</P>
<P>
Low-maintenance yard. Concrete and wood chips give this home the ambience of a 
prison site. 
</P>
<P>
Open and airy. There is a slight problem with the roof -- but just think, you 
won't need air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Architect's own. Spacey, trendy, and unique. This house is great if you like 
triangular kitchens, lofts, and waterfalls in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Close to the freeways. Are those tire tracks in the front yard? 
</P>
<P>
Rustic. The bathroom is out back. 
</P>
<P>
Private back yard. There is a steep hill rising for 300 feet almost directly 
outside your back door. 
</P>
<P>
Unobstructable ocean view. There is no such thing. 
</P>
<P>
Great little starter. For those people who are desperate to get into their 
first home, and aren't too picky. 
</P>
<P>
Great potential. If you have an extremely large bank account and an even larger 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Fixer-upper. Don't even ask. If they are brave enough to call it a fixer in the 
newspaper, you know this place has serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
Hot new listing. If it's that hot, why is it even in the paper? 
</P>
<P>
Woodsy lot. The trees haven't been trimmed in 30 years. The home is dark, 
creepy and smells suspiciously of mildew. 
</P>
<P>
Perfect family home. Comes complete with intercoms, laundry chutes and crayon 
drawings on the walls. Has a smell of animals that won't ever come out unless 
you level the place. 
</P>
<P>
Love to entertain? An 800-square-foot house with an illegal 600-square-foot 
family room added on. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the market. The last buyers wised up and got out before the deal 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
Price reduced. They haven't found any suckers yet who will pay the outrageous 
asking price. 
</P>
<P>
Pride of ownership. It's too bad the owner likes gold foil wallpaper and fake 
wood paneling. 
</P>
<P>
Unique, one-of-a-kind. You will never resell this one. 
</P>
<P>
Beach bungalow. 900 square feet fixer-upper for $525,000. And they've got 15 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
Good starter, room to add on. A teeny tiny house, but great if you are a family 
of very short people with high-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Owner anxious. He must know something we don't. 
</P>
<P>
Close to shopping. Walk out your front door and right into the parking lot of a 
mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
Original owner. This is a house that has avocado green appliances and tile in 
the kitchen, gold shag wall-to-wall carpeting, huge swag lamps that weigh about 
400 pounds each, aluminum sliding doors, and pink and green bathrooms with the 
original linoleum. The place is a museum to the '50s.

'EMPTY NEST' PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing to applaud the price cuts made by Urban West Communities at their 
Creekside II development in Moorpark "Sitting on Empty Nests" by David W. Myers 
(Jan. 21). 
</P>
<P>
I can understand that earlier buyers may be unhappy to see prices reduced, but 
I would hazard a guess that many of these "First 22" would have been gloating 
over the "Last 32" if Urban West had made "unexpected and drastic" price 
increases instead (Letters, Feb. 4). 
</P>
<P>
This was the practice last year, when greed and profiteering was rampant among 
sellers, and buyers were being caught up in the frenzy, fueled by anticipation 
of overnight riches. Now it appears that the bottom of the pyramid is being 
squeezed, and prospective buyers are demanding quality homes at truly 
affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that costs to build a new home (or sell an existing one) did not 
skyrocket as rapidly as prices did over the last few years, so where did all 
that extra money go? Buyers should think about this and strive to get lower 
prices instead of simply relying on the "creative financing" games popular with 
banks and real estate brokers that only serve to keep prices (and quick 
profits) sky high.

FEES ON OWNER-BUILDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty-five years ago as an owner-builder, I constructed my home in La Puente. 
It was of modest size and adequate for raising our family. 
</P>
<P>
Now that our children are on their own, we decided, now was a good time to add 
on. Got my plans and applied for a permit as an owner-builder. 
</P>
<P>
In order to get a permit, aside from the regular fees, was a developer fee 
imposed by the Whittier School District of $1.50 per foot for new construction. 
</P>
<P>
My question: Why should this burden apply to a long-term resident who has paid 
the school taxes before, during and after my children have left the system? 
Eighteen hundred dollars tacked on just about puts me in limbo for this 
project. What was the intent of the developer fee legislation? Was it to help 
the school districts where developers created a need for new schools or also to 
penalize long-term residents improving their property, with no intention of 
burdening the schools with new students? 
</P>
<P>
As a retiree I was looking forward to this project, but apparently government 
seems to destroy initiative, miss out on new taxes and lose generated sales 
taxes.

The problem I see with the new Real Estate section is the growing space I need

HOW TO SAVE ON TAXES WHEN YOU WORK AT HOME; 
</P>
<P>
DEDUCTIONS: YOU MAY BE ABLE TO CONSIDER A PORTION OF YOUR UTILITIES, FIRE 
INSURANCE, PROPERTY TAXES AND MORTGAGE INSURANCE AS LEGAL WRITE-OFFS. 
</P>

By ROBERT J. BRUSS

<TEXT>
<P>
Operating a full- or part-time business from your home may be more profitable 
than you think. Or perhaps your employer does not furnish suitable work space 
and requires you to work from your residence. 
</P>
<P>
If you qualify, part of your home utilities, fire insurance, repairs, mortgage 
interest, property taxes and even depreciation of your business area in the 
home can become tax-deductible as business expense. 
</P>
<P>
Internal Revenue Code 280A(c) allows home business tax deductions if your home 
office or shop area is your principal business location and is used to meet 
clients or patients. If you are an employee, your use of your home for business 
must be "for the convenience of the employer." 
</P>
<P>
However, your home business does not have to be a full-time job. But it cannot 
be just a hobby or an avocation. 
</P>
<P>
In the leading Tax Court case, a dermatologist who worked at a hospital and 
managed his real estate holdings from his home was entitled to deduct some of 
his home office expenses (73 TC 61). 
</P>
<P>
But in the Moller case (553 Fed.2d 1071), a stock and bond investor was denied 
"office at home" deductions because the court felt such investing was not a 
business. Other examples of nonqualifying circumstances include a realty 
salesperson who works at home and at an office where the broker provides a desk 
and phone. 
</P>
<P>
Employees have an especially difficult time deducting home business expenses. 
Schoolteachers, for example, who bring work home, generally cannot deduct part 
of their residence expenses if their school has suitable work space, since the 
school is considered the teacher's primary business location. 
</P>
<P>
But a few Tax Court decisions do allow home office deductions for teachers 
whose schools do not provide quiet and safe office space. 
</P>
<P>
When your home is your principal business location for your full- or part-time 
business, or if your employer requires you to work at home, the next test 
requires you to have an "exclusive business area." 
</P>
<P>
However, this area need not be a separate room. Several Tax Court decisions 
have accepted deductions for part of a room, such as a desk and file cabinets 
located in a bedroom. But the business area cannot also be used for personal 
use, such as a den used by the family as well as for an office. 
</P>
<P>
When you qualify for the home business use tax deduction, a portion of your 
"business area" expenses become tax deductible as business deductions. Even 
renters can deduct part of their rent for the business portion of their 
apartment or house. 
</P>
<P>
Strictly business expenses such as a telephone line coming into your home 
business area are deductible. Another fully deductible example would be 
painting your home office or shop area. 
</P>
<P>
The apportioned deductions can be calculated either on a square-footage basis 
or by room count. To illustrate, if you have a 1,600-square-foot home and your 
400-square-foot extra bedroom is used exclusively for business, then 25% of 
your applicable home business expenses, such as insurance, utilities and 
maintenance, become tax-deductible. In addition, you can depreciate the 
"business area" of your home by using the 31.5-year straight-line commercial 
depreciation rate. 
</P>
<P>
You may even be able to deduct your automobile business mileage if you start 
your business day from your office at home. In the recent Leitch decision of 
the Tax Court (TC Memo 1989-549), auto travel expenses were held to be 
deductible for a building inspector whose home office was the "focal point" of 
his daily business activities. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Tax Reform Act imposed limits on home office deductions. The maximum 
deduction is the net income earned from the home business activity. Employees 
required to use their home for business can deduct qualified business expenses 
that exceed 2% of their adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you earned $10,000 net income from your home business activity, 
then your maximum home business deductions would be limited to $10,000, even if 
you can justify a higher deduction. 
</P>
<P>
Home business deductions cannot create a tax loss to shelter your ordinary 
income from tax. But any leftover non-deductible home business losses can be 
carried forward to future tax years. Consult your tax adviser for more details.

PLANTING: SELECT SMALL PLOT, TURN SOIL, ADD AMENDMENTS AND FERTILIZER, AND 
WATER PROPERLY TO GET PROFUSION OF BLOOMS.

<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ELLEN GUFFEY, Mary Ellen Guffey tends a prize-winning Malibu garden. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A friend of mine said recently, "I'm thinking of getting back into flower 
gardening. Where do I start?" 
</P>
<P>
First, start with a small plot of land -- say, no more than 100 square feet. A 
10-by-10-foot square produces 100 square feet, but a plot with such dimensions 
would be hard to maintain because you couldn't reach the center without walking 
on the soil. 
</P>
<P>
And a cardinal rule of good gardening is to avoid walking on, and thus 
compacting, garden soil. Better to design a long, narrow bed, with dimensions 
such as 4-by-25 feet. 
</P>
<P>
No garden in California can flourish without an efficient irrigation system. 
One of my neighbors tried for years to grow flowers, planting them hopefully 
each spring, just before her mother came to visit. But each year they fizzled 
out after mother left. Main problem? Insufficient water. Sooner or later, a 
gardener who relies solely upon hand watering will fail. 
</P>
<P>
Overhead sprinklers work well when plants are small. However, as plants grow 
tall and bloom, the flowers are knocked over by the water from the sprinklers. 
I've started to use irrigation hoses called "leaky pipe." These hoses lie on 
the surface of the soil (or can be buried just below) and ooze water to the 
root area. 
</P>
<P>
After assuring water, get the soil ready for digging. It's usually best to 
water the target area a few days before you plan to dig. Moist, but not soggy 
soil is easiest to turn over. 
</P>
<P>
But how do you know whether your soil is too soggy to dig? Use the hand-squeeze 
test. Soil is ready to dig if a handful crumbles when squeezed; if instead it 
makes a dense ball, wait for it to dry somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a step that many gardeners underestimate: use organic soil amendment in 
preparing the soil. The least expensive is redwood amendment or redwood 
compost; these additives improve any soil, whether it's clay or sandy. Be sure 
that the amendment you choose has been either composted (allowed to break down 
naturally) or nitrolized (had nitrogen added). 
</P>
<P>
Even though my own garden soil is excellent loam, I add many bags of KRA 
organic amendment or Bandini soil builder each time I plant. Because of my 
intensive flower growing, the soil needs to be regularly replenished. For a 
100-square-foot plot, use four 3-cubic foot bags of amendment. Spread the 
amendment on the top of the soil before you turn it over. 
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer should also be added at this time. Choose a granulated fertilizer 
that contains some phosphorus, because this element does not filter through the 
soil. If you don't place it in the root zone, it can't be added later when the 
plants are growing. Use as much as the package directions suggest for a 
100-foot area, and spread it evenly on top of the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the fun. Spading a garden -- if it's small and if you spread the task 
over a couple of days -- is one of life's genuine pleasures. Turn over the soil 
to a depth of 9 or 10 inches, working in the amendment and fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
For particularly hard soil, you may wish to dig twice, first to loosen the soil 
and then to mix in the soil amendment and fertilizer. When you finish, the soil 
should be loose and fluffy. 
</P>
<P>
After the soil has settled, select plants from the nursery. Smaller plants in 
pony packs and six-packs are better than quart- or gallon-sized containers. 
Even though they take longer to bear their first flowers, smaller plants 
produce more total flowers in a season -- because of their well-developed root 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
And smaller plants don't dry out as quickly as the roots of larger plants that 
are concentrated in a small area. Moreover, smaller plants are easier to plant 
and they're much cheaper than larger plants. 
</P>
<P>
Apply a diluted liquid fertilizer two weeks after planting and again about 
every four weeks during the growing season. To control weeds and keep the soil 
moist, spread a 1-inch layer of organic amendment around the plants as a mulch. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of plants to grow depends upon what you want: a cutting garden, a 
kitchen garden combining vegetables and flowers, a perennial border or an 
annual display. I like maximum color and flowers for vases; hence I choose 
fast-blooming annuals and perennials. Some of my spring favorites are blue 
salvia, Shasta daisies, coreopsis, larkspur, dianthus and annual phlox. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing, though, is to know what you are getting. Don't expect a 
gallon-sized, fully blooming foxglove that is resplendent at the nursery, for 
example, to continue blooming throughout the season once you plant it. It 
won't. Foxgloves, and many other perennials, should be planted in the fall for 
color in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Ask questions when you shop. You'll generally get good advice from garden

IN THE GARDEN: TAKING A CUT AT THE FINE ART OF ROSE PRUNING; 
</P>
<P>
FLOWERS: EFFECTS OF PROFESSIONAL PRUNING CAN BE SEEN AT THE HUNTINGTON. BUT 
WATER, FERTILIZER AND SUN HAVE MORE TO DO WITH ACHIEVING RESULTS. 
</P>

<P>
Rose pruning requires no magic spells or special incantations; it is not, as 
some seem to think, most akin to voodoo. It is not even that important. Plenty 
of water and fertilizer and lots of sun have more to do with the health and 
vigor of a rose. 
</P>
<P>
But pruning does tend to keep a plant shapely, in bounds and flowering. "You 
really can't hurt them," say Clair Martin who oversees the Huntington Botanical 
Gardens' 2,000 or so roses. 
</P>
<P>
A walk around the Huntington's rose garden at this time of the year, when the 
roses are all pruned and tidied up, is illuminating. You can't help but notice, 
with the roses bare of leaves, that they are spaced reasonably far apart so 
they are not crowded. At least 3 to 4 feet separate each. Having enough room 
and no competition makes sure that each rose gets its share of water, 
fertilizer and light. 
</P>
<P>
And, it is easy at this time of the year to see how they were pruned. All of 
the branches are evenly spaced on the plant. About 3 to 4 inches separate the 
closest. These plants have not been cut back drastically. Though much material 
has been removed, plenty of small branches remain so there will be lots of 
leaves early on and as a direct result, lots of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Says Martin: "The English method of pruning that is so widely copied in this 
country (where plants are cut back to a few thick canes) forces the plant to 
start all over again each year. You get bigger flowers but fewer of them. All 
the plant's efforts go into growing, not flowering, and at the Huntington we 
most want flowers, lots of them." 
</P>
<P>
Watch Martin prune a rose and you see that he begins at the front, because he 
wants to shape the rose so it is lower in front and higher in back, giving it a 
slightly rounded shape that will show off the flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The first branches to go are any that make getting between the rose bushes 
difficult or downright dangerous. He then removes lots of the twiggy inner 
growth and twiggy branches low on the plant because "I don't think these do 
much for the rose." By the time he finishes, most branches are "larger than the 
diameter of a pencil," an old rule-of-thumb. 
</P>
<P>
Next he looks for old canes that don't have strong new growth coming from them 
and branches that are rubbing or crossing, and removes these. Most often there 
are no old canes that must be removed, but there are plenty of "crossovers." 
</P>
<P>
Where a number of branches are growing from the same place on a cane, he tends 
to leave just one or two that are facing out from the plant, or up. He also 
tries to leave several "eyes" or buds on each branch so there are plenty of 
opportunities for new growth. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his cuts are made just above a bud or eye, which tends to direct the 
new growth up, instead of out. "People often leave too long a stub above the 
bud," and he adds that you have to hold the pruning shears just the right way 
so the blade cuts close. 
</P>
<P>
The shears used should be very sharp and cut clean. To make sure, Martin keeps 
a whetstone in his pocket. A few passes of the stone over the beveled side of 
the blade (he never hones the flat side) does the trick. Good shears also help. 
He uses a pair of Swiss-made Felcos. He often steps back to see how the plant 
is shaping up. 
</P>
<P>
"I look for the branches to be evenly spaced around the bush and try to direct 
new growth to fill voids," he says. Directing growth is simply a matter of 
making cuts just above buds that face in the direction you want growth to go. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, all the leaves are pulled off, or if they resist, cut off. 
</P>
<P>
All of the roses are pruned pretty much the same at the Huntington (except the 
climbers). On hybrid teas, he tries to open up the center of the plant a 
little, and floribundas are left a little bushier, but even the new Austin 
roses and the old roses are pruned in a similar fashion, though some are 
naturally pruned much higher than others because they are bigger plants. 
</P>
<P>
When all is said and done, however, you need something to prune. At the 
Huntington, there are lots of canes and branches to select from, and that is a 
result of fertilizer and water and a good soil, not pruning.

COMMERCIAL SCENE: PACIFIC SELLS INTEREST IN ABC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Financial Group has sold its interest in Century City's ABC 
Entertainment Center to an investment group led by City Center Group partners 
Juri Ripinsky and Malcolm Kingston for about $55 million, local brokers report. 
</P>
<P>
ABC Entertainment Center Associates acquired an exclusive leasehold interest in 
the 580,000-square-foot complex for a term set to expire in a little more than 
12 years. 
</P>
<P>
When the lease runs out, both the property and two office buildings at 
2020-2040 Century Park East revert to affiliates of JMB Realty Corp. and the 
Prudential Insurance Corp., which own the land through Delta Towers Joint 
Venture. 
</P>
<P>
As Century City's biggest landlord, JMB may extend the lease beyond the year 
2002 or pursue the site's original master plan, which would mean replacing the 
current six-story office/retail/theater center with two high-rise office 
buildings. Name tenant ABC's master lease for 186,000 square feet is set to end 
in 12 years too. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Ripinsky declined repeated requests for comment on his Feb. 1 purchase, 
but brokers close to the deal report that he and his fellow investors assumed 
an estimated $49-million note originally executed by seller Pacific Financial 
of Beverly Hills with a Japanese lender. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Financial has been selling most of its Los Angeles office portfolio 
amid speculation that its four partners are splitting up after 10 years in 
business. Other properties sold within the last several months by the partners 
include 9000 Sunset Blvd. and 9107 Wilshire Blvd. in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate brokers familiar with Ripinsky describe him as a very private deal 
maker who has collected his commercial real estate portfolio with little money 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Other City Center-related assets include an office building with the same name 
at 3810 Wilshire Blvd., another at 6380 Wilshire and the former Ohrbach's 
department store site at Wilshire and Fairfax Avenue, which is set to become a 
new retail center. 
</P>
<P>
With just a few million dollars, noted Robert Sonnenblick, managing director of 
Sonnenblick-Goldman of California, Ripinsky now has his name associated with 
one of L.A.'s most recognized buildings. Sonnenblick, who represented both 
sides in the transaction, added that "it has given the buyer a much higher 
profile in Los Angeles, and that's already leading to more good deals." 
</P>
<P>
With the Century City complex 99% leased, Ripinsky hopes to have no problem 
keeping up with his loan payments. A downturn in occupancy, however, could 
place the lender at risk, said finance experts familiar with such deals. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Northrop Corp. announced last month it was selling two nearby 
Century City towers to the Sacramento-based California State Teachers' 
Retirement System for an estimated $200 million. Northrop, however, will 
continue to lease office space in its headquarters building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SALES 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Office Towers Sold 
</P>
<P>
Bentall Development Co. of Vancouver, B.C. paid FIMSA Inc. $34 million for the 
12-story One Pacific Tower and the six-story One Pacific Plaza II office 
buildings in Huntington Beach. The buildings encompass 285,000 square feet and 
are a little more than half occupied. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service plans to build a north Los Angeles County distribution 
center on 62.4 acres being purchased from the Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. in 
Valencia for $26.8 million. Close of escrow is set for April 1. Projected 
completion is slated for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Neil Senturia is offering 26 acres in Pacific Palisades' Las Pulgas 
Canyon for $10.5 million after his plan to build 50 homes there hit a wall of 
opposition from nearby residents. Senturia bought the canyon in 1987 for $1.6 
million and cut a road into it without permission from the California Coastal 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Zellner Housing Corp. of Costa Mesa is now known as Zellner Communities L.P., 
after its acquisition by NVR L.P., a Virginia-based home builder with Los 
Angeles and San Francisco operations through H.R. Remington Properties L.P. 
</P>
<P>
Zellner Communities has 1,200 homes under development, including nine new 
Inland Empire projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

INTERIORS: HOW TO KEEP THOSE HOME FIRES BURNING SAFELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS GIBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our ancestors worshipped fire for nearly half a million years. Today we still 
derive physical and spiritual comfort from the sight, sound and smell of a 
crackling fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not an efficient heat source. More hot air goes up the chimney than 
into the room. Better heaters have been around for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, until World War I, most U.S. homes were warmed by fireplaces. When new 
houses were built without them, Americans huddled before coldly flaming gas 
logs and flickering red light bulbs set in make-believe grates. 
</P>
<P>
Fireplaces were finally brought back because, practical or not, nothing 
surpasses their cheerfulness, peace and charm. 
</P>
<P>
Building a masonry fireplace is expensive, painstaking work. The firebox, 
sloping at just the right angles, must be in exact proportion to the flue. 
</P>
<P>
The midsection must be accurately made, the damper strategically set, the 
chimney meticulously designed. Special firebricks, fireclay and mortar must be 
used. Everything must be carefully distanced from surrounding construction. 
</P>
<P>
The slightest imprecision may send smoke billowing into the room or cause the 
house to burn down. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s, factory-built fireplaces were introduced. Now available in 
all sizes, shapes and styles, they are less costly, firebrick-lined, perfectly 
engineered and almost indistinguishable from their masonry antecedents. 
</P>
<P>
Kits include prefabricated chimneys, efficient heat-recirculation devices and 
gas starters. No clearance is required; they can be set directly into existing 
walls at any level without risk of combustion. They are restoring traditional 
hearths to American homes. 
</P>
<P>
See-through models are ideal for window walls, for indoor-outdoor use and to 
serve adjacent rooms. Corner and three-sided models augment visibility and are 
elegant room dividers. Most dramatic are free-standing models open on all four 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
Adding a fireplace can boost real estate value and make a home more livable, 
especially when it's installed where it will be most appreciated. A family that 
gathers in the kitchen seldom needs a parlor fireplace. A working couple 
probably needs a raised bedroom hearth they can see and enjoy from their bed. 
</P>
<P>
Placement may also be determined by chimney site, by limitations on chimney 
location and by the convenience of using one chimney to accommodate more than 
one fireplace or barbecue -- back-to-back, side-by-side or on an upper or lower 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Emphasis is another variable. A spectacular fireplace or fire pit dominates a 
room. 
</P>
<P>
But, if the focal point is a breathtaking view or a magnificent antique, a 
subtler hearth is required. It can blend into a wall of paintings and sculpture 
or a wall of books, TV and stereo equipment. Where space is limited, it can be 
angled across a corner, tucked into a niche or beneath a staircase. Some raised 
hearths resemble portholes. 
</P>
<P>
Renovating an existing masonry fireplace is sometimes easy; other times not 
worth the trouble. A droplight lowered down the chimney may reveal birds' 
nests, loose or fallen bricks and other obvious problems. 
</P>
<P>
But only a reputable fireplace contractor or chimney sweep is trained to deal 
with structural flaws, barely detectable holes and cracks, brick or mortar 
deterioration and soot or creosote buildup. Any of these might cause a 
disastrous roof fire. 
</P>
<P>
Chimneys bonded with lime mortar before the advent of portland cement are apt 
to crumble. The wood surrounding old, single-layer brick chimneys may have 
turned to combustible charcoal. Flues often need liners and caps. 
</P>
<P>
An inconveniently located hearth can be replaced by a factory-built hearth, its 
flue offset to reach the existing chimney. Or the hearth can be reversed for 
use in the room behind. A raised hearth can be dropped to floor level. 
</P>
<P>
A fireplace can be made to appear larger, smaller or differently shaped without 
internal alteration. Drafty old hearths can be updated with energy-saving 
dampers, vents, fans, glass doors and heat-exchange pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners who find a walled-up fireplace are advised to look down the chimney 
and, if it seems sound, chip away a small viewing hole before dismantling the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes what seems to be a plastered-over fireplace is actually an old 
heater. It may have a roof exhaust, camouflaged as a chimney, which can be used 
to vent a factory-built unit. 
</P>
<P>
Fireplaces can be face lifted to harmonize with the style or spirit of a room. 
</P>
<P>
In a contemporary setting, the mantel may be removed, the front painted or 
paneled to match walls, the firebox faced with molding, mirror, granite, or 
whatever suits. In a period room, the contemporary hearth may be "aged" with a 
Louis XIV marble front, an arched Victorian or hand-carved Colonial mantel, a 
rough-hewn Gothic facade or a kitsch Art Deco fireplace-surround. 
</P>
<P>
A rustic timbered hearth can be gentrified with a rococo mirror, a graceful 
shelf, a pair of salvage yard corbels and a Pottery Barn antiquing or marbling 
kit. 
</P>
<P>
New, antique and custom fireplaces, stoves, mantels and accessories are sold 
and repaired by specialty stores such as Paykel in Santa Monica, Tulanian's in 
Sherman Oaks and Wilshire Fireplace Shops in Beverly Hills and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Paykel also sells gas logs, "electric fires" and alcohol-burning hearths which 
require no chimneys. Wilshire sells antique hearth benches and inglenooks. 
</P>
<P>
Fine old mantels from demolished mansions are sold by salvage dealers such as 
Architectural Imports in Pasadena, Scavengers Paradise in North Hollywood and 
MRM Contractors in Los Angeles.

WHAT TO DO IF YOUR FIREPLACE SMOKES 
</P>
<P>
Some causes and solutions for smoke escaping into the room. 
</P>
<P>
Cause: Solution 
</P>
<P>
No cross-ventilation.: Open a window. 
</P>
<P>
Firebox too large for flue.: Raise bottom of firebox with firebricks. 
</P>
<P>
Chimney damage or blockage.: Repair. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby roof, tree or TV antenna: Raise chimney with an extension cap. 
</P>
<P>
disrupting air flow. 
</P>
<P>
Damper set too low.: Lower top of firebox with firebricks. 
</P>
<P>
Double-faced fireplace smokes.: Seal one side with glass door while using other 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Open fire smokes.: Add a hood or flue-top fan. 
</P>
<P>
None of the above.: Consult a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fireplace Basics 
</P>
<P>
A few precautions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A frequently used fireplace should be cleaned and inspected annually. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fireplace door, curtain or screen should be a bit higher and wider than 
firebox opening. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Glass and solid-mesh doors are safest in homes with children. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Metal stoves and metal fireplaces can severely burn children. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Metal stoves and metal prefabs cannot be tiled. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coal is too hot for most hearths. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never barbecue in a fireplace. It can't tolerate grease. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never extend an unprotected stovepipe through a ceiling or wooden roof. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Store TV or stereo at least one foot from fireplace, never directly above 
it, or components may burn out.

PARTY IN VERACRUZ; 
</P>
<P>
MEXICO'S FUN-LOVING PORT ENJOYS ONE OF THE LIVELIEST CARNIVALS IN THE CARIBBEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

free-lance writers researching a book in Mexico.

VERACRUZ, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The only madhouse with a sea view." That's how one Jarocho, as locals here are 
known, characterizes this city. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the boisterous street life of this bustling port on the Gulf of Mexico 
frequently verges on the insane. Veracruz's zocalo has a reputation, in fact, 
as Mexico's liveliest central square. 
</P>
<P>
And at this time of the year things get even livelier. The week before Lent 
brings the annual carnaval, and to understand it, a visitor first must 
understand what passes for normal in Veracruz, especially around the white 
colonnaded zocalo. 
</P>
<P>
In sidewalk bars, white-shirted waiters pile bottles of beer precariously on 
tables already overloaded with empties. Mariachi bands serenade the crowd, 
while strolling trumpeters, harpists and marimba players in silver-trimmed 
uniforms and oversized sombreros offer song lists to prospective customers. A 
white-faced mime, or perhaps a troupe of lavishly costumed dancers, performs 
for an audience gathered around the central fountain. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a moving market threads its way between the cafe tables. 
Vendors offer goods of all kinds -- silk hammocks and pistachios, cigarettes 
and embroidered dresses, preposterous model ships several feet long and 
elaborately rigged, even Polaroid snapshots to commemorate your evening in 
Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
This is everyday Veracruz. But the city really comes into its own during the 
weeklong carnival, when it plays host to one of the biggest fiestas between New 
Orleans and Rio de Janeiro. This year it is set for Feb. 20-28. 
</P>
<P>
All work comes to a halt during the carnival, and everyone -- visitor and 
native alike -- gets down to the serious business of having fun. Each day the 
streets are filled with colorful parades that begin in mid-afternoon, when 
revelers have recovered from the festivities of the night before, and last into 
the early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-age beauty queens wave from atop outlandish floats (a giant fish on 
wheels, for instance), uniformed bands march endlessly, and neighborhood 
musicians play odd instruments that have no names in English. 
</P>
<P>
Squalls of confetti fill the air. Salsa, rumba, tango, calypso -- all the music 
of the Caribbean dances its way past the crowds watching from street level or 
from balconies. Many people sport elaborate costumes -- some older folks, for 
example, dress in the fashions of their youth, while others parade about 
disguised as the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl or perhaps as Batman. 
</P>
<P>
The carnival has always carried an undertone of social and political satire 
amid the festivity. This has not always set well with the authorities, but 
attempts by government to tone down the exuberance have invariably failed. 
</P>
<P>
This year, as in years past, the first of more than 40 floats will celebrate 
the ritual burning of Bad Humor, a larger-than-life, papier-mache character 
dressed in black and scowling. In previous carnivals, Bad Humor has lampooned 
corrupt politicians or police officials. This year former Panamanian dictator 
Manuel Noriega is one candidate for the role; another is President Bush. 
Jarochos like to poke fun through their choice and at the same time make a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of the carnival there is the symbolic funeral of Juan Carnaval, 
not a papier-mache caricature this time but a real person who wanders about the 
city surrounded by grieving women draped in mourning attire. Juan will, of 
course, be reborn the following year. 
</P>
<P>
In between the burning of Bad Humor and the mock funeral of Juan Carnaval, the 
city throws what is virtually a nonstop party. All-night dances fill the 
plazas. Fireworks erupt almost continuously. The spirit is intoxicating, and 
those who begin as spectators usually end up as participants. 
</P>
<P>
Veracruz's light-hearted approach to life may well be a result of its turbulent 
past. 
</P>
<P>
In 1519, Hernando Cortes and his army of Spanish Conquistadors landed at the 
tiny island of San Juan de Ulua in Veracruz harbor. They negotiated with envoys 
of the Aztec emperor Montezuma, set up a shrine to the Virgin Mary and founded 
the first Spanish town in the Americas. They optimistically named it Villa Rica 
de la Vera Cruz -- the Rich Town of the True Cross. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan de Ulua and the harbor were vital in the country's trade and defense. 
In the 16th Century the port was repeatedly attacked by pirates, and after such 
infamous marauders as John Hawkins and Francis Drake successfully plundered 
Veracruz, the authorities of New Spain fortified the island. Even so, during a 
17th-Century raid the soldiers stationed at the fort deserted their posts 
because they hadn't been paid, and the town succumbed to Dutch buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
Today the "island" of San Juan is connected by a highway to the mainland and is 
home port to naval ships and enormous industrial tankers, signs of Veracruz's 
latter-day development as the largest city and busiest port in the oil-rich 
state of Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-minute bus ride from the town center, the old fort, in contrast to the 
concrete jungle of the shipyards, looks like a kindergartner's idea of a 
castle, complete with moat, drawbridge and dungeons. Its wind-swept balustrades 
look out over the Gulf of Mexico. Deep inside are dank, rough-hewn dungeons 
known as Glory, Purgatory and Hell. It is hard to believe that any of them were 
anything but hellish. 
</P>
<P>
Centuries after the last pirate attack the harbor continued to play a role in 
Mexico's defense. During the War of Independence, San Juan's fort was the final 
stronghold of the Spanish, who were expelled by anti-colonial forces after a 
long and bloody battle in 1825. In the so-called Pastry War of 1838, the French 
invaded Veracruz, claiming that the Mexican government owed them money for 
damaged property. The supposedly impregnable fort of San Juan capitulated 
readily to France's superior firepower. But the French later were persuaded to 
withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also invaded Mexico, twice using Veracruz as the starting 
point. During the Mexican-American War in 1847, Gen. Winfield Scott attacked 
Veracruz, leading troops hurriedly through the town on the way to Mexico City 
to avoid the perennial yellow fever that plagued the coastal area. 
</P>
<P>
During the Mexican Revolution, Woodrow Wilson sent the U.S. fleet to subdue 
Veracruz and hence protect the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
To honor the town's resistance to those four foreign invasions, Veracruz 
officially proclaims itself "four times heroic." 
</P>
<P>
The Museo Cultural de la Ciudad, Veracruz's city museum on Avenida Zaragoza 
between Calle Canal and Calle Morales, celebrates these feats. It also offers 
intriguing details on the town's history, such as the number of times it burned 
down during the 17th Century (four, aided by fierce northerly winds) and major 
goods that once passed through the port (such as hand grenades, silk and olive 
oil from Spain, and chile, cocoa, tobacco and gold from the colony). 
</P>
<P>
Frequent epidemics during the 17th and 18th centuries, due to its humid 
tropical climate and mosquito-infested jungles, earned Veracruz the nicknames 
"Port of Hell" and "Graveyard of the Living." 
</P>
<P>
Early Spanish settlers hurried inland to more civilized regions. Left behind in 
Veracruz were sailors, merchants, Caribbean and African slaves, and random 
wanderers just looking for a good time. 
</P>
<P>
Out of this multicultural blend of starry-eyed adventurers and sturdy vagabonds 
emerged the Jarocho, or Veracruz native. Jarocho culture is reckless, 
irreverent, insubordinate, and has produced some memorable political escapades. 
</P>
<P>
In the 17th Century, for example, an Angolan slave named Yanga -- who was 
either a bandit or liberator of the oppressed, depending on whom you talk to -- 
led the first slave revolt in the New World. In this century vociferous 
Veracruz prostitutes ignited a tenants' rebellion that helped precipitate a 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Modern Jarochos are more laid-back than revolutionary; they talk slowly, dress 
casually, and excel in music and dance. Music is inescapable. In the zocalo 
alone, you hear four or five varieties at once on almost any evening throughout 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Those visitors inspired to try swinging to the Latin beat should head for La 
Bamba, a waterfront club named after the world-famous dance that supposedly 
originated in Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
At a little bar called La Bella Epoca, two blocks southwest of the zocalo on a 
pedestrian alleyway, a band of funky old men play guitars, drums and percussive 
gourds in the home-grown style of "sol" -- not soul, but sun -- which began in 
the 1940s. The bar's regulars, who look old enough to know, claim that the same 
individuals who play today were among the founders of this syncopated, eclectic 
musical style. 
</P>
<P>
Jarochos are fond of music and equally fond of good food, particularly seafood, 
which is fresh and inexpensive here. The best seafood restaurants are in the 
village of Boca del Rio, on the Rio Jamapa about five miles south of Veracruz. 
There the restaurant most often recommended is Pardino's, which is a little 
more upscale than the rest, serving such dishes as octopus or sea bass with 
Veracruzana sauce -- a delicious mixture of onion, garlic, tomatoes, olives, 
green pepper and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
A good place in Veracruz to try some traditional Mexican favorites, meanwhile, 
is Restaurant Tlaquepaque, three blocks from the zocalo. There, combinations of 
marinated meats and fresh vegetables on tortillas can be enjoyed for less than 
$5 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations are no problem in Veracruz, either, except during the carnival. 
The city has an enormous range of hotels, all of which are reasonably priced by 
U.S. standards. For a visit during carnival time, reservations must be made 
months ahead. A few rooms are available for this year's event, but only in the 
budget hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The most luxurious hotel on the zocalo is the Hotel Veracruz, where lovely 
air-conditioned rooms cost about $75 a night. Those who prefer a beach-side 
setting would do well to check out the architecturally splendid Hotel Mocambo, 
a few miles south of town at Playa Mocambo. The Hotel Mocambo has an outdoor 
pool set among spacious patios. Rooms are about $60 a night. More lavish and 
more expensive resorts share the same stretch of coast, where the dark-sand 
beaches are the best in the area. 
</P>
<P>
For the more budget-minded traveler, several hotels near the zocalo -- such as 
the Hotel Imperial, the Concha Dorado and the Hotel Rex -- make up in charm 
what they lack in luxury, offering reasonable accommodations for less than $15 
a night. 
</P>
<P>
How to get there: Veracruz is easily reached from Mexico City. Mexicana offers 
40-minute flights from the capital twice a day. First-class ADO buses take 
about six hours, and leave hourly. There are no direct flights to Veracruz from 
the United States.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: LEGISLATION THAT'S TRYING TO GET OFF THE GROUND; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: A BILL OF RIGHTS INTENDED TO PROTECT PASSENGERS AGAINST SUCH COMMON 
FRUSTRATIONS AS FLIGHT DELAYS, CANCELLATIONS AND LOST LUGGAGE HAS BEEN 
INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chances are you haven't heard of House Resolution No. 3528. It was introduced 
last Oct. 25 by Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.). But it's a safe bet that any 
airline passenger who has heard of the bill has supported it. 
</P>
<P>
Stark's legislation is called the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights, and it's 
designed to deal with many of the aspects of airline travel that annoy, 
infuriate and otherwise inconvenience us: delays, cancellations, lost luggage, 
confusing air fares and frequent flier program rules. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a summary of the key points of H.R. 3528: 
</P>
<P>
 -- An air carrier may not cancel a flight within 72 hours of its scheduled 
departure time for any reason other than safety (or, unless there are 
absolutely no passengers at all for that flight). 
</P>
<P>
 -- An air carrier that cancels a flight in violation of this section must 
compensate passengers in the same manner as if such a person was involuntarily 
denied boarding ($200 if another flight gets the passenger to his destination 
within an hour of the original schedule, up to $400 if alternative 
transportation takes two or more hours). 
</P>
<P>
 -- If a scheduled departure is going to be delayed by 15 minutes or more, the 
carrier must notify passengers before they board. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Department of Transportation must establish one toll-free number for 
complaints and one toll-free number for providing consumers with comparable air 
carrier service. 
</P>
<P>
 -- All air carriers must establish toll-free numbers to receive and handle 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Air carriers must notify passengers about fares of limited availability, 
fares to which restrictions apply, fares that are limited to a certain number 
of seats on a flight, fares to which a restriction pertains (advance purchase 
of tickets, refundability of money used to buy tickets, minimum-stay 
requirements). 
</P>
<P>
 -- No airline or travel agent can sell a ticket unless they notify the 
consumer of the lowest fare available for that flight, the time and date of 
expiration of the ticket, and toll-free numbers established by the DOT. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carriers must make tickets available that do not include the price of food 
and beverages. If a passenger doesn't want to eat airline food, he doesn't have 
to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carriers with frequent flier programs must disclose any limitations or 
restrictions in a clear, concise manner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If a carrier has a frequent flier program, it cannot exclude any date on 
which the passenger wants to redeem his benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the carrier changes terms or conditions of the program, individuals 
enrolled must be notified in writing at least 180 days before the changes take 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The DOT must issue regulations requiring air carriers to use a standard 
claim form for handling claims of lost or damaged baggage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carriers must reimburse passengers within 30 days of a submitted claim for 
lost or damaged baggage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last, any airline violating any provision of this legislation would be 
subject to fines of $10,000 for each violation. 
</P>
<P>
The Stark bill obviously addresses some important issues, but I have a few of 
my own amendments to suggest, and most of them deal with the subject of delays. 
Here's my wish list of proposed new rules: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Disclosure. Once passengers board a flight, if that flight is then delayed 
at the gate more than 15 minutes, the airline has to inform passengers the 
specific nature of the delay and a reasonable estimate of its duration. For 
delays not caused by air traffic control or weather (i.e., mechanical delays), 
the airline is required to update passengers with detailed information every 10 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Passenger options. For flights delayed at the gate more than 30 minutes 
(for reasons other than air traffic or weather), the airline is required to 
open the aircraft doors and give passengers the option of disembarking and 
seeking alternate air transportation, which the airline must then facilitate in 
good faith and at no additional cost to the passenger. 
</P>
<P>
For flights delayed more than 30 minutes (for reasons other than air traffic or 
weather) on planes not parked at the gate, the airline is then required to 
return to the gate to give passengers the same alternate transportation option 
as above. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Additional provisions for delays. This rule applies to flights of two hours 
or more. Each passenger who elects to stay on an aircraft that is delayed, for 
reasons other than air traffic control or weather, will be properly and 
directly compensated by the airline for his/her inconvenience on a prorated 
scale based on the air fare each passenger paid. 
</P>
<P>
Compensation will start once the time delay exceeds one hour, and will increase 
proportionately as the delay increases, with a maximum compensation figure to 
be no greater than 50% of the air fare paid by the passenger within any 24-hour 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cancellations. This rule applies to any flight departing from a U.S. city 
or a flight with an immediate destination in a U.S. city. If the flight is 
canceled for any reason other than air traffic control or weather, the airline 
is responsible to obtain alternate transportation for passengers at no 
additional cost to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Additional provisions for cancellations and alternate transportation. 
Alternate transportation must be provided at least in the same class or fare 
category as originally purchased by the passenger. Once a flight is canceled, 
if the next available flight -- on any airline -- departs within two hours, the 
original airline is relieved of any further responsiblity. 
</P>
<P>
If the next available flight departs between two and six hours later, the 
original airline is responsible for providing a meal to passengers, as well as 
one free long distance telephone call to each passenger requesting one. 
</P>
<P>
If the next available flight departs more than six hours later, the original 
airline is responsible for providing hotel accommodations, meals and one free 
telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
And if the next available flight departs more than 12 hours later, the original 
airline will then be subjected to the sliding compensation scale. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, these proposals (both the Stark bill and my own suggestions) 
are not popular with airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think the Stark bill deals with the real issues," says Bill Jackman, 
spokesman for the Air Transport Assn., the main lobbying group of America's 
major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is with the state of the infrastructure of the air transport 
system. We need to improve and upgrade airports and runways and equipment that 
can lessen delays." 
</P>
<P>
As for the other provisions of the Stark bill, Jackman said the numbers of 
incidents of cancellations and delays, mishandled or lost baggage or denied 
boardings, are inflated. 
</P>
<P>
For example, between January and August, 1989, there were 317,000 reports of 
lost or mishandled bags. "That's not a significant number," Jackman argues. 
"More than one million Americans fly every day on more than 18,500 flights." 
</P>
<P>
But what about the issue of economic cancellations? 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever thinks airlines cancel flights because of low load factors doesn't 
understand how airlines operate," Jackman says. "We can't get a plane from 
point B to point C if we don't fly it from point A to B. Some of the provisions 
of the Stark bill could result in more delays." 
</P>
<P>
In the short run, perhaps Jackman is right, because the airlines would have to 
come to grips with compliance. But probably not in the long run. The Airline 
Passenger Bill of Rights could very well serve to eliminate the capricious 
cancellations (flights canceled because of light passenger loads) that do 
happen, or flight delays caused by combining flights with other flights that 
have light passenger loads. 
</P>
<P>
In the area of aircraft maintenance, the bill would also serve as a strong 
financial incentive for airlines to do a better job at airports they serve 
frequently, but where they do not have maintenance personnel. 
</P>
<P>
At this writing, Stark's bill is awaiting a public hearing in the House Public 
Works and Transportation Committee. If you have any thoughts on the bill, now's 
the time to let the committee know. Write to the Chairman, Congressman Glenn 
Anderson, 2165 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20515.

Anyone remember when you could do Europe on $10 a day? This was back in the 
early '50s. And while it's possible barely to buy a good pizza for $10 these 
days, students can still do Corsica on 10 bucks a day. This is the island off 
the French mainland (Napoleon's birthplace), and for $10 you get lodging with a 
Corsican family and three meals a day. Or if you prefer, you can choose a 
dormitory for the same price in Ajaccio, the Corsican capital. The offer from 
the Corsican Travel &amp; Trade Commission is aimed at students (all ages), 
youngsters or seniors. The season gets under way in July, ends in September. 
Another offer involves a weekend cruise from Nice or Marseille to Corsica, with 
a return to Nice, for $99.

A Letter From Australia: "We would like to exchange our motor home for a 
similar one in California with anyone planning a visit to Australia. As seasons 
are reversed, traveling here is better between October and May, and if you want 
to visit the Outback (Alice Springs, Ayers Rock, Darwin) or the Great Barrier 
Reef (Cairns, Townsville), the best time is April/May. In six to eight weeks 
there is time to do both. Our motor home is best suited for two people but will 
sleep four. Shower, toilet, hot water, stove, TV. It is a Ford, six cylinders, 
automatic and runs on LTG and/or petrol. This is important since it doubles 
your range for Outback travel."

<P>
If you're one of the 3,962 California travelers who received a use-tax note 
from the State Board of Equalization recently stating that you owed money on 
purchases made abroad, you can throw it out. 
</P>
<P>
If you have already made the payment (about 800 payments were received, 
totaling $110,000), don't worry; your check will be returned. Moreover, no new 
use-tax notices will be sent out, since the pilot program to collect this 
previously obscure tax has been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
That's the good news. It is, however, still a good idea to watch what you spend 
while shopping abroad, since chances are that the use tax, which dates to 1935, 
will be reimplemented at some point. 
</P>
<P>
Funding to enforce the use tax is part of the Board of Equalization's 1990-91 
budget proposal to the State Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"If the program is reimplemented, there will be substantial advance notice to 
consumers and the travel industry," said a Board of Equalization spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of prior notice regarding enforcement of the use tax, known officially as 
the Consumer Use Tax Return, created an uproar last month when people began 
receiving notices of unexpected debts. The use tax is applied to items that 
residents of the state buy outside of California, then bring home. 
</P>
<P>
If and when the program is reinstituted, tax bills may be sent out quarterly 
and purchases will be taxed on the basis of which county you live in. The rate 
is 6.50% in Los Angeles and San Diego counties, 6% in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Authorization giving the Board of Equalization access to U.S. Customs records 
was the major factor that activated the dormant tax. 
</P>
<P>
The board has requested that customs include some notice of the use tax in new 
printings of its "Know Before You Go" pamphlet. Airlines also are working on 
ways to alert passengers to this tax. 
</P>
<P>
Travel agents, too, are busy notifying clients. Henry Chase of Chase Travel in 
Glendale said that he learned of the tax from a client who was assessed $104.96 
after reporting purchases of $1,555 to customs in December, 1989. "I'm sending 
memos out to all my clients, advising them about this use tax in California," 
Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a forewarning about any new start-up of the use-tax program, 
travelers will have at least 30 days from the date of the tax-due form's 
arrival to make their payments. Late payments may incur penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Only travelers bringing in items valued at more than $400 are affected. Items 
purchased for less than $400 don't have to be itemized on the declaration form, 
and no duty is required. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers coming back through a U.S. possession or territory such as the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, Guam or American Samoa can claim an $800 duty exemption. 
However, more than half of the items must have been bought in a U.S. territory. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you've been on a Caribbean cruise and bought $600 worth of 
goods on the Dutch island of Curacao and $200 on St. Thomas, a U.S. possession, 
you would get a $400 exemption on the Curacao-bought goods and a complete 
exemption on the St. Thomas items. You would pay duty on $200 of the Curacao 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, if you bought $600 worth of goods in St. Thomas and $200 in 
Curacao, you would pay no duty. 
</P>
<P>
John Miller, a customs spokesman, recommends that travelers, as a supplement to 
their receipts, keep a record of items and in which country they were 
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
"Itemize each thing you buy in each country and the price it was worth, in 
dollars," Miller said. "The declaration form is somewhat small, and this 
notebook can alleviate guesswork." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, these items don't have to be bought. You could have gotten them as a 
gift, found them, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the Board of Equalization spokesman suggested that consumers 
indicate what portion of their declaration represents gifts: "Indicate legibly 
on the form if something is a gift. If the amount of the gift is large, we 
might seek documentation." 
</P>
<P>
Information on gifts from abroad is available to the Board of Equalization, 
although California hasn't requested it yet. Any unsolicited gift sent to the 
United States from abroad is entitled to a $50 exemption ($100 if it's from a 
U.S. possession) from U.S. Customs. When buying gifts abroad, be aware that the 
use tax may eventually apply to gifts above a certain amount. 
</P>
<P>
"Travelers should also realize that the use tax will still apply to items they 
buy as gifts to give other people," said the board spokesman. Moreover, the use 
tax is in addition to whatever duty you pay on your purchases to customs. 
</P>
<P>
Exemptions are based on the retail value of the goods where bought or otherwise 
obtained, not U.S. prices. Also, travelers must be gone from the United States 
for at least 48 hours and must not have claimed an exemption within the last 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
If you return from Canada within 48 hours, you only get a $25 exemption per 
person. Returning from Mexico you can get the $400 exemption even if you stay 
less than 48 hours, but the 30-day limitation applies. 
</P>
<P>
The head of the family can still make a joint declaration for all members of 
his or her family (if living in the same household). Accordingly, a family of 
four can bring in $1,600 worth of articles duty-free and with no itemization, 
even if two members of the family are minors. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Generalized System of Preferences is still in effect. This is a 
system whereby the United States helps developing countries -- more than 70 in 
all, including Antigua, Brazil, Costa Rica, Nepal, Pakistan, Congo and Uganda 
-- by permitting some of their goods to be brought in duty-free. 
</P>
<P>
These goods must be purchased in the nation that produces them, not another 
country. Among popular items are baskets, Chinaware, jewelry, carvings, toys 
and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Although the temptation to undervalue items is always there, customs is good at 
assessing the value of merchandise. "The additional tax might be an incentive 
to some people to decrease the value of items in their declarations, but we'll 
be extra vigilant," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Some people have figured out that the way to evade the use tax is to return to 
the United States through a non-California gateway and then get a connecting 
flight home. If your purchases are really on the high side, the extra travel 
costs might justify this trick. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Equalization, however, is working on plugging this loophole. It is 
also looking at ways to eventually exchange information with other states, 
which may have such a use tax on their books, and which may also start applying 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, customs has several other free brochures that are worth looking at, 
including "GSP &amp; The Traveler" and "Pocket Hints." 
</P>
<P>
Copies are available at the customs office at the departure level at Bradley 
Terminal, Los Angeles International Airport, or by contacting U.S. Customs, 300 
S. Ferry, Terminal Island 90731, (213) 514-6721.

ALONE WITH NATURE IN A TROPICAL RAIN FOREST

MARENCO, Costa Rica 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are no roads to Marenco. 
</P>
<P>
Remote, tropical, blessed with unspoiled beaches, towering rain forest and only 
a few flying insects that bite, Marenco Biological Station is a privately owned 
nature reserve along Costa Rica's southern Pacific Ocean coast. 
</P>
<P>
My first view of the station was from a five-passenger, single-engine plane. A 
cluster of red metal roofs beckoned from the forest that surrounded them. 
</P>
<P>
During the trip by launch 10 minutes down the coast from a grass airstrip, we 
passed narrow bands of deserted beaches -- palms and forest encroaching onto 
dark sand. By dinghy, we maneuvered among lava rocks to shore. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two hours after leaving the traffic and sounds of Costa Rica's 
capital, San Jose, I was setting off down a trail that winds silently through 
mile after mile of rain forest giants. 
</P>
<P>
For the next two days I tramped along with four other nature lovers behind 
resident Lou Jost. 
</P>
<P>
The hip-high, red-clay stain on Jost's white pants was a tip-off to trail 
conditions after days of rain. Soon those of us who had gingerly stepped from 
the dinghy, protective of dry shoes, were wading across rivers and slipping 
through mud like veterans. 
</P>
<P>
A green kingfisher, a red-capped manikin, woodcreepers and butterflies welcomed 
us. Although I was a neophyte at bird watching, I saw an exotic, slaty-tailed 
trogon. Mysterious sounds from unseen creatures punctuated the stillness. 
</P>
<P>
Later, a bird book in the Marenco station's small library added color and shape 
to some of the sounds Jost had identified for us. We peered at pages showing 
the Amazon parrot and pale-billed woodpecker. 
</P>
<P>
Our small group neither saw nor heard tapirs, crocodiles, anteaters or sloths, 
but we were treading their turf. 
</P>
<P>
Returning at sunset on trails behind the station grounds, loud, hoarse barks 
pulled us back in search of howler monkeys. In the dim light of a darkening 
forest, we finally saw a troop high in the trees. 
</P>
<P>
Private reserves such as Marenco, along with Costa Rica's internationally 
recognized park system, help conserve the biological diversity of the tropics 
in this corner of Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Though Sergio Miranda, director of the biological station, suggests that 
Marenco is not for the luxury traveler, accommodations are far from primitive. 
</P>
<P>
Lodges on a hill 180 feet above the ocean house two people per room, with 
private baths. Each room has its own terrace looking out at a sweep of 
machete-cut lawn, over the forest and down to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Floors of gleaming tropical hardwood prompted me to leave muddy shoes outside. 
A split-tailed "Jesus Christ" lizard, so called because of its ability to walk 
on water, has taken up residence near the lodges. 
</P>
<P>
The isolation in the midst of tropical rain forest that doomed the fruit farm 
was the key to Marenco as a center for nature-adventure travel. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after Miranda came to Marenco, Costa Rica set aside 87,500 acres 
south and east of it as Corcovado National Park. Corcovado now encompasses more 
than 105,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
"Creation of the national park in 1975 began to change the whole future," 
Miranda said. "The biggest problem then, as now, was how to get into the area. 
I used a dugout to travel out of Sierpe when I was building Marenco." As word 
spread among researchers that Miranda was coming and going in the area, they 
started to contact him to get them to Corcovado. 
</P>
<P>
He not only brought them in, but soon was housing the scientists and then 
university student groups. One day a tour agency called to inquire if a group 
of bird watchers could use his boats. "I didn't know anything about 
natural-history travelers," Miranda said, but he researched the 
nature-adventure travel market and in 1985 went into business. 
</P>
<P>
A stay at the station offers a day with a Marenco guide in Corcovado Park. 
After a 6:30 a.m. family-style breakfast in the dining hall -- eggs, black 
beans and rice (gallo pinto), toast, fruit, juice and coffee or tea -- I set 
out with Jost and four other travelers to see the national park. 
</P>
<P>
A gentle rain was all that remained of a roaring nighttime downpour as we 
transferred from dinghy to launch for a 20-minute ride to San Pedrillo, a 
ranger station marking the northern park boundary. After hiking along the 
beach, we climbed into the forest. 
</P>
<P>
We saw red spider monkeys leaping from tree to tree in search of fruit, one 
toting a baby on its back. My bird list mushroomed -- I saw kiskadees, a 
golden-hooded tanager and anis (of the cuckoo family), and caught a glimpse of 
the huge, turkey-like curassow through thick foliage. 
</P>
<P>
We caught scent of white-lipped peccaries, a sort of wild hog. "If they 
appear," advised Jost, "stand still and hope they don't charge." In case of 
attack, he suggested we climb at least three feet up in a nearby tree. 
Peccaries roam in herds of up to about 50. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to knowing where army ants are on the move? The chirr of antbirds 
that prey on insects fleeing a swarm. Miniature roads in forest litter tell of 
leaf-cutting ants that carry bits of bright green leaves for the fungus gardens 
in their nests. 
</P>
<P>
We touched the white latex of the baco, or milk tree. Indigenous peoples drank 
its "milk," ate its sweet fruit and beat its reddish gray bark to use as 
blankets or clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Fallen flowers on the forest floor hint of riches hidden in the canopy above. 
"That's why I decided to go into the canopy," Jost said. He discovered an arrow 
lost on a previous attempt to climb one of the forest giants; using a 
crossbow,, he shot climbing lines that helped him get to an area of the rain 
forest that has been largely inaccessible to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Red, yellow, brown and green seed pods -- works of art and engineering -- also 
litter the forest floor. One looks like a child's top. It hangs with the point 
up, and a bottom plug pops out to release seeds into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Printed guides to trails on Marenco's 1,500 acres allow visitors to encounter 
the tropical forest alone, an adventure worth taking. 
</P>
<P>
Walking through the thick carpet of leaves, Jost would suddenly squat to 
briefly detain a brightly colored frog no bigger than his thumbnail. He noticed 
a toucan -- against the sky on a dead tree -- that I could barely see with 
binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
As my eyes adjusted, I, too, made discoveries: A small salamander so delicate 
and tiny, like a toothpick with legs, camouflaged brown against a brown leaf; a 
toucan, unseen, but identified by his song; a baco or ajo recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Jost spun tales of interrelationships in the forest. My favorite was his 
description of the "arms race" between the passion flower and the Heliconius 
butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
The passion flower has Velcro-like leaves with little hooked hairs to catch 
marauding butterfly larvae. The plant also produces egg-mimics on its leaves to 
fool butterflies into thinking that eggs already have been laid there. 
</P>
<P>
Butterflies, for their part, have learned to detoxify the poisonous chemicals 
in the plant or to use them to make themselves toxic to their predators. 
</P>
<P>
Though he refers to these forests as "benign" because of the few bothersome 
insects and snakes that mostly keep to themselves, Jost recalls one woman who 
sat on a log without looking and found herself on the tail of a fearsome 
fer-de-lance, the most dangerous snake in Central America. As Jost yanked her 
up, the surprised snake slithered away. 
</P>
<P>
We ate sack lunches beside the roaring waterfall at Llorona. Although it was a 
cool day from the rain and cloud cover, I stepped in to feel the pounding 
torrent. On a dry, hot day, tired hikers, no doubt, rush to the cooling water. 
</P>
<P>
For those not up to the rigors of an all-day trek through the forest, there are 
miles of uninhabited coastline to explore and there's swimming in rivers or 
ocean, snorkeling and horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
One need only carry binoculars to the hammock on the terrace to get a view of 
parrots, toucans and maybe a scarlet macaw as they fly through the clearing. 
</P>
<P>
Others saw two humpback whales from the terrace while we were away at 
Corcovado. Residents say that whales announce summer, the dry season that 
begins in December. At night sparkling fireflies can be seen from the same 
vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
One night we descended the long hill to the beach to look in tide pools with 
our flashlights. (Flashlights are essential -- the generator for electricity 
sometimes is turned off as early as 8:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
Marine life is abundant, especially around Isla del Cano, a national biological 
reserve about an hour away by boat. 
</P>
<P>
Legend says pirates' treasure is hidden on the island, and Indian graves and 
stone spheres suggest an ancient cemetery. Earlier Indian habitation is also 
evident on the mainland -- while we waited at the airstrip, workers digging a 
drainage ditch unearthed pottery shards. 
</P>
<P>
This is a remote area -- communication with the outside world is by radiophone. 
Plans may have to change according to weather and tides. Visitors do well to 
travel with some flexibility in schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Temperature and humidity on departure day, for instance, made it necessary to 
ferry the five of us out in two trips to Palmar Norte, where we rejoined for 
the flight to San Jose. While three of us waited for the plane to return, we 
were treated to pipas, coconuts a worker cut for us, deftly whacking off the 
tops so we could drink the milk. 
</P>
<P>
Charter flights to the Marenco Biological Station leave San Jose on Mondays and 
Fridays on a 47-minute trip. Cost for three nights at the station is $515, 
including round-trip transfers from hotel to airport, plus flight, lodging, 
meals, guided trip to Corcovado and Rio Claro, and taxes. A four-night package 
adds a tour of Cano Island; cost is $631. 
</P>
<P>
Boat trips must be arranged. There are two possibilities: from Uvita, a coastal 
village where a Marenco boat picks up guests for the two-hour ride to the 
station, and from Sierpe, traveling on the Sierpe River through the largest 
mangroves in Costa Rica and then along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors prefer the dry season, from December through April. However, 
Miranda says those who want to stay away from the "crowds" should consider 
November or May to August. Even in the wet season, rains are intermittent, but 
September and October can be waterlogged. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, Mexicana and Lacsa, the Costa Rican airline, fly out of Los Angeles to 
San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose office for the Marenco Biological Station is on the second floor 
of Edificio Cristal, on Avenida 1 between Calles 1 and 3. Mailing address is 
P.O. Box 4025-1000, San Jose, Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
Travel companies in the United States who book individual travel to Marenco 
include Seattle-based Journeys (toll-free 800-345-4453), and Voyagers in 
Ithaca, N.Y. (607) 257-3091.

CRUISE VIEWS: COSTA RICA'S SCENIC BEAUTY ATTRACTS MORE SHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch are Los Angeles free-lance 
writers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past several years, more and more cruise ships have been calling in 
Costa Rica. While the mounting troubles of Gen. Manuel Noriega may have been 
partly responsible for the shift away from Panamanian ports, so many passengers 
reacted favorably to scenic Costa Rica that it has become a regular stop on the 
transcanal route. 
</P>
<P>
The country's major cruise ports, Puerto Limon on the Caribbean side and Puerto 
Caldera on the Pacific side, both offer day-trip access to the capital city of 
San Jose, tropical rain forests and active volcanos. 
</P>
<P>
But a visit in more depth can be made on a 12-day voyage called "Exploring the 
Natural Treasures of Costa Rica" aboard Special Expeditions' 80-passenger 
Polaris, which was, coincidentally, the first passenger ship to transit the 
Panama Canal after it was closed and reopened in December. 
</P>
<P>
We joined the Polaris in Puerto Caldera a few days after that for a cruise to 
the country's coastal national parks and reserves, some of them accessible only 
by sea. Zodiac rubber landing craft take passengers ashore at islands and 
isolated beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Every day in Costa Rica included two or three naturalist-led excursions from 
the ship for hikes through lush rain forests, bird watching and photography, 
snorkeling among brightly colored tropical fish or strolling and 
shell-collecting on broad, empty beaches. 
</P>
<P>
At Manuel Antonio National Park we were able to get a good look at a furry 
three-toed sloth feeding on leaves in a cercopia tree, a graceful study in 
slow-motion ballet. White-faced monkeys ceased their chattering long enough to 
stare solemnly down at us, while overhead scarlet macaws and fire-beaked 
curassows with bright, toucan-like bills darted from tree to tree. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has 800 bird species, plus 10% of all the world's butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most fascinating ports of call was tiny Isla del Coco, 365 miles off 
the mainland and only 280 miles from the Galapagos Islands. The island, covered 
with a rich green tangle of vine and trees, receives 25 feet of rain a year. 
</P>
<P>
Ships have called there for fresh water since the early 16th Century, including 
several notorious pirates who are said to have buried three notable treasure 
caches there. None has ever been reported recovered, despite an estimated 500 
treasure-digging expeditions over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Daily life aboard the Polaris is comfortable and congenial. Most passengers are 
in their 60s and 70s, the kind of people more interested in a lecture on 
sea-bird migration than a game of jackpot bingo. 
</P>
<P>
Dressing for dinner usually means a clean shirt and slacks, and most passengers 
turn in early to be ready for a sunrise beach landing and hike before returning 
to the ship for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Besides a handsome, wide-windowed lounge that doubles as a lecture area with 
swivel chairs that revolve to the videos or slide screen, there is a quiet 
library with cushioned wicker armchairs, its bookshelves well stocked with bird 
guides and natural history references. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-hour coffee- and tea-making area offers cookies, morning pastries and 
late-evening sandwiches for snacks. The dining room also has big windows so 
that passengers at mealtime don't have to miss a chance to see a whale or group 
of dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Big-ship extras aboard the little Polaris include a beauty shop, sauna, shop, 
next-day laundry service, ship's doctor and small hospital. The upper stern 
deck is canvas-shaded and is a favorite spot for readers, while a small, sunny 
lower deck attracts sunbathers to stretch out on lounge chairs. The bow deck 
and navigation bridge are open to passengers too. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no swimming pool on board, the ship's Zodiacs take passengers to 
beaches and for snorkeling almost every day. A glass-bottomed boat is also 
launched wherever there are coral reefs and tropical fish. 
</P>
<P>
All of the cabins on the Polaris are comfortable, if not elaborately furnished 
-- outsides, with lower twin beds and windows, or, on A deck, portholes, good 
built-in storage and hair dryers. The compact, utilitarian bathrooms contain 
showers and storage shelves but not tubs. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is no elevator, getting around the ship involves negotiating 
steep stairways, so the Polaris is not suitable for people who use wheelchairs 
or walkers. While the ship rides fairly smoothly for its shallow draft, there 
are no stabilizers, which could discomfit people extremely susceptible to 
motion sickness. 
</P>
<P>
Meals are open sitting, which means passengers have the freedom to sit where 
and with whom they please. At breakfast you choose from a buffet of hot and 
cold dishes, including fresh fruits, cereals, eggs, cheese, meats and flaky 
Danish pastry. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch is also served buffet style, with a separate menu of a la carte dishes 
that can be ordered from the kitchen. Teatime includes freshly baked pastries 
or cookies, hot tea, iced tea or coffee. Dinner is served at the table, with 
appetizers, soup, a choice of main dishes, salad and dessert. 
</P>
<P>

FINDING A WINDOW INTO HOME LIFE OF NORWAY'S BELOVED EDVARD GRIEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BERGEN, Norway 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long before his death on Sept. 4, 1907, Edvard Grieg was rowing near 
Troldhaugen, his beloved home. He gazed up at the high cliff and said, "Here I 
would like to rest." 
</P>
<P>
The composer was granted his wish. His ashes are buried in a niche cut out of a 
cliff overlooking the estate. Grieg's wife, Nina, who lived another 28 years, 
is also interred there. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as the sun goes down, its rays pause for just a moment to cast a final 
glow of radiance at the grave of a man who gave the world everlasting melodic 
beauty. Along with Henrik Ibsen, Grieg was what in today's parlance would be 
known as Norway's favorite son. 
</P>
<P>
Troldhaugen, just a 15-minute car ride from Bergen, where Grieg was born, was a 
refuge for the composer-conductor from the rigors of travel to the world's 
musical centers -- London, Paris, Berlin, Leipzig, Prague, Warsaw and Rome. 
(Although often invited, he never made the trip to conduct in the United 
States, because he feared he would not survive the transatlantic journey.) 
</P>
<P>
The hideaway was a fixed point in Grieg's life, a quiet base camp for the 
hectic travels that dominated his life almost until his death. Each year he 
would come home, relax a bit and then compose some more. 
</P>
<P>
Grieg and his wife, who was a concert singer and who accompanied him on most of 
his travels, built the home at Nordasvannet in 1885. The name Troldhaugen means 
Troll Hill. The name was suggested by Mrs. Grieg because the local people 
called the ravine that forms one of the boundaries of the site "Troll Valley." 
</P>
<P>
It was here that the leading men and women of the artistic world met every 
summer for more than 20 years. Here Grieg's fellow townsmen marched up with 
their brass band ringing in the air to honor him on his 60th birthday. And it 
was such occasions that inspired Grieg to write "Wedding Day at Troldhaugen." 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, the Grieg home is one of the stops on all sightseeing 
tours of Bergen, but visitors can also drive out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
In the main house the tour begins in what in Grieg's day was the kitchen and 
pantry. Today it contains a collection of Grieg's treasures and memorabilia. 
There is the composer's well-used trunk. 
</P>
<P>
It was because he lived out of a suitcase for so long that Grieg strongly felt 
the need to own property. This was home. He could always come back to it. There 
are also many trophies and ribbons, reminders of his many performances abroad. 
There are original manuscripts and letters. Grieg's own conductor's score for 
his piano concerto is on display. One entire wall is covered with numerous 
portraits of the maestro. 
</P>
<P>
There are only two other rooms on the ground floor -- the dining room and the 
living room. They have basically been left untouched, just the way they were 
when Grieg died. The rooms are filled with the many gifts Greig and Nina 
received, reminders of the popularity they enjoyed. The Steinway piano, still 
used for concerts at Troldhaugen, was a gift to the Griegs from their friends 
in Bergen on their silver wedding anniversary in 1892. 
</P>
<P>
The large Danish landscape above the piano was given to Grieg on his 60th 
birthday in 1903, as was the chandelier in the living room and the solid silver 
centerpiece on the dining room table. 
</P>
<P>
A few steps from the main house is the place Grieg went to get away from 
everybody, a small red one-room cabin. The modest working hut where Grieg did 
his composing was built by the artist in 1982. He referred to it as "my little 
workshop." Several of his compositions were written there, among them a series 
of "Lyrical Pieces" for the piano. 
</P>
<P>
The exquisite view of the water below makes it not hard to understand how the 
composer was inspired to write some of his well-known compositions. 
</P>
<P>
But because Grieg bought the property so late in life, his most famous 
masterpieces -- his piano concerto, the Peer Gynt suite, the String Quartet in 
G minor -- were written elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The little hut (it is closed to the public but its interior can be viewed 
through a large glass window) even was used after Grieg's death. The Danish 
composer Carl Nielson, when he visited the home as a guest of Grieg's widow, 
wrote part of his violin concerto in the hut. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny workshop stands today as it did a century ago with a standup piano and 
a small desk. On the desk is a Grieg manuscript and a feather pen. 
</P>
<P>
When he went on his travels, Grieg left a message on top of his work, addressed 
to possible thieves. "Dear thieves," he started a polite note, and went on to 
beg any intruders not to remove the papers, as they were of no value to anyone 
other than himself. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1957 there have been a series of summer recitals at Troldhaugen. The 
house was able to accommodate an audience of about 90, but in good weather 
several hundred others could gather in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
Recently a music hall with seating for 250 has been built on the grounds, and 
concerts are held regularly. 
</P>
<P>
Between the home and the concert hall is a bronze man-size statue of Norway's 
greatest composer, who bears a sharp resemblance to Mark Twain. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the statue gives a visitor the distinct feeling that Grieg is still 
the master of the place. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is open from May 2 to Oct. 1. Entrance fee is 10 krona (about $1.60 
U.S.) per person. Bergen sightseeing tours also stop at Troldhaugen. It is a 
stop, for example, on the three-hour city tour that takes half a day and costs 
about $20. Entrance to the museum and grounds is included. 
</P>
<P>
Central hotels include the large Norge, where double rooms range from about 
$127 to $232; the Augustine (from $109 to $120), and the small and pleasant 
Victoria ($100 to $144). All rooms have bath or shower and include breakfast. 
</P>

THE MATURE TRAVELER: HOTEL'S OFFER IS NOT TO BE DISCOUNTED

Hilton Hotels has updated and expanded its Senior HHonors discount travel 
program for 1990, adding 76 hotels in more than 30 countries. 
</P>
<P>
With the added hotels, Hilton's Senior HHonors members age 60 and over can get 
discounts from 25% to 50% off regular rates at more than 310 hotels worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The program does not include all 140 Hilton International hotels. However, it 
does cover nine in Canada and 20 in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton guarantees that the discount rate will be the lowest published rate for 
a hotel chosen, even lower than those offered to members of AARP, who are 
eligible at 50. 
</P>
<P>
With a senior discount, rates at the more than 310 domestic Hiltons can be down 
to $45 a night, single or double. The average discount rate for the more 
popular Hiltons is closer to $60, which is still a good deal. 
</P>
<P>
And a second room at the same discount rate is also offered for a member's 
immediate family, such as children or grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in the Hilton program can be on two levels -- $25 for an annual 
domestic membership, $50 for a worldwide membership (which includes the 76 
international hotels). There is also a $150 lifetime worldwide membership. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in any category automatically includes a spouse. Hilton will refund 
money to those who decide against using the program within 30 days of 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Mature travelers who are already members of Hilton HHonors' frequent guest 
program will receive 500 HHonors points per stay at the discounted senior rate 
at domestic hotels. 
</P>
<P>
All new senior members not already in the frequent guest programs are 
automatically entered so they also can earn credits for the future travel 
rewards and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
With the discounts of 25% to 50%, the membership fee is usually paid for with 
just one night's lodging. As examples, Hilton cites a $165 room at the Palmer 
House in Chicago, available to Senior HHonors members for $60; a $130 room at 
the Orleans Hilton, available for $70, and an $85 room at the Ocala (Florida) 
Hilton that seniors get for $52. 
</P>
<P>
Another benefit in the program provides a 20% dinner discount for two at more 
than 240 Hilton Hotel restaurants in the United States, regardless of whether 
members are staying at the hotel. (This is a retreat from last year, when only 
a party of six or more got the discount.) 
</P>
<P>
Other benefits include a special toll-free reservation service for Senior 
HHonors members, pre-registration and quick hotel check-in at HHonors 
registration desks, and late check-out times, if requested. 
</P>
<P>
As good as the program and its discounts are, mature travelers should expect 
the usual restrictions that can be found on most all senior discount programs 
-- they can't be used in combination with other discounts or package tours, or 
for conventions or group meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Senior HHonors hotel reservations are required, because rooms at individual 
hotels may not always be available at all times. Blackout periods can be 
expected during major conventions, meetings and sporting or other major events. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, reservations can be made up to a year in advance to help 
assure getting the senior discount at the hotel and time of your choice. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on the Senior HHonors program, call Hilton Hotels 
toll-free (800) 455-8667, Ext. 901, or contact travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
Corliss Tours has added a 12th destination, New Orleans, to its program of 
Stay-Put Tours for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-day tours will use the Montelone Hotel in the French Quarter for the 
entire stay. City and countryside sightseeing tours will start from the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Tours include a paddle-wheeler cruise on the Mississippi River and a swamp tour 
of the Bayou Country on a flatboat, plus visits to antebellum mansions and 
plantations and a creole cooking class at the New Orleans School of Cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Departures March 24, April 14, Oct. 6 and Nov. 10. Stay-Put Tours cost $840 per 
person, double; $1,115 single. Transportation is not included, but it can be 
arranged by travel agents or Corliss Tours. 
</P>
<P>
Other 1990 Stay-Put destinations include Charleston, S.C.; Orlando, Fla.; 
Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia, San Antonio, New York City, Boston, Montreal, 
Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
For more information and a free Stay-Put brochure, contact Corliss Tours, 436 
W. Foothill Blvd., Monrovia 91016, or call toll-free (800) 456-5717 or (818)

MARKLEEVILLE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most winter visitors to the snow-clad Sierra Nevada are bundled up in ski 
clothes, but some are happiest in nothing more than their swimsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors who come to enjoy the hot springs don't mind that the air temperature 
may be below freezing. At Grover Hot Springs State Park, the two outdoor 
thermal pools are a comfortable 72 degrees and a steamy 104 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
There's a greater choice of bathing temperatures over the state line in Nevada 
at Walley's Hot Springs Resort, where seven open-air swimming and soaking pools 
are kept from 75 to 104 degrees. Cabins are available for bathers who become so 
relaxed that they decide to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
On a daylong circle excursion to the bi-state hot springs, you'll enjoy High 
Sierra winter scenery and learn more about the area's history. Along the route 
is the Genoa Bar, Nevada's oldest saloon. 
</P>
<P>
Driving north from Southern California, follow U.S. 395 along the eastern 
Sierra to Nevada's Carson Valley, where side roads lead northwest from Minden 
to Walley's Hot Springs. 
</P>
<P>
For vacationers at South Lake Tahoe or its neighboring casino hotels in 
Stateline, Nev., follow U.S. 50 north to join Nevada 207/Kingsbury Grade over 
the mountains to Carson Valley. Then drive left (north) on Nevada 206 toward 
Genoa. Walley's is about four miles up the highway, which parallels the old 
Pony Express trail. 
</P>
<P>
Now a state historic site, the hot springs attracted travelers after David 
Walley and his wife opened a hotel there in 1862. Mark Twain was among its many 
guests. Two fires earlier in this century destroyed the hostelry and some 
outbuildings, but in 1980 the property was renovated and reopened. 
</P>
<P>
Mineral water bubbling from wells at 140 degrees is cooled to varying 
temperatures before being pumped to modern pools, where bathers feel their 
tensions evaporate with the steam that rises in the bracing winter air. Other 
facilities include an exercise room with weight machines, saunas, steam rooms 
and two tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
You'll pay $9 to use this rural spa, which is open every day from 9 a.m. to 10 
p.m. Lockers and towels are included. Minimum age is 12 years. Massages and 
body wraps can be arranged with reservations. Call (702) 782-8155 or (702) 
883-6556. 
</P>
<P>
On Fridays and weekends, visitors can dine in style at the resort's Zephyr 
restaurant, which serves lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch. Among the chef's 
specialties are coconut shrimp and chicken Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
Five historic buildings, including the old Minden train depot, have been 
redecorated as guest cottages. Nightly rates are $75/$110. Call the above 
numbers for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Two miles north of Walley's Hot Springs is Nevada's oldest settlement, Genoa. 
It was called Mormon Station when established as a trading post in 1851. 
</P>
<P>
A replica of the original fort has a small museum, which reopens in May. Across 
the street is the Genoa Courthouse Museum, a two-story brick building that 
later served as a school after the county seat was moved to Minden in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
Today Genoa is best known for the Genoa Bar, a saloon that's been in operation 
since pioneer days, and a trio of restaurants -- Pink House, Inn Cognito and 
Casentini's. 
</P>
<P>
There are also three B&amp;Bs: Orchard House, (702) 782-2640, Genoa House, 
(702) 782-7075, and Taylor House, (702) 782-3932. Nightly rates range from $45 
to $55. 
</P>
<P>
Drive east on Genoa Lane, then south on U.S. 395 to nearby Minden for other 
accommodations and dining spots. Call toll-free (800) 321-6983 for reservations 
at Carson Valley Inn, where 160 rooms are $49 on weekends, $39 weekdays. Eat at 
Katie's, the inn's 24-hour restaurant, or cross the street to fancier Fiona's. 
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Gardnerville is well known for three Basque restaurants -- J&amp;T, 
the Overland Hotel and the Carson Valley Country Club -- as well as a longtime 
favorite for prime rib, Sharkey's. 
</P>
<P>
Just west of Minden, follow Nevada 88 south over the state line and continue on 
California 88. Then turn south (left) on California 89 to Markleeville, and go 
west at the signs to Grover Hot Springs State Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1800s the hot springs belonged to the Grover family, which ran a 
hotel in Markleeville and invited guests to soak in the outdoor pools. Since 
buying the property 30 years ago the state has operated the hot springs, which 
are surrounded by Toiyabe National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Snow sometimes covers the access roads, so the two concrete pools of mineral 
water are open when weather permits. Normal weekend winter hours are 9 a.m. to 
9 p.m Saturdays, and to 7 p.m. Sundays. Weekday hours are noon to 7 p.m., 
except Fridays when the pools remain open until 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $3 for adults, $2 for ages 18 and under; take your own towels and 
refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
You can buy snacks in town at the Markleeville General Store, which first 
served silver miners in the 1860s. 
</P>
<P>
You'll also find food and drink at the Cutthroat Saloon, named for the trout 
that's caught in local streams, not for the tavern's clientele. You might have 
doubts, however, after noticing that the ceiling is decorated with brassieres. 
</P>
<P>
Meals also are served up the highway in the cozy Country Cafe at Sorensen's, a 
restful all-seasons resort in scenic Hope Valley. Follow California 89 
northwest toward South Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered in the woods are 23 cabins of differing styles, including a 
sod-roofed log structure from Norway. The cabins accommodate two to eight 
guests and cost from $55 to $175. Call (916) 694-2203 for reservations. Also 
ask about Hope Valley's cross-country ski activities that are based at 
Sorensen's resort. 
</P>
<P>
Continue on California 89 to join U.S. 50 to South Lake Tahoe, and pick up U.S. 
395 back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
(California 89 southeast from Markleeville over Monitor Pass to U.S. 395 is 
closed in winter.) An alternate route home is via U.S. 50 west to Sacramento to 
pick up California 99 or Interstate 5 south. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Markleeville is 842 miles.

YOUTH BEAT: SAVING DOWN UNDER VIA NEW BACKPACK GUIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

routes.

<P>
Travelers planning shoestring-budget adventures Down Under can consult the new 
"Australian and New Zealand Backpackers Guide." 
</P>
<P>
Young Australians are masters at traveling on tight funds. When they travel 
abroad they tend to stay away for long periods, often circling the globe. 
</P>
<P>
The bonus for Americans is that many young Australians have returned home with 
lots of firsthand knowledge and ideas, and have created their own budget-travel 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The 248-page first edition of this magazine offers budget-travel information, 
plus background information on the various regions of the country. Only eight 
pages cover New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The publishers plan to produce new editions quarterly, updating basic 
information and adding special features on seasonal destinations. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's major drawback is its size. The information on budget 
transportation, accommodations and sightseeing is good for pre-trip planning, 
but the guide is similar to a thin telephone book -- a bulky product for 
backpackers to carry. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you want to investigate the Northern Territories of "Crocodile Dundee" 
fame, cuddle a koala, snorkel on the Great Barrier Reef, relax in a rain 
forest, find a temporary job or search out ski slopes, the guide helps with 
information on how to get around, where to stay and whom to contact. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations listed vary from budget hotels and youth hostels to other 
low-cost options. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the Whitsunday Island area an island resort is restricted to 
travelers of between 18 and 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Contiki Resort, on Long Island, was created as a special stop for Contiki 
tour groups. 
</P>
<P>
According to the guide, independent budget travelers also can stay there in a 
special backpackers' lodge, sharing four-bunk rooms for $15 Australian (about 
$12 U.S.) a night. 
</P>
<P>
In Cape Tribulation National Park in northern Queensland, budget travelers can 
explore the lush rain forest, using Crocodylus Village as a base. 
</P>
<P>
According to the guide, the village offers "moderate creature comfort in a 
safari-style complex" using "hut accommodations set high off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
The listings for caravan (trailer) parks can be helpful even if travelers 
aren't carrying camping equipment. In Australia, many trailer parks offer vans 
or cabins as alternative accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine lists the popular sights in each region of the country. In some 
cases, special discounts are offered. 
</P>
<P>
For example, backpackers are offered special standby rates for cruising Sydney 
Harbor aboard a full-scale replica of the Bounty. 
</P>
<P>
There is also special transportation fares. There's a 25% reduction for buying 
the standby version of Deluxe Coachlines' Koala Pass, which is good for 
unlimited travel. 
</P>
<P>
To travel on the nationwide network of services, standby costs $299 Australian 
(about $25 U.S.) for 15 days. A 21-day pass is $404 A, 30 days costs $544, 60 
days are $749 and 90 days are $1,049.

Backpackers Guide magazine is not being distributed in the United States, but 
you can write directly to Australia for a copy. It costs $2 U.S. plus $6 for 
airmail postage. Write to Backpackers Guide, Thomson Media Group Pty., Suite 3,

POLITICS, IF NOT YOUR CHECK, IS LIKELY TO BE IN THE MAIL; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BUT OFTEN INVISIBLE POLITICAL FORCES IN 
AMERICA IS THE MAILBOX. IT KILLED CATASTROPHIC HEALTH CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Timothy B. Lynch, Timothy B. Lynch, who worked in politics for more than 20 
years, currently heads direct-mail operations for the Planetary Society. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Late last year, Congress overwhelmingly repealed the Medicare Catastrophic 
Coverage Act. The same elected officials who a year earlier had proclaimed the 
act a major legislative achievement rushed to say that its repeal was no less 
important. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Tons of mail demanding the law's repeal were dumped on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
But where did the opposition to the social program for seniors come from? After 
all, the legislation was the product of a careful compromise between the Reagan 
Administration and Democratic leaders and was supported by the largest 
senior-citizen groups in the country. If Congress could flip-flop on such a 
universally agreed upon program, what else might it flip-flop on? 
</P>
<P>
The repeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act was the result of one of 
the most important but often invisible political forces in America -- mailbox 
politics. One of the major political developments of the 1970s was the growth 
of special-interest groups who organized direct-mail campaigns around single 
issues. Although the type of person attracted to these organizations changed in 
the 1980s, their numbers and political clout grew. The direct-mail techniques 
honed by these activists undid catastrophic health care. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the big stories during the '80s -- from policy in Central America to 
abortion -- shared something in common. Associated with them were large numbers 
of donors linked through mailing lists and, as a result, kept informed of new 
developments that usually required specific political responses. These 
communications were, in essence, an alternative press without the constraints 
of the regular media. 
</P>
<P>
The power of such direct-mail organizations to mobilize citizens to action 
simply by depositing a message in a mailbox is decried by some, applauded by 
others. After the catastrophic-health-care fiasco, some legislators even urged 
that this form of political speech be regulated. But as in the case of 
television's coverage of politics, criticism and calls for regulation are 
mostly intellectual hot air. 
</P>
<P>
"Mail-order" political organizations are a sign of democratic strength. 
Viewpoints that may momentarily be in the minority or of little interest to the 
general public, but are strongly held by a diverse or scattered constituency, 
can be represented and promoted if their advocates can find each other. The 
only economically practical way to do this is through the mails. 
</P>
<P>
This type of political activity has its drawbacks, of course. Leaders of 
mailbox organizations can exploit essentially unedited communications to 
manipulate followers. This is exactly what proponents of the Medicare 
Catastrophic Coverage Act accused the repeal groups of doing. Such political 
manipulation and demagoguery, to be sure, occur in all political settings. But 
with direct mail, there are few, if any, of the usual checks and balances 
associated with political advocacy. 
</P>
<P>
Another drawback of mail-order politics is its tendency to focus on a special 
interest to the exclusion of all legitimate competing interests. But everyone 
looks out after their own interests first. The problem is that decision-makers, 
who must balance competing interests, are afraid to talk back to the 
direct-mail organizations, as they apparently were in the case of 
catastrophic-health-care legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits of advocating through the mails are substantial. Direct-mail 
organizations are meaningful and legitimate political outlets for a large and 
diverse society. They are a detour around the institutional inertia of the 
established political order; they facilitate the introduction of important new 
political issues into the political arena. Many senior citizens who supported 
repeal of catastrophic health care, for example, felt betrayed by the 
established seniors' group because it supported a new tax. They recognized the 
need to form a new organization to represent their viewpoint. The mails gave 
them their opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, average Americans can sit at home and let the political process come to 
them in the form of "offers" to become involved with new causes and issues. He 
or she can select what issues or groups to support with much greater 
flexibility -- and often with greater effect -- than either can choose their 
representative. As with mail-order merchandise, stay-at-home letter readers can 
draft their own mail-order political platform and tailor their own political 
campaign. They know where to recruit: from lists of people who have supported 
other causes. 
</P>
<P>
This networking of people through the mails is how the Reagan revolution was 
able to spread. The opposition to Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination to the U.S. 
Supreme Court was another example of the same phenomenon. Politicians who 
switched their allegiances did so because the cumulative weight of active 
public opinion shifted. 
</P>
<P>
The passing of a political issue can also be determined, in one sense, by 
monitoring the mails: When the targets of the tens of millions of direct-mail 
appeals "order" fewer of the "offers" found in their daily mail. It is hard to 
create a sense of urgency when there isn't any, or maintain collective, 
cooperative efforts when interests diverge. This is one of the safety valves in 
the direct-mail system. Another is the existence of competing offers, and the 
capacity of people to know when their efforts are being wasted. 
</P>
<P>
The main beneficiaries of "mail-order politics," as with most large-scale 
political activities in America, is the middle class. There is something 
inherently democratic about a movement composed of hundreds of thousands (even 
millions) of individual supporters, which is precisely the case with most 
mailbox organizations and not with most political-action committees. The main 
losers, as usual, are the less affluent, largely because they do not have any 
alternative means of being heard. And since the poor are less settled, less 
established and preoccupied with more basic concerns, they remain 
underrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
The techniques of mailbox organizations do not exist in the political desert. 
Direct mail is now an integral part of most political activity, whether of 
candidate, party or political action committee. Neither is the power and 
influence of television any less. Actually, many think of direct mail as "poor 
man's television." But as the TV-evangelist experience has shown, it is the 
checks in the mail, which usually come in response to direct-mail appeals 
reinforced by television, that pay the television bills. 
</P>
<P>
The two media -- television and the mails -- combined create the most power, 
but only through the mails can carefully targeted, pre-selected messages be 
sent. Indeed, the best place to look for the new issues and groups that will 
dominate the 1990s will be your mailbox. And if you're lucky, you'll find 
messages from the group or groups who represent your views. If you don't see 
what you like, why not create your own?

IN GLOBAL-WARMING DEBATE, SKEPTICS CORRAL BUSH WITH A POLICY OF INACTION;

ENVIRONMENT: A SMALL GROUP OF CONSERVATIVE SCIENTISTS TELL THE PRESIDENT THERE 
IS NO PROBLEM; A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF SCIENTIFIC TESTIMONY ARGUES OTHERWISE.

<TEXT>
<P>
What's happening to the Earth's climate is not certain. What's happening to 
U.S. policy on global climate change is becoming clear. Last week President 
Bush ducked yet another opportunity to exert even minimal leadership on the 
issue. His speech Monday to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
was a resolute call for more study. 
</P>
<P>
Last November the United States and Japan blocked an international agreement on 
climate change by refusing to discuss specific reduction of greenhouse gas 
pollutants by any target date. At that meeting, too, Bush's team supported only 
further study. 
</P>
<P>
That do-nothing stance is the result of a White House power struggle being won 
by conservatives led by Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. Sununu is greatly aided 
by a group of conservative scientists who have turned technical uncertainties 
about the greenhouse effect into pseudo-scientific politicking. They argue, to 
the distress of many of their colleagues, that there may not be any global 
warming. 
</P>
<P>
The greenhouse skeptics, according to Science magazine, "number less than a 
dozen . . . . Most have not specialized in greenhouse research and have only 
recently entered the fray." But they are sought out and quoted liberally by 
anyone who wishes the greenhouse effect would go away -- by Forbes magazine, 
for example, in a recent cover article titled "The Global Warming Panic: A 
Classic Case of Overreaction." 
</P>
<P>
Three skeptics -- William A. Nierenberg, director emeritus of Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography; Robert Jastrow, former director of the Goddard 
Institute for Space Studies, and Frederick Seitz, president emeritus of 
Rockefeller University -- have produced a 35-page report widely circulated in 
the White House. The report says, basically, that there is no evidence for 
global warming now, no certainty that there ever will be and even a possibility 
of cooling in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
That's half the argument that Sununu is putting into the President's mouth. The 
other half, advanced by conservative economists, is that anti-greenhouse 
measures will be so expensive that only the greatest scientific certainty could 
justify them. 
</P>
<P>
And in the opposite corner we have James E. Hansen, current Goddard director, 
who also produced scientific shock waves by testifying before Congress that, 
"with 99% confidence," greenhouse warming is already here. We have Steve 
Schneider of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who puts the 
confidence level at 80%, and who has written a blistering critique of the 
Nierenberg/Jastrow/Seitz report. 
</P>
<P>
We have Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute, who calculates that the 
cost of reducing greenhouse gases through energy-efficiency measures could be 
negative -- saving so much money and reducing so many other kinds of pollutants 
that the measures could pay for themselves. And a distinguished array of the 
nation's ecologists -- George Woodwell, Paul Ehrlich, E. O. Wilson and others 
-- are convinced that greenhouse warming is one of the most serious threats to 
the Earth's ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
The primary action necessary to combat a greenhouse effect is to use fossil 
fuels much more efficiently. Whether there is a greenhouse effect or not, 
energy efficiency would improve the environment, the balance of payments and 
the general economy. But it would greatly inconvenience the oil, coal, 
electricity and automobile industries, among others. Hence the eagerness in 
some political camps not to believe in the greenhouse effect, and to cite only 
the side of the argument that feeds such bias. 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists play directly into that political eagerness. Like the rest of 
us, they have genes, glands, emotions, values, whatever predisposes people to 
prefer nature to oil companies or vice versa. Many of the protagonists in the 
greenhouse debate have been combating one another for decades. Whether the 
issue is nuclear energy or nuclear winter, population policy or global warming, 
they are arrayed predictably, some advocating social reform, others defending 
the current order. The last time Nierenberg, Jastrow and Seitz made a public 
statement, it was to promote the Strategic Defense Initiative. Schneider, 
Ehrlich, and Lovins have never taken anything but a dim view of the 
environmental effects of untrammeled industrial society. 
</P>
<P>
That does not make them wrong or manipulative or insincere, it makes them 
human. Their fault comes only when they pass off their values as science. 
Suppose (a large supposition indeed) we had an administration or citizenry that 
wanted to sort out whatever truth there is in the scientific brouhaha, and 
choose the wisest course of action for the whole society. Would that be 
possible ? 
</P>
<P>
It would. The way to separate values from science is to do what Sununu is not 
doing -- listen openly and critically to all sides. Listen for agreement 
(scientific certainty, as far as it goes) and disagreement (scientific 
uncertainty, all mixed up with values). 
</P>
<P>
In the case of global warming, there is absolute agreement that human 
activities are rapidly increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. There is 
near-agreement that more greenhouse gases mean a climate warmer than it would 
otherwise be. There is no agreement about what it would otherwise be. Other 
forces besides greenhouse gases -- such as the sun's energy and wobbles in the 
Earth's orbit -- also affect the climate. Those other forces could be moving in 
a warming direction just now, or they could be about to plunge us into an ice 
age. That we don't know. 
</P>
<P>
We also don't know what feedbacks warming might set off. A hotter Earth would 
evaporate more water, which could make more clouds, which could cool the Earth 
again. Or a hotter Earth could release methane locked in frozen tundra -- 
methane is a greenhouse gas; that would make the Earth still hotter. The 
computerized climate models, from which most greenhouse forecasts derive, 
include few of these feedbacks, which could bring on the greenhouse effect much 
faster than we expect, or much slower. 
</P>
<P>
In short, we know we are doing something that, all else equal, will lead to 
warming. Whether all else will be equal, how fast a climate change could 
happen, what it would mean for rainfall and sea levels, droughts and 
hurricanes, ecosystems and human settlements, all that we don't know. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore we know almost nothing about costs. I have yet to see a cost estimate 
on this matter done honestly -- which is to say, done by comparing what 
greenhouse gas reductions would cost versus what it would cost to endure a 
global warming. The job is virtually impossible. But I believe that every 
anti-greenhouse policy -- energy efficiency, solar energy, forest preservation 
and reforestation, chlorofluorocarbon reduction, population control -- is worth 
pursuing in its own right, even if there is no greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
So here we are, causing large changes in our atmosphere and highly uncertain 
about the consequences. The dynamics of the planet are such that if we wait for 
certainty, it will be too late to do anything -- if anything ought to be done. 
Our choice boils down to a judgment about the value of the current society, 
whose blessings and faults we know, versus an attainable alternative society 
that could be better, or worse, or better for some and worse for others. 
</P>
<P>
Who gets to define better and worse? Where should the burden of our uncertainty 
be placed? On a few sectors of the human economy, on the Earth's ecosystems or 
to some extent on both? Sununu and Bush are letting the ecosystems bear the 
entire risk, a one-sided choice, arrived at in a process both unscientific and 
undemocratic. 
</P>
<P>
The study our President is asking for will concentrate largely on the 
computerized climate models used by Hansen, Schneider and others. Those models 
are highly imperfect. Five or 10 years from now they will still be imperfect. 
They will never be anywhere near as complex as the real Earth. But all we have 
to go on, now and five years from now, is imperfect models, coupled with our 
values. 
</P>
<P>
What the President has decided is that for the foreseeable future, the model 
and the values that will determine U.S. greenhouse policy are the ones in John 
Sununu's head.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the pre-dawn darkness, we stumble along the gravel road leading into Pacific 
Lumber Co.'s private forest. We are trespassers in the most political woods in 
California. Environmentalists and the timber industry are near war over 
Headwaters Forest. 
</P>
<P>
It is a five-mile hike to where some of the thickest redwood stands are, and 
I'm no hiker. I've already managed to lose my glasses; the trees are beginning 
to play tricks on me: They're posing as people. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen," whispers Darryl Cherney, an Earth First! activist. Besides him, the 
other members of our group are guides Todd Swarthout and Raven (no last name, 
please). Cherney thinks he's heard a security guard. He's been caught on 
Pacific Lumber land before and has been ordered by a court to keep out. 
</P>
<P>
But it's just a deer crossing behind us. The time is 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
I'm breaking the law because I want to see Headwaters firsthand, and Pacific 
Lumber never returned my phone calls asking if company officials would be my 
guide. But my desire to see the virgin redwoods is not special. Swarthout 
informs me that he takes groups into the redwood forest about twice a month. 
And they aren't all environmental activists. 
</P>
<P>
The day before our trip, he tells me, a group of six prominent Californians 
trespassed into Headwaters. Their guide wouldn't disclose much about them, only 
saying that some were businessmen and lawyers. He hinted to Swarthout that they 
might help environmentalists in their efforts to save Headwaters. Indeed, the 
timber industry and environmentalists agreed Thursday on a two-year moratorium 
on logging Headwaters. 
</P>
<P>
The forest is so dense that even at noon only a shaft or two of sunlight 
reaches its floor. From the sword ferns to the tufts on the leaves, everything 
is a gentle yellow-green. The scene resembles a Maurice Sendak drawing. There 
are no signs, no roads, no paths. 
</P>
<P>
We mostly wade through massive clumps of ferns, occasionally walking on fallen 
tree trunks. The redwoods are colossal -- 250 feet high, with trunks the size 
of a Volkswagen Beetle. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Pacific Lumber Co., these trees are located in a 3,000-acre stretch of 
Humboldt County timberland that includes some of the oldest virgin sequoias in 
the world. Charles Hurwitz, chief executive officer of Pacific Lumber, wants to 
log some of them to pay down his company's debt. Cherney demands that no tree 
be axed. 
</P>
<P>
The fight is currently being waged in the form of three initiatives. The timber 
industry is collecting signatures for its measure, which would allow loggers to 
regulate their own practices. The other two initiatives are sponsored by 
environmentalists. They would, among other things, clear the way to buy 
Headwaters from Pacific Lumber. 
</P>
<P>
Earth First! activists, among the most radical of environmentalists, have their 
own tactics to keep chain saws out of Headwaters: tree sit-ins and tampering 
with bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have been fighting Pacific Lumber since 1986, when the 
company was taken over by the Maxxam Group, private investors led by Hurwitz. 
After the company was taken over by the private group, Pacific Lumber more than 
doubled its tree-cutting, partly to pay down the debt, mostly junk bonds, that 
the new owners took on to buy the company. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last summer, Hurwitz defended his management of the land and 
company. "There's more timber than the board of directors realized, so we 
(could cut more board feet and not violate) modern-day standards." He wants to 
log about a fifth of the redwoods, or 565 acres, in Headwaters. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, company officials say the increased cutting won't deplete any 
redwood stands. Quite the contrary: They claim to be replacing the forest by 
planting five trees for every one felled. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting on the forest floor, I try to imagine where I am in Headwaters. I hear 
a muffled hum above. It's an airplane. But I can barely see its tracks through 
the tree tops. 
</P>
<P>
While hiking in, there was talk about how an experienced hiker got lost in 
Headwaters for a few days. Should that happen to me, I was instructed, I should 
look for a stream and follow it into town. I didn't confess how unreliable my 
sense of direction is. I vowed to myself to stay near our guide. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Cherney decides he wants to hike deeper into the forest. I want to 
go, too. I want to see if there really are trees that have trunks the size of a 
two-car garage. But my blistered feet will not take me. 
</P>
<P>
Upon Cherney's return, we decide to hike out of the forest before it gets dark. 
It's about 3 p.m. I'm not looking forward to the trek. In the forest, we are 
safe from security guards. Once outside, we are easy targets. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, as we leave Headwaters, I stop to look back. Some of these trees 
were here when Jesus was preaching. As the setting sun turns the sky an ashen 
rose, I wonder how many of them will make it to the year 2000.

THE GREENING OF URBAN AMERICA REQUIRES A LOT MORE THAN A GUSHER OF GREENBACKS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: PRESIDENT BUSH'S CALL TO CREATE STREET FORESTS WILL FAIL WITHOUT 
URBANITES BECOMING THE GUARDIANS OF TREES.

<P>
President Bush's proposal for a massive urban tree-planting program could 
transform our nation and the environment. It could also be counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
The images and mythology associated with tree planting and nurturing stir 
powerful emotions that cut across cultural, racial, economic and political 
lines. Accordingly, they have the power to galvanize Americans into taking 
unprecedented cooperative action. With trees as our banner, we can take on the 
challenge of ameliorating pollution and rebuilding our cities. Perhaps most 
important, this movement could reawaken our confidence, as individuals and as a 
nation, in our ability to solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
But there is an obstacle: If the President and others are persuaded that the 
only missing ingredient is money, the tree-planting program will surely fail. 
</P>
<P>
Picture this: Thousands line a major urban boulevard, removing concrete from 
the sidewalk and digging holes. Each team mixes amendments into the native 
soil, drops in root-control guides that prevent sidewalk damage and pours 
gravel outside the guides to facilitate delivery of water and oxygen to the 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
Team members lift a tree, support its branches, and gently remove the pot from 
its root ball. Steel poles are pounded into position on either side. Special 
rubber ties secure the tree, loose enough to allow it to sway in the wind and 
build trunk strength, tight enough to provide protection from a host of urban 
stresses. 
</P>
<P>
The team dedicates the tree by writing its name -- and signing theirs -- on a 
sign affixed to the steel poles. Stepping back, one can see the boulevard in 
the midst of a profound transformation. 
</P>
<P>
Ecotopia, no. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Los Angeles, Jan. 13, 1990. A 
community scene that can and must be replicated in cities across the United 
States if the President's plan is to work. 
</P>
<P>
Trees in cities need guardians. The best people to perform that task are those 
who benefit most from trees. But how do you cajole busy or hassled urbanites to 
look after trees? 
</P>
<P>
A simple law of humanity is that we take care of those we care about. If we 
invest time, money, resources, spirit and love into a community tree planting, 
we're going to water and watch over our charges. Conversely, if our government 
plants the trees, it should watch out for them. 
</P>
<P>
For the President's program to succeed, he must be willing to share the credit, 
for he's certainly going to share the cost. Large sums of money from 
government, corporations or even foundations, spent in the wrong way, can 
actually prevent communities from building their own support system, thereby 
robbing them of their most essential resource -- the passion to create much 
from little. When neighborhoods must struggle to raise cash to buy them, they 
invariably become fiercely protective of their hard-won trees. Their passion 
for tree maintenance and additional planting is accordingly whetted. 
</P>
<P>
Take the TreePeople organization. What is now a nationally known pioneer in the 
field of urban forestry, with a staff of more than 30 and 600 volunteers and 
15,000 members, began as the dream of a 15-year-old boy who lacked corporate 
"pull" or government dollars. TreePeople has never had a patron to lighten the 
burden of fund-raising. As a result, the organization has grown the way a 
strong tree grows: It developed a sturdy support system in the form of 
grass-roots membership that will be there if government dollars drop away or 
corporate and foundation funding falters. 
</P>
<P>
The value and real power, the joy and satisfaction of community work -- or any 
work -- come from sweat equity. Motivated by politics, or simply by the fatal 
combination of impatience and ignorance, a sudden influx of government "help" 
runs the risk of robbing communities of the real satisfaction that can and 
should come from their efforts at healing the urban environment. 
</P>
<P>
This is not merely moral philosophy. Even with sufficient funds, it's simply no 
longer possible to establish trees in most large cities without an 
extraordinary level of public involvement. The environmental stresses caused by 
inadequate water, extremes of light and temperature and soil and root 
compaction make it difficult for local governments to keep newly planted trees 
alive. And the problem is not only physical, but social as well. Whether it's 
the result of anger or a sense of powerlessness and alienation, a large 
percentage of young, urban trees are victims of random violence. Put another 
way, unwatched trees get walloped. The only sure long-term solution is to 
nurture tree stewardship within communities. 
</P>
<P>
How? People need training and guidance. They need support. And they need 
leadership. At least one model exists. 
</P>
<P>
TreePeople's Citizen Forester Training teaches ordinary people the 
extraordinary skill of breathing life into a community. The basics of species 
selection, planting and care are taught. Instruction on how to organize 
neighbors, raise resources -- labor, supplies and equipment, as well as money 
-- and work with local agencies to obtain permits and logistical support is 
provided. Perhaps as important, students learn patience, persistance and 
perseverance. After their first planting, they learn that the power to reshape 
neighborhoods and cities lies not with government programs but within. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens in Los Angeles working with TreePeople, citizens in California under 
the California ReLeaf banner and citizens across the United States under Global 
ReLeaf are rising up to heal their cities. But urban dwellers themselves need 
to be healed every bit as much as their cities. 
</P>
<P>
Urban forests cannot be planted without money. But they will not survive 
without the love and ownership of trained citizens. The vital partnership 
between citizens and professional urban foresters must be appreciated and 
cultivated, so when those expensive urban trees are at last purchased and 
planted, they will stand a chance of survival. To do that, money for 
professional urban-forest management and for the recruitment and training of 
citizens is needed. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see that this work isn't simply a matter of loving trees, 
beautifying our streets, or attacking the greenhouse effect. Foremost, it's an 
opportunity to galvanize the tremendous amount of latent and often-wasted 
energy residing within our urban populations to help reverse global warming and 
demonstrate that in working together, we have the energy, resources and ability 
to solve other problems. 
</P>
<P>
If the President's plan works, then, in the words of Lao Tse, "When the task is 
fulfilled, the people will all say, 'we did this ourselves.' "

MALATHION CONTROVERSY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why the need to protect the agricultural business of Southern California with 
malathion spraying? The land developers of Southern California have already 
launched their own Medfly assault, and it is clean and profitable. 
</P>
<P>
They simply bulldoze thousands of acres of producing orchards for future 
transportation corridors and housing developments. You don't need an MBA degree 
to figure out that the law of supply and demand will raise fruit prices, not 
the Medfly. The less fruit produced per capita in California will result in 
increased imports. So why the fuss?

SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the author of the 1978 legislation that created the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area, I take issue with Bill Boyarsky's discouraging 
assessment of the efforts to save this beautiful area ("Watching the Mountains 
Go Downhill," Metro, Feb. 2). 
</P>
<P>
It's true that some very valuable pieces of land in the Santa Monicas have been 
lost to development, or are about to be. However, of the 150,000 acres within 
the boundaries of the recreation area, roughly 60,000 are already in public 
ownership -- thanks mainly to the state's foresight in establishing four large 
parks in the mountains many years ago. The 16,000 acres of park land Boyarsky 
mentioned refer only to land which the National Park Service itself has 
acquired. 
</P>
<P>
That the Park Service has been able to acquire even that much acreage is a 
testament to park supporters' ability to make progress under adverse 
circumstances. Not only did we have to contend with skyrocketing land prices 
and competition from developers, but also the opposition of President Reagan 
and his appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, we were able to persuade Congress to continue appropriating at 
least modest amounts of funds for the Santa Monicas anyway, which enabled the 
National Park Service to buy some key properties. And, two years ago, the park 
got a big boost from Prop. 70, which provided $30 million for state 
acquisitions in the mountains. Now that we have a President who supports the 
Santa Monica Mountains park, the prospects for its continued expansion are more 
encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
We shall keep working to obtain federal funds for land acquisition but, to 
ensure that the Park Service has the opportunity to buy land before it is 
developed, local officials will need to make appropriate land-use decisions -- 
for example, refraining from increasing zoning densities, which make the land 
more attractive to develop.

MALATHION CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article ("Man Behind Malathion Safety Study Disavows It," Part B, Feb. 6) 
leaves the impression that the only transgression of California officials who 
altered the Medfly risk assessment that I co-wrote and directed was to make an 
"insignificant" change in one portion of our calculations. In fact, the change 
made was consistent with the wholesale exclusion of the major portion of our 
conclusions regarding the uncertainty which existed (and still exists) over the 
long-term safety of such a spray operation. By fudging the numbers on our 
cancer risk assessment so that the apparent risk was no more than 1 in a 
million, it was possible for the reviewer to keep the artifice that the report 
issued an "all clear" for malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the 1980 report, on which the state still relies, itemized residual 
concerns about genetic damage, cancer and birth defects in exposed populations. 
Some of these issues, specifically those relating to chromosomal damage, are 
critically important to resolve, since it is possible that no threshold exists 
for producing such an effect. Repeated sprayings, on often vulnerable 
populations, may lead to exposures that are cumulative in their effects. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, what is needed is a fresh look at the entire spectrum of health 
consequences of spraying a mixture of chemicals. In the original report, the 
major sections had to be limited to pure malathion, not the commercial grade 
which is currently being used. It is this grade which has the greatest 
proclivity for producing damage -- and it is widely known that its toxicity is 
greater (depending on the extent of contamination with more noxious alkylating 
agents) than is malathion alone. The decision to convene a panel of such 
experts is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it is worth asking what the response of any governmental 
agency would have been if experimental data and conclusions were altered in the 
manner that my report was in 1980. Such manipulation of data and distortion of 
clearly stated conclusions regarding residual concerns of safety might well be 
labeled fraud.

HOT AIR AND THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It doesn't take a degree in meteorology to see that the White House is cooling 
off on global warming. The question is: Why? 
</P>
<P>
If this reflects only President Bush's customary caution, there is no harm 
done. Even if it reflects skepticism about being able to come up soon with 
precise measurements of anything as vast as the planetary atmosphere, there is 
no real cause to strip Bush of his environmental epaulets. 
</P>
<P>
But if it represents a backing away from concern that man-made carbon dioxides 
are forming an envelope around the Earth that eventually will raise 
temperatures in strange places by trapping heat that now escapes into space, 
then the environmentalists are right to worry. 
</P>
<P>
Few scientists question the validity of the theory that various gases, most of 
them generated by burning fuels for energy, are creating a monster greenhouse 
effect. They just want more information before they are ready to join the 
handful who think they know enough now to say when heat will cause oceans to 
rise and glaciers to melt. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was right to ask Congress for one thing that is essential to answer 
questions like those: money. His new budget would increase this country's 
Global Change research program by 60%, to more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Caution on the greenhouse also can cause little trouble as long as Bush does 
not slow down programs that could retard global warming because they make sense 
on other grounds, such as making electrical generators and automobiles more 
efficient and saving tropical rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
But the President was on rather shaky ground when he talked of making 
absolutely certain that future efforts to deal with the greenhouse effect are 
consistent with sound principles of economics. Nearly a century ago, a British 
economist, A. C. Pigou, developed the now widely held theory that industries 
could not expect to pay hard cash for raw materials, land, labor and the rent 
of money and then use air and water as if they were free goods. Principles of 
economics don't get any more sound or venerable than that.

A SPEEDY TRIAL IS THE RULE, MCMARTIN THE ABERRATION; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THIS CASE WAS EXCEPTIONAL IN ITS COMPLEXITY AND NUMBERS. IT'S NO SIGN 
OF HOW MOST FELONIES ARE HANDLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD P. BYRNE, Richard P. Byrne is presiding judge of the Los Angeles 
Superior Court. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The verdict in the McMartin Preschool child molestation case has focused 
renewed public attention on the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
Since the not-guilty verdicts were delivered last month, many in the public and 
the press have charged that McMartin illustrates all of the ills that plague 
the courts -- including a costly legal process that is excruciatingly long and 
laborious. 
</P>
<P>
But the impression that the McMartin case was representative of the speed at 
which the criminal justice system works is incorrect. McMartin was an 
aberration. It has been both the longest and costliest case ever tried. It 
initially involved a great number of defendants charged with many, many counts 
of very serious criminal behavior, over a six-year period. The testimony of 
children had to be relied upon to establish the crimes. Other events occurred 
in the course of the trial that made it more complicated and extended its 
length. (One defendant, Raymond Buckey, faces retrial on at least some of the 
13 counts that the jury deadlocked on.) 
</P>
<P>
While the public has criticized the Superior Court for being too slow in 
handling McMartin and other criminal cases, many people fail to understand the 
dimensions of the problem we face. The sheer volume of felony cases we process 
in Los Angeles County is mind-boggling. In the last 10 years, felony case 
filings have risen from 20,420 in 1980 to 32,308 in 1985 to 51,307 last year. 
That's an increase of 151%. Civil, family law, juvenile, probate and other 
cases have increased as well, although not to the same extent. During this 
period, the number of Superior Court judges in Los Angeles County has increased 
by only 21%, from 196 in 1980 to 238 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of increased filings, the handling of felony cases has been speeded. 
During the first 11 months of 1989, the average time it took to determine the 
guilt or innocence of an in-custody defendant charged with a felony in the 
Central District, where the McMartin case was tried, was 48.4 days. The median 
adjudication time for these cases was 22 days. (The median is the midpoint 
along the range of case processing. Half of the cases take more than the median 
time to adjudicate; the other half, less.) 
</P>
<P>
The National Center for State Courts recently studied felony case processing 
time at 26 trial courts around the country. While Los Angeles Superior Court 
was not included in the study, our median adjudication time would have tied for 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
While our record for resolving felony cases is very good, we believe it can be 
even better. Over the past several years the Superior Court has worked 
cooperatively with other criminal-justice agencies to develop and implement 
numerous programs aimed at resolving cases before they get to trial, reducing 
the time it takes to try and sentence defendants and granting judges with 
complex cases additional time to concentrate on them, so they can dispose of 
them more quickly. Most people are unaware that Judge William Pounders, who 
tried the McMartin case, carried a full calendar of other felony matters until 
last summer, when we were able to open six additional courts in the Criminal 
Courts Building to speed felony case disposition and transfer the rest of his 
calendar to another judge. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, lessons in how to expedite complex criminal cases can be learned from 
the McMartin case. But the public -- and press -- should not use this case as 
the yardstick by which it measures all others. 
</P>
<P>
And when Ray Buckey is retried, his rights will be protected by the judge, just 
as mine or yours would be if we were charged with a crime. His guilt or 
innocence will be determined in a court of law by a jury of his peers. The 
jurors will be instructed that the defendant is presumed to be innocent until 
the contrary is proved, and that if they have a reasonable doubt as to whether 
his guilt has been satisfactorily shown, he is entitled to a verdict of not 
guilty. That's the way our jury system should and does work -- regardless of 
how much time it takes.

NAKED AND VULNERABLE UP AND DOWN THE COAST; 
</P>
<P>
OIL SPILLS: THE ORANGE COUNTY SLICK WAS JUST THE LITTLE BIG ONE. WE SHOULD ACT 
NOW IF WE'RE EVER TO AVERT A LARGER CATASTROPHE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAYDEN, Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) is a member of the state Assembly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-seven hours after the accident, after much talk of effective 
containment, the oil slick first rolled in, met by 25 hired workers with rakes 
and absorbent towels. 
</P>
<P>
However well or poorly the Orange County cleanup effort fares from here, it is 
clear that the California coastline remains largely naked and vulnerable. It is 
dependent more on Mother Nature than upon any contingency plan for protection 
against oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
And, to borrow a phrase born in the San Francisco earthquake, this is not the 
Big One, only the Little Big One. 
</P>
<P>
This one, remember, is 1/35 the size of last year's Alaskan spill and a tenth 
that of the Santa Barbara spill of 20 years ago. It occurred in "ideal 
conditions," as a Coast Guard official observed. Not only were the waves and 
winds benign and the crew sober, but the spill took place just eight nautical 
miles from the only location of a cleanup team in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
I have visited the headquarters of that team, called Clean Coastal Waters, in 
Long Beach Harbor. I highly recommend it to anyone trying to penetrate the 
abstract technical arguments over how safe we are from spills. 
</P>
<P>
The scene is this: Every year there are 2,500 separate tanker trips in and out 
of the harbor. The tanker captains are under no single traffic officer; the 
place is something like a floating freeway with each driver negotiating his own 
lanes. One tanker carries up to 23 million gallons of oil, enough, when 
refined, to power 1 million cars from here to New York. Or, to do damage that 
is hard to imagine until you hold a bird that has learned what it's really like 
to be tarred and feathered. 
</P>
<P>
Moored to a small dock in the midst of all this harbor-tanker traffic are four 
vessels that comprise our front-line defense against this slick. Funded and 
maintained by the oil industry, the flagship of the fleet is Clean Waters I, a 
150-foot vessel carrying a skimmer and tanks of chemical dispersants. The other 
three boats are like large Boston Whalers. Glossy photographs show them 
bouncing through the surf alongside happy dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Clean Waters team three hours to travel eight miles to the spill 
site. By then darkness had descended, and the crews couldn't begin to really 
attack the spill until morning. Their equipment is designed to joust with a 
spill up to the size of the Orange County one. And even with "ideal" weather, 
the slick made the beach. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Skip Olmstead, the commander of Clean Waters, whether he could fight a 
Santa Barbara-sized spill. "Impossible," he frankly replied. 
</P>
<P>
What about two smaller spills at the same time? A spill off San Diego instead 
of San Pedro? The current spill in serious winds? The answer would be the same. 
</P>
<P>
The oil industry and regulators are surprisingly candid on this score. At a 
joint legislative hearing last year, I vividly remember two questions asked: 
Could an Alaskan-type spill happen here? Are we prepared? The straight answers 
were: Yes, it could happen here, even worse than Alaska because of our waves. 
No, we couldn't fight it. Not soothing testimony, when even the Minerals 
Management Service predicts a 94% likelihood of a huge California spill in the 
next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
There is a pattern resembling fiction by Orwell or Kafka. Since Santa Barbara, 
the authorities have reassured us that lessons have been learned, that 
catastrophe cannot happen again because precautions have been taken. Then, when 
a new catastrophe nonetheless occurs, the authorities say it couldn't be 
helped, they are investigating, whatever happened will be corrected, they are 
doing their best. 
</P>
<P>
This bureaucratic mentality deserves the fate it received in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
We Californians once again must take greater charge of our coastline. There are 
specific steps that can be taken: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Require double hulls for tankers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tankers and terminals can be required to have prevention plans approved by 
the state, with local participation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tanker-traffic controllers, like air controllers, can be required in our 
harbors and shipping lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Better-equipped cleanup crews can be headquartered at the most critical 
points all along the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A $500-million prevention and cleanup fund can be created to ensure that 
personnel are trained and that sufficient money is immediately available when 
disasters begin. A 25-cents-a-barrel fee would pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ban new drilling in state waters. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals such as these are contained in legislation awaiting hearing in 
Sacramento and in the Environmental Protection Initiative proposed for 
November. 
</P>
<P>
The key is simple: Put California in charge of maximizing its coastal safety 
and rely less on the oil industry. The current approach is a crude joke.

The dirty and unspoken secret of American foreign policy is the "R" word. It is 
not uttered in polite society, but nothing else can explain our government's 
often cruel and contradictory policies. Racism disregards black lives, and 
black lives are being lost daily in southern Africa because of callous policy 
decisions made by the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and South Africa have contributed weapons, money and other 
resources to Renamo, the right-wing rebels in Mozambique, and to UNITA, a rebel 
organization in Angola. Both are terrorist groups that have caused not only 
widespread death and misery in those countries but also an extraordinary $40 
billion in property damage over the past 10 years, according to a recent United 
Nations report. The price of American and South African foreign policy is the 
blood and the lives of black Africans. 
</P>
<P>
While we seem to have money for war, we give no money for peace. For the coming 
year, eight African nations -- Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Malawi, 
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe -- are expected to get a pitiful total 
of about $50 million in American foreign-development aid. These countries, 
which are part of the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference, 
contain 76 million people, most of them poor, many of them starving or losing 
their lives to disease, many more of them dying in U.S.- and South 
African-supported violence. 
</P>
<P>
All over southern Africa, hundreds of thousands of children die every year from 
malaria, yellow fever, influenza, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases. 
In Tanzania alone, 250,000 children die every year of sicknesses that in the 
Western world have been effectively abolished. Hunger and starvation are 
rampant in these countries. The health-care systems are overburdened to the 
point of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the causes of misery in southern Africa are found in nature. The 
apartheid government in South Africa has engaged over the past several years in 
a systematic campaign of terrorist aggression, destabilization and sabotage 
against neighboring countries. In the past decade, this strategy for regional 
military dominance has caused the deaths of 1.5 million people in southern 
Africa, more than half of them children under 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official told a United Nations Conference on 
Mozambique in early 1988 that the Renamo campaign was "a systematic and brutal 
war of terror against innocent civilians through forced labor, starvation, 
physical abuse and wanton killing." 
</P>
<P>
According to UNICEF, 494,000 children under age 5 in Mozambique died from 
war-related causes between 1980 and 1988, and 331,000 Angolan children under 5 
lost their lives to UNITA's war. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony during a congressional hearing last year, the United 
States sends the bandits of UNITA an estimated $80 million a year in covert aid 
to wage their unpopular and futile war of death and destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, we Americans spend more of our money causing bloodshed in Angola than we 
do on promoting development in the states of the Southern Africa Development 
Coordination Conference, nations that are all struggling to create democracy 
and diversify their economies. If we can support important processes of 
liberalization and economic reconstruction in Europe, why not in Africa? What 
is the difference? 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of aid to Africa assert that Africa has less "strategic" importance 
to us than Europe. Then, it must be asked, why have we spent hundreds of 
millions of dollars supporting South Africa's dubious foreign policy by 
encouraging destruction and terror in the region? What justifies our 
participation in these guerrilla wars? 
</P>
<P>
The aftermath of the invasion of Panama and the end of the Cold War in Europe 
show us how quickly America can mobilize to give foreign aid to a people in 
need. It only took Congress days after the shake-up in Eastern Europe to 
authorize more than $900 million in development aid for Poland and Hungary over 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
The swift passage of aid to these countries was morally right. We have an 
obligation to help the people of Panama recover from the damage caused by our 
invasion and the Noriega dictatorship. Similarly, the whole world is cheering 
for democracy and freedom in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But if we can help white people in Europe to improve their quality of life and 
their political system, we can do the same for black people in Africa. If we 
can contemplate a second Marshall Plan for the relatively wealthy nations of 
Europe, we can develop a first Marshall Plan for the impoverished nations of 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, now that we have helped to create so much misery and chaos in 
southern Africa, we have an obligation to help the people of the region find 
their way to economic development, freedom from starvation and political 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
At this brilliant juncture in the history of humanity, the people of America 
must reevaluate and re-create our foreign policy. It is time to bring the "R" 
word out into the open and then banish it once and for all from the conduct of 
our foreign policy. Let us not bring our worst baggage from the most horrible 
days of the 20th Century into the hopeful new day of the 21st.

WHERE THE SKIES ARE NOT CLOUDY ALL DAY;

<P>
GROWING UP WESTERN RECOLLECTIONS EDITED AND WITH INTRODUCTIONS BY CLARUS 
BACKES; FOREWORD BY LARRY MCMURTRY (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $22.95; 240 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Jordan-Smith, Jordan-Smith is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Up behind the house in the hilly suburbs of Colorado Springs, my wife's cousin 
has a little place marked out among the pines which he refers to as his "shrine 
of the West." There he has some of the things that we all commonly associate 
with the American West: a couple of bleached cow skulls, an old wagon wheel, 
various odds and ends of mining iron, etc. 
</P>
<P>
You can't see the spot from anywhere around, not even the house. It's just 
there, and he knows it's there, and now and then he adds something to it. 
Another of my wife's cousins retired with his wife to an isolated piece of land 
in western Nevada, with no running water until last year, electricity supplied 
by a gas generator, a privy out in the sagebrush, and no phone. 
</P>
<P>
These little vignettes are not unlike those provided by the seven distinguished 
men writers (why no women?) who grew up somewhere in that almost independent 
nation we call The West: Dee Brown ("Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"), A. B. 
Guthrie Jr. ("The Big Sky"), David Lavender ("One Man's West"), Wright Morris 
("The Field of Vision"), Clyde Rice ("A Heaven in the Eye"), Wallace Stegner 
("The Big Rock Candy Mountain") and Frank Waters ("Book of the Hopi"). 
</P>
<P>
Mentioning single titles like this does not do justice to the writers, of 
course. Some are known best by these works, but all have written others -- some 
more memorable than others -- and of course Wallace Stegner and Wright Morris 
were the 1980 and 1981 winners of the Los Angeles Times Robert Kirsch Award for 
the whole body of their work, and there are other national awards scattered 
among these seven. 
</P>
<P>
The editor of this book, Clarus Backes, was book editor of the Denver Post. 
Before his death in 1988, Backes gathered these anecdotal pieces and wrote 
brief introductions to each. His children completed the editing and saw their 
father's book into press, and another distinguished western writer, Larry 
McMurtry, agreed to write a foreword. 
</P>
<P>
The writers chosen all are now in their 80s, so they grew up in a West -- 
between Oregon and Texas -- that has changed considerably since their several 
boyhoods. The vignettes of Western life have a common texture, therefore, which 
corresponds to a great extent with the mental icon, carried by many Americans, 
which represents this curious region. 
</P>
<P>
And it is a curious region, with an even more curious iconographic consistency: 
One might say that the image we have of the West is of the highest definition, 
to a degree even more pronounced than that of the South. Western dress and 
Western music, for example, are unique in the American cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
If we think about it, we might be able to concoct "Southern dress," perhaps 
even "Pacific Coast dress," or that of the Northeast, but Western clothes do 
not need any concoction: We know the elements of the cowboy outfit instantly; 
so do people around the world. We call the music "Country and Western," but its 
origins are clearly in the cowboy ballad. Indeed, the West, as icon, was 
perhaps the first internationally recognized image of American character. 
</P>
<P>
The texture presented in these vignettes should not, therefore, come as any 
surprise. The features of the land, and the raw quality of the civilization 
that crept into it, element by element, are not unfamiliar: ranch life, the 
railroad, whorehouses, telegraph offices, saloons, gold mines, all the panoply 
of the West that corresponds to our image of it, all spread out against the 
mountains, rivers, plains and deserts that are still there, some of them even 
untouched by strip- mining and real-estate development. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Wright Morris, describing a scene from his boyhood: "At a time every 
western man smoked and gambled, spitting indoors was something of an option. My 
father neither smoked, drank, gambled nor swore, but he liked to sit and talk 
in a good lobby. A good one had palm trees in tubs at the front, with a tile 
floor all the way back to the desk. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a lobby from where to watch what was going on, without a lobby where 
something of interest might happen, a town could have half a dozen or more good 
railroads but in no time at all none of the trains would stop. Even before I 
knew anything else, I knew that." 
</P>
<P>
It is an odd book, strangely comforting in its assurance that what we think of 
when we summon up an image of the West is not just the invention of Hollywood. 
As kids, most of us seemed to know that the movies were filmed in Simi Valley 
(after all, why truck all that film gear so far from the studios?), but we 
fervently hoped that the West of Randolph Scott had been in fact something like 
what we were shown. 
</P>
<P>
But what, after all, is the appeal of the West? What is the hunger in us that 
its violent landscapes and the ruggedly individualistic character traits of its 
people promise to satisfy? There are lots of cheap answers, none adequate. Why 
did I buy myself a pair of cowboy boots in Colorado Springs, to the 
uncomprehending and sardonic amusement of my wife? Her cousin could not explain 
it to her, any more than could I. 
</P>
<P>
Why did we both find the gently dying mining town of Victor, on the slopes of 
Pike's Peak, infinitely preferable to the touristy hucksterism of Cripple 
Creek? I looked to Frank Waters, who grew up there, and to Dee Brown and the 
others for an answer, but they seem just as unable to explain it. 
</P>
<P>
One of my best friends, the Western painter Ron Himler, moved to Tucson to get 
closer to the country of his subject, the Indians of the Plains and the 
Southwest. I asked him what made him choose the subject that ultimately drew 
him to where he feels he has found his roots. We polished off a lot of brandy 
one night talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't explain it either.

THE SECOND IRON CURTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When we say "the Middle East" we are usually thinking of a physical area 
bounded on the south by the Sahara and the waters of the Indian Ocean; a 
cultural area where Islamic and Arab civilization is the dominant factor. In 
one direction only we find neither a cultural nor a physical barrier but simply 
a political barrier: the boundary of the U.S.S.R. . . . Beyond it there is 
another huge area that is equally the Middle East, part of the great Islamic 
cultural belt. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow managed to divide the Middle East by an Iron Curtain just as it divided 
Europe. Yet the setting up of miles of barbed wire and the intrusion of 
divisions of Russian frontier troops have no more de-Islamized and de-Turkized 
central Asia than they have converted Poland into a non-European community. 
</P>
<P>
In the southern, or free, part of the Middle East, the Russians strongly 
advocate the unity of the various Arab-speaking peoples. In their own area, 
they strongly suppress pan-Turkism, the equivalent. In their propaganda, they 
conduct violent attacks on alliances between the United Kingdom and independent 
states of Arabia. Criticism of their own rule over the colonial territories of 
Turkestan and the Caucasus is treated as vicious incitement. . . . The Russians 
have taken every possible step to destroy Islamic and Turkic sentiments. First, 
they have split up the nationalities of Turkestan politically and attempted to 
exaggerate the diversity and to deny the common features of their languages and 
cultures; and they have provided them with false histories. Turkestan as a unit 
-- indeed, even as a word -- survives in the Soviet only in the "Turkestan 
Military district," under a Russian general. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The whole of the vast area of the Soviet Middle East retains a potential 
dynamism against Communist rule, just as -- indeed, much more than -- Arab 
nationalism does against the more flexible West. When and if the Soviet regime 
breaks up or evolves, this area will come back into the world. Even in its 
present unbreakable quarantine, it plays an important part. It is kept alive by 
the existence of the great Islamic culture to the south of it; and at the same 
time, that culture, with all its temporary emphasis against the West, never 
entirely forgets the far greater hostages it has had torn from it, and looks 
forward to one day receiving back.

TYRANTS AND TYPEWRITERS COMMUNIQUES FROM THE STRUGGLE FOR TRUTH BY ROBERT 
CONQUEST (LEXINGTON BOOKS / D. C. HEATH: $19.95; 208 PP.; 0-669-21222-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Karen Steinberg, Steinberg, an editor at the Rand Corp., has reviewed books 
on Soviet literature and politics for the San Francisco Chronicle and the 
Christian Science Monitor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first thing that strikes one about "Tyrants and Typewriters: Communiques 
From the Struggle for Truth" is that its splendid title is a misnomer. 
Ostensibly presenting portraits of Soviet writers and their works, and showing 
how, over time, the pen has proved a mighty weapon against oppression and a 
primary stimulus for glasnost, this book really offers a loosely connected 
collection of reviews and essays by Kremlinologist Robert Conquest, author of 
numerous books on Soviet politics and history. 
</P>
<P>
Each piece in the collection was written to stand alone and appears without 
prefatory comment. Thus not only does no continuity exist between pieces, but 
proceeding from one to the next is a bit like being thrown successively into 
the deep end of vastly different swimming pools. We're not given an opportunity 
to dip our toes into the water first, to understand what we'll be dealing with; 
and by the time we've managed to struggle to the surface, we're plunged into 
yet another unfamiliar pool. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that these waters aren't worth our efforts, however. Taken 
individually, Conquest's reviews and essays offer important insights into a 
wide range of writers and their works. These self-contained analyses are 
grouped into three rather arbitrary sections (only one of which is preceded by 
an introduction) -- "Witnesses," "Literature" and "History and Pseudo-History." 
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 pieces in "Witnesses" is a discussion of Hungarian-born novelist 
Arthur Koestler's masterpiece based on the Moscow trials of the 1930s, 
"Darkness at Noon." Conquest's historical critique of this work illuminates our 
understanding of how Koestler was able "to effect one of the first major 
penetrations of the Western consciousness by a true feeling for the element of 
vast and ruthless deception in the Stalinist scheme of things." Two other 
notable inclusions are a review of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Andrei 
Sakharov's "Progress, Coexistence and Intellectual Freedom" and a detailed 
assessment of the impact of "The Gulag Archipelago" by Nobel laureate Aleksandr 
Solzhenitsyn. 
</P>
<P>
A brief introduction entitled "The Issue" precedes the second section, "Tyrants 
and Typewriters." Simply put, in Soviet literature the "issue" is artistic 
freedom -- the ability to speak one's mind without catering to a political 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Although Conquest claims he approaches the 11 authors and works grouped under 
"Literature" from a "fundamentally literary point of view," he provides ample 
discussion of related political situations and implications, particularly in 
the essays on Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg, poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko and former 
editor (of the influential literary journal Novy Mir) Alexander Tvardovsky. And 
this is all to the good, because such discussion is Conquest's real strength. 
The more strictly literary analyses (on poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, for example) 
aren't nearly as compelling. 
</P>
<P>
The final section, "History and Pseudo-History," contains 16 pieces. Included 
are a particularly insightful review of Roy Medvedev's "Let History Judge," a 
discussion of genocide as revealed in Alexander Nekrich's "June 22, 1941," and 
a review of Harrison Salisbury's "The Siege of Leningrad" that examines 
mortality statistics. A short epilogue on Solzhenitsyn forms the volume's 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing Solzhenitsyn's role in the West and his impact on Soviet leadership, 
Conquest notes that now is the time for the Kremlin to consider the author's 
advice as set forth in his 1973 "Letter to Soviet Leaders." "He asked of them 
not that they abandon power," Conquest writes, "but that they withdraw the 
autocracy to the realm of political rule only, allowing an autonomous civic, 
legal, economic and intellectual life to their citizens; and that they renounce 
their expansionist world mission." It was Solzhenitsyn and the other writers 
examined in "Tyrants and Typewriters," Conquest avers, who were responsible for 
crippling the Soviet system's "huge organism of falsehood" and who showed "the 
best way forward for a return to reason and reality." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, though this sounds impressive and may well be true, "Tyrants and 
Typewriters" never clearly shows how this happened. The book's introduction 
claims that, in addition to dealing with political themes, "Tyrants and 
Typewriters" is "about writing in general, as the sphere in which the 
individual asserts autonomy against the power of the state." Although we see 
this indirectly throughout the volume, Conquest never makes the connections 
explicit enough. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the book's main problem lies in its very concept. Assembling a diverse 
collection of reviews and essays into one coherent statement is a difficult 
task at best; one way of ensuring at least a modicum of unity, however, is by 
linking together the separate pieces. "Tyrants and Typewriters" would have been 
far better -- and more accessible to a broader audience -- had each piece been 
put into context and related to the rest. As it stands, this critical 
compilation will be of interest to (and understood by) only a very small group 
of Soviet specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, this is one case in which the total is less than the sum of its 
parts.

BLOODY SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best crime writing diverts and entertains but it also catches the flavor of 
its time, and now and again the milieu is itself the message. So it is with 
Josef Skvorecky's The End of Lieutenant Boruvka; translated by Paul Wilson (W. 
W. Norton: $18.95; 167 pp.), six connected stories featuring a homicide 
detective working in Prague in 1968, at the time of the Soviet "fraternal" 
occupation of the country. 
</P>
<P>
It is the third collection of Boruvka stories and, to judge by the climactic 
events, the last. Josef Boruvka has had all he can take of the political 
corruption around and above him. He solves crimes -- among them, the apparent 
suicide of a beautiful young woman, the shooting of another -- only to have the 
guilty protected because of their political job or connections. 
</P>
<P>
Skvorecky, whose other writings include "The Bass Saxophone" and "The Engineer 
of Human Souls," evokes, with a terrible and mesmerizing immediacy, an 
oppressed and oppressive country with all its petty tyrannies, hypocrisies and 
insults to the soul. Read now against the recent freeings-up in Czechoslovakia 
and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Skvorecky's stories have the quality of 
prediction. He leaves no doubt that everything had to change, and in the 
lieutenant, Skvorecky has created a real, idiosyncratic and thoroughly likable 
protagonist, a rumpled and perfect symbol of the urgings for rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
By my count, Vespers (William Morrow: $18.95; 331 pp.) is the 41st of Ed 
McBain's 87th Precinct novels, set in a metropolis that is not quite New York 
or any other identifiable metropolis but linked to them all by the turbulence 
of its streets and the extremes of its life styles. 
</P>
<P>
The first three in the series were published in 1956, but after more than 30 
years at it (his output also including other novels published as Evan Hunter), 
McBain shows no sign of wearying or repeating himself. He is a muscular 
storyteller whose pace is relentless, dialogue crisp, detailings economic but 
telling, and who keeps finding fresh themes and sub-environments. 
</P>
<P>
In "Vespers," a young Catholic priest is stabbed to death at the door of the 
church. A cult of Satanists is headquartered not far away. (McBain gives more 
play-by-play on the Black Mass than the devout or the squeamish may care to 
read about; fair warning.) 
</P>
<P>
There are some surprising links between church and anti-church in the story, 
and surprising, too, in its believable way, is the solution of the mystery of 
the priest's death. McBain is not unsympathetic to his characters, and he can 
lead the reader's sympathy exactly where he wants it to go. But his 
encompassing vision of life appears neither sunny nor optimistic, and the 
ending of "Vespers" is a very sardonic song at twilight. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Daniels Cornwell was a crime reporter on the Charlotte Observer who 
then became a computer analyst in the chief medical examiner's office in 
Virginia. Her only previous book was a biography of Mrs. Billy Graham. For her 
first mystery, Postmortem (Scribner's: $16.95; 293 pp.), she has created a 
protagonist, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, who is, conveniently enough, Virginia's chief 
medical examiner. 
</P>
<P>
The police are confronting a serial rapist, following a forensic trial in which 
the computer is massively involved. Cornwell trots out her expertise in 
dazzling and occasionally bewildering fashion. But the specifics are 
fascinating, as work well-described always is, whether it's Dick Francis at the 
track or Amanda Cross on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Scarpetta has a terrible time with the chauvinists around her, one of whom 
in particular is malevolently eager for her to fail. These passages have the 
ring of truth as experienced, and so does the portrait of an investigative 
reporter who abets the solving. (Cornwell has mastered the writer's lesson of 
starting with what you know best.) 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, the novel is about the tracking down, not the culprit, who turns 
out to be as anonymous as a bus rider, even though he nearly adds Scarpetta to 
his scorecard. The story is based loosely on an actual serial killer in 
Richmond, and Scarpetta evidently has a real-life model in the medical 
examiner's office. Whatever its inspirations, "Postmortem" is a first-rate 
first thriller, and I hope to run into Dr. Scarpetta again. 
</P>
<P>
Edna Buchanan is another police reporter (for the Miami Herald, where she won a 
Pulitzer Prize in 1966) who has become a crime novelist. Nobody Lives Forever 
(Random House: $17.95; 241 pp.) is her second thriller (the first was "The 
Corpse Had a Familiar Face"). 
</P>
<P>
She is nothing if not adventurous, and her villain is a woman with multiple 
personalities -- an evil Eve. She is by turns a simpering child-woman, a raging 
and imaginative nymphomaniac, an uptight and obsessively clean housekeeper, a 
murderous male and, when she is reasonably in control, the mistress of a cop 
who is working on the various murders. 
</P>
<P>
The cop is conveniently blind to his lady's severe mood swings, although his 
buddy tumbles soon enough, thus enhancing the story's quota of suspense. 
Writing through the consciousnesses of the various personae (who are 
dangerously jealous of each other, and, in every case but one, resentful of the 
detective), is no small trick. Buchanan makes it readable rather than 
convincing, but she generates a lot of suspense along the way and her plotting 
is nothing if not inventive. 
</P>
<P>
At that, Buchanan is at her most readable when she is evoking today's Miami, 
especially when a full moon has set all the weirdos a-hollering or when, in the 
blazing light of day, the great contrasts in a city with its own multiple and 
conflicted personalities are seen as through shimmering heat waves. 
</P>
<P>
William Hood is said to have spent 30 years with various intelligence and 
counterintelligence agencies, including the OSS and its successor, the CIA. 
Reading Cry Spy (W. W. Norton: $18.95; 303 pp.), that claim is easy. Like the 
works of John Le Carre, his novel declares on every page that these must most 
indubitably be the tricks, the jargon, the endeavors of spy craft. 
</P>
<P>
These are hard days for spies and spy-writers, with glasnost making gingerly 
neutrals of old adversaries and leaving an operative uncertain where his next 
squeal is coming from. 
</P>
<P>
Hood's man, the veteran Alan Trosper, introduced in "Spy Wednesday," wants to 
discover why an old cloak-and-dagger pal, who had ostensibly come in safely 
from the cold, has been killed in England by a hard-to-detect poison favored by 
Moscow Central. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect I'd have trouble passing a quiz on who had done what to whom on whose 
behalf. As in both Le Carre and Len Deighton, clarity is not a top priority and 
everyone speaks cryptically. The book, for all the ellipses, is considerably 
talkative, and yet there is a satisfactory quantity of action, a kidnaping and 
a forced confession or two among the pleasures. The mostly European settings 
and the characters, moles and countermoles as well as excessively mannered 
Washington higher-ups, are vividly captured (if that's the word). 
</P>
<P>
Bloody Sunday 
</P>

The Man in the Moon (St. Martin's: $16.95; 295 pp.) is a first cloth novel by 
Frank Norwood, a Los Angeles social worker and screenwriter. His hero is a 
half-Irish, Half-Hispanic bail-bondsman, raised in the East Los Angeles barrio, 
a sometime welterweight contender (still bearing scars from a fight with 
Marvelous Marvin Hagler) now in his late 30s. He lives in a dumpy flat near 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
The book's interest is that it does have a feeling for the Los Angeles 
underside, not that Norwood is the first to discover it. The book's problem is 
Norwood's overwriting in emulation of Raymond Chandler and other stylists who 
kept or keep their images under fairly strict control. Plenty of complication 
and, after much action, a snowy shoot-out in the mountains of far-off 
Pennsylvania. A writer to watch for again, as he steadies his voice.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE CAGE KEEPER AND OTHER STORIES BY ANDRE DUBUS III 
(PLUME: $7.95) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Darkly powerful stories of the American underclass: drifters, bikers, ex-cons 
and drop-outs. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Dubus' angry, threatened people struggle in vain against the system that 
has beaten them down. The father in "White Trees, Hammer Moon" tries to be a 
nurturing parent, but the violent temper and weakness for alcohol that lead to 
his conviction for manslaughter overcome his good intentions. The ancient 
snapping turtle in "Last Dance," whose flesh continues to twitch after the 
hunters have hacked it to pieces, provides the key metaphor for these stories: 
Dubus' characters fight to keep functioning, even after their lives have ended, 
as far as society is concerned.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X AS TOLD TO ALEX HALEY 
(BALLANTINE: $5.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-five years after his assassination, Malcolm X remains a compelling, 
charismatic figure whose life has become the subject of renewed interest. Works 
by many young black artists feature references to him, including Spike Lee's 
hit film, "Do The Right Thing," and "Self-Destruction," a rap song by the group 
Stop the Violence; while the wire-framed glasses like the pair he wore are 
often referred to as "Malcolms." 
</P>
<P>
His searing autobiography forms a journey that unconsciously mirrors "Pilgrim's 
Progress": from his childhood in the rural South, through his life as a 
drug-pushing hustler in Harlem, his term in prison and his role as spokesman 
for Elijah Muhammad's racist doctrines, to his spiritual growth through Islam 
that broadened his vision and enabled him to embrace all of humanity. Had 
Malcolm X lived longer, he undoubtedly would have helped to lead America toward 
genuine racial equality during the last quarter-century. Unlike many '60s 
icons, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X," with its double message of anger and 
love, remains an inspiring document.

"Roger &amp; Me" gets a special release later this month -- at an "orientation 
session" for Miss USA Pageant contestants. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not the entire documentary, which examines the impact of General Motors' 
plant closing in Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Just the section in which film maker Michael Moore catches then-Miss 
Michigan/Miss America, Kay Lani Raye Rafko, off guard during a Flint parade. In 
the segment, she gives memorably vacuous responses. (When asked how she feels 
about Flint's severe unemployment situation, Rafko declares, "I'm all for 
employment.") 
</P>
<P>
Sara Meza, p.r. director for Madison Square Garden Television Productions, 
which produces the Miss USA Pageant (it airs live from Wichita March 2 on CBS), 
included the Rafko segment in a training reel for this year's 51 competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I like them to be prepared, to know what to expect (from interviewers)," Meza 
tells us. "The best way is to show them examples." 
</P>
<P>
The reel will also include clips from "A Current Affair" and "48 Hours," in 
which beauty queens from other pageants come off better than Rafko. 
</P>
<P>
"It really hits the nail on the head," Meza says of the "Roger &amp; Me" 
footage. "People expect those (lightweight) responses from a beauty queen." 
</P>
<P>
She's grooming this year's Miss USA hopefuls for press questions "that might 
require a little more thought." 
</P>
<P>
Will Moore be invited? 
</P>
<P>
"If he's on our mailing list of 1,800 (credentialled) press people and he'd 
like to attend, we'd be more than happy to have him." John M. Wilson

OUTTAKES: CALMER SEAS AHEAD?

<TEXT>
<P>
When "The Love Boat: A Valentine Voyage" sets sail on CBS Monday night at 9, 
Lauren Tewes won't be aboard with her many former co-stars. Tewes, who played 
cruise director Julie McCoy on the hit series -- a lucrative role derailed, in 
part, by her admitted cocaine addiction -- says she was offered only a small 
cameo on the reunion show. 
</P>
<P>
She turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done that," says Tewes, who says she's now drug free. "I didn't want to 
go back to such a small part. It really didn't interest me." 
</P>
<P>
(Fred Grandy, now a Republican congressman from Iowa, is the only other 
original cast member missing from "A Valentine Voyage.") 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Tewes confessed her drug problem to TV Guide. There were also reports 
of a salary dispute. "Love Boat" co-exec producers Aaron Spelling and Douglas 
Cramer let her contract run out. Neither producer wished to comment on Tewes' 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Although her acting career never fully recovered, she's been getting work, 
including a small role in the recent USA Network suspense-drama "The China Lake 
Murders." Married to musician Paolo Nonnis, Tewes has also been active in local 
theater -- currently directing "The Head" at the Matrix Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope and pray that that's all past now," Tewes says of her troubles. "I 
think I made the right choices by trying to stay in the business while it was 
trying to keep me out, by following my own heart and my own drive, and by 
making the choice to stick it through." Mary Helen Berg

Robin Williams and director Terry Gilliam are reteaming -- this time, for a 
drama. 
</P>
<P>
Williams -- who went uncredited for his depiction of the Moon King in Gilliam's 
fantasy, "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" -- will star in "The Fisher 
King." 
</P>
<P>
He'll play a radio-show personality whose career and life take nose-dives. Down 
and out on the streets of New York, he encounters some street people who lead 
him on a personal quest. The title refers to a character who figures in the 
legend of the Holy Grail. 
</P>
<P>
Scripted by Richard Lagravanese, "The Fisher King" will be produced by Debra 
Hill and Lynda Obst for Tri-Star. 
</P>
<P>
Filming's set to begin in May on a $20-25 million budget, according to a 
project insider -- relatively modest, compared to Gilliam's notable 
budget-buster, "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen." Pat H. Broeske

STAGE WEEK: 'ON THE TOWN' REVIVED IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty-six years ago, pals Leonard Bernstein, Jerome Robbins, Betty Comden and 
Adolph Green got together and decided to put on a show. Bernstein, of course, 
would do the music, Robbins the choreography, Comden and Green the book and 
lyrics. The result of that youthful collaboration was "On the Town," a 
high-spirited World War II-set romp about three sailors' New York adventures 
during a 24-hour leave. 
</P>
<P>
Unproduced locally for the past 31 years, the California Music Theatre revives 
the musical -- and its most famous song, "New York, New York (It's a Hell of a 
Town)" -- at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, beginning Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We wrote it in four or five months, which is very fast," recalled Green from 
his New York home. "It just all fell into place," added Comden. "It was 
everyone's first show, and I guess we didn't know any better." The husband and 
wife also wrote parts for themselves in the show -- as Claire de Loon and Ozzie 
-- which they played for over a year on Broadway. "We auditioned for (director) 
George Abbott just like any other actor," Comden noted. "Well, maybe not like 
any other actor . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Although the musical's setting stays rooted in the '40s, Green believes it has 
aged well. "There's been no show quite like it since," he said. "It's madcap, 
energy-packed, a young people's show, a Leonard Bernstein score, comedy with 
tragedy. There's that whole undercurrent of the wartime thing, the poignancy of 
that, of people parting." They feel the subsequent Gene Kelly movie (which they 
wrote) missed that youthful vigor. "It could never take the place of the play," 
Green remarked. 
</P>
<P>
Though the show hasn't been visible locally (CMT star Lorna Patterson cites the 
demanding dance numbers as the reason), Comden and Green have noticed a recent 
increase of interest in the musical. In addition to reports of overseas 
stagings and a "lovely" production they saw last year at Washington's Arena 
Stage, a big chunk of "On the Town" is featured in the Tony Award-winning 
"Jerome Robbins' Broadway." Said Green proudly, "It's keeping the show alive." 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: When Bruce Adler (of the Yiddish-English revue "Those Were The 
Days" at the Westwood Playhouse) was a baby, his parents, Henrietta Jacobson 
and Julius Adler, were stars of the Yiddish-American theater. One of their 
co-stars was a handsome young actor named Bernie Schwartz, who would often 
babysit the infant Bruce on his nights off. Then one day, Bernie was gone. 
"Enough of this Yiddish stuff," said his farewell note, "I'm going to 
Hollywood." And so he did . . . and became Tony Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Howard Korder's contemporary spiritual odyssey, "Search 
&amp; Destroy," is playing at South Coast Repertory. David Chambers directs. 
</P>
<P>
Said The Times' Sylvie Drake: "It's impossible not to compare Korder's language 
to David Mamet's, but only in an effort to impart a sense of flavor. The words 
are Korder's alone, as is the play . . . Rarely has a production come together 
as seamlessly as this one." 
</P>
<P>
In the Daily News, Daryl H. Miller felt the play "leaves the viewer intrigued 
but vaguely unsatisfied. Korder needs to do some more searching if this play is 
to become the jolting examination of American life that it is capable of 
becoming . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Daily Variety's Kathleen O'Steen wrote: "This new work from the author of 
'Boys' Life' should more likely be considered a work in progress. As it now 
stands, Korder fails to brings any enlightenment to a rather one-dimensional 
story . . . " 
</P>
<P>
From Tom Titus in the Daily Pilot: "The American dream assumes nightmarish 
proportions in (this) darkly hilarious study in avarice that reaches out for 
the throats of its audience . . . At the heart of this gripping cynical 
exercise is Mark Harelik's stunning interpretation of Mirkheim."

ON THE RECORD: FROM THE U.S.S.R. -- A VERITABLE SOVIET BONANZA, OF SORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past few months a steady stream of Soviet recordings has been issuing 
forth from Universal City via MCA's classical division, among the more quixotic 
unions of high art and mass entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
MCA Classics has entered into an agreement with the Soviets to re-release 
nominally worthy material from the vaults of the state-run Melodiya label (MLD, 
for present CD-identifying purposes) as well as to make new recordings using 
American technology and even facilities to be built in the Soviet Union by 
MCA's Art &amp; Electronics affiliate (AED). 
</P>
<P>
MCA would, however, seem to be jumping the gun, using the Arts &amp; 
Electronics rubric to identify material recorded several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Note too that other firms, including Germany's BMG Classics, which owns the RCA 
label, have announced similar aims. Who ultimately will be doing what to and 
with whom, and when, is not readily discernible in these times of rapidly 
changing allegiances and agreements. 
</P>
<P>
For the present, MCA's initial Russian release -- there are 17 titles at this 
writing -- offers a heady mix of pleasures and frustrations, of gems and dross, 
of novelties, and of old friends in new guises. 
</P>
<P>
Musical values tend to be high, while sonically things are as variable as the 
current state of Soviet technology and the skills of Soviet technicians. The 
documentary production is, however, wretched. Annotations and cover material 
tend to be ineptly written and/or translated. In several instances 
identification of soloists and works, and who performs what, is mishandled or 
not handled at all. 
</P>
<P>
Still, MCA can be forgiven some of its transgressions for the boon of some of 
the most exciting stuff yet from the West's new darling among progressive 
Soviet composers, 60-year-old Sofia Gubaidulina. It's on a splendid-sounding CD 
(AED-68005) that is competently annotated as well. 
</P>
<P>
Gubaidulina's 1979 duo, "In croce," is, for the most part, quietly shattering, 
alternately contemplative and ecstatic. The cello groans, croons, slithers and 
sometimes explodes in flurries of arhythmic harmonics, against hypnotically 
purling, scale-like passages on the organ. 
</P>
<P>
"The Seven Last Words" (1982) and "Ex expecto" (1986) are, like "In croce," of 
mystical Christian inspiration, and both feature one of the composer's favorite 
instruments: the bayan (accordion). But cast out thoughts of "Lady of Spain" or 
a Neapolitan wedding. In the hands of Gubaidulina and her soloist, Friedrich 
Lips, the accordion is a sophisticated, profoundly expressive instrument. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy "Seven Last Words" is scored for bayan, cello and small string 
orchestra, "Ex expecto" for bayan alone. The latter piece is rich with tone 
clusters, tense silences and oddly compelling sounds created by "using the 
noise of the accordion's air button," according to the booklet notes. 
</P>
<P>
The masterful executants are Lips and cellist Vladimir Tonkha, whose 
biographies are included, and organist "T. Sergeeva," about whom nary a 
syllable is offered. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, there is a dashing reading by Moscow's Shostakovich Quartet of 
namesake composer's Quartet No. 7 and, with the brilliantly high-strung 
collaboration of Alexei Nasedkin, a fierily propulsive Piano Quintet 
(MLD-32106). 
</P>
<P>
This handsome sounding, 75-minute long CD, derived from material recorded in 
the early-'80s, further includes a performance by the Borodin Quartet (are you 
following?) of Shostakovich's sombre, gripping Quartet No. 14, similar to the 
one in the Borodin's glorious EMI/Angel traversal of the entire quartet canon. 
</P>
<P>
In a totally different vein, MCA offers Barry Douglas' live Moscow performance 
of the Brahms D-minor Concerto (MLD-32102), the one that occasioned all the 
shouting at the 1986 Tchaikovsky Competition. 
</P>
<P>
If you've wondered from subsequent exposure to the young Irish pianist 
(including RCA's later, studio-made version of the Brahms) what the fuss is 
about, this recording tells all. It's rabble-rousing, gut-thumping and brainy 
pianism accompanied, after a fashion, by a seemingly semi-pro orchestra whose 
conductor may have neglected to show up -- or if he did, shouldn't have. 
</P>
<P>
In the old friends from the old country department, there are flavorful 
versions of Tchaikovsky's First (MLD-32112) and Third symphonies (MLD-32100), 
the latter with a hair-raising "Francesca da Rimimi." In each instance the 
U.S.S.R. State Symphony under Yevgeny Svetlanov projects a vibrant native 
richness of timbre that has become all but extinct in this age of sound-alike 
orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a worthwhile Prokofiev "Classical" Symphony (Svetlanov again) that 
is fast, fierce and Slavically heavyweight, rather than in the crisply Gallic 
style to which we are accustomed. Its discmate (on MLD 32108) is Prokofiev's 
undervalued Seventh Symphony, with its original downbeat ending. The conductor 
here is the admirable Gennady Rozhdestvensky, who wisely emphasizes the 
simple-sounding score's usually overlooked ominousness. 
</P>
<P>
From the curiouser and curiouser file: MCA and its annotator seem unaware that 
their deeply committed performance of Bruckner's Fourth Symphony by the 
U.S.S.R. Ministry of Culture Orchestra under Rozhdestvensky (MLD-32115) is of 
the rare first version, which lacks, among other familiar pages, the composer's 
best known creation, the rousing "hunting" scherzo. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a CD (MLD-32105) devoted to the hootchy-kitsch orientalia of one 
Sergei Lyapunov (1859-1924), zestfully done by Svetlanov &amp; Company, on 
whose front and back covers one finds listed an "Eastern Symphonic Poem." It 
turns out to be a quaint "Scheherazade" ripoff whose real title is "Hashish" 
and is so-called on the identical performance issued in England. 
</P>
<P>
MCA's Department of Listener Morality evidently feels that Americans aren't 
ready for such potentially mind-altering titles -- at least on those parts of 
the packaging that can be read in the store. "Hashish" -- the word is there. 
But only in the notes, which you can't see until after purchasing the CD, 
removing its outer wrapping and opening the box.

Passports and cigarettes (invaluable for barter) aren't the only things that 
pop stars apparently feel are essential when heading to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
There are also video crews and recording equipment. Elton John, Billy Joel, Bon 
Jovi and the Scorpions have either recorded live albums or made documentaries 
during their Soviet excursions. For this concert documentary, the footage isn't 
much more involving than something you'd expect if one of the members of this 
gently soulful English reggae-pop group took along his own video camera. But 
UB40 isn't a particularly dynamic act live, so the non-concert scenes (mostly 
elementary sightseeing) add a welcome, if still limited visual diversion.

"BLINDS &amp; SHUTTERS" PHOTOGRAPHS BY MICHAEL COOPER PUBLISHED BY 
GENESIS/HEDLEY ($595) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Cooper is not a name that most rock fans will recognize, although he 
earned a small place in pop history by taking the cover photographs for both 
the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and the Rolling Stones' 
"Their Satanic Majesties Request" albums. 
</P>
<P>
However, this extraordinary, limited-edition book -- whose photos are 
reproduced in fine-screen lithography and bound in Moroccan leather paper and 
buckram -- links the late London photographer's name with the swinging London 
scene of the '60s and early '70s in a way that may prove indelible. 
</P>
<P>
It's a fascinating look at the innocence and decadence of what many still feel 
was rock's golden era; a time when a generation of artists felt society was 
being forever changed -- and, to some degree, they may have been right. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper took more than 70,000 photos, concentrating not only on the rock stars 
who defined the era, but also a wider circle of creative artists who 
intersected with the musicians. Those other figures from literature and art 
ranged from novelist Terry Southern and gallery owner Robert Fraser to artists 
Andy Warhol and David Hockney. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than the highly composed and sometimes sterile images in much of Rolling 
Stone magazine's recent "The Photographs," Cooper's works lean more toward the 
warm accessibility of candid snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael had that perfect ability to take all those pictures without annoying 
anybody," Keith Richards says in a remembrance that appears beneath a picture 
of the Rolling Stones guitarist holding a coke spoon to his nose. "It would be 
accepted by whoever was around -- people wouldn't know they were having their 
picture taken." 
</P>
<P>
This personal quality is what makes looking through the more than 600 photos in 
"Blinds &amp; Shutters" -- for anyone who lived through the early 
Beatles/Stones era -- a bit like rediscovering a school yearbook or a family 
scrapbook that had been in the garage for 20 years. Indeed, Cooper's photos 
were stored away until 1985 after his suicide in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's son Adam and his former assistant Perry Richardson began work in 1985 
on reviving Cooper's dream of a book of photos. Their efforts led to Brian 
Roylance, owner and editor of Genesis Press, which had published 
limited-edition books by George Harrison and Beatles publicist Derek Taylor. He 
served as editor of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told Michael had wanted to do a book that would be a collaboration of 
all his friends and that's what intrigued me," Roylance said in an interview. 
"There was such a tremendous range of people in his photos, a mix of musicians, 
artists and writers that mirrored the cultural (exchange) of the period -- an 
interaction that doesn't exist anymore. The book seemed to be a way to 
underscore that cultural richness." 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 of Cooper's subjects -- from the Beatles and Stones to Eric 
Clapton and Terry Southern -- joined in the project, writing remembrances of 
varying lengths. The energy involved in assembling this ambitious book and the 
gentleness of the recollections stand as an act of love to a lost friend and a 
lost age. Each copy is autographed by at least 10 of the book's subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Roylance said there are no plans at present to publish a more conventional 
version of the book. "Blinds &amp; Shutters" can be ordered from Christopher, 
Cabot &amp; Fuller Ltd. in Atlanta, (800) 828-5861. ROBERT HILBURN

POP EYE: WILL WARNING-STICKER SHOCK LEAD TO RATINGS SYSTEM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're under 18, you better stock up on all your favorite Guns N' Roses and 
LL Cool J. albums. Fast. 
</P>
<P>
Record industry lobbyists have been hastily mounting a counterattack against a 
flood of legislative proposals that would put warning stickers on albums or 
preventing sales of "offensive" albums to under-18 rock fans. (See censorship 
story, page 69) 
</P>
<P>
But while record companies are trying to kill these legislative offensives, 
some of the music industry's other key players -- retailers and record store 
owners -- are coming out in favor of an age-bracket rating system similar to 
the X-R-PG categories used in the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see the record labels or some third-party organization get 
together and form a Motion Picture Assn. of America-type organization which 
could design a uniform sticker, labeling certain product as being X or R or 
PG," said Mark Siegel, executive vice president of Shamrock Holdings Inc., 
which owns the California-based Music Plus chain and Sound Warehouse, which 
operates 134 stores in mid-America and the South. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the record companies are in the ideal situation to set up a ratings 
bureau which could give us a self-regulated system, like the film industry, 
instead of having so much confusion and debate over the standards that exist 
today." 
</P>
<P>
This kind of proposal drives industry moguls crazy, especially since they have 
fought an MPAA-type rating system for years, deeming it unworkable. As National 
Assn. of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences chief Mike Greene puts it: "I think it's 
ludicrous to compare motion pictures to albums -- you just can't apply 
MPAA-style criteria to music. It's a completely different art form. These 
retail guys are just protecting their (butts)." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's no wonder why even a progressive chain like Music Plus wants a 
coherent rating system. If any of the legislative bills pass, it's the record 
store managers and clerks -- not the record execs or recording artists -- 
who'll take the heat (and either go to jail for 90 days or be fined up to 
$300). 
</P>
<P>
"These bills have scared the (expletive) out of us," said one top chain-store 
exec who asked to remain anonymous. "They are an absolute nightmare for a 
retailer. You can't listen to 700 new albums every month and make an 
intelligent decision about what a concerned parent -- or some right-wing kook 
-- might find offensive. To play it safe, you'd have to sticker every album. 
Most big chains are going to be very slow in ordering new albums because 
they're going to want to wait and see if a problem develops or not." 
</P>
<P>
Record labels currently place small "parental advisory" stickers on potentially 
objectionable albums, but policies and stickers vary with each label, who have 
so far only stickered the most blatantly offensive releases. None of the 
stickers remotely resemble the warning sticker described in Pennsylvania's 
proposed bill, which would require record companies to warn consumers about 
lyrics advocating "bestiality," "incest" and "morbid violence," even if the 
song merely discussed drug or alcohol use. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the record companies have been ducking the problem and putting the 
burden on us," said Siegel. "I would agree that the (proposed Pennsylvania) 
sticker goes too far. But it would be appropriate to have a sticker that could 
be more easily noticed by clerks in the store." 
</P>
<P>
Many retailers have already instituted measures aimed at calming community 
fears. Siegel said his Sound Warehouse chain -- which has stores in 30 cities, 
including Detroit, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta and Miami -- doesn't sell records 
with warning stickers to under-17 pop fans. Plans to adopt a similar policy at 
Music Plus stores is currently under discussion. Siegel said that his stores 
continue to carry a wide variety of rap and metal records, but some potentially 
objectionable records are kept behind the counter, available only upon request. 
</P>
<P>
Will stickers -- or 18-and-under purchase laws -- have a chilling effect on 
artistic expression? Will record companies, as film companies regularly do now, 
start editing lyrics to get a prized PG-rating? 
</P>
<P>
"Our social climate has always swung back and forth between free expression to 
more restrictive views of art and in some ways we may be moving from the 
freedom of the '70s and '80s back to the '50s," said Siegel. "But I don't think 
this will hinder the flow of creativity -- or sales. If anything, this 
controversy may inspire more artists to deal with issues that push the edge of 
the social fabric."

Our Jose Canseco 900 Rip-Off Award goes to David Bowie, who recently announced 
a 1990 "Retrospective" World Tour, which kicks off March 3 in Quebec and 
(surely by coincidence) coincides with the release of his digitally remastered 
catalogue of albums. The gimmick: Each concert will be an all-request affair, 
with Bowie performing songs chosen by his fans. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, to vote your favorites, you have to dial a 900 number (that's $2 for 
the first minute, kids, $1.50 for each additional minute), which leisurely 
touts various contests and prizes aimed at keeping fans on the line for as long 
as possible. . . . Rap hotshot M.C. Hammer's new album, "Please Hammer Don't 
Hurt 'Em," is due later this month from Capitol Records. It features rap-style 
covers of the Jacksons' "Dancing Machine" and the Chi-Lites' "Have You Seen 
Her," plus a song called "U Can't Touch This" that borrows heavily from the 
main riff of Rick James' "Super Freak." Hammer's new single, "Help the 
Children," also incorporates parts of Marvin Gaye's "Mercy Mercy Me."

POP EYE: ASYLUM UPDATE:

<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the year's worst-kept industry secret is that Geffen Records is 
launching a second label, using the reactivated moniker of Asylum Records. 
(Founded in the mid-'70s by David Geffen, Asylum was affiliated with Elektra 
Records but has been dormant in recent years.) 
</P>
<P>
Several key Geffen execs, including promotion wiz Marko Babineau and A&amp;R 
heavyweights Tom Zutaut and Gary Gersh, are expected to play major roles in the 
label's development. Industry insiders say the Asylum start-up is a shrewd 
marketing strategy aimed at giving Geffen's promotion staff a better shot at 
getting more radio airplay for its artists. The big question: If Geffen has 
already hired a number of new promotion staffers, why hasn't it officially 
announced the label? The answer: Geffen's distribution deal with Warner Bros. 
Records is up at the end of the year. If Geffen's top brass end up signing a 
deal with a different label or selling the company outright (recent suitors 
have reportedly included Paramount and EMI), it would no longer have the rights 
to the Asylum name, which is owned by Warner Inc. So expect Geffen's 
distribution deal to be cleared up before any Asylum announcement hits the 
papers.

Our Sassiest Ad of the Week Award goes to Elektra Records. The label's new 
full-page trade ads tout a host of current albums, accompanied by a photo of 
Washington mayor Marion Barry. 
</P>
<P>
The ad's headline reads: "Record Bust. Busted Records." (The label's credit, at 
the bottom of the page, goes: "Just another stupid crack . . . from Elektra.") 
. . . Warner Bros. Records has signed Squeeze, who left A&amp;M after more than 
a decade there. But before the band moves to Burbank, they've made a one-album 
deal with I.R.S., who'll be releasing a Squeeze live album, "A Round and A 
Bout," in May on I.R.S.' Deptford Fun City label. . . . The Cowboy Junkies are 
back with a new album, "The Caution Horses," which features a remake of Neil 
Young's "Powderfinger." . . . And starting next Sunday, L.A.'s leading local 
rock haven, the Coconut Teaszer, will celebrate its third anniversary of live 
music. The festivities kick off with the Dickies and conclude Feb. 28 with the 
Rock City Angels and the Nymphs, who both performed at the club's opening 
night. Other bands on display (most of whom have signed deals with big-time 
labels) will include Burning Tree, Rhino Bucket, E.G. Daley &amp; Slave, the 
Fuzztones and Flies on Fire.

MESSAGES AND SIGNALS FROM THE WORLD OF RAP

<P>
Regarding the Feb. 4 rap articles and interviews: 
</P>
<P>
I must say I was surprised to see real interviews done with members of the rap 
group Public Enemy. 
</P>
<P>
The media has never handled rap music the way it should have. The only time rap 
was talked about was when violence broke out at concerts or when lyrics caused 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody had done a special on the positive qualities that rap has to offer -- 
such as the stop-the-violence movement. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy has given young blacks the pride that we have been denied through 
the years.

I'm sure the cause to "tell it like it is" is a prevalent and urgent theme to 
many rappers. But which rappers are in it to enlighten black society, as 
opposed to those who seek rags-to-riches fame? 
</P>
<P>
King, Malcolm X and Evers put their lives on the line to establish the 
groundwork for black self-esteem; it's a huge responsibility to use their names 
in any rap song. 
</P>
<P>
Sincerity will come if rappers put back some of their rewards into their 
culture. Rappers who wind up in America's Betty Ford rehab centers or who sow 
seeds of destruction will only fuel the fire for separatism for years to come. 
The next generation will live with the words they speak.

Re the Visa credit card TV ad featuring Paul McCartney: 
</P>
<P>
Big corporations pay big dollars to artists such as McCartney to attach a brand 
name to their art through a slick commercial. Each time a viewer sees the ad, 
that attachment is made stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, every time the viewer hears the song involved, the TV commercial 
gets a free run in his or her mind. It's free subliminal advertising time every 
time he or she hears the song anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
I consider this a rape of my loyalty to a musician's work. 
</P>
<P>
Every time I hear "Tonight Tonight" by Genesis, all I see in my head is a bimbo 
at a bar about to have sex with some guy cause he's drinking Michelob beer. 
Same with "Don't You Know What the Night Can Do" by Steve Winwood and "After 
Midnight" by Clapton. Three or four Stones' songs mean "Drink Budweiser!" now. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp, REM and Neil Young seem to do just fine 
without the extra cash this racket generates. Maybe McCartney could ask them 
for some pointers on making ends meet.

A FANCY FOR NANCY; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' PERFORMER AGAIN DONS A LACQUERED WIG AND A COPY OF 
AN ADOLFO SUIT TO SAVAGE THE EX-FIRST LADY IN HIS ONE-MAN SHOW

<P>
Why is Terry Sweeney dressing up as Nancy Reagan -- again? 
</P>
<P>
"When she wrote her book -- well, that was the last straw," said the ponytailed 
performance artist who opens today at Santa Monica's Highways in "It's Still My 
Turn," a one-man, one-two punch aimed squarely at America's former First Lady. 
"It was very false, very 'Feel sorry for me,' still trying to manipulate public 
sympathy. I thought, 'I've had it with her.' It just crossed the limit of what 
I could take." 
</P>
<P>
The association is neither accidental nor recent. It's been more than three 
years since Sweeney first donned a lacquered wig and Adolfo suit (OK, a copy of 
an Adolfo) as a cast member on NBC-TV's "Saturday Night Live." In fact, he won 
the role when "SNL" producer Lorne Michaels caught his multiple 
characterizations -- including his drag rendition of a low-rent gossip 
columnist named Connie Chutzpah -- at New York's 78th St. Theatre Lab. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked me if I could do Nancy Reagan, because they wanted to do political 
material," said the Long Island native. "The first sketch we did was a takeoff 
on 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'; Charles and Diana were over and the 
evening just got worse and worse. I found that once I got into that Adolfo 
suit, I could say anything. And Nancy gave us plenty of material. Everything 
she was doing or not doing became fodder for us." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney's Highways program is a continuation of that relationship. He subtitles 
the show (excerpted from his upcoming book of the same name), "An Unauthorized 
Collection of Nancy Reagan's Private Poetry." In one poem, titled "Oh, I Had 
the Scariest Dream Last Night," Sweeney's First Lady intones, "I gave my old 
clothes to a mission, a shelter for women in need, and I even threw in my good 
china as my second noble deed." 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old performer said, "I think people are reacting to her fakeness, 
her insensitivity, her hypocrisy. See, I'm a lover of truth; I like people to 
be truthful. But this is not a vendetta, and there are other things I like to 
lampoon. Sure, part of it's about what happens when you take public office, 
part of being out there. Look, I wasn't the one who went out and bought new 
china. She did. 
</P>
<P>
"Parody is one way of processing that behavior," he continued. "And that's what 
the artist does in our society. The artist doesn't have any rules. He says, 
'This is what I see. I'm going to hold up a mirror; you may not like the 
reflection, but I'm still going to hold it up.' I think we can't help but be 
political people. And we have a responsibility to respond in the way we know 
best. I'm a performance artist, I do political satire." 
</P>
<P>
Highways co-founder Tim Miller said he believes that Sweeney "fits in really 
well in both the sex and politics part" of the theater's current "Sex, God and 
Politics" performance festival. "It isn't stand-up," he explained, "more of a 
strange character performance." 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite Highways' non-traditionalist profile, Sweeney doesn't think he'll 
be playing solely for the already converted -- or causing more polarization in 
a society already so divided. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all Republicans are archconservatives," said Sweeney, adding that some 
audience members come up after a show and say, " 'I'm a Republican, and I still 
think it's hilarious.' 
</P>
<P>
"You know, there are a lot of Republicans who don't like the Reagans, don't 
like what they stood for or how they behaved," Sweeney said. "Already we're 
seeing the damage: to black people, gays. And Nancy and Ron are like, 
'La-la-la, $2 million to speak in Japan. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
Since people in glass houses ought not to throw stones, Sweeney keeps a tight 
leash on his own words ("I have to catch myself sometimes, when I'm being 
hypocritical") and life style. For that reason -- and because, as he says, he 
loves truth -- -- Sweeney publicly admitted he was gay in 1986. "I guess it was 
a brave thing to do," he said. "You're challenging people's value systems, and 
they're going to react. A lot of them will say, 'OK, be gay -- but don't flaunt 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney (whose biography describes him as "openly gay") is fully aware that his 
frankness may affect his career. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's what I am," he said simply. "I'm also an animal rights activist. If 
someone wants to make fun of that, satirize me or my values . . . well, that's 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney hopes that societal tolerance for gays isn't too far in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in a relationship with a man -- Bill Lovejoy, my writing partner -- 
for nine years," he said. "We're like a married couple." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Still My Turn" plays today, Feb. 18 and 25 at 3 p.m., and 10:30 p.m. 
every Saturday beginning March 10 at Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica. 
(213) 453-1755. Admission is $8.

FROM ROXY TO RAJI'S, BANDS PICK THE BEST SITES FOR SOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHMALTZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bass guitarist Mike Watt of Firehose has seen clubs, halls and theaters come 
and go during his 10 years on Los Angeles stages, but losing the John Anson 
Ford Theater was especially painful. 
</P>
<P>
"That place was happening," Watt said mournfully of the Cahuenga Boulevard 
amphitheater just east of the Hollywood Bowl -- which discontinued its summer 
rock concert schedule last June because of complaints by neighbors of traffic 
and noise and charges by the Hollywood Bowl that the concerts interfered with 
their programs. 
</P>
<P>
A fixture of the local music scene since he helped form the Minutemen in 1978, 
Watt is one of more than a dozen Los Angeles-based musicians asked to name 
their favorite live music venue on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Watt insists that the John Anson Ford Theater, if still open, would be his 
first choice, though he says he experienced firsthand the conflicts the outdoor 
rock 'n' roll stage had with its larger, more famous competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was outdoors and it had great sound," Watt recalled. "But we had problems 
with the Hollywood Bowl. They made us stop playing. Mel Torme was getting 
upset. We were bogarting his gig." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles area may be minus one musician's paradise, but as active local 
artists will testify, there are still some gems out there. 
</P>
<P>
One place Watt enthusiastically endorses is tiny BeBop Records on Sherman Way 
in Reseda, because it's small and accessible to anyone who wants to play. But 
with all things considered, the bassist favors the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"For most gigs, I think the Roxy is probably the best place still going," Watt 
decided. "Everybody gets to see you, and you ain't too far away from the crowd. 
That's really rock 'n' roll -- with the dude right in your face." 
</P>
<P>
The Untouchables, Los Angeles mainstays for the last eight years, also value 
the Hollywood club. "The Roxy is definitely our favorite," said the group's 
lead guitarist, Clyde Grimes Jr. "There's something intimate about it. It's 
really hot and sweaty. It has just enough people to make it exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Since opening in 1973, the Roxy's location, size (a capacity of just over 500) 
and tradition have made it perhaps Los Angeles' most popular stage. Firehose 
and the Untouchables began their careers in the more punk rock-oriented era of 
the late 1970s and early 1980s, but during the last couple of years, the Roxy 
has proved its broad appeal by becoming a club desired by not only seasoned 
veterans of the Strip, but also by a new crop of hard rock/heavy-metal bands. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I think fans like the show more just because it's at the Roxy," said 
Tony Palacios, lead guitarist of Guardian, a heavy metal group. 
</P>
<P>
Hard rockers Juliett have been playing together for less than two years but 
already think they've found Los Angeles' hottest spot in the Roxy. "We play the 
Roxy once a month," said Juliett's Greg Pecka. "The other clubs are nowhere 
near as nice." 
</P>
<P>
Singer Danny Simon fronts Jailhouse, a band that's an all-star collection of 
local hard-rock musicians. "The Roxy is good because it's bigger than the other 
Sunset Strip clubs like Gazzari's and the Whiskey," he said. "There's a cool 
atmosphere from the audience to the band that creates a lot of energy. The 
audience is right in your face." 
</P>
<P>
Though intimacy is important, Simon said Jailhouse also likes Reseda's Country 
Club, a larger venue with a capacity of 910. "The Country Club is not as warm 
as the Roxy, but it's great, especially the size of the stage and the 
lighting." 
</P>
<P>
"The Roxy's like a condensed version of the Country Club," said Lizzy Borden, 
leader of the heavy-metal group of the same name. "The Roxy's a nice place to 
play, but the Country Club is No. 1. It has probably the biggest stage of all 
the L.A. clubs. It's the best of both worlds -- except for alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
Borden's reference is to the Country Club's loss of its permit for on-site 
consumption of alcoholic beverages, a problem that puts the popularity of the 
nightspot in jeopardy. The County Club's operations manager, Scott Hurowitz, 
said that while they attempt to re-obtain the permit, the club is determined to 
prevent the no-liquor rule from damaging its status with local musicians. (The 
permit was not renewed by the L.A. City Council in November because of 
complaints of noise and vandalism at the club.) 
</P>
<P>
"Bands are finding that they don't need alcohol to draw fans," said Hurowitz, 
39. "They like to know that people are coming to see them, not just to party." 
</P>
<P>
Bad Religion's Brett Gurewitz said his group favors the Country Club partly 
because the audience includes many underage fans who can easily frequent the 
dry environs of the Reseda establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a punk band," said Gurewitz, 27, "and we need to play all-ages shows, 
and the all-ages scene in Hollywood is virtually non-existent." He added that 
the Country Club also draws a crossover audience of speed-metal bands, creating 
a sea of mohawks and long tresses that comprise the largest crowds in the 
history of the band's nine-year existence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our hottest venue," Gurewitz said. "We get paid well, we get treated well 
and they have a decent sound system." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their ongoing popularity as favorite all-around clubs, the Country Club 
and the Roxy almost exclusively operate as pay-to-play venues, a process where 
the promoters rent the venue out, then have bands purchase and sell tickets to 
ensure enough paying customers will show up for the club to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
The Country Club's Hurowitz strongly defended pay-to-play, insisting that 
without it, many places would close. "This whole thing revolves around ticket 
sales. If people don't show up, we close. Then the bands have no place to play. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't a nightclub," continued Hurowitz, "and neither is the Roxy and other 
Sunset Strip clubs. We're concert facilities, but too small to purchase 
national acts. It leaves us in the position where we have to use pre-sales to 
fill the place up to pay the rent." 
</P>
<P>
Gurewitz of Bad Religion says his band's built-in following has prevented them 
from performing at the Country Club on a pay-to-play basis. "I don't think we 
would ever do it, but we've been around a long time. Our fans will always show 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Hurowitz agrees, adding that though there have been punk pre-sale shows, the 
fierce loyalty of punk, thrash and speed-metal fans usually guarantees a full 
house. But they're the exception. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish all bands meant so much to their fans that people would come and pay 
$10 just because there's so much excitement over them, but that's not the 
case," Hurowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger is not always better to some. Ex-Plimsouls leader Peter Case has been 
strumming and humming on the local circuit since 1977, but he didn't hesitate 
to voice his preference for McCabe's, a small but well-equipped Santa Monica 
guitar shop that opens its back room for concerts, with an audience capacity of 
150. 
</P>
<P>
"I love McCabe's," said Case, who has performed under his own name since 1984. 
"It's been a home club for me." 
</P>
<P>
Citing the sound quality and the enthusiastic audiences, Case has appeared at 
McCabe's about 20 times. "And people you never see anywhere else play 
McCabe's." 
</P>
<P>
After kicking around the local scene for about a dozen years, colorful folk 
singer Phranc also said McCabe's is No. 1 with her. 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite places to play are places where I can see everybody's eyes, where 
it's intimate," said Phranc, who plays acoustic sets exclusively while decked 
out in her trademark brush cut and androgynous wardrobe. "McCabe's is cozy, 
comfortable; it's the best." 
</P>
<P>
Singer/guitarist Sylvia Juncosa, a one-time member of SWA and leader of the 
now-defunct To Damascus, has played acoustic and electric sets around Los 
Angeles since 1984 but hasn't yet found the place that puts it all together. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a weird contradiction. If there's a good sound system, they 
might have a restrictive booking policy, or there's a problem with the staff, 
or the people that go there think we're too weird or underground," Juncosa 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
All the venues Juncosa enjoys share one significant quality: None of them are 
booked on a pay-to-play basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's morally right," she said about pay-to-play. "I would never 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Juncosa acknowledged that some of the better clubs now operate this way, though 
she said it puts a stigma on the acts participating. "When I see the names on 
the marquee of the Whiskey and the Roxy, I think of those groups as being 
really commercial metal bands. 
</P>
<P>
"Pay-to-play just takes away from the music." 
</P>
<P>
If bands have to pay up front anyway, reasoned Juncosa, they might as well do 
everything themselves. "Sometimes it's better to just rent a warehouse, send 
out flyers and put on a show. More people are doing that now." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Juncosa prefers outdoor concerts to the indoor, nighttime variety. 
"I played the West Hollywood Street Festival two times, and those were my two 
favorite gigs." 
</P>
<P>
Like Mike Watt, Juncosa shares an affection for BeBop Records because of its 
raw, unpretentious sensibilities. "It's small," she acknowledged, "but it 
really has Bohemian qualities." 
</P>
<P>
Juncosa also has noticed the benefits of playing Hollywood's Coconut Teaszer. 
"Usually you can get on a good bill at the Teaszer and people will show up, but 
the sound is horrible," she said. But some perks can make up for disappointing 
audio. "They give you all this good food," Juncosa said. "They take care of 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Another Coconut Teaszer fan is bassist Bruce Duff of the Jeff Dahl Group. Duff 
has had about 10 years experience playing in Los Angeles, including stints with 
45 Grave, Jesters of Destiny and John Trubee. 
</P>
<P>
"The Teaszer always has great bills, especially during the week," Duff said. 
"It's easy to draw there." Duff added that the club's specials, which he said 
sometimes include free beer and hot dogs, don't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Falling James, 29, of the Leaving Trains named the gritty Hollywood Boulevard 
club Raji's as his band's venue of choice, but only because of an obvious 
process of elimination. "I guess Raji's is our favorite since it's the only 
place we haven't been kicked out of," James said. 
</P>
<P>
The future of Leaving Trains is in doubt. James recalled that some of the 
group's favorite shows were performed in the open spaces of Temesco Canyon when 
the group would plug its instruments into any available outlet and jam all 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"We could play as long and as loud as we wanted," he remembered. "We were only 
chased out a couple times." 
</P>
<P>
The Pandoras' Paula Pierce said the Palace in Hollywood gets her vote. "It's my 
favorite place because there's space to move around," said the leader of the 
all-female band known for its provocative shows. "There's this big echo sound 
there I really like." 
</P>
<P>
According to Pierce, the L.A.-based Pandoras are dissatisfied with the local 
music community and don't play the area as much as they used to, opting instead 
for out-of-town dates. Is pay for play an issue? 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. is dead," Pierce said. "There's no kind of scene for us here." 
</P>
<P>
But despite occasional lapses, such as the closing of the John Anson Ford, Mike 
Watt still considers L.A. the place to be for music. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been all over the country, and this is the best city for bands," he said. 
"It's more like vaudeville here; people with the spiel can just get up there 
and hoof it. 
</P>
<P>
"People who don't go to clubs are missing out. I think any band can get a gig 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Even one they like.

MESSAGES AND SIGNALS FROM THE WORLD OF RAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rapper Chuck D. asks the question: "Is white America ready to deal with the 
rise of black male intellectualism?" Like so many other rappers, he seems to be 
ignorant of the fact that there are millions of black female intellectuals in 
this country as well. 
</P>
<P>
Much of rap music's potential to educate is lost in the flood of near-rabid 
woman-hate indulged in by popular male rappers. 
</P>
<P>
You'd think anyone with class would get sick of hearing the word bitch a 
thousand times on one album, but judging from the current popularity of rappers 
such as Run D.M.C. and N.W.A, that is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
For the information of Chuck D. and the rest of his ilk: We black female 
intellectuals do exist. We are more than a little weary of hearing women run 
into the ground in rap lyrics. Before rappers can concern themselves with 
acceptance by white Americans, they ought to get it together on the home front.

MORE THAN MUSIC

I enjoyed John G. Zawadzinski's article of Jan. 28 on Mieczyslaw Horszowski 
(and attended his Jan. 31 recital at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion). However, 
Mr. Zawadzinski incorrectly identifies the Juilliard School as the Juilliard 
School of Music. 
</P>
<P>
The school dropped "of Music" from the name when drama and dance divisions were 
added and the school moved to Lincoln Center.

HIDEBOUND PERSONALITY TEST UPDATED FOR NORMALCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SPECTER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Would you consider a woman too masculine if she said she would like to be a 
soldier? What would you make of a guy who took care not to step on cracks in 
the sidewalk? 
</P>
<P>
Does the statement, "I was often sent to the principal's office for cutting 
up," suggest the speaker was a class clown or a knife-wielding gang leader? 
</P>
<P>
By turns sexist, confusing and completely out of date, versions of those 
questions all appeared for decades on the world's most widely used 
psychological test, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, or MMPI. 
Millions of people in dozens of countries, being evaluated for character, 
attitudes and personal behavior, have waded their way through 556 statements, 
which they must answer true or false. 
</P>
<P>
The test was designed to figure out who is normal and who is not. To do that, 
the researchers who created it relied on a group of 2,600 middle-class, mostly 
rural, married people from Minnesota. None of them was younger than 16 or older 
than 65. And they were all white. They were the standard of "normal" 
psychological fitness against which millions across the world came to be judged 
by businesses, industries and schools. Now, almost a half century after it was 
first used, the MMPI has undergone its first major overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
"Society changes, assumptions change and we realized the test needed to reflect 
a broader range of people," said W. Grant Dahlstrom, professor of psychology at 
the University of North Carolina and a member of a committee that recently 
introduced a new version of the personality test. "We took out the sexist 
references, the religious references and others that have become obscure." 
</P>
<P>
No more can the statement, "I like mechanics magazines," be used as a way to 
gauge a person's "appropriate" sexuality. Also, the blanket use of the word 
"he" has been supplanted with "person." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers won't reveal specific new questions because they say it might 
bias the test. But they will say they added questions and some new categories 
of personality type. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, for example, when the test was first introduced, people were 
considered either hard chargers or easygoing, big eaters or picky. Now the test 
interpretation must account for Type A personalities and anorexics. 
</P>
<P>
"We have included a number of items that reflect the driven, compulsive, 
schedule-bound, aggressive and competitive style of the Type A," said James N. 
Butcher, a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota and another 
member of the group that rewrote the test. "We now have certain questions 
dealing with eating disorders too." 
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 people randomly selected from phone books and carefully 
balanced by region, race and sex took the new version of the test. Different 
groups of items assess paranoid behavior, hypochondria, anxiety, depression, 
low self-esteem, anger, cynicism and many other behavioral patterns. 
</P>
<P>
There are a variety of trick questions in the test so psychologists can 
evaluate whether people are trying to lie about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The personality test started out in a medical and psychiatric setting, but it 
quickly spread. Applicants for few high-tension jobs in the United States these 
days can get by without taking the test. 
</P>
<P>
Flight controllers, nuclear power plant operators, airline pilots and officials 
at such top-secret federal agencies as the National Security Agency all must 
take it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been translated into more than 100 languages," Butcher said. "You could 
argue that no test has been applied more widely. It needed some improvements. 
But it has really stood the test of time."

ALASKA'S LONG WINTER NIGHTS BRING TO LIGHT GLOOMY EFFECT;

<TEXT>

Martha Roderick has never been much of a morning person, and living in 
Anchorage, where she had to get up one recent Sunday long before the sun 
finally rose at 9:13, it's sometimes difficult for her to do much more than 
snarl. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Alaska -- where length of residency is measured in terms of winters 
rather than years -- the long nights that plunge much of the state into 
darkness for weeks can manipulate moods and alter body clocks. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska winters certainly let Roderick know who is master. 
</P>
<P>
"One winter, I went into complete hibernation," the 58-year-old tutor said. "My 
mind stopped accepting information and my body stopped accepting commands. I 
just wanted to stay in bed all day with the covers over my head, and for a good 
part of one winter, that's just what I did." 
</P>
<P>
In Anchorage, tanning salons and fitness centers get a workout during the long 
winters, and so does the flight path from Anchorage to Honolulu. Tickets for 
Hawaii Airlines flights to Honolulu last December had been sold out a year in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty well understood among everyone in this state that you have to go 
south at least once a year. It's a good pick-me-up," said David Pierce, a state 
planner in Juneau, which is wrapped in gray mists most of the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, gets a daily average of slightly more than 7 
hours of daylight in December and about 8.5 hours a day in January. Twilight 
here lasts well into mid-morning, then sneaks back again in mid-afternoon. In 
winter, people drive to work in the dark and drive home in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
By Alaska standards, Anchorage has a spotlight shining on it. 
</P>
<P>
In Barrow, the northernmost community in North America, the sun does not rise 
for 65 days, from dusk Nov. 19 to dawn Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothers most people to some degree," said John Agee, a meteorological 
technician with the National Weather Service in that Arctic frontier town. "Not 
many people dig in here and stay forever. It's not that kind of place. It 
doesn't seem to bother me any, though. I've been on shift work for 30 years. It 
doesn't matter whether it's 3 a.m. or 3 p.m. My biological clock sprung years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
Studies suggest that as many as 20% of Alaskans suffer from Seasonal Affective 
Disorder, a mood disorder triggered by light deprivation, according to Dr. Aron 
Wolf, a psychologist at Langdon Clinic in Anchorage who has treated Martha 
Roderick for the illness known as SAD. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like they've turned the carburetor down," he said. "People sleep a lot. 
They crave carbohydrates and gain weight, and they suffer low- to 
moderate-grade depression. It isn't until mid-March that SAD folks begin 
feeling like their world is coming together again." 
</P>
<P>
SAD, which is estimated to affect 3% of all Americans, was identified a decade 
ago and became an officially diagnosed disorder last year. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors aren't sure exactly what causes the disorder, but some theorize that 
the absence of light triggers the secretion of a hormone called melatonin, 
which is thought to work as a sort of tranquilizer. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf said the illness generally affects women more than men, and seems to spare 
children and American Indians. He estimated that half of those who suffer from 
SAD in Alaska move here from cities in southern climates such as Dallas, 
Houston and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He has treated Roderick and hundreds of others like her with phototherapy, or 
simulated sunlight. For an hour every morning, from mid-September until early 
March, Roderick sits in front of a special light that throws off a brightness 
comparable to the sun coming through a window at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Anchorage Telephone Utility installed the full-spectrum 
lights, which throw off a bluish tint, in a building where 40 operators work. 
"That's a high-stress position, and it seems to have changed the mood of the 
people," said Bud Murphy, a utility spokesman. "I think it's working. People 
seem to like it a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Alaska's harsh environment shapes its character -- and, according to some 
theoreticians, the characters who are drawn to it. The state's rates of 
divorce, suicide and alcohol consumption are among the highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty much at the top of the heap for aberrations in general, and 
things do seem to deteriorate in the winter," said Jan Campbell, executive 
director of the Alaska Mental Health Assn. "When we came here in the early 
'60s, it was the end of the road. A lot of people who can't make it other 
places come here to start over. There is opportunity here, and the spirit of 
the individual flourishes in Alaska. People are less willing to conform."

OREGON GOES MINING FOR MORE BOOM TOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

VALE, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the more than 10,000 mining claims filed in Oregon during the last year 
have been on federal lands in Malheur County in the state's southeast corner, 
where officials say they welcome a boom town. 
</P>
<P>
Malheur County, at 9,926 square miles, is larger than the states of New Jersey, 
New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, Connecticut, Hawaii or Vermont. It is 
94% rangeland, two-thirds of it controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Land 
Management. Its largest industry is agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Its population of about 23,500 is clustered in small communities at the 
northern end, leaving plenty of room to accommodate the impact of a large 
mining facility, said county economic development coordinator ZaDean Auyer. 
</P>
<P>
"We would definitely welcome mining," Auyer said. "We're realistic that mining 
is probably to some degree boom and bust, but there's nothing stable, not 
really. You have to keep trying to find things." 
</P>
<P>
About 500 to 600 seats are available at local schools, and at least 290 houses 
are for sale because of the flight of people who couldn't find jobs, she said. 
Most county residents are so eager to improve the local economy, they are 
lobbying to build a new Oregon prison there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
One mining company that has found a promising ore deposit in Malheur County has 
indicated that it may start a mine operation with more than 100 people; another 
projects a smaller operation of about 30 employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Our per capita income is the second-lowest in the state -- $10,260 in 1986," 
Auyer said. "If we have a few jobs at $20,000 to $25,000, it's going to make a 
difference, and that's what you get with mining jobs. They figure 2 1/2 times 
turnover on a paycheck, so that $25,000 is going to be worth $75,000." 
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Nevada, for instance, mining is the highest-paying industry in 
the state, averaging about $33,000 per employee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the impact on the local community would be good because it will fill 
homes and help our businesses in town," said Ed Jabs, president of the Vale 
Chamber of Commerce. "You always have that small group of people who declare 
themselves environmentalists, but that's been very, very minimal. We feel good 
about that (mining) activity being here." 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists believe images of prosperity are blinding distressed 
communities, such as Vale, Ontario and Nyssa, to the environmental threats 
posed by big-time gold mining. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gary Brown, a lifelong Ontario resident who has formed a small 
activist group called Concerned Citizens for Responsible Mining, believes the 
towns are threatened by something else. 
</P>
<P>
"Greed," Brown said. "The people that are going to benefit from this are your 
business people. You're going to have businesses pop up here and there. I would 
love to see some industry come in that's going to stay here, but the mining 
won't last. What's going to happen when the miners are gone in six to 10 years 
is you're going to have empty buildings." 
</P>
<P>
"When the economic boom is anticipated, no one considers the bust and its 
effects," said Stuart Garrett, president of the Native Plant Society of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Across the border in Idaho, the communities of Wallace and Challis stand as 
testimony to what can happen when towns fail to prepare for the shutdown of 
local mines. These two cities were hit hard by the bust that came when nearby 
mines curtailed or closed. Property values plummeted, and costly school 
buildings and newly built houses were left empty. 
</P>
<P>
In Humboldt County, Nev., government officials and merchants have been riding 
the boom for three years. Seven gold mines employing from 150 to 200 people 
each have been established in Humboldt County, and the county has been 
scrambling to provide housing and classroom space for new residents. 
</P>
<P>
However, county officials say they have tried not to overbuild, hoping to avoid 
a crash when the surrounding gold mines reach the end of their projected lives 
in 10 to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We walk very carefully so that we won't have a ghost town left," said Humboldt 
County Commissioner Darrell Taylor. "We don't want to build an infrastructure 
that the people who lived here before are going to pay for after. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me, mining has been very economically beneficial for the 
community."

PAIR PUBLISH MAGAZINE ABOUT LIFE ON THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, ASSOCIATED PRESSPublications: Michael Lane and Jim Crotty 
stay on the move as they put out a periodical that is billed as America's first 
totally mobile magazine. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
James Crotty and Michael Lane don't wait to return home to spin tales of their 
latest travels. In fact, they don't return home at all. 
</P>
<P>
Crotty, Lane and their two cats have been on the road for four years and 85,000 
miles publishing a totally mobile magazine: Monk. 
</P>
<P>
They eat, sleep, travel and work in a 26-foot 1986 Fleetwood motor home. A 
solar-powered Macintosh computer is mounted on the dashboard. Ads are sold by 
Lane, 39, and Crotty, 30, from phone booths. A mailing address described as a 
"suite" is actually a 5-inch by 10-inch postage box in Santa Fe, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
What started as a newsletter has turned into a magazine with a circulation of 
about 30,000 and a cover price of $2.95 ($3.75 abroad). 
</P>
<P>
"Monk is about life on the road. In each issue we describe the latest segment 
of our travels and encounters with the lucky victims of our latest pit stop. 
Everyone from dogs to dancers, vision queens to country singers and 
occasionally, even real live monks," the two Monks wrote in their seventh 
issue, July 28. "We are a gentle tickle in the side of the earnest seeker, the 
frazzled housewife and the corporate climber, though we can also be quite 
useful. In fact, thousands of readers use our quarterly rag to teach dogs how 
to fetch." 
</P>
<P>
Lyrical, philosophical, kind of zany -- that's the kind of thing readers expect 
from Monk and its founder-editors, New Age hippies who held down a series of 
jobs in San Francisco before they answered the call of the open road. 
</P>
<P>
"We represent a new style of spiritual nomad who is not bound by religious 
norms," they say, a kind of "traveling soap opera, flophouse and nunnery all 
rolled into one." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, they were fed up with rising rents. But Crotty said the Monks' 
odyssey was also a quest for simplicity in their lives and resulted from a 
"burning desire to create a life style that was completely mobile." 
</P>
<P>
"That's obviously a dream of a lot of people or mobile homes wouldn't be so 
popular. We were just a little more passionate about that than most." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine describes their adventures in a stream-of-consciousness, chatty, 
gonzo style. Occasionally, people they encounter contribute articles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Charles Kuralt with Jack Kerouac and they pick up Laurel and Hardy 
hitchhiking and then go on an adventure," Crotty said. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the Monks to New Mexico, where "it's high, it's clear, it's desert and 
it's peyote land." Follow them to the "scene of the crime" -- White Sands 
Missile Range, where one of the first nuclear test blasts occurred on July 6, 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
Listen as the Monks expound on turbans, China Cola, the benefits of geese in 
weeding farms, how Arkansas got its name and "What You Won't Learn Through The 
Arkansas Department of Tourism." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's advertisements offer all-natural sunscreens, herbal toothpaste, 
the secret to instant memory, massage tables, Indian-style ceremonial drums and 
"The X-rated Bible." 
</P>
<P>
With advertiser and reader support, the Monks break even. Eventually, Lane 
hopes to distribute Monk in Europe and to travel overseas. For now, they 
explore the United States, changing directions on a whim. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, they were in Minnesota and chose to go to Mardi Gras in New 
Orleans. But the motor home slid off an icy road, and about 30 residents of the 
tiny village of Calico Rock, Ark. emerged with shovels. "We almost lost the van 
and ourselves," Lane said. "These people all came out and rescued us and helped 
us get started. It was touching. 
</P>
<P>
"Being on the road you have to open up to all people. There're a lot of people 
traveling like us in vans but they would never have these chance encounters 
because they will just stick to certain tourist centers, or what's expected." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, stereotypes crumble along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"In the South we thought they were going to be a bunch of bigoted racist 
rednecks, and though that exists, everyone you run into is really open-minded. 
Most people everywhere are incredibly friendly," Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a simple journey that many people have carried out. We just got very 
complex about it," Crotty said. "We go to places that are unheralded or to 
places that you dare not go with a motor home, and Manhattan fits into the 
latter category. Absolutely no motor home magazine will recommend that you go 
to Manhattan." 
</P>
<P>
There is a reason, of course. While in Manhattan, the motor home was parked in 
a garage. But that didn't prevent thieves from stealing a bicycle from the 
Monks, who were last reported more safely ensconced in North Bergen, N.J.

RANCHERS HAVE FEW DISCOURAGING WORDS ABOUT RAISING HARDY BUFFALOES; 
</P>
<P>
REVIVAL: AMERICAN BISON PROVE EASY TO TAKE CARE OF. THEIR LEAN MEAT BRINGS 
TWICE THE PRICE OF BEEF AND MOUNTABLE HEADS SELL FOR $400 ON UP.

<P>
There's more capitalism than altruism these days behind the resurgence of the 
once nearly extinct buffalo -- the shaggy animals are easier to raise, fetch 
more per pound and are lower in fat and cholesterol than beef. 
</P>
<P>
The buffalo, which once roamed the Great Plains like a moving black robe, was 
hunted for meat and hides in such great numbers that historians say by 1889 
fewer than 600 remained. Since 1970, the number of buffalo has doubled in this 
country to about 60,000, according to the American Bison Assn. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 stockmen, ranchers like Brian Ward of Center, have gone into raising 
buffalo because of a beef market made unstable by American eating habits. Ward 
runs 1,700 head on his 100,000-acre spread in southern Colorado's San Luis 
Valley and sells about 100,000 pounds of boneless meat a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We get long winters in this valley," he said. "The buffalo hide's thicker 
(than cattle), they got a lot more hair and they eat and tend to be more like 
wild animals -- store fat in the fall and their metabolism slows down in the 
winter, so they require less feed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some exciting times. We drive them about 35 miles to pasture and 
back every year, cross-country. We used to use horses but we use motorcycles 
now. The buffalo don't charge the cycles as bad as they do horses." 
</P>
<P>
The price of good buffalo breeding stock has doubled in the last five years to 
about $1,500 for a young breed cow, twice what a comparable beef cow brings, 
according to the Denver-based ABA. But buffalo meat also brings twice the price 
of beef, and it's lean meat. A 3-ounce serving has 93 calories, compared to 183 
for beef; 43 milligrams of cholesterol, compared to 55 for beef; and 1.8 grams 
of fat, compared to 8.7 for beef, the association says. 
</P>
<P>
A buffalo cow can bear calves for 30 years or more, while a cow is usually sent 
to slaughter after about 10. Stockmen can also sell skulls for $100 or so, 
uncured robes for $6 to $12 a square foot and mountable heads for $400 on up. 
</P>
<P>
The symbol of the American West is an imposing animal. It has a black-brown, 
shaggy head and cape and short curved black horns. A mature bull stands more 
than 6 feet tall at its hump and weighs 2,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
A century ago, the buffalo was nearly exterminated as the railroads pushed 
westward. The slaughter was triggered by demand for meat to feed the rail crews 
and the crowded East, a new tanning method that let the spongy hides be used as 
leather, and political expediency -- to destroy the Plains Indians' food 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
Historian Francis Haines said: "The rush of new hunters to the Kansas plains 
resembled the stampede to a new gold strike. . . . In the spring of 1872 . . . 
the constant booming of the big guns sounded more like a battle than a hunt." 
</P>
<P>
In 1872, Col. Richard Irving Dodge wrote there was "apparently no limit to the 
number of buffaloes." A year later, he found "myriads of carcasses. The air was 
foul with a sickening stench and the vast plain, which only 12 short months 
before teemed with animal life, was a dead, solitary putrid plain." 
</P>
<P>
Historians estimate that 6.3 million buffalo were killed in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The Plains Indians, whose society depended on the buffalo for food, shelter and 
clothing, either starved or surrendered. Their lives were so miserable that the 
"Ghost Dance" cult sprang up, preaching that whites would be buried and the 
buffalo would return. The Army's massacre of 200 Sioux at Wounded Knee at the 
end of 1890 ended the "Ghost Dance" movement. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the early 20th Century that buffalo preservation became a 
concern. The newly created American Bison Society and President Teddy Roosevelt 
were able to persuade Congress to set up preserves in Oklahoma and Montana in 
1907. By then there were several hundred buffalo in private herds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the ranchers who really took it upon themselves to save the bison," 
said Duane Lammers, president of the ABA. "Some of those early people who 
wanted to save the buffaloes had Indian heritage, some had Indian wives. It was 
very important to them to save the bison. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think, too, it was just out of genuine care for them." 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo stockmen warn that the bison remains a wild animal, extremely powerful 
and territorial. There is an old saying that you can push a buffalo anywhere it 
wants to go. Another is never turn your back on a buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
But the advantages are apparent as well. 
</P>
<P>
"They are easier to take care of," said Lammers, who runs about 1,000 head on 
his Triple Seven ranch in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
"Beef producers are living with their cow herds during the calving season. That 
first spring when we didn't have cattle we went through calving here with free 
time. It was like (taking) a couple of weeks off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a storm comes up, I'm losing sleep over my cattle. With my buffalo, I can 
just sleep through the night."

SCANDINAVIAN SMOKERS HUFF AND PUFF AS LEGAL RESTRICTIONS GET TOUGHER TO SWALLOW

Shoved into corners, banned from local flights and excluded from some hotel 
floors, smokers in Scandinavia say they have had enough and are beginning to 
fight back. 
</P>
<P>
Smokers have banded together in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark to combat 
perceived discrimination, to lobby against new anti-smoking laws and to share 
tricks to sneak a smoke against the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to protect smokers' rights. We don't want to encourage people to 
smoke, especially not young people," said Bengt Oste, chairman of the Swedish 
lobby Smokepeace. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many smoking bans were coming from all over the place. It was about time 
somebody did something about it," said Tore Dinesen of the Danish smokers' 
organization, Henry. 
</P>
<P>
In their latest action, the pro-smoke groups published a pamphlet on how to 
avoid the smoking bans on local flights by Finnair and SAS, the Scandinavian 
Airlines System. The rule was extended Nov. 1 to any international flight less 
than 100 minutes long on these airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The "Smokers' Guide To Smokers' Flights in the Nordic Area" lists flights by 
other airlines with smoking sections that have stopovers in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Smokepeace, which adopted the symbol of an Indian in feathered headdress 
puffing a peace pipe, says it just wants a fair deal for smokers and 
non-smokers. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 months it has drawn 1,500 members. Some are non-smokers offended by 
discrimination, Oste said, and 53% are women. 
</P>
<P>
"Smokers have to back down a bit, so as not to harm or irritate non-smokers," 
said Oste, an anchorman for Swedish TV news who says he has been a pipe smoker 
for 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, fair provision should be made for smokers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Henry, launched two years ago by a Danish wine and tobacco merchant, enlisted 
Denmark's pipe-smoking Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen in an advertising 
campaign last spring to plead that "tolerance and consideration are the basis 
of living together." 
</P>
<P>
Although it doesn't release financial figures, Henry reportedly gets part of 
its finances from the Danish tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
Norway has enacted some of the world's toughest anti-smoking laws, which 
critics say make lighting a cigarette indoors illegal almost everywhere except 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden's parliament is in the early stage of drafting a comprehensive law, 
which many legislators want to fashion on the Norwegian model. Steps toward a 
similar bill in Denmark were interrupted by an election and have been dropped 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
Among Norway's regulations is a ban on smoking in any office occupied by more 
than one person, even if everyone in the room is a smoker. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking was outlawed in schools, hospitals, theater lobbies and public 
transportation. Selling tobacco to youths under 18 is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Many Scandinavian hotels have no-smoking rooms, and some have barred tobacco 
from entire floors. 
</P>
<P>
Most workplaces have set aside smoking areas. The Stockholm daily Aftonbladet 
banned smoking anywhere in its new nine-story building except in a few 
glassed-in rooms by the coffee machines on each floor. They are so poorly 
ventilated that workers refer to them as "the gas chambers." 
</P>
<P>
High tobacco taxes also are meant to deter. In Norway cigarettes cost about $4 
a pack, slightly more than in the other countries. Roll-your-own tobacco is 
becoming more popular in Denmark, where pipe tobacco is taxed less. 
</P>
<P>
One dodge from smoking bans is snuff, a plug of tobacco that many Scandinavians 
stick under their upper lip. 
</P>
<P>
The government in Oslo adopted an ambitious and, critics say, unrealistic 
target of making Norway smoke-free by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
The critics note that although tobacco has not been advertised since 1973, four 
out of 10 Norwegians smoke, and consumption is rising by 500 tons of tobacco a 
year.

HIGH BIRTH RATE THREATENS TO WIPE OUT AFRICA'S MODEST GAINS IN ECONOMIC GROWTH

HARARE, Zimbabwe 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elizabeth Mazivire, a 16-year-old mother of three, works in the tobacco barn of 
a wealthy Zimbabwean farmer to supplement the earnings of her tractor-driver 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
Her eldest son, Peter, is only 4 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Weary, and looking far older than her age, Elizabeth says she "accidentally 
fell pregnant" at 12 and since then has continued having accidental pregnancies 
by her 20-year-old husband, Jonathan. 
</P>
<P>
She is one of thousands of Zimbabwean women who, either because they do not 
know about contraceptives or have no access to them, end up having more 
children than planned. 
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, with only 9 million people in a country the size of France, hardly 
ranks as overcrowded. But here, as almost everywhere in Africa, a high birth 
rate is threatening to wipe out modest gains from economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and neighboring Botswana have been spotlighted by the World Bank as 
the only two countries in sub-Saharan Africa where vigorous government efforts 
to promote family planning are starting to show results. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of Zimbabwean couples now use contraceptives -- about 10 times the 
African average, according to the World Bank. Only Mauritius, an Indian Ocean 
island not typical of Africa, scores higher, with 78%. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Zimbabwe is still fighting an uphill battle against the African 
tradition of large families. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1987 the net population growth was 3.7%, although the latest 
figures show a drop to 2.9%. World Bank statistics show that as recently as 
1988, the average Zimbabwean woman could expect to give birth to five children 
in her lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Population growth has far outpaced Zimbabwe's annual average economic growth 
rate of 2.4% since independence in 1980, according to World Bank statistics. 
</P>
<P>
This has led to an average drop in the per capita gross domestic product of 
1.3% a year, with falling living standards, growing unemployment and increased 
pressure on social services. 
</P>
<P>
In much of Africa the figures are far worse. World Bank projections foresee a 
doubling of the continent's population to 1 billion in the next 30 years, and 
at the moment only 3% to 4% of couples use contraception. 
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe accidental pregnancies are most prevalent among schoolgirls who, 
for moral reasons, are barred by the authorities from freely obtaining 
contraceptives like their married and adult counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
But teen-agers and couples who do not use any form of modern contraception for 
cultural, religious and other reasons are now the main targets of a 
state-backed family planning program. 
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council has expanded its activities since 
independence to almost every town and has established a rural network in which 
contraceptives are given freely to couples and unmarried adults. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the nerve center of the country's population control strategy," said a 
spokeswoman of the council, which gets 70% of its funds from the government. 
</P>
<P>
The council holds lectures for couples on why and how to space their children 
and counseling sessions for young people on the consequences of early marriage. 
</P>
<P>
However, the campaign to persuade families to have fewer children has yet to 
reach every corner of the country, particularly isolated rural areas where 80% 
of Zimbabwe's population lives. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth, for example, despite living on a farm only 40 miles from the 
capital, said she had never heard of contraceptives until "a few weeks ago, 
when I went to Harare for specialized medical treatment." 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I knew there was this (contraceptives) and I think I couldn't have 
fallen pregnant in the first place and I could have been in school now," she 
said with a wry smile. 
</P>
<P>
Rural families, who rely on children to work on their farms, have an average of 
eight children. Before the advent of modern medical care, infant mortality 
encouraged women to have a large number of pregnancies to ensure that several 
children survived.

SHE READS BUSH'S LIPS -- AND NOSE, EARS. . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SILVER SPRING, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While President Bush talks about "a kinder, gentler nation," Laura Rosetree 
says everything about his face -- from his straight eyelids to his narrow nose 
and thin-lipped smile -- suggests that Bush isn't very keen on kindness. 
</P>
<P>
And about those lips. Bush says "read my lips" about not raising taxes, but 
what are his lips really saying? 
</P>
<P>
"What they suggest is that Bush controls his speech very carefully," says 
Rosetree, a self-proclaimed expert in analyzing faces to learn what they reveal 
about personality. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't say whatever he's really feeling or thinking," she said. "If you 
literally read his lips, they are proclaiming, 'I'm not ever going to get 
sentimental on you. I'm not going to be a bleeding heart.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rosetree, 41, is a former self-development teacher who became interested in 
"reading" faces in New York in 1976, when she met an elderly Chinese 
practitioner of an ancient method known as siang mien. 
</P>
<P>
After a decade of research, she says, she developed her own psychic road map of 
the human face, which she describes in a 285-page book titled "I Can Read Your 
Face." 
</P>
<P>
She claims that every facial feature from eyebrows to chin dimples can betray 
how people think, behave and handle life's challenges. While most psychologists 
would scoff at such a claim, Rosetree says she has been hired by several 
businesses to train salespeople and real estate agents how to read the faces of 
prospective customers. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in her sunny apartment in this Washington suburb, Rosetree studied a 
close-up photo of Bush and a videotape of a Nov. 7 news conference for clues to 
his personality. 
</P>
<P>
Her conclusion: Bush is a hard-nosed pragmatist and skeptic, a die-hard 
ideologue, a shrewd negotiator and skilled conciliator, an intellectual who 
revels in the realm of ideas, a decision-maker who respects facts, disdains 
feelings and isn't afraid of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a people person, he's more of an idea person," Rosetree says. Even 
the small inner circle of Bush's ear suggests that he "listens for facts and 
objective information rather than feelings, emotions or spiritual aspects," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Kindness is not a major trait of George Bush's, judging by his face," Rosetree 
said. "He has other strengths, but kindness is not one of those. There are at 
least 10 facial traits that indicate kindness, and Bush doesn't have a single 
one." 
</P>
<P>
When Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met at the Malta summit, 
she said, they may have differed on some East-West issues but "they have noses 
in common" -- long and straight, with tips pointing down. 
</P>
<P>
Rosetree said that means Bush and the Soviet leader both tackle problems 
logically, they're good at long-term strategy and they have a strong sense of 
self-interest. But she says they are strikingly different in the shape of their 
eyelids. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's lower eyelids are straight, meaning he's naturally wary of new people, 
while Gorbachev's are curved, meaning he probably is "the open-hearted one of 
the two," Rosetree says. 
</P>
<P>
To set the record straight, she says, Bush is a macho man -- it's right there 
in the semicircular knob on his prominent, square-jawed chin. 
</P>
<P>
"That semicircle relates to being very proud of his masculinity, the macho 
aspect, forcefulness, and being very sensitive to appearing weak in front of 
other people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The wimp image in the presidential campaign must have bothered him 
excruciatingly," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"His straight chin shows that he makes his major life decisions based on 
principles and ideology, not on compassion or other people's feelings. This is 
not the chin of a Santa Claus, it's the chin of a crusader." 
</P>
<P>
Further, she says, the way Bush's ears lie flat against his head indicates that 
he is a strong conformist, a stickler for "correct" behavior and intolerant of 
kooks.

IVORY BAN SPURS DEMAND FOR MAMMOTHS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Those who thought that a recent ban on the international ivory trade would save 
the elephant did not take into account the giant mammal's ancient relative, the 
mammoth. 
</P>
<P>
Since an international conference banned trade in elephant ivory last October, 
demand for mammoth tusks -- still buried in the frozen wastes of northeastern 
Siberia -- has soared, and wildlife experts fear that trade in mammoth ivory 
could be used as cover for illegal trade in elephant tusks. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya-based conservationist Esmond Bradley Martin said that the Soviet Union, 
which sold five tons of mammoth ivory to India for $12 a pound in 1986, is now 
asking as much as $455 a pound from prospective Japanese buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The mammoth, a type of hairy elephant that adapted to live in Arctic climates, 
died out about 10,000 years ago, but tens of thousands of mammoth carcasses 
have been preserved in Siberia's permanently frozen sub-soil. 
</P>
<P>
"Mammoth ivory affords substantial cover for unlawful elephant ivory, and the 
economists' prediction that a ban would push the price up appears to be 
correct," Ian Parker, an elephant expert based in Nairobi, said. 
</P>
<P>
Mammoth ivory, which once sold at less than half the price of elephant ivory, 
is now three times more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has defied the ban on ivory trading, which took effect Jan. 18, to 
allow Hong Kong, its colony, six more months to dispose of 670 tons of elephant 
tusks in stock. 
</P>
<P>
Burundi, which until 1987 was the main center for trading poached ivory in 
Africa, is sitting on 86 tons of tusks. 
</P>
<P>
Parker fears that these and other stocks will be shifted to other countries and 
then reappear in traditional markets labeled as mammoth ivory -- for which no 
trading restrictions apply since the animal is extinct. 
</P>
<P>
Mammoth ivory from Siberia has been traded extensively in Asia and northern 
Europe for at least 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
According to English trader Basset Digby, who bought mammoth ivory in Siberia 
in the early years of this century, some 30 tons a year used to pass through 
the town of Yakutsk. 
</P>
<P>
During the spring thaw in Siberia, he reported, ivory hunters would excavate 
tusks buried in frozen tundra that had been exposed by the erosion of river 
banks or the battering of the sea against the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Tusks are to be found at low tide, sometimes quite a grove of them sticking up 
in the sand, their drooping curves making them look, as the Yakuts graphically 
put it, like great candles that have been placed too near the fire," Digby 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the mammoth carcasses have been reduced to skeletons, but some have 
been preserved perfectly in the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"People have even eaten the meat and some mammoths have been found because of 
wolves and other animals tearing away pieces of the exposed flesh," Parker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the flesh decays, mammoth ivory tens of thousands of years old often 
remains in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
"The cold has delayed the normal chemical and biological processes of decay, 
and much of the ivory is close to its original state," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
There are differences between the tusks of mammoths and modern elephants. 
</P>
<P>
"Mammoth ivory tends to be longer and more heavily curved," Parker said. "The 
ivory is frequently stained by minerals in colors ranging from pure blue 
through pinks and reds to russets, some of which are very attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Mammoth ivory is also harder to carve than elephant ivory and cracks more 
easily, which historically made it cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
"But the best mammoth ivory is virtually indistinguishable from elephant ivory 
to anyone but an expert," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
The trade in mammoth tusks virtually disappeared after the 1917 Russian 
Revolution, but it re-emerged in the late 1980s as ivory prices soared and 
rampant poaching decimated the elephant population of Africa. By most 
estimates, Africa's elephant population has halved to about 600,000 over the 
last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said traders in Japan, which consumes 40% of the world's ivory, had told 
him that since they can no longer import elephant tusks, they are planning to 
negotiate imports of Soviet mammoth ivory, despite the high price. A delegation 
of Japanese ivory traders is to visit Moscow this month, he added.

AUSTRIA-HUNGARY PAST MAY SIGNAL FUTURE

<P>
Some Eastern European countries may have to go a century back in time to find a 
geopolitical model to help pull them out of the economic shambles left by the 
collapsing communist system. 
</P>
<P>
So says Thibaut de Saint Phalle, financial lawyer, author and World War II 
veteran who has spent much of his life making his way through the maze of 
international finance. 
</P>
<P>
De Saint Phalle is circulating the idea that what Eastern Europeans need, now 
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is allowing them to move toward 
free-market economies, is a system similar to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, 
which resulted in almost 50 years of peace until World War I. 
</P>
<P>
This will become particularly necessary, he said, if and when West and East 
Germany reunite and again become a powerful economic force in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems highly likely that sooner or later the Germanys will get together 
again," he said. "If I were secretary of state, I would be terribly excited 
about recreating in southeastern Europe a strong economic and political bloc to 
keep the Germans from expanding eastward." 
</P>
<P>
The dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy, with the emperor of Austria doubling as 
king of Hungary, was established in 1867 and was a stable power in southeastern 
Europe until it was dismembered at the end of World War I. 
</P>
<P>
In the process Hungary lost regions to neighboring states -- Transylvania to 
Romania, Croatia and Bacska to Yugoslavia, Slovakia and Carpatho-Ruthenia to 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
De Saint Phalle envisions an economic federation between Austria, Hungary, 
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, with links to Romania and Poland, able to trade 
both with Western Europe and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
They would again use Trieste, a Yugoslav city at the northern end of the 
Adriatic Sea, as the principal port. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting because lately there have been political discussions and 
certainly all sorts of tentative economic agreements between Austria and 
Hungary on the one hand and more recently between parts of Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary, Austria, parts of Yugoslavia, and Italy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is 'Let's reinstitute that port, which would serve as the exporting 
center for this whole region of Eastern Europe.' " 
</P>
<P>
De Saint Phalle, who is writing a book forecasting the state of Europe in 1992, 
also said bureaucrats in the U.S. government are spending too much time 
worrying about what effect Western Europe will have on the United States in 
1992 when the European Economic Community becomes an integrated trading bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they ought to spend a lot more time worrying about what is going to 
happen in Eastern Europe. How do we try to help avoid what happened in the days 
from 1870 to 1945 when the Germans were creating all these problems? Let's make 
sure they're not in a position to create problems again." 
</P>
<P>
Assuming Gorbachev's reform program does not collapse, the Soviet Union should 
not interfere with such a federation as long as it proceeds slowly and bases 
its decisions on economic reasons, not political or military ones, De Saint 
Phalle believes. 
</P>
<P>
"It will go as fast as it's meant to go, but we can give it a push from time to 
time. We can say to the American businessman, 'Go and invest, become part of 
the groups, work with these people, encourage them,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Already American businesses are attempting to invest nearly $2 billion in 
Poland and Hungary through the Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC), and 
officials expect Congress soon to authorize investment in other nations in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Such investments are one way to tap into the Western European market after 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can invest in Eastern Europe, they can manufacture things there and 
export them to Western Europe," said Jim Hall of OPIC. "Not only is Eastern 
Europe a huge, untapped market, but they can also sell competitively in Western 
Europe."

BANK TAKES HOPE TO BANGLADESH VILLAGES

<TEXT>
<P>
Safura Begum starts her day early to finish the housework before the sun is up 
and get her children ready for school. Then, along with her neighbors, she 
awaits an "every-morning" visit from her bank manager. 
</P>
<P>
He arrives with a smile and asks if the boys have new books or the girl has 
recovered from illness. Any discussion about banking comes much later. 
</P>
<P>
"This is how we operate," said Arshad Alam, manager of the Mograpara branch of 
the Grameen Bank. "By the time the villagers have finished their breakfast, I 
have trekked six or seven miles to get to them." 
</P>
<P>
Alam, in an interview at his office 25 miles from Dhaka, compared the role of a 
Grameen Bank official with that of a rural schoolteacher who sets out every 
morning to check on pupils. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk hygiene, education, agriculture and domestic problems before getting 
down to business," he said. "And this trick has so far proved highly 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the Grameen (Rural) Bank was conceived by Mohammad Yunus, a 
professor of economics at Chittagong University whose dream is to revolutionize 
Bangladesh's rural economy. 
</P>
<P>
The award-winning economist set up the first branch of the Grameen Bank on an 
experimental basis in 1976 not far from his university. 
</P>
<P>
Most rural villagers, who account for 85% of Bangladesh's 100 million people, 
live in dire poverty. The country's annual per capita income is only $170. 
</P>
<P>
Villagers told Yunus they had no money to deposit with conventional banks nor 
had they any idea of earning interest. 
</P>
<P>
So Yunus thought of a bank with a difference that would provide the landless 
and mostly illiterate women with credit facilities from funds he borrowed from 
a local bank. 
</P>
<P>
Since then the Grameen Bank has come a long way. With 632 branches, it has a 
clientele of more than 630,000 people in 14,310 villages. 
</P>
<P>
After initial successes, funding came from the Bangladesh central bank, the 
International Fund for Agricultural Development and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
The bank has loaned about $160 million and received back more than $130 
million. "The rate of (loan) recovery is spectacularly high compared with other 
banks," Alam said. 
</P>
<P>
Before granting loans to individuals, the bank forms borrower groups, each with 
five villagers, and gives them mandatory training for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The first loans, for a maximum of 10,000 taka (about $320) each, go to two 
group members. If they repay the loans regularly, two more come on the list. 
After a month or so, the fifth member, who is the group's chairman, gets 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowers are free to use the loans to buy cattle, build a house or start a 
small business. But they must repay the loans, with interest, within a year by 
weekly installments before another loan is granted. 
</P>
<P>
More than 75% of the bank's stock is owned by the landless members and the rest 
is retained by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowers' savings account for 10% of the total loans disbursed. 
</P>
<P>
The bank has started a savings scheme for children. The money is used for 
hiring teachers for them and buying books and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The bank also operates a social development program. Called "Sixteen 
Decisions," it helps motivate members with discipline, unity and hard work to 
improve their living standards. 
</P>
<P>
To improve standards of health, all bank members must have sanitary latrines at 
their homes. Any house built with a bank loan must stand on concrete pillars, 
supplied by the bank from its own plant, to withstand flood or cyclone. 
</P>
<P>
"Banking is not our primary goal. We want to change every aspect of an 
individual's life," Alam said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we look forward to a golden future," said borrower Ahmad Hussain. 
</P>
<P>
To make it easier for the borrowers, bank officials go from door to door to 
collect loan payments. "People feel greatly encouraged by such gestures," Alam 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank operates in 38 of Bangladesh's 68 districts.

Pots and pans, a young girl's cloth belt, fading snapshots, a box of shoes. The 
ordinary stuff of ordinary people's lives, they assume a horrifying 
significance in the archives of the new Holocaust museum being built near the 
National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
These simple objects are made extraordinary by the awful events that gave them 
meaning. This is no ordinary museum, either. 
</P>
<P>
Chartered by Congress in 1980, its purpose is not to celebrate the triumphs of 
Western civilization but to shine a glaring, uncomfortable light on one of its 
darkest moments, the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews and untold millions of 
Gypsies, homosexuals, physically handicapped people and other "undesirables" 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are Holocaust museums in Los Angeles and Detroit, and one under 
construction in New York, Washington's will be the only national Holocaust 
museum in the United States. When completed, it also will be the largest in the 
world, surpassing the Yad Vashem national Holocaust center in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
"Most museums, like the National Gallery of Art, begin with a valuable 
collection that requires a building to house it," said Holocaust museum 
spokesman Sam Eskenazi. "Our museum is being built because it has a story to 
tell, and we're collecting artifacts to tell that story." 
</P>
<P>
In the last 18 months, as cement was poured for the museum's foundations, 
archivists have been deluged with more than 10,000 artifacts donated by 
Holocaust survivors and their children, or obtained through negotiations with 
authorities in East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller objects include diaries, sketches, real or forged identity papers, 
Star of David clothing patches, striped inmate uniforms, coins and stamps used 
in Jewish ghettos, clandestine sketches of life in concentration camps and 
secret coded messages exchanged by prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
These items might be considered commonplace "ephemera" by other museums, but 
Holocaust museum curator Susan Morgenstein invented the term "survivor objects" 
to signify their value as "hard and fast documentation of a fragmentary period 
in history." 
</P>
<P>
Each has been catalogued and stored in gray, acid-free boxes in the 
climate-controlled rooms of a warehouse whose location is kept secret for 
security reasons. Some will be chosen for display in the permanent exhibition 
when the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum opens in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a special power to tell the human stories of the Holocaust," 
Morgenstein said. "Each of them, like the survivors themselves, has a story to 
tell." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Meyerowitz was 13 when her family was deported from Frankfurt, Germany, to 
Auschwitz-Birkenau in April, 1943. Separated from her father and brother, she 
and her mother lived in a barracks near the crematoriums where more than 2 
million people -- mostly Jews -- were killed. 
</P>
<P>
One day, as she sorted through a mound of loot confiscated from new prisoners, 
Meyerowitz retrieved a blue belt appliqued with colorful, floral-shaped felt 
cutouts, "obviously the work of a young girl, probably from somewhere in 
Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Risking a beating for violating camp regulations, Meyerowitz wore the forbidden 
piece of finery cinched at the waist of her long uniform skirt, to keep it from 
dragging in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
As Meyerowitz lost weight and the belt got looser, she tried to convince her 
worried mother that the belt was magical. "I explained that I'm not getting 
thinner, but the belt is getting longer," said Meyerowitz, who now lives in 
West Orange, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
William Luksenburg of Silver Spring, Md., donated the tattered, striped woolen 
jacket that he wore in the Flossenberg concentration camp. It had been hanging 
in the back of his closet for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten to 20 years from now, there won't be any survivors left to tell the 
stories," Luksenburg said. "My jacket is evidence that will speak to future 
generations." 
</P>
<P>
Among other items, the museum has acquired: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A box of brushes -- hairbrushes, toothbrushes -- seized from Auschwitz 
inmates, and 2,000 pairs of children's shoes and empty canisters of Zyklon-B 
poison gas from the Majdanek killing center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 27-foot freight car that once shuttled 100 Jews at a time from the Warsaw 
ghetto to Treblinka, along with a section of the tracks it rode into the death 
camp. The former cattle car is housed in a warehouse somewhere in North 
Carolina, where conservators are stripping paint to find the original wartime 
layer of reddish-brown, complete with markings and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A tourist-class ticket on the luxury liner St. Louis, which carried 936 
passengers -- most of them Jews with American visas -- on an ill-fated cruise 
from Germany to Cuba, where they planned to wait their turn for entry into the 
United States. They were turned back at Havana and eventually were forced to 
return to Europe. The ticket-holder, Moritz Schoenberger, was one of the few on 
board to survive the war. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A crushed doll carriage, some bricks, glass fragments and rubble from the 
Warsaw ghetto, the largest in Nazi Europe until it was demolished in 1943. Also 
excavated and shipped to the museum were 2,000 square feet of cobblestones once 
trodden upon by the ghetto's doomed Jewish inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The "02," the only surviving motorboat used in a secret Danish rescue 
operation to ferry 1,400 Jews and Resistance fighters from Nazi-occupied 
Denmark to safety in neighboring Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A partially burned Nazi flag and some 8-millimeter color movie footage shot 
from the stone ramparts of Mauthausen, a notoriously harsh SS concentration 
camp in Austria, by an American liberator in 1945, Army Sgt. Ray Buch. 
</P>
<P>
Associate curators Charlotte Hebebrand and Jacek Nowakowski have spent the past 
year scouring Eastern Europe with a shopping list of prized artifacts. They 
will make their first trip to the Soviet Union soon to search for relics of the 
Nazi massacre of 17,000 to 30,000 Jews at Babi Yar, a ditch outside Minsk, in 
1941. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their best efforts, some objects -- like their Jewish owners -- may 
have perished without a trace in the Holocaust. Nowakowski said he despairs of 
ever finding a pedicar, the pedal-operated taxi that once was commonplace in 
the Warsaw ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Nowakowski has searched in vain for menorahs, or ritual 
candlesticks, and other religious objects used in ancient Jewish communities 
that were obliterated by invading Nazis. But he was surprised during a visit to 
the museum that is the only thing left of Chelmno, an infamous killing center 
in western Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to find anything there," Nowakowski said, because fleeing 
Nazis had blown up the crematoriums and reduced Chelmno to rubble before Allied 
troops arrived. Yet he found a few keys, knives, forks, a cloth cap and 
spectacle lenses left by Jewish victims, as well as concrete blocks unearthed 
from the foundations of a crematorium. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Smith, the prize-winning British documentary film producer who is 
director of the museum's permanent collection, recently received the unexpected 
gift of an accordion, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, from the son of a Romanian 
Gypsy who perished in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying desperately to find a Gypsy caravan," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The five-story museum, designed by architect James I. Freed, a partner of I.M. 
Pei and himself a child refugee from Nazi Germany, is being built on 1.9 acres 
donated by the government and is administered by a federal agency with a 
$2-million annual budget.

HOTELS, PENTHOUSE SUITES ADD DIVERSITY TO BOOMING DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
striking transformation of downtown San Diego, where spindly construction 
cranes seem a permanent fixture on the skyline, shows no signs of abating in 
1990 as several large-scale projects -- from high-rise hotels to small-scale 
condominiums -- are expected to break ground. 
</P>
<P>
When combined with developments already under construction or scheduled to open 
this year, it is clear that downtown remains on fast-forward, in a boom cycle 
the upward spiral of which began in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
This year's construction comes with a new twist: housing, from tiny and 
inexpensive one-room shelters found in single-room occupancy hotels to 
sumptuous, multimillion-dollar penthouse condominiums perched on 41-story 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on residential construction is a departure from high-rise office 
buildings that have dominated downtown development. That is not to say that the 
office market is dead downtown. On the contrary, several large buildings are 
under construction and more are in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, the majority of new projects will be residential, a phenomenon 
that thrills downtown land-use planners. 
</P>
<P>
For all of this year's development activity, it promises to be merely a 
precursor to 1991. Barring a worldwide economic downturn, downtown construction 
next year is expected to be even more dramatic, with several apartment, 
condominium and office towers scheduled to break ground, according to both 
private real estate experts and government land-use planners. 
</P>
<P>
"The key ingredients for a vital downtown are coming together," said Kraig 
Kristofferson, an associate vice president of Coldwell Banker commercial real 
estate brokers who specialize in downtown office space. He cites the 
long-awaited opening of the new Convention Center, the emphasis on residential 
construction and construction of hotels as indicators of a vibrant downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are fears that the office market might be overbuilt, 
Kristofferson maintains otherwise, saying that there is room to expand and that 
office absorption rates are healthy enough to propel more construction. 
"Downtown is the strongest office market in all San Diego," more so than 
Mission Valley or the Golden Triangle in La Jolla, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's strong for offices but traditionally weak for housing, despite the push by 
city and redevelopment planners to make downtown an attractive residential 
market. That effort has included offering developers incentives such as 
government subsidies and low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
Although such incentives are still needed in some cases, as with the 
construction of single-room-occupancy hotels that offer low-priced, bare-bones 
efficiency shelter, developers increasingly compete on the open market to build 
housing downtown as they would anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, as anti-growth sentiment in suburban parts of the city 
has led to frequent attempts to limit development in those areas, downtown 
proponents have jumped in, marketing center city as a place hungry for housing. 
</P>
<P>
The premise behind this strategy is that what downtown needs more than anything 
else is people: middle-class folks who have a stake in its enhancement as a 
neighborhood. According to the theory, as the area becomes identified with a 
range of housing types and prices, it will become a magnet to even more people, 
leading to the real goal, the metamorphosis of a once-moribund urban core into 
one with a sense of vitality and life. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's how the city's government planners see it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you could say that 1990 is the year of housing," said Paul Desrochers, 
a top administrator with Centre City Development Corp., the agency in charge of 
downtown redevelopment. Of the about 40 major projects breaking ground, under 
construction or scheduled to open in 1990, almost half are housing projects, a 
plethora of plans encompassing single-room-occupancy hotels, artists' lofts, 
apartments and both low-scale and massive condominium complexes. 
</P>
<P>
And, for the first time, the city will see the construction of a "living-unit" 
project. The low-cost hybrid offers shelter that is larger than a room in a 
single-room-occupancy hotel but smaller than a studio apartment. The city has 
approved the project in an effort to increase affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked hard to make downtown a good place to market residential 
projects," said Larry Monserrate, a principal planner for the city of San Diego 
who specializes on downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Monserrate, who works with the Centre City Planning Committee headed by Horton 
Plaza developer Ernie Hahn, said not only has the committee recommended 
enlarging the area downtown where housing can be accommodated, but it has also 
recommended giving developers construction bonuses, allowing them to build 
bigger projects if they are predominantly residential. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, holes in downtown's glossy future. Aside from an economic 
downturn reverberating through the development industry, the major damper on 
continued housing construction downtown is the homeless and the transients, 
among them the mentally ill, whose presence is apt to repel fence-sitting 
downtown housing customers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the building of single-room-occupancy hotels has helped provide 
shelter for some of those who have been able to find jobs, planners such as 
Desrochers say much more needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledges that his agency, as well as others, have pressed so hard 
for bricks and mortar that serious, comprehensive solutions or alternatives to 
deal with the street population have been largely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
The remedy for the most part has been left to social agencies, from the Rescue 
Mission to the St. Vincent de Paul Joan Kroc Center for the Homeless, which are 
mainly concentrated in Centre City East. 
</P>
<P>
One exception will be evident this year. Scheduled to break ground in the 
spring is the Neil Good Day Center for Homeless Men, an experiment in keeping 
homeless men off the streets by giving them someplace to go during the day, 
someplace where they can be safe, where they can take a shower and perhaps get 
a foothold on entering mainstream society. 
</P>
<P>
The $705,000, 5,000-square-foot facility is being paid for by a combination of 
private funds, the San Diego Unified Port District, the county and the city. It 
will be located on a strip of California Department of Transportation right of 
way on 17th Street, between J and K streets, at the Interstate 5-Imperial 
Avenue off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
Although the homeless day center and other single-room-occupancy hotels are 
slated for construction in 1990, the glitzy high-rises will fetch the most 
attention, primarily because they are too large to overlook. 
</P>
<P>
Three major ones are scheduled to break ground near the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
One is One Harbor Drive, consisting of two slender towers, each 41 stories 
high, containing a total of 202 condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Built on a triangular tract across the railroad tracks from the new Convention 
Center, the towers will have units ranging from 1,119 square feet with one 
bedroom to 4,878-square-foot penthouses. They will also be the most expensive 
condominiums yet built downtown, with prices starting at $271,000 and running 
up to $2.5 million, according to Suzette Y. Gauvin, director of sales and 
marketing for the project and an employee of Stark Properties. 
</P>
<P>
A long fly ball away across Harbor Drive, the long-awaited 40-story, 875-room 
Hyatt Regency is also scheduled to break ground. Developed by Doug Manchester's 
Torrey Enterprises, the hotel and the huge adjoining 1,250-car garage will open 
two years after construction begins in April. 
</P>
<P>
A short distance away, near Horton Plaza, the biggest of the three -- Roger 
Morris Plaza -- is scheduled to break ground in the third quarter of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The central feature of this complex, spread over a block and a half, is a 
50-story tower. The development will have 750 hotel rooms, 150 apartments and 
an underground parking garage with 800 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Although not on the same scale as the big three, the expansion of Seaport 
Village is also scheduled to start this year, according to Roger Manfred, a 
partner and director of Seaport Village. He is also president and chief 
executive officer of the firm that is developing Roger Morris Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Officials and developers say construction downtown probably would be even 
greater this year if not for an underground plume of gasoline. The plume has 
delayed several residential projects while redevelopment officials try to find 
a long-term cleanup solution, an effort that has already consumed more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
If a comprehensive plan to clean up the toxic waste and determine legal 
liability is arrived at soon, then two other high-rises will probably begin 
construction next year. One would be the 32-story, 368-unit Tyson Plaza 
apartment tower across G Street from Horton Plaza, and the other would be the 
Courtyard, a 40-story, 400-unit apartment high-rise on the next block bounded 
by G, Market and Front streets, and 1st Avenue.

DEVELOPER, ESCONDIDO BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF CATTLE RANCH; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION: SLOW-GROWTH INTERESTS WANT TO QUASH PLANS TO PLACE 3,263 HOMES ON 
PRISTINE LAND, BUT THE BUILDERS ARE SUING THE CITY AND COUNCIL MEMBERS FOR 
TRYING TO DERAIL THE PROJECT.

<P>
Daley Ranch, a 4,400-acre cattle ranch that has belonged to the land-rich Daley 
family for more than a century, will become Escondido's largest and most 
prestigious subdivision if its owners and developers have their way. 
</P>
<P>
The steep and rocky acreage in the northeast corner of the North County city 
will become a low-density development compatible with its hilly terrain if the 
Escondido City Council's new slow-growth majority has its way. 
</P>
<P>
Which side will prevail? That question will be answered in coming months and 
years, after a very expensive war is fought at council meetings, on the 
streets, in living rooms, through the mail, at the ballot box and in the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
The way Councilwoman Carla DeDominicis sees it, it is a battle for all the 
marbles, a contest to determine who will run Escondido: the developers who, she 
says, are concerned with only the bottom line or the council, which, she 
claims, is concerned with only the best interests of the city and its 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
No one wonders where DeDominicis stands. The newspaper reporter-turned-attorney 
won a council seat in 1988 based on her contention that the city needed to get 
a grip on growth and plan its future. 
</P>
<P>
DeDominicis and Kris Murphy, another winner in the 1988 election, teamed up 
with veteran Councilman Jerry Harmon to form a slow-growth majority on the 
five-member council that, for the past 18 months, has pressured impatient 
developers by negotiating lower development densities and increased 
contributions for city improvements. 
</P>
<P>
But not until Daley Ranch developers notified the city last August that they 
were prepared to begin a 3,263-home project did the council trio turn them down 
flat and advise them to revamp their plans to conform to new growth-management 
ordinances and a revised general plan that cuts in half the city's ultimate 
population, from 300,000 to 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
An interim city ordinance, adopted to stem development until the new 
growth-management rules are in place, provides building permits only to major 
developers who have agreements with the city. Daley Ranch does not have such an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simple," DeDominicis said. "Now they have to play by our rules," which, 
under the proposed general plan, call for a maximum of 1,700 residences on the 
Daley Ranch. That number would not provide sufficient profit to the developer, 
said a former Escondido councilman. 
</P>
<P>
To Shea Homes and Daley Corp., two of the largest family-owned corporations in 
the nation and joint owners of Daley Ranch, the battle is over property rights. 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed in October against the city, its attorney and its three 
slow-growth council members, attorneys for Daley Ranch Associates ask the court 
to order the city to abide by agreements signed as far back as 1982, when Daley 
agreed to annex the historic ranch to Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
The present council "has a non-discretionary duty" to negotiate a development 
agreement with Daley under earlier agreements that would have allowed 
construction of 3,263 homes, the suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
City staff and elected officials have "attempted to extort unreasonable 
concessions" from Daley Ranch developers by limiting the number of units that 
can be built, according to Daley Ranch attorneys. The suit seeks about $200 
million in damages from the city and a minimum of $10 million in damages from 
each of the slow-growth council members -- Harmon, DeDominicis and Murphy -- 
and from City Atty. Lloyd Chapman. By naming Chapman, the developers' suit 
forced the city attorney to disqualify himself and the city to hire outside 
representation, San Diego attorney Louis Goebel, at an estimated cost of 
several hundred thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The four city officials should pay punitive damages "to deter future similar 
outrageous and illegal conduct," the lawsuit stated. 
</P>
<P>
DeDominicis labeled the request for individual judgments "malicious and 
improper" and predicted that the lawsuit would be thrown out of court. She 
described it as a "harassment tactic" that could have a chilling effect on city 
officials seeking to follow the dictates of their consciences and constituents. 
</P>
<P>
All three members have vowed to file a countersuit for malicious prosecution 
after the lawsuit has run its course. 
</P>
<P>
"If they really were serious about recovering money from me as an individual 
citizen and not as an elected official, they could have filed in small-claims 
court," where the limit of a claim is $2,000, DeDominicis quipped. 
</P>
<P>
The developers say they are not interested in recovering damages from the city. 
Rather, they are interested in building houses under agreements that the city 
and previous councils have approved, they say. The slow-growth troika is 
"stone-walling" all efforts toward that end, they claim, and their lawsuit is 
an attempt to force the city to negotiate in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Noon, head of Shea Homes San Diego division, said he has been trying to 
negotiate with the city for more than a year to allow the Daley Ranch 
development to proceed. City officials have rejected the plan as "not in 
substantial conformance" with earlier plans and have told Shea that it must do 
a complete environmental impact review on their altered plan before it can be 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
To do so would be "extremely expensive and also extremely risky, given the 
city's present political makeup," Noon said, referring to the slow-growth 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
Looming in the next two months are final hearings on the proposed general plan 
that would initiate slow-growth policies and pare development levels by about 
half, not only on Daley Ranch but citywide. 
</P>
<P>
Noon believes that Escondido residents back the slow-growth coalition in its 
efforts to prevent the problems of rapid urbanization: traffic congestion, 
school overcrowding, air pollution, water and sewer problems. But, he stresses, 
the Daley Ranch project is different. It is part of the solution, not the 
problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Daley Ranch developers have pledged $8 million to $11 million for road 
improvements outside the ranch property, Noon said. They also plan to build 
schools and to contribute to the community's cultural and recreational 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done several polls over the past months, and I am certain that the 
city's rejection of our project is not in keeping with the sentiments of the 
general populace of the city," Noon said. 
</P>
<P>
Noon said that he has "personally sat down with probably 500 residents to talk 
face to face, in groups of three, four, five or 10 people," and set them 
straight on Daley Ranch. He found most people "terribly misinformed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Harmon, who plans to run for mayor in June, said he has not 
participated in the polls or meetings but has heard from friends that poll 
questions were "loaded" and other information was of questionable accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
In light of his landslide victory in the 1988 council election, "I'm convinced 
the people are with us in our efforts to bring the city's growth into 
reasonable limits," Harmon said. He suspects that Daley Ranch public-relations 
efforts are aimed toward a ballot measure that would put the issue to voters, 
bypassing the council. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman DeDominicis believes the campaign of mailings, informational 
talks, community meetings, personal letter appeals and polling might even be a 
prelude to a recall effort targeting the slow-growth members. 
</P>
<P>
Noon and representatives of the Lynn Wessell Company, which is overseeing the 
pro-Daley Ranch campaign, say there are no plans for either a ballot measure or 
a recall of council members. 
</P>
<P>
Noon said that the polls indicate that council members have a higher opinion of 
their public support than is warranted. Polls showed that between half and 
two-thirds of Escondido voters could not name a single council member, and that 
only a slightly higher number recognized the members' names as they were read. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Hoehl, Daley Ranch campaign coordinator, said that more community 
meetings, mailings and coffee klatsches are scheduled to win Escondido voters 
to the side of Daley Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Wessell's services are sought by besieged developers statewide because of 
his pro-development successes. His most famous coup came in the 1988 Orange 
County elections, when Proposition A, which would have set limits on new 
construction, was favored by 80% of voters polled just eight weeks before 
election day. 
</P>
<P>
In that short time, Wessell, using sophisticated computer programs, targeted 
voter lists and deployed hundreds of workers to turn around public opinion. The 
growth-control measure lost by a healthy 56% to 44% margin. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon says that his concern over the Daley Ranch campaign does not focus on 
Wessell, who "is simply hired to do his job," but on Daley Corp., which in an 
earlier annexation election allegedly used "political dirty tricks" in an 
attempt to persuade rural Lehner Valley voters to annex to Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the election, Lehner Valley residents received bogus copies of 
the Lehner Valley News, a sporadic publication of annexation opponents. The 
edition reported that annexation opponents had changed their minds and now 
favored joining the city. 
</P>
<P>
The effort was quashed when annexation opponents traced the look-alike to Daley 
Corp. through the postage meter number. An eleventh-hour telephone campaign to 
alert voters to the ruse resulted in defeat of the annexation issue. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon said of Daley Ranch campaigners: "They may bamboozle an awful lot of 
people and they may promise an awful lot of things, but I still believe that 
the residents of Escondido are behind our efforts to control growth, and the 
momentum is building."

MULTI-TRACK SCHOOLS MAKE FISCAL SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the same week that the Board of Education in Los Angeles took a major step 
toward multi-track, year-round schools as a way to cope with overcrowding, the 
San Diego city school board started moving away from the controversial system. 
</P>
<P>
Why? In part because the crowding in Los Angeles schools is much worse than 
here. San Diego still has some options that L.A. has virtually exhausted: 
squeezing more portable classrooms onto some campuses and busing students to 
under-used schools. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some of the six San Diego schools spared from multi-track either 
had seen their enrollments level off or were having significant troubles making 
the system work. 
</P>
<P>
But the San Diego school board was also sending a clear signal that it 
considers multi-track, year-round schools a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
It's a retreat the school district may come to regret. Although the option is 
inconvenient and unpopular with many teachers, parents and administrators, it 
makes considerable long-term financial sense. 
</P>
<P>
By staggering schedules, a school can accommodate about 25% more students, 
without having more students in attendance at any one time. That saves on 
school construction costs -- which can be about $13 million for an elementary 
school, including the cost of the land -- and allows school districts to deal 
with growth quickly. 
</P>
<P>
This system should not be confused with the generally popular single-track, 
year-round schedule. In both systems, vacations are spread throughout the year, 
which many educators say helps students retain what they learned. But in the 
single-track system, all students in a school are on the same schedule, so 
there is no increased capacity. 
</P>
<P>
A multi-track system does have problems. Maintaining desegregation and 
specialized educational programs is more difficult with the added scheduling 
complications. Communication among teachers and administrators is hampered, 
because 25% of the teachers are on vacation at any one time, and teachers and 
students must frequently switch classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The ideal solution to overcrowding is to build more schools. Even if schools 
can work out the administrative bugs in multi-track systems -- and some schools 
have -- more classrooms must be built if class size is to be reduced or the 
school year lengthened, as educational reformers suggest. 
</P>
<P>
But realistically, population growth and spiraling land costs will financially 
limit that solution. And portables and busing have drawbacks, including the 
fact that they drain money from longer-term solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than retreating from multi-track schools, educators here should be 
looking for ways to use them creatively. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in Oxnard, where all schools are multi-track, new schools are 
designed with offices for teachers to mitigate some of the class-switching 
problems. Perhaps some of the savings from multi-track might eventually make it 
more feasible to reduce class size. 
</P>
<P>
It might also prove easier to persuade voters to approve tax increases for 
multi-track schools. The San Diego Unified School District used that argument 
in its successful 1988 tax measure. And in Oxnard, a bond measure passed with a 
71% majority. The superintendent there says the multi-track system helped 
persuade parents that the school district had done all it could to stretch 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles made the decision to put all schools on the same year-round 
calendar and to require each school to increase its capacity by 23%. For many, 
this will mean a multi-track system. The decision will help spread the 
overcrowding burden and allow for growth in some areas. It will also eliminate 
much scheduling confusion. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. plan makes sense. But it did not happen until the system was bursting 
at the seams. San Diego has the luxury of more time. It should be careful that 
its short-term decisions on multi-track don't sabotage long-term planning. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodating the 20,000 or so additional students expected by the year 2000 
will require maximum efficiency in the use of resources.

INSTRUCTING MIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I live in an area of North County with a desperate problem with migrant 
workers. I have a suggestion for the Rev. Rafael Martinez who is highly 
respected for his work with the migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
As a liaison between the citizens of North County and the workers, he has the 
power to create an atmosphere of harmony or animosity. He can explain to them 
what is acceptable and lawful behavior in our country and what is not. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is the community where I live. It has been estimated that it 
will cost us at least $6,000 a year to remove the litter and fecal matter left 
by the migrant workers who have been camping less than 75 feet from our condos. 
We are required by law to do so. 
</P>
<P>
We are an elderly group of retired teachers, farmers, veterans, etc., of very 
modest means. Our age and lack of physical agility precludes us from cleaning 
it up ourselves, and the cost of hiring it done is prohibitive. We do not 
expect the migrants to "disappear." We just feel that, along with the privilege 
of living in this country, goes the responsibility of living by our laws.

UPGRADE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego has become a world center for the biotechnology industry. In the 12 
years since I co-founded Hybritech, more than 70 companies have started here. 
</P>
<P>
The biotechnology industry is one that is built on strategic alliances with 
other U.S., European and Japanese companies. This requires our partners to 
visit us and us to visit them. In order for us to compete, we must have 
efficient air service. San Diego does not have a first-class airport, nor 
first-class air service. To get to any major city on the East Coast, Japan or 
Europe, one must always go through connections. This uses valuable time, and 
time is money. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is currently the leader in biotechnology, and if we are to 
stay that way and establish San Diego as a global industry center, we must make 
the decision today to upgrade our airport and air service. If we don't, this 
industry, which employs thousands of people and generates an ever-increasing 
tax base, will not be able to continue in this city and county. 
</P>
<P>
The decision-makers in this community must form a business plan to improve our 
air service and meet the travel demands of their constituents -- now. In a few 
years it will be too late.

The news media are blowing out of proportion gang happenings and painting the 
wrong picture of Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
For all the drive-by shootings, there are as many good things happening, such 
as the Regional Youth Center that provides summer jobs for the low-income 
families. The Palace, formerly called the Boys' Club, provides recreational 
activities and dance parties on the weekends. The Bandini Center is a 
continuation program that helps students make up classes.

Southeast San Diego is not always as the newspaper and TV describe it. I live 
there and I like it.

THE EMERGENCY OF PARAMEDIC USER FEES

<P>
Your photo (Jan. 30) showing the women being transported from the scene of an 
accident in Costa Mesa to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana via helicopter is a 
perfect example of the sad state of the health-care "system" in the county. 
</P>
<P>
If you are the unfortunate accident victim in the cities of Newport Beach, 
Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley, Westminster or Costa Mesa, it is likely that 
you will have to be flown to Santa Ana -- not only because we lack a trauma 
center here but also because the traffic system is too congested and 
unpredictable. So beware to all those who travel in the northwest section of 
the county!

THE EMERGENCY OF PARAMEDIC USER FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a paramedic/fireman for a department in Orange County. I live in an area 
serviced by Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Recently the Orange County Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance that would 
begin charging for paramedic services. In lieu of a charge for each use of the 
paramedic service they offered a subscription fee for an annual, unlimited use 
of these services. 
</P>
<P>
I feel that this is wrong for several reasons. Let's call it what it really is. 
A user tax. Another end run around Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Not all who use the service will pay or even be able to pay. Statistics have 
shown that other paramedic services have a collection rate as low as 50%. This 
will become an administrative nightmare. Early fire services used to be run and 
managed by private insurance companies. You paid for fire protection to an 
insurance company to protect your home or business. Each building had an 
identification plaque. If you had not paid and did not have an identification 
plaque, the building was often left to burn while fire companies sat in front 
and watched. We have come a long way since then and have realized our folly. 
Paramedic services, however, seem to be regressing back to that level of 
service. Oh, we will still respond and render aid, but eventually the level of 
service rendered will diminish for those who do not subscribe. That will happen 
despite the disclaimers from our politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County trauma system's days are numbered. Too many people used the 
service and didn't pay. Paramedic services are declining every day with 
reconfiguration of delivery systems. We cannot foresee when we will need these 
services. Accidents, fires and life-threatening medical problems can happen to 
anyone regardless of prosperity or ability to pay. When these services are 
needed you cannot shop around to get the best price. 
</P>
<P>
First-rate emergency medical services are expected and wanted by most Orange 
County residents. The emergency medical system has become a safety net to catch 
us when we have a heart attack, car accident or other medical emergency. 
Because our elected officials do not have the moral fiber to call a tax a tax 
and fund these programs, the very fiber of that safety net rots more and more 
every day. Some days that net catches us, but more and more often it is too 
weak to hold us and we fall through, dying or suffering needlessly.

PROTESTERS HOPE IRVINE MARCH WILL CLOSE THE 'OPEN SEASON' ON GAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN FARRELL, Kevin Farrell is co-chairman of the Orange County Visibility 
League, a lesbian and gay civil rights organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lesbians and gays will gather at Irvine City Hall at noon on Saturday to begin 
a peaceful march through the city. This march for lesbian and gay rights is a 
response to the controversial vote in November in favor of Measure N, which 
removed lesbians and gays from Irvine's Human Rights Ordinance. In effect, the 
voters of Irvine decided that the civil rights of lesbians and gays did not 
warrant protection. 
</P>
<P>
While statistics are unavailable, anecdotal evidence indicates that since the 
vote, there has been an increase in prejudicial incidents directed against 
lesbians and gays in Irvine. One recent example is the decision by the 
chancellor of UC Irvine to prohibit lesbian and gay couples from living in 
married students' housing. Just last weekend, an elected Orange County 
official, in referring to a group of gays and lesbians picketing a meeting he 
was attending, used a highly derogatory term in public to refer to the sexual 
orientation of the pickets. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, the passage of Measure N allowed much pent-up bigotry against 
lesbians and gays to surface, in effect giving people "permission" to vent 
their true feelings against us. 
</P>
<P>
While many of us in the lesbian and gay community are still angered and 
frustrated by the results of the Irvine vote, the voters of Irvine are not 
entirely to blame. In fact, I would contend that they were duped by a 
scurrilous campaign led by a small group of people who, for whatever reasons, 
have selected lesbians and gays as the target of their hate. 
</P>
<P>
These people were willing to go to any length in the Irvine campaign to ensure 
victory. They distributed campaign literature that was filled with 
misconceptions, half-truths and outright lies. They showed a video on Irvine 
public-access TV that equated lesbian and gay civil rights with child 
molestation, intentional transmission of the AIDS virus, bestiality and a 
wild-eyed plot to gain control of the U.S. political system. They stated that 
allowing the words sexual orientation to remain in the Human Rights Ordinance 
would eventually mean hiring quotas for lesbian and gay teachers, as well as 
rampant same-sex couplings in Irvine parks and streets. 
</P>
<P>
The information they chose to impart to Irvine voters in a smear campaign of 
hate and fear would be laughable were it not done in so deadly serious a manner 
and had it not elicited the response from the electorate that it did. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine voters were not alone in being fooled by right-wing demagoguery against 
lesbians and gays in November. In Akron, Ohio, and Tacoma, Wash., lesbian and 
gay rights measures similar to Irvine's were also repealed, after like-minded 
campaigns appealing to voters' basest instincts. 
</P>
<P>
In Contra Costa County, Concord voters repealed an AIDS anti-discrimination 
measure, and San Francisco voted to prevent its City Council-passed "domestic 
partners" measure from going into effect. The literature distributed in each of 
those campaigns bore remarkable similarities to that used in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But lesbians and gays do not need to compare hate-filled campaign literature to 
know that we are the targets of a sophisticated, well-financed and coordinated 
campaign to prevent us from exercising our civil rights. We are feeling the 
sting of discrimination keenly all over the United States, and it hurts. 
</P>
<P>
From gay killings in Maine to gay-bashing judges in Texas, and on to the ballot 
boxes in California, the right wing has made it clear that we are public enemy 
No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
We are attacked by bigots cloaked in the guise of so-called "Christian" 
morality, who claim that we will seduce children and destroy value systems. 
They say we are anti-family and against "traditional" values. Do they forget 
that we came from families, that we are children, sisters, brothers, aunts, 
uncles, parents and grandparents? Can they deny that we respect the most 
important traditional values in America: justice, love and peace? 
</P>
<P>
In fact, we want nothing more than to be left in peace -- with our rights. 
</P>
<P>
When we petition for our civil rights, or demand inclusion in measures such as 
Irvine's, we are not asking for special rights, or anything that other 
Americans do not enjoy. We are asking for protection of our civil rights 
because they are at risk. Because there are people who would deny us our civil 
rights, we need protection. 
</P>
<P>
For a variety of reasons, many people find lesbians and gays very threatening, 
so they have made us a target. And their tactics have worked well. Many of us 
are so afraid of the consequences in housing, employment, medical care and 
family life that we are unwilling to come out of our closets. Who can blame us 
when we are greeted by people who remind us that we are better off dead? 
</P>
<P>
We have also been targeted because we are at our most vulnerable today, with 
millions of us affected by the crisis of AIDS, a crisis that we have been made 
scapegoats for, even as we alone have cared for our sick and dying when no one 
else would help. At the same time, in California, we have had to fight punitive 
measures targeted against people affected by AIDS, such as Propositions 64, 69, 
96 and 102, which have drained us financially and emotionally. We have been 
attacked time and again by politicians seeking to raise money and garner 
followers. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, we are singled out for hate: No one would dare circulate petitions to 
have African-Americans or Asians removed from a human rights ordinance. No 
self-respecting minister would consider attacking any other minority from a 
church's pulpit. But, when it comes to lesbians and gays, it's open hunting 
season. 
</P>
<P>
When we gather on the steps of City Hall in Irvine next Saturday, our actions 
will not be directed against the voters of Irvine. Many of them -- more than 
10,000, as well as the mayor and members of the City Council -- offered their 
support. Our actions will be directed at the mentality that finds lesbians and 
gays worthy only of contempt, hate and fear. 
</P>
<P>
We will be marching for our rights and against a small minority that 
successfully manipulated the electoral process in November. The voters of 
Irvine, Concord, San Francisco or any other electorate cannot take our civil 
rights away. We have our rights. They are not negotiable.

popularity. I believe, however, the comments that 20% of all women develop 
complications, thus leading to a transfer and Cesarean section, are misleading. 
</P>
<P>
In a study on the safety of birthing centers (Dec. 28, the New England Journal 
of Medicine) the total transfer rate was 15.8%, but the total Cesarean rate was 
only 4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The use of unnecessary interventions and misused technology caused 
complications leading to a Cesarean section for the birth of my first child. 
When pregnant a second time, I traveled over an hour to give birth naturally 
with no interventions. In the United States, the Cesarean rate can reach higher 
than 35% in some hospitals. Perhaps this trend toward out-of-hospital births 
can reduce Cesareans to a normal and acceptable rate.

I really hate to complain; the Times is usually so sensitive to societal 
improvements such as inclusive language, but it cannot be passed by that you 
used the term "lawmen" (Jan. 23) in the article about the planned drug training 
center. 
</P>
<P>
It's a cute word if you're thinking of Matt Dillon and the days of "Gunsmoke." 
But it does discount police officers who happen to be women and who, I assume, 
would be students at the training center. Or, will they?

CESAREAN FIGURES ON HOSPITAL TRANSFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The timely article on birthing centers (Jan.21) failed to mention some of the 
most interesting and significant results found in the recent Columbia 
University study of 11,814 women in 84 free-standing birth centers throughout 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is true that childbirth can be fraught with life-endangering 
complications that require immediate medical attention, it is interesting to 
note that the (Columbia) study found that only 7.9% of the mothers or their 
infants developed any serious emergency complications during or soon after 
birth -- with less than half of these requiring transfer to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
And while mothers were transferred on a non-emergency basis, the overall 
Cesarean-section rate was only 4.4% (our nation's Cesarean rate is currently 
about 25%). The overall neonatal mortality rate was 1.3 per 1,000 births -- 
similar to those reported in large studies of low-risk hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the American obstetricians and gynecologists will always be critical 
of birth centers -- about 80% of them are staffed by midwives. In our culture, 
medical doctors dominate childbirth and this is how they prefer it. Childbirth 
is a business just like everything else in our country. It is time for parents 
to become wise consumers.

SALARY OFFER FOR TUSTIN TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You, along with the citizens of the Tustin Unified School District, are 
probably asking why we, the teachers of Tustin Unified School District, are not 
happy with the current salary offer. Very simply, 12 years ago we were paid 
comparatively with teachers of other school districts. Today we are among the 
lowest paid teachers in the county. 
</P>
<P>
What is being offered us is a salary increase to maintain that low pay status 
(even though the district is fifth in daily attendance revenue among unified 
districts in Orange County). 
</P>
<P>
What we want is to be paid comparatively with other teachers of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
For years, other districts put teachers' economic needs first instead of last. 
Tustin has essentially put teachers' needs last in the budget process. Over the 
past decade, the loss each year has accumulated to put Tustin teachers at least 
20% behind. Teachers cannot afford to be patient any longer. The penalty for 
teaching in Tustin currently ranges from $6,000 to $13,000 annually. Teachers 
wishing to retire will lose $300 per month for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Until the philosophy changes, the best teachers will not come to Tustin; nor 
will they stay very long.

<P>
Mike Lanier is the tallest player in college basketball and the tallest twin in 
the world. He's used to being the center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
But never like this. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier is turning heads at more than 80 universities, where recruiters promise 
to stitch a custom uniform to fit his 7-foot-6 frame. 
</P>
<P>
He is leaving Hardin-Simmons University at the end of the season because the 
small Baptist school in West Texas decided to drop its basketball program from 
NCAA Division I status next year. 
</P>
<P>
The school that lands Lanier also will have to remodel his dorm room, raise the 
shower head and build him a special bed. And when the team travels by air, 
they'll have to make sure Lanier sits alone in a first class row or at least 
gets the seat by the emergency exit. It has more leg room. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier, who weighs 285 pounds, is just a tad taller than twin brother Jim, who 
plays for the University of Denver. They're identical in weight and appearance, 
though Mike is a better basketball player. The Guinness Book of World Records 
lists them as the world's tallest twins. 
</P>
<P>
Hardin-Simmons Coach Dennis Harp said he gets an average of five calls a day 
regarding his 20-year-old center, who stands 7-7 when he dons his sneakers and 
can dunk the ball without jumping. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's one from Drake," Harp said, flipping through pink call-back messages on 
his desk. "UCLA, another from Kansas State. N.C. State. Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'll probably have two or three more at my house when I get home tonight. 
And every last one of them wants to know about Mike." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows him better than Harp, the only Division I coach who offered Lanier 
a scholarship when he graduated from high school in Troy, Mich., two years, 20 
pounds and 2 inches ago. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Lanier was another undiscovered, uncoordinated big center. 
</P>
<P>
Hardin-Simmons Athletic Director Merlin Morrow, who has supervised strenuous 
agility drills for Lanier, said Lanier's rampant growth rate had outstripped 
his body's ability to keep up in muscle development and coordination. 
</P>
<P>
Already as tall as Manute Bol of the Golden State Warriors, the tallest man in 
the NBA, Lanier said he could grow a few more inches by his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
But his growth has been stopped for a year now, and that has allowed him to 
improve his game dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to keep adjusting my shot every time I grow," Lanier said. "I hope this 
is it. I don't need to get any taller." 
</P>
<P>
Lanier is averaging 7.5 points, 4.4 rebounds and 1.2 blocked shots, a modest 
output, but considerably better than last season, when he averaged 2.1 points, 
1.7 rebounds and fewer than 10 minutes in 14 games. He blocked seven shots as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
But observers say that because of his height and stubborn work ethic, Lanier 
could develop into an effective professional player, much like Utah Jazz center 
Mark Eaton, who scored only 53 points in his final two college seasons at UCLA 
but since has emerged as one of the foremost defensive players in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
One college coach who saw Eaton as a sophomore at Cypress College, recently 
visited Hardin-Simmons to see Lanier. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is farther along at this stage than Eaton was," said the coach, who asked 
not to be identified because he is recruiting Lanier. "Mike is a little more 
mobile and has a little more skill in his shooting touch." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lanier "won't ever run down any rabbits, he will always have an impact 
on every game he plays simply because of his size," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the numbers are deceiving, said Harp, suggesting that if there were such 
a statistic as affecting an opponent's shot, Lanier would be the clear 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching films, you notice that he alters his man's shot at least eight times 
a game, forces them to try something they usually don't do," he said. "When you 
can do that, you're awesome." 
</P>
<P>
No explanation exists for the Lanier twins' size. Both were 7-4 by their 
sophomore year in high school, and medical tests reveal no abnormalities, 
Lanier said. 
</P>
<P>
Their father is 6-3 and their mother 6-1. But they have a 5-6 sister and a 5-9 
brother. Lanier jokes that he used to think his mother "might have taken some 
kind of growth pill when she was pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
Lanier has never had a car, because he doesn't fit in them. His parents had to 
tear the middle seat out of the family van in high school so that Mike and Jim 
could fit in the back and not have to walk everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Hardin-Simmons had to remodel Lanier's dorm room, building a 7 1/2-foot bed, 
raising the ceiling and lowering the floor in his shower. 
</P>
<P>
"And the shower head still hits me in the chest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He cannot work out at Hardin-Simmons' weight room because the angles of 
adjustment on the equipment are mismatched for his height, and the university 
has no free weights. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier, who would be eligible to play immediately after his transfer, hopes to 
redshirt a year so his skills can catch up to his height. And a key to 
improving his agility and strength are good weight training facilities. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to announce his choice of schools in late March. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will have a tall order to fill: Lanier doesn't want to play a 
run-and-gun offense. "I can't play for a fast team," he said. "My body won't 
let me." 
</P>
<P>
Lanier, who said he "used to hate being this tall," now describes his enormous 
height as "a burden that's becoming a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
"I realize I got a shot to play pro ball, if only I can find the right college 
program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier said he's looking forward to the summer, when he will hit the weights 
again and play some one-on-one with his twin. "That's my favorite game," he 
said, "one-on-one with Jim. He's the only one I can find that's my size."

FRIGID-SHOOTING UCLA FALTERS UP FRONT, 83-74

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's most glaring weakness is its lack of a powerful center. Usually, 
however, the Bruins are able to compensate. 
</P>
<P>
But when they make only 39.2% of their shots, as they did Saturday in an 83-74 
loss to Arizona in front of 13,627 in the McKale Center, their weaknesses 
magnify. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona extended the nation's longest home winning streak to 44 games and 
handed UCLA its fourth loss in its last six road games. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who dropped into third place in the Pacific 10 Conference, hadn't 
shot so poorly since their opener Nov. 25, when they made 37.3% of their shots 
in a 66-62 victory over Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well, but we had enough (open) shots to do what we needed to 
do," Coach Jim Harrick said. "They just didn't fall." 
</P>
<P>
If they had, UCLA might not have fallen behind so quickly in the second half 
and been forced to abandon a zone defense that contained the Wildcats' front 
line last month in a 73-67 Bruin victory at Pauley Pavilion. And Arizona's 
7-foot Ed Stokes, 6-11 Brian Williams and 6-11 reserve Sean Rooks might not 
have combined for 50 points, 25 rebounds and 66.7% shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Rooks made eight of 12 shots, scoring a career-high 24 points and taking nine 
rebounds in only 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big, strong horse," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
But last month at UCLA, the sophomore from Fontana made one of six shots, 
scored four points and took three rebounds in 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to play more intense than I have at times this season," said 
Rooks, who has been the target of Coach Lute Olson's wrath more than once and 
indicated two months ago that he might transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I get down on myself, but I knew I had to take it up another level." 
</P>
<P>
Olson rotated his big men in the lineup, keeping them fresh, and Williams 
responded by scoring 12 points in 22 minutes. Stokes had 14 points and nine 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to play them when their big men are on," UCLA's Don MacLean said. 
"They have so many of them. They keep rotating them in and out. They were 
fresh. And maybe we were a little tired." 
</P>
<P>
MacLean and point guard Darrick Martin were the only effective Bruins. MacLean 
scored 26 points and took 14 rebounds; Martin scored 14 points and had seven 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
But MacLean, after scoring 17 points in the first half, faced a box-and-one 
defense in the second and was held without a point during a 17-4 run by Arizona 
that wiped out a one-point Bruin lead and put the Wildcats ahead to stay, 
52-39, with 12:15 left. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through, Harrick switched to a man-to-man defense in an effort to change 
the tempo and spark the Bruins, but Arizona maintained its advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats were able to concentrate on stopping MacLean, assigning Jud 
Buechler to tail him, because starters Trevor Wilson, Tracy Murray and Gerald 
Madkins were a combined nine of 38 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Madkins missed all six of his attempts and center Murray, who had made 61.3% of 
his shots since moving into the starting lineup last month, missed 14 of 18. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to keep shooting, so I kept shooting," said Murray, who missed 
six of eight three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson scored 12 points, but 11 came after Arizona had built its 13-point 
second-half lead. He missed his first seven shots before scoring on a tip-in 
with 10:45 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed in myself," said Wilson, who collided with Stokes in the 
first half and had a welt under his left eye afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really disappointing. We had a chance to win, but we didn't execute." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona made 42.4% of its attempts. But Buechler, despite making only five of 
18 shots, scored 17 points and took 13 rebounds. And Matt Othick, who made only 
one of eight shots, had eight assists and no turnovers despite playing on 
sprained ankles. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Arizona improved to 16-4 overall and 10-3 in the Pac-10, moving into second 
place behind Oregon State, which will risk its 10-1 conference record against 
Oregon today at Corvallis, Ore. UCLA is 16-5 and 9-3. . . . No team has made 
more than 47.3% of its shots against Arizona, which has limited its opponents 
to 39% shooting. "To go through 20 games without anybody (shooting) over 50% is 
testimony to the fact that our guys work very hard and that you're going to 
have to do some other things to beat us," Wildcat Coach Lute Olson said. . . . 
Arizona's top big men -- Ed Stokes, Brian Williams and Sean Rooks -- are from 
Southern California. Stokes is from Playa del Rey; Williams is from Santa 
Monica and Rooks is from Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
Don MacLean's 26 points increased his career total to 1,003 in 52 games. Only 
two Bruins, Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton, reached 1,000 points faster. . . . In 
UCLA's last seven games, MacLean is averaging 21.9 points and 11.9 rebounds. . 
. . Said Arizona's Jud Buechler, who guarded All-American Danny Ferry of Duke 
last season: "I don't want to say (MacLean is) at that level yet, but he's 
similar." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, on the Bruins: "I don't want to say they're haughty or arrogant 
because they're a good bunch of guys, but once they step on the basketball 
court, it seems at times they get very emotional and borderline defensive."

Former USC star and Philadelphia 76er Cliff Robinson runs Cliff's Night Club 
&amp; Cafe in Berkeley while recovering from knee surgery. But Robinson, 30, 
doesn't feel totally detached from the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a TV here in my club, and we were open for happy hour, and I'm laying 
back watching the local news," Robinson said. "It was Chicago against Portland, 
in Portland, and they're showing the highlights. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy says Michael Jordan does such-and-such, and now Portland has the ball, 
and (Clyde) Drexler throws it to so-and-so, who throws it to Cliff Robinson, 
the Bay Area's own, and he slams it through!" 
</P>
<P>
"I said to my son, 'This guy sure keeps my name alive if nothing else.' It was 
really weird. It was like I was watching a ghost on TV or something." 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers' Cliff Robinson is a rookie from the University of 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The Lakers have three starters on the Western Conference All-Star 
team. When was the last time that both conferences had three starters from one 
team? 
</P>
<P>
Life in the fast lane: K.C. Jones, assistant coach for the Seattle SuperSonics, 
on the pressures facing high-paid rookies in the NBA: "It's like you win the 
lottery for $2 million. The money comes to you and what happens? All the 
salesmen in the world come up to you and want to sell you everything they've 
got; here come the cocaine guys, here come all the women, the cars, the 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to deal with all that. You have to keep that stuff in 
perspective and keep your feet on the ground. Immaturity is found out quickly 
in this league." 
</P>
<P>
Work is never done: Gene Littles of the Charlotte Hornets, on his duties as 
coach: "In the NBA, you do everything, even when you coach. You scout as a 
coach. You're an administrator, you have to budget. You might have the title of 
one position but you do a combination of things. When you sign a contract it 
might read in bold 'assistant coach' or 'director of personnel.' But there's 
always that small print that says 'and other related duties.' " 
</P>
<P>
Turn the page: Calvin Murphy, who made an NBA-record 78 consecutive free throws 
during the 1980-81 season, is candid about his feelings toward the Boston 
Celtics' Larry Bird, who has made 68 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want Larry Bird to break my record. That's my legacy to my son," 
Murphy said. "When you look in the Guinness Book of World Records and see your 
face there, that's a nice feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Talk like an Egyptian: Jerry Reynolds, the Sacramento Kings' director of player 
personnel, on the Lakers' Magic Johnson: "When I first heard about him in 
college as a 6-9 point guard, I said, 'Oh, b.s. You're saying he's a point 
guard, but he really isn't.' Then I saw him, and he really was a point guard. 
It was like seeing the Pyramids for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Add Magic: John Stockton of the Utah Jazz, who leads the NBA in assists, on 
Johnson: "If every team could find a Magic, all of us 6-footers would be out of 
the league." 
</P>
<P>
Nice place to visit: Washington Bullet center Mel Turpin on playing for 
Zaragoza of Spain last season: "It was good to see that part of the world, but 
I couldn't take it for two years. There are some teams that take care of their 
American players, but I wasn't on one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Single-minded: Dave Pritchett, scout for the Minnesota Timberwolves, told 
Patrick Reusse of the Star Tribune in Minneapolis: "People say I'm different. 
If that means getting out of the bed in the morning thinking about basketball, 
and falling asleep at night thinking about basketball, they're right." 
</P>
<P>
Cornered market: Buck Williams on being traded by the New Jersey Nets to the 
Portland Trail Blazers: "In Portland, we're the only game in town. The players 
are revered. My family is treated like royalty." 
</P>
<P>
Sticky situation: Dick Motta, coach of the Sacramento Kings, on owning the 
Bluebird Candy Co. of Logan, Utah: "They really are great candies. But running 
that operation makes basketball look almost simple." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: In 1977, the Philadelphia 76ers had Julius Erving, George 
McGinnis and Doug Collins, while the Denver Nuggets had Bobby Jones, David 
Thompson and Dan Issel. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Golden State Warrior guard Sarunas Marciulionis on his first NBA 
season: "Life in America is no problem. I can give more energy to basketball 
here. In Lithuania it takes a lot of energy to get things, like food." GARR

over Portland Saturday night at Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Holbert scored 24 points and Thomas had 14 for the Toreros (12-10, 7-3 in the

LOYOLA GETS ITS USUAL BURSTS, ITS USUAL VICTORY, 139-110, OVER ST. MARY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
MORAGA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola Marymount, an explosion waiting to happen for much of the weekend, 
caught fire in the second half Saturday and burned St. Mary's, 139-110. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, who looked sluggish and were soundly outrebounded in a victory over 
the University of San Francisco on Friday, trailed the Gaels midway through the 
first half. Loyola had one of its characteristic bursts late in the half and 
put the game out of reach with a decisive 75-58 second half. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, before a McKeon Pavilion sellout crowd of 3,500, raised Loyola's 
record to 19-4 overall and 10-0 in the West Coast Conference, where the Lions 
have a three-game lead over Pepperdine and San Diego with four games to play. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's (6-16, 3-7) was missing two starters due to injury and started a 
lineup averaging fewer points than Loyola's Bo Kimble. Three St. Mary's 
starters fouled out in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions set McKeon Pavilion records for points in a game and in a half. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble scored 33 points. Hank Gathers added 30 points and 13 rebounds. Terrell 
Lowery scored 23 points and Jeff Fryer had 19. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers' points tied him with former USF center Bill Cartwright for career 
scoring in conference games with 1,065 points. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola controlled the rebounding, 71-49, and had 30 offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We were actually colliding with each other on some offensive rebounds," Lion 
Coach Paul Westhead said. "That's a good sign when that's happening. And some 
of Hank's rebounds, it's a good thing they have a high ceiling here. When he 
goes after the ball with that kind of energy, it transmits to the whole team." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola built a 12-2 lead in the opening minutes, but St. Mary's depleted lineup 
handled the ball well, with only seven first-half turnovers. The Gaels tied the 
game, 20-20, and took a 43-40 lead with 5:15 to play in the half when sophomore 
Andre Durity hit a three-pointer. The sophomore guard out of Fairfax High, a 
last-minute addition to the starting lineup, scored 20 points in the first half 
and finished with 22. 
</P>
<P>
That seemed to awaken the Lions, who scored the next nine points and went on a 
24-9 tear on the way to a 64-52 halftime lead. Kimble had 23 points the 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's pulled to within nine in the second half, but the Lions got a 39-19 
run in the next 8 1/2 minutes to put the game away. They led, 106-77, with 9:45 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our guys were playing pretty sharp from the beginning," Westhead 
said. "I told the guys at halftime, even though it was close, we were playing 
well. I had no problems with our (early) performance. Credit St. Mary's for 
keeping it close."

SYRACUSE'S QUICK START FINISHES CONNECTICUT WIN STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Syracuse got off to a quick start and Connecticut finished strong, but the 
sixth-ranked Orangemen emerged from Saturday's Big East Conference game with a 
90-86 victory at Syracuse, N.Y., before a Carrier Dome record crowd of 32,820. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Derrick Coleman scored a career-high 29 points as Syracuse avenged last 
month's 70-59 loss in Hartford, Conn. The Orangemen, who ended the Huskies' 
10-game winning streak, have won six consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
"We really got out to a good start and that's what we had to do against this 
team," said Syracuse forward Stephen Thompson, who added 19 points. "Last time 
we came out slow and we never did get going. This time we wanted to come out 
fired up and do the job right." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Owens, who scored 21 points for Syracuse, said: "I think we kind of 
shocked them a little bit. We wanted to get out to a big start on them early, 
because when we get that kind of jump early, it's hard for anybody to catch up 
to us." 
</P>
<P>
But No. 8 Connecticut almost did. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse led, 81-71, with 2:10 to play, but the Huskies chipped away down the 
stretch. Syracuse made 17 of 22 free throws over the final seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"About a month ago when we beat Syracuse, people asked me what was wrong with 
Syracuse," said Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun. "I said, 'Nothing. Syracuse is a 
great basketball team.' Tonight, they put us in a hole early, and they didn't 
let us out of that hole. And we're not an easy team to keep in such a hole." 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse is 18-3, 7-3 in the Big East. Connecticut (20-4, 7-3) was led by Chris 
Smith's 25 points, all in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Missouri 107, Nebraska 85 -- Doug Smith scored 44 points, including 12 in 
a 23-9 run beginning the second half, as the Tigers won their 29th consecutive 
home game. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 6-foot-10 senior whose previous career high was 32, fell just two 
points shy of Missouri's single-game record. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (22-2, 8-1 in the Big Eight Conference), whose top ranking fell into 
jeopardy Thursday night with a 65-58 loss at Kansas State, appeared listless in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith scored six of the first eight points in the second half to help turn 
a close game into a rout. The Huskers (9-12, 2-6), who earlier in the week 
snapped a 17-game road losing streak with a 91-82 victory at Colorado, were led 
by Rich King with 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Kansas 88, Iowa State 83 -- Kevin Pritchard scored 18 points and the 
Jayhawks took advantage of a four-point play late in the game to move into 
position for a return to the top of the national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (24-1, 7-1 in the Big Eight) had to survive a shaky final minute to 
break a six-game losing streak at Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
Four other players scored in double figures for Kansas, which hosts Missouri on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State (7-13 and 2-6) lost for the seventh time by five points or less. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas was clinging to an 82-81 lead when Mark Randall was fouled by Brian 
Pearson as Jeff Gueldner hit a jump shot from the top of the key. Randall made 
both free throws for an 86-81 lead with 1:03 left and the Jayhawks held on. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor 82, No. 3 Arkansas 77 -- David Wesley scored eight of his 23 points in 
the final two minutes at Waco, Tex., as the Bears avenged an earlier 99-84 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor's victory also snapped a 12-game Arkansas winning streak and handed the 
Razorbacks their first loss in the Southwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley, who missed 11 games because of a stress fracture of the right leg 
before returning on Wednesday against Texas, hit six free throws and got a 
basket off a steal in the closing minutes. For the game, Wesley hit 12 of 12 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied, 70-70, before Wesley took charge. The Hogs scored only two 
baskets in the final 3:07. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas was led by Lee Mayberry, who had 16 points. Todd Day, who was 
averaging 20 points, was held to nine. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas dropped to 20-3 and 11-1 in the SWC. Baylor is 13-9 and 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Duke 114, Maryland 111 -- Phil Henderson scored nine of his 26 points in 
overtime after the Blue Devils had to rally from an 11-point deficit in the 
final five minutes of regulation at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Duke (18-4, 8-2 in the Atlantic Coast Conference) came back from a 103-102 
deficit in overtime with seven consecutive points, four by Henderson and three 
by Alaa Abelnaby, with 1:16 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
After Jerrod Mustaf, who scored a career-high 35 points for Maryland, converted 
a three-point play eight seconds later, Christian Laettner hit the front end of 
a one-and-one free throw opportunity to give Duke a 110-106 lead with 42 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Laettner led Duke with 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
Evers Burns then made a layin with 31 seconds left to get Maryland within 
110-108, but Henderson made two free throws two seconds later and Bobby Hurley 
sank two more to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland, which lost for the 11th time in 12 games to Duke, dropped to 13-10 
and 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
No. 5 Georgetown 56, Florida 40 -- Alonzo Mourning scored 10 of his 14 points 
during a 16-1 first-half run to lead the Hoyas in a nonconference game at 
Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown (19-2) has won four consecutive games. Undermanned and undersized 
Florida (6-13) has not won since Jan. 13, dropping eight in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown trailed 9-1 and 15-10 before rallying behind Mourning to take a 
26-16 halftime lead. The Hoyas, who got 15 points from Mark Tillmon, never let 
the lead slip below nine points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey Poole scored 12 points for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
No. 11 Louisiana State 119, Tennessee 113 -- Chris Jackson scored 49 points at 
Knoxville, Tenn., including 10 three-point baskets, as the Tigers took over 
first place in the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson scored 17 points in a 31-13 run midway through the second half as LSU 
(19-4, 9-3) broke away from a 61-61 tie to take a 92-74 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Houston scored 43 points for Tennessee (12-9, 7-5). The Volunteers fought 
back to within 112-106 on a three-point basket by Greg Bell with 1:49 to play, 
but could get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 La Salle 99, Manhattan 78 -- Lionel Simmons scored a career-high 40 
points and moved past Elvin Hayes into eighth place on the NCAA scoring list in 
a Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference game at New York. 
</P>
<P>
La Salle (19-1, 10-0) never trailed in opening a 45-38 halftime lead. The 
Explorers pulled away with 16 consecutive points, seven by Simmons, that made 
the score 66-42 with 13:43 to play. Manhattan dropped to 9-13 and 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
No. 16 Georgia Tech 94, No. 15 Louisville 84 -- Kenny Anderson scored four 
points and had four assists in a 17-7 run to open the second half as the 
visiting Yellow Jackets remained unbeaten outside the Atlantic Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech (16-4) made 21 of 29 field goals in the second half (72%), after 
hitting only 14 of 34 (41%) in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Scott led Georgia Tech with 30 points and Anderson finished with 29 
points, 12 assists and eight rebounds. LaBradford Smith scored 23 points for 
Louisville (18-5). 
</P>
<P>

Kirk Manns 24 as the Spartans hit seven consecutive field goals down the 
stretch in a Big Ten Conference game at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State (19-5, 8-3) made 14 of 23 shots from the field in the second 
half and finished 28 of 53 for 53%. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State, led by Mark Baker's 19 points, fell to 11-10 and 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 St. John's 83, Villanova 69 -- Boo Harvey scored 27 points for the 
Redmen, who have won two consecutive games after losing three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Malik Sealy added 22 points for St. John's (19-6, 7-4), which has a solid grip 
on fourth place in the Big East after the home victory. Greg Woodard led 
Villanova (13-12, 5-7) with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Indiana 98, Northwestern 75 -- Eric Anderson scored 26 points to lead 
the Hoosiers in a Big Ten game at Bloomington, Ind.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
EAST 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 117, Providence 102 -- The Panthers' Brian Shorter scored 34 points 
and was perfect on his 11 field goal attempts at Pittsburgh to set a Big East 
record for field goal percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh's 117 points were a league record and marked the most points ever 
scored against Providence (12-8, 5-6). Connecticut owned the Big East 
single-game record with 113 points against Seton Hall in 1982. The 219 combined 
points scored also was a league record. The Panthers are 10-11 and 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MIDWEST 
</P>
<P>
Wichita State 68, Drake 62 -- John Cooper scored 22 of his 25 points in the 
second half, including the go-ahead basket with 1:38 left, as the Shockers 
rallied at Des Moines, Iowa, and spoiled the debut of the Bulldogs' replacement 
coach, Eddie Fields. 
</P>
<P>
It was Drake's first game since a player revolt resulted in the ouster of Coach 
Tom Abatemarco earlier in the week. The Drake players boycotted practice for 
two days, then said they no longer would play for Abatemarco, complaining he 
was too harsh with them. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin 80, Iowa 71 -- Larry Hisle, Jr., and Brian Good, two low-scoring 
guards, combined for 34 points as the Badgers ended a 15-game losing streak in 
Iowa City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin, which shot 77% from the field in the first half, is 12-12 and 3-9 in 
the Big Ten. Iowa fell to 11-10 and 3-8. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOUTH 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 74, Virginia 63 -- Center Elden Campbell tied a career-high with 29 
points as the Tigers won their 20th consecutive home game. Clemson improved to 
18-5 and 6-3 in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Virginia dropped to 14-7 and 
3-6. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State 80, DePaul 71 -- Rodney Monroe scored 22 points and 
combined with Brian Howard for the Wolfpack's first 20 points in the second 
half in a nonconference game at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State is 17-6 and DePaul is 13-11. 
</P>

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
CS LONG BEACH OVERPOWERED BY NO. 3 NEVADA LAS VEGAS, 92-62 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas took control of the Big West Conference women's basketball 
race by defeating Cal State Long Beach for the second time this season, 92-62, 
Saturday night at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Twins Pauline and Geannine Jordan scored 21 and 17 points respectively, for the 
third-ranked Rebels (21-1, 13-0 in the Big West). 
</P>
<P>
UNLV outrebounded the 49ers, 56-47, with Pauline Jordan, who became the first 
UNLV player to collect 1,000 rebounds, grabbing 20 and Geannine Jordan adding 
10. 
</P>
<P>
Four other UNLV players scored in double figures, as the Rebels swept the 
season series from the 49ers for the first time. Senior Angelique Lee scored 21 
points for the 49ers (17-5, 10-2). 
</P>
<P>
Washington 81, Stanford 78 -- Laurie Merlino scored eight of her 22 points in 
the final 1:43 at Seattle as the No. 7 Huskies gave the second-ranked Cardinal 
its first loss. 
</P>
<P>
Playing before a sellout crowd of 7,704, Merlino's 15-foot jump shot with 1:43 
to play broke a 73-73 tie. The junior guard scored a layup with 57 seconds 
remaining and converted four free throws in the final 14 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 69-59, Stanford staged a 14-2 rally to go ahead, 73-71, with 2:31 
remaining. Jennifer Azzi was fouled on a successful three-pointer and converted 
the free throw and Katy Steding followed with a three-pointer to give the 
Cardinal its final lead, 73-71. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's Amy Mickelson led all scorers with 24 points, as the Huskies 
(19-2, 10-1) moved into a first-place tie with Stanford (20-1, 10-1) in the 
Pacific 10 Conference. The loss halted a 28-game conference winning streak for 
the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford was led by Trisha Stevens with 21 points.

ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP GIVES GOOD GRADES TO MOST AREA LAWMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz was praised for introducing legislation to protect 
mountain lions. State Sen. Alan Robbins got kudos for authoring a bill to 
require that cosmetics tested on animals be so labeled. And Assemblyman Tom 
Bane was cited for steering pro-animal legislation to a friendly legislative 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
They were among the San Fernando Valley-area legislators given A ratings 
recently by PAW PAC, a San Francisco-based political action committee that 
backs state legislators sympathetic to animal rights. 
</P>
<P>
In its yearly "report card" on state lawmakers, PAW PAC gave A's to every 
Democratic senator and assembly member representing part of the Valley: Sens. 
Gary Hart, who represents Woodland Hills; Robbins of Tarzana; David Roberti of 
Hollywood; Herschel Rosenthal of Los Angeles; and Assemblymen Bane of Van Nuys; 
Terry Friedman of Sherman Oaks; Katz of Sylmar, and Burt Margolin of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The only Republican to fare well was state Sen. Ed Davis of Valencia, who got a 
B. Assembly members Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks and Cathie Wright of Simi 
Valley wound up with F's, while Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette of 
Northridge received a D. 
</P>
<P>
PAW PAC's ratings were based on legislators' votes last year on 14 
animal-related bills, including ones involving elephant abuse, caging of veal 
calves, tougher penalties for cockfighting and a ban on so-called puppy mills. 
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1980, PAW PAC has about 5,000 members statewide, said Virginia 
Handley, PAW PAC's legislative director. Its board of directors features 
several prominent figures in the animal-rights movement, including Laurence W. 
Kessenick, a founder of the Animal Legal Defense Fund, and Gladys Sargent, a 
longtime animal-rights activist and part-owner of the Los Angeles Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to most PACs, which represent businesses and professional associations 
and contribute huge amounts of money to state legislators, PAW PAC has little 
financial clout, having contributed only $25,000 over the past 10 years. 
Nonetheless, it represents an increasing involvement in mainstream politics by 
the often-militant animal-rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole movement is getting a lot more politically active in legislatures in 
all the states," Handley said. "After you spend time in the Legislature you see 
how important it is to publish voting charts so people can see what legislators 
are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Handley said Robbins received an A and a "paw of appreciation" for introducing 
a bill that would have required that labels indicate whether cosmetics and 
household products sold in California had been tested on animals. 
</P>
<P>
The bill failed during the last legislative session, but Handley said Robbins 
plans to introduce a version this year that would remove the labeling 
requirement but require manufacturers to tell consumers who inquired if the 
products were animal-tested. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbins is exceptional in that he thinks up legislation himself," Handley 
said. "It's not that we have to go to him and ask him to do something." 
</P>
<P>
She also praised Katz for introducing an unsuccessful bill to protect mountain 
lions and later working on behalf of a statewide wildlife initiative that 
includes mountain lion protections. 
</P>
<P>
Bane, the powerful chairman of the Assembly Rules Committee, got kudos for 
steering a bill involving veal-calf cages to the Assembly's Public Safety 
Committee, rather than the Agriculture Committee. The bill would prohibit 
chaining veal calves by the neck and require that their cages be large enough 
to enable them to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
Handley said shifting the bill from the Agriculture Committee was helpful 
because "that's dominated by interests that wouldn't want the bill to pass. We 
got a fairer hearing in the Public Safety Committee." 
</P>
<P>
Handley said McClintock was rated F because he worked to defeat a bill that 
would have banned two types of animal tests, the Lethal Dose 50 and Draize 
eye-irritation tests, for cosmetics and household products. 
</P>
<P>
Under Lethal Dose 50, animals are force-fed products until half of them die. 
The Draize test involves filling animals' eyes with cosmetics and household 
products to see if they are damaged, she said. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock said he was proud of his leading role in defeating the test bill, 
which he said was opposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
California Medical Assn. and U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"That bill literally put the safety of lab rats ahead of the safety of 
toddlers," McClintock said. "That bill literally said you may not test baby 
lotion or skin lotion on lab rats before you test it on the skin of a baby." 
</P>
<P>
McClintock's low rating also was based on no-votes or abstentions on five other 
animal bills, but he said most of them were "drafted with the same principle in 
mind, that lab rats should be protected above infants."

CALIFORNIA CITY -- A DREAM IN PROGRESS; 
</P>
<P>
MOJAVE DESERT: THE SPACE AND THE EXPECTATIONS HAVE BEEN THERE FOR 30 YEARS. BUT 
REALITY HAS NOT CAUGHT UP WITH THE PLAN. AMERICA'S 11TH LARGEST CITY HAS ONLY 
6,500 RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California City was to be the city of the future. A big future. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired 30 years ago by the explosive development of the San Fernando Valley, 
the city was designed to catch the human overflow as it crept northward into 
the Mojave Desert. It was the dream project of a man who could not be accused 
of dreaming small. When California City incorporated in 1965 it became -- and 
still is -- the third largest city in area in the state. It is the 11th largest 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
To appreciate its size, you have to get into an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Below, near the center of the city, lies a massive grid of highways, streets, 
cul-de-sacs and driveways in mile after mile of ordered rows. Everything in the 
30-year-old grid is laid out in right angles: The cul-de-sacs connect to 
streets which, in turn, feed into highways at regular intervals. 
</P>
<P>
But the grid is a skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
Out here there are no houses, no cars, no fenced-in yards, no barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
The future never came to California City. 
</P>
<P>
What did come were lawsuits, disappointments and government intervention, all 
on a scale befitting the size of one of the most ambitious real estate schemes 
in the history of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Some people did come to settle: There are about 6,500 residents now, mostly on 
the western edge of the 186.5-square-mile city. But the vast majority of 
California City, including the ghostly residential grid in its center, is still 
unpopulated, brush-covered desert land. 
</P>
<P>
The great industries, universities, shopping centers, skyscrapers and financial 
institutions that were also part of that plan never arrived. The schematic of a 
great city was in place, but hopes were dashed that it would ever be fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Toler was there almost at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the '50s, every newspaper you picked up was talking about population 
explosion," said the white-haired Toler, 78, as he leaned against his car at 
one of California City's two gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
"There had to be new cities. The country needed new housing, colleges, 
hospitals, freeways, jobs, businesses. Nat Mendelsohn knew this. He had a 
vision of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Nathan K. Mendelsohn was the father of California City. A Czechoslovakian-born 
sociologist who taught at Columbia University in the early 1940s, he came West 
after World War II to try out his community development theories. 
</P>
<P>
He converted military barracks near Riverside into two-bedroom homes and helped 
subdivide the desert town of Hesperia. He worked with famed land developer M. 
Penn Phillips, whose motto was "you can't buy a bad piece of land in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
In 1955 Mendelsohn told friends that he was going to create a dream city out of 
the barren desert land and alfalfa fields just north of Edwards Air Force Base 
and east of the town of Mojave in Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
"He would take people up on a hill overlooking the land and explain to them 
about the city that would be there one day," said Renate Saremba, Mendelsohn's 
longtime secretary. "They would just look at him. They could not see what he 
saw." 
</P>
<P>
With bank loans and money from investors Mendelsohn bought 82,000 acres of 
land. Then he brought in the planners. 
</P>
<P>
"They divided it into seven different communities with a reason for each one," 
said Toler, who was a firefighter in Los Angeles before he moved to California 
City. 
</P>
<P>
"There was going to be a university town, a medical town, the bedroom 
community. Areas were set aside for light industry." 
</P>
<P>
An ambitious street system was designed and roads were cut into the brush, 
making the grid that can now be seen from the air. A sales office and model 
houses were constructed, and work was started on Central Park, an 80-acre 
recreational area that eventually included a 20-acre lake, outdoor swimming 
pool, playing fields, par-three golf course, picnic areas, tennis courts, 
indoor sports center and community building. 
</P>
<P>
In 1958 Mendelsohn began selling his dream at rates as low as $990 a lot -- $90 
down and $17.50 a month for five years. For a new three-bedroom house, with lot 
included, prices started at $8,700. 
</P>
<P>
The response to his project was overwhelming, almost right from the beginning. 
"California was the magic word back then," said Dennis Sumrow, who grew up near 
California City and has spent most of his life in the area. "It was the land of 
promise, the land of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Less than a year after lots were put on sale, the frenzy was on. 
</P>
<P>
"Buses bringing up people from Los Angeles would be pulling in all day," Toler 
said. "DC-3s would land out right next to the main street, bringing in more of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
"There was a kind of buying hysteria up there," said Carl Click, an optometrist 
in Riverside who first heard about California City at a booth at the Los 
Angeles County Fair in 1958. He and his wife drove up to have a look. "The 
sales office had a frantic atmosphere with loudspeakers proclaiming each lot 
sale and large board displays showing what had been sold." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the buyers came from the Los Angeles area, where Mendelsohn's dream 
project triggered a longing to get into something big on the ground floor. 
Everyone, it seemed, had a distant uncle who had made a killing in real estate 
by speculating when L.A. land was incredibly cheap. Now their chance had come. 
</P>
<P>
"On a good weekend day, I saw sales go as high as a half-million dollars before 
noon," Toler said. 
</P>
<P>
Some came with the dream of establishing their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born in L.A., and I couldn't wait to get out," said Pat Cooper, who came 
to California City with her husband in the early 1960s. They opened California 
City's first grocery store. "We came up here without selling our home down 
below in L.A.," she said. "Mr. Mendelsohn gave us a house to live in here at no 
charge until we sold ours. He wanted people up here who were willing to start 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Sprague and her husband came from Garden Grove to open a hardware store. 
"There were maybe only a couple of telephones in the whole town," Sprague said. 
"We all had CBs and when someone was going out to the liquor store on Highway 
58, they'd get on the radio and say, 'I'm going over to Ma Green's. Anybody 
need anything?' It was sort of fun." 
</P>
<P>
"We were pioneers," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Mendelsohn donated a small church and a city airport, both with early 
'60s-style futuristic architectural flourishes, and a barn that the residents 
turned into a community club. He sponsored celebrations and publicity stunts to 
mark various occasions. When the man-made lake in Central Park was filled, 
Mendelsohn had water from New York's Central Park ceremoniously poured into the 
lake from an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest celebration marked the date, seven years after Mendelsohn started 
selling the land, when California City actually became a city. 
</P>
<P>
Now all it needed was a reason -- beyond real estate speculation -- to exist. 
</P>
<P>
Mendelsohn, Cooper said, offered several industries land for $1 an acre if they 
would build a plant in town, and there was speculation that major aerospace 
companies were considering his offer. Also fueling the boom mentality was a 
plan, by the Los Angeles Department of Airports, to build a 17,000-acre airport 
in Palmdale, about 50 miles to the south. 
</P>
<P>
But the only industry that actually came to California City was a small cement 
plant. The airport project was drastically scaled down. 
</P>
<P>
A decade after lots went on sale, the dream was deflating. By then, tens of 
thousands of lots had been bought, but few homes had been built or businesses 
started. In 1969 the population was only 1,700. 
</P>
<P>
"Nat was a very dear man," Cooper said. "My husband and I felt he was honest 
and sincere and always trying to do the best for the community. Things just 
didn't happen as fast as he had hoped." 
</P>
<P>
Others believed Mendelsohn had deceived them. "They told us the land would have 
to go way up in value," Click said. "We were misled." Click's sales documents 
show that he paid $3,490 for one of the lots in 1959. His tax assessment from 
Kern County for the last fiscal year lists the property's current value at 
$3,755.64. 
</P>
<P>
Many landowners were not willing to hold out -- they stopped paying taxes on 
their land and let the state take ownership. "You would not believe the number 
of people there who let their land go," said a Kern County official who did not 
want to be identified. "In September, the last time we had a land redemption 
sale, the California City list was half-an-inch thick, with 10 parcels per 
page. There were hundreds of them." 
</P>
<P>
Mendelsohn pulled out in 1969. He and his associates sold his company to Great 
Western United Corp., a Denver-based sugar and mining company, for $27.4 
million in stock. Mendelsohn became an officer of Great Western, but he 
concentrated on pursuits away from California City. By the mid-1970s he was 
rarely spotted there. 
</P>
<P>
He died in 1984 after suffering a heart attack on a golf course near a resort 
community he founded in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western continued selling California City with Mendelsohn-style hype in 
ads placed in national magazines, such as Reader's Digest and Look. The ads 
painted such a rosy picture of the city that the California Department of Real 
Estate objected. Charging that the ads greatly exaggerated the "commercial, 
recreational, structural" development of the city, the agency issued a desist 
and refrain order in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Great Western was acquired by the famed Hunt brothers, Nelson and 
William of Texas, who wanted the company for its beet sugar fields. Along with 
the sugar, they got California City. 
</P>
<P>
It was not one of their better acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
"California City -- that's the place California dreamers and California 
schemers got together and did business," said Los Angeles attorney Kenneth H. 
Donney. In 1974, Donney was with the Federal Trade Commission and the head of 
an investigation into sales practices at California City. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC's major objection had to do with "tool" lots, a sales approach that had 
been used since Mendelsohn's time, whose company had set up a real estate 
license school to train salespeople for the development. "They were told, 'You 
would be that much more convincing a salesperson if you yourself were a 
landowner. You could say to prospective buyers, 'This is such a great deal that 
I got in on it myself,' " Donney recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"Our allegation was that the students were not buying a sales tool when they 
bought that lot, they were simply buying a lot. It was just a scheme to sell 
them land," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The problems preceded the Hunts -- they had just taken over when the FTC acted. 
The Hunts agreed to a settlement, paying almost $4 million in partial refunds 
to people who had bought land since 1972 and a $50,000 penalty to the 
government. They also agreed to pay up to $16 million for improvements in 
water, gas and other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a landmark case, no pun intended," Donney said, describing the largest 
refund ever obtained to that date by the FTC. The settlement also called for a 
written warning on sales materials given to potential buyers. The caveat, 
reminiscent of the warning on cigarette packs, reads: "You should consider the 
value of any of our land to be uncertain. Do not count on an increase in 
value." 
</P>
<P>
It is a lasting legacy. The warning is still found on California City tract 
maps. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Logue is now California City's leading citizen. But he's as different from 
Nat Mendelsohn as the vision of California City is from the reality. 
</P>
<P>
Mendelsohn was, by all accounts, a natty dresser, well versed in the arts, 
politics and world affairs. He was friendly but somewhat aloof. 
</P>
<P>
Logue, 63, is almost always dressed in cowboy duds, complete with boots, vest 
and hat, although he removes the hat during City Council meetings. Logue is the 
mayor of California City, a job that pays $500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has the highest elected position in the town, he could not be 
accused of being aloof. The business card of the mayor of the third largest 
city in California gives his office and home phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Like Mendelsohn, he is a builder -- Logue is a contractor who moved to 
California City 12 years ago. But Logue does not talk in terms of grand master 
plans, great universities or industrial centers, at least not for now. He has 
seen California City at its worst. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first moved up here the town was in sad shape," Logue said. "You 
couldn't even get equipment people to come in here back then. The first couple 
of houses I put in, I had to dig the foundations by hand." 
</P>
<P>
Major industries have yet to come to town. The two-block-long commercial area, 
along the grand boulevard Mendelsohn put in, has not attracted any big retail 
outfits. It includes a couple of cafes, a gift shop, auto parts store, video 
rental outlet, a pizzeria, Sears Catalog Service counter, realty offices and 
two nail parlors. 
</P>
<P>
The bowling alley, which was idle for years, has recently reopened, but the 
city's only movie theater closed last year. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go to a nice restaurant anywhere around here and have a nice night 
out," Dennis Sumrow said. "There is no theater, except for community groups, no 
orchestra, no galleries. You starve for that up here. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought my wife here, and it was like taking her to the moon. She didn't 
last here. It was too small-town for her." Sumrow himself has moved on since he 
was interviewed for this article. 
</P>
<P>
But if California City does not have the commercial or cultural markings of a 
great metropolis, it is slowly acquiring one element every great city needs -- 
people. In 1980, according to the census, 2,743 people were living in the city. 
By the beginning of this decade, according to a city estimate, the population 
stood at 6,573, a 240% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Even more impressive is the increase in construction. Records show that in 1980 
about $1.5 million in construction was done in the city. In 1989, the figure 
was more than $33 million. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see it out there, it's happening," Logue said. 
</P>

The true industrial and residential boom is happening about 50 miles south in 
the cities of Lancaster and Palmdale, both of which are rapidly expanding. But 
California City is feeling the repercussions. "Housing prices in Palmdale are 
moving on up to the Los Angeles range," said the mayor, exaggerating a bit. But 
there are bargains to be had for those who are willing to commute the 130 miles 
from California City to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Kern Island Homes, a builder that recently moved its headquarters to California 
City from Bakersfield, offers new three-bedroom homes for a base price of 
$79,950. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Strong, the company's co-owner, estimated that in 1990 the company will 
sell 200 houses in the city, as opposed to the 30 they sold there in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Kern Island is only one of several builders that have built model houses in the 
past year and erected signs along the main road leading into the city to entice 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so optimistic that we have bought land to create two new subdivisions 
all our own," Strong said. "That might be a little crazy, but time will tell if 
we were nuts or not." 
</P>
<P>
Along with development comes new problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sewer system is already running at maximum," said Helen Dennis, editor of 
the Mojave Desert News, a weekly newspaper based in California City. "It was 
rebuilt about five years ago and it was supposed to make it to the year 2000, 
but it didn't make it." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis also said there were problems with crime, which she blamed on an 
"undesirable element" moving up from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Last month a 22-year-old California City man was arrested on suspicion of 
stabbing a man in Lancaster. The stabbing was described by police as a gang 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part the city is still perfect for those who want to avoid 
urban blight. About 15 miles northeast of the main commercial/residential area 
is a development overseen by Silver Saddle Development Co., which bought out 
the Hunts in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Stacy and Eddi Dixon of Los Angeles recently built a two-story house 
there with three bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths, two kitchens, two fireplaces, an indoor 
Jacuzzi and a three-car garage, all for $94,000, according to Stacy. 
</P>
<P>
Although well within city borders, it is in a spectacular setting. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the animals, I wanted the weather changes, I wanted real sunsets, I 
wanted the quiet," Stacy said. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the balcony of the house they have built, she can look out on miles 
of stark desert landscape with the blue Tehachapi mountains in the distance. 
The streets in her neighborhood have been paved to make way for hoped-for 
development, but so far she can only see one other house from her vantage 
point. 
</P>
<P>
The area resembles -- on a small, less frenetic scale -- California City in the 
Mendelsohn days. More than 1,000 lots have been sold in this area by Silver 
Saddle, but only five houses have been built. Obviously, buyers are speculating 
that their neighbors will build and raise the value of the land. 
</P>
<P>
But as in the early '60s, not only the speculators are buying. California City 
still attracts the young dreamers. 
</P>
<P>
In the bar of the Silver Saddle clubhouse, Jerry and Barbara Arreola of Simi 
Valley were having a celebratory drink. They had arrived that morning 
responding to a direct-mail campaign offering a free night's stay and a prize. 
A Silver Saddle salesperson showed them available lots, which were priced for 
an average of about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been out to these kinds of places before, and it always turned out they 
were selling time-sharing," said Barbara Arreola, 29. "But when I saw that land 
out there, I thought we could do this; we could have our own home." 
</P>
<P>
The Arreolas bought their first piece of land that day, not far from where 
Stacy and Dixon built their house. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at it this way," said Jerry Arreola, 30. "Land in California will only 
go up." 
</P>
<P>
The Arreolas had never heard of Mendelsohn. They didn't know they were saying 
the same things that others had been saying for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, almost anyone in town will tell you that the bad days are over. The 
boom has begun. And they could well be right. 
</P>
<P>
"I want Spanish-style and she wants ranch," Jerry Arreola said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever we build, the first thing we are going to do as soon as escrow closes 
is to plant four trees on the land, one for each of our daughters," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shaking earlier when we did this," he said. "But now I feel so good. I 
own some dirt that nobody else owns. That's my rocks out there, my sage." 
</P>
<P>
He raised his glass in a toast. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the American dream."

72% FEWER HOMELESS USE NEW SHELTER; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES: THE VALLEY'S COLD-WEATHER SHELTER PROGRAM USES AN AUSTERE ARMORY. THE 
PROGRAM HAD OFFERED MOTEL ROOMS.

<P>
Despite 38 nights of bitter-cold temperatures in the San Fernando Valley this 
winter, only a handful of homeless families have sought refuge in a new 
city-sponsored shelter in Sylmar, drawing criticism from some homeless 
advocates who say the program is ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
On two frigid nights this month no one showed up. On average, about eight 
mothers, fathers and children sleep on cots in the sprawling gymnasium-size 
Sylmar National Guard Armory each night. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly empty armory represents a 72% decrease in the number of homeless 
served this winter and results from a major cost-cutting change in the 
emergency cold-weather shelter program in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Last year homeless families were given a free motel room when night 
temperatures dropped to 40 degrees. The program attracted hundreds each night. 
This year the city opened the doors to an austere armory, which has proved to 
be a far less desirable alternative for families. 
</P>
<P>
Between Nov. 1, 1988, and Feb. 5, 1989, 10,298 people were housed -- mainly in 
motels -- on 42 nights. During the same period a year later, 2,887 were housed 
on 38 nights in two shelters. The Sylmar family shelter has housed only 308 
parents and children. Another armory shelter exclusively for adults in Van Nuys 
has attracted an average of about 65 each night it has been open. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that the family shelter program isn't working and is not 
effective," said John Suggs of the Los Angeles Countywide Coalition for the 
Homeless. "This is not an indication that the homeless population is 
decreasing. It's a clear indication that the program is not addressing the 
basic needs of the homeless population." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian allowed municipalities to use the state's armories as 
shelters for the first time last year after four people died of hypothermia in 
Los Angeles. Before that, the city opened park recreation centers to the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Last year families -- especially single mothers with young children -- were 
offered vouchers for motel rooms because officials did not believe it was 
appropriate to house mothers and children in the same facility with adults, 
many of whom often suffer from mental illness. In addition, boisterous children 
often angered adults. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and some who work with the homeless say the change was needed to 
improve flaws in the previous program. The motel voucher program was open to 
abuse because it was difficult to prove if a family was truly homeless or 
simply taking advantage of a free night in a motel. Also, social service 
workers were not able to offer food and counseling to families who 
"disappeared" into motel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. John Purdell of the Van Nuys Corps of the Salvation Army was critical of 
the motel program because families were often sent to neighborhoods plagued 
with drug trafficking and prostitution. He said he believes many families 
reject the armory operation because of strict rules that prohibit drinking and 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is providing a clean, supervised shelter, and many homeless I'm sure 
are saying 'thanks but no thanks,' " Purdell said. "I don't mean to sound 
uncaring. But many homeless cannot cope with such regulations." 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocates and city officials both cite several reasons why the shelter 
program is failing to attract homeless families: 
</P>
<P>
* The armory is difficult to find, hidden from street view by industrial 
buildings in an eastern corner of Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
* Homeless parents are afraid to bring their children to a government-sponsored 
shelter, fearful that authorities will take their children away. 
</P>
<P>
* Families are forced to leave the armory between 6 and 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
* The shelter program operates sporadically, depending on strict temperature 
guidelines. This makes it difficult for a family to know when it will be cold 
enough to open. 
</P>
<P>
One homeless couple with five young children who stayed in the shelter Tuesday 
said they were thankful for the warm room at night, but were jarred awake and 
sent out in the dawn cold with nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
"They woke us up at 5:30 and told us we had to pack our bags and leave," said 
James Enriquez, 26. "It's real hard. Where are you supposed to go with five 
kids and no money at that hour? It's still cold out there." 
</P>
<P>
Toni Reines, co-director of the California Homeless Coalition, said the 
armories do not provide a setting that works for most families. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know when the program will be open. They have to be back out in the 
cold at 6 a.m. with their kids," Reines said. "It's obvious that it is not as 
desirable as being in a private motel room. People would rather sleep in their 
cars." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles emergency shelter policy mandates that the city open shelters for 
the homeless when the temperature drops to 40 degrees or less at night and to 
50 degrees or less when rain is forecast. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley, shielded from warm ocean wind by the Santa Monica Mountains, has 
been hit with freezing or near-freezing temperatures 38 nights this winter. The 
rest of the city, which has recorded temperatures of 40 degrees or lower on 
only nine nights -- is served by a second family shelter, in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Although criticized by some homeless advocates as an arbitrary cutoff, city 
officials defend the 40-degree requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have a standard then it becomes a subjective thing on when we 
activate the shelters," said Karen Patterson of the Community Development 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, city officials say, they are concerned with the low attendance at 
the Sylmar armory. But because the program ends March 31, they are unlikely to 
change the program this late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we need to think of a program that works better. That's what I'm 
hoping to do next year," said Nancy Bianconi, director of housing operations 
for L.A. Family Housing, the nonprofit group that operates the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, homeless advocates say, they will continue to push for 
winter-long activation of shelters and elimination of the 40-degree rule. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-degree cutoff aside, some city officials are not eager to return to the 
motel-voucher program. Robert Vilmur, the city's homeless projects coordinator, 
stressed that the armory program is superior to motels because the city can 
provide dinner and breakfast. A public health nurse is on call for medical 
needs, and social service workers are available for counseling. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing more comprehensive services, the shelter program is 
less expensive. The cost of housing a person in a shelter is between $9 and 
$10; the cost of putting them up in a motel averages $25 a night. Last year 
$719,000 in city and federal emergency housing funds were spent citywide on 
motel and shelter expenses. Expenditures so far this year have not yet been 
tabulated. 
</P>
<P>
The armory also eliminates what some suspect was widespread abuse of the motel 
program, said Jim Bird of Better Valley Services, the nonprofit social service 
organization that distributed the free vouchers last year. 
</P>
<P>
Bird said he and his workers suspected that people living in overcrowded 
apartments would seek motel vouchers for a respite. Also, families living in 
motels because they could not afford apartments would ask for vouchers to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way whether we could determine if people were homeless or not," 
Bird said. "The armory pretty much screens out the marginally homeless. The 
shelter is not an incentive that draws people who are doubled up in apartments, 
living in substandard housing or in cars." 
</P>
<P>
But for the Enriquez family, it was all they had Tuesday night. Their 
experience with the shelter exemplifies the strengths and weaknesses of the 
program, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The family -- James, Linda and their five children, ages 1 to 8 -- exhausted 
their savings Monday night after living nearly a month in a motel. Enriquez 
said he had been laid off from his job with a moving company. Money was tight. 
So when cockroach and plumbing problems were not eliminated, he withheld rent 
and his family was evicted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Without a car, the family packed their clothes in plastic sacks and spent 
Tuesday at a Van Nuys Boulevard coffee shop while James begged for quarters to 
make telephone calls to find shelter. 
</P>
<P>
He called a Van Nuys church group named Loaves and Fishes and was given a 
toll-free number -- 800-548-6047 -- for cold-weather shelter information. The 
operator directed him to Van Nuys City Hall, where a special bus would pick 
them up and take them to the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
For three hours in the dark, with an icy wind howling, the family sat on the 
steps of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't know they had missed the bus. 
</P>
<P>
About 8 p.m., Enriquez said, a man offered to give them a ride to the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"We drove around the street for about half an hour but couldn't find the place. 
The man was getting mad," he said. Then they noticed a small, hand-painted sign 
against a light pole with an arrow pointing toward "armory shelter." 
</P>
<P>
"It was warm inside; they were real nice," Enriquez said. His family was fed 
soup and sandwiches. "I don't know where we would have gone without it." 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, lights were flicked on at 5:30 a.m, causing the children to 
cry. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at 6:15 a.m., after a breakfast of fruit-flavored juice and doughnuts, 
the family was told they had to board a yellow school bus that would take them 
back to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The older children, bundled in jackets and hats, carried their belongings in 
backpacks. Linda held a bag of disposable diapers and a sack of sandwiches from 
the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
They stayed on the bus as long as they could, finally getting off on Van Nuys 
Boulevard near Parthenia Street. Enriquez said they intended to go to a church 
to ask for some money. Then they would walk to a Laundromat. The heat from the 
dryers would warm the children, he reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish my wife and children could have stayed at the shelter so I could go 
look for a job," Enriquez said. "I can't leave them alone in a park or 
something all day." 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm glad we could stay there. We won't miss the bus tonight, we're going 
to be at the stop right at 5," he said. "I hope it's cold again." 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday night the shelter doors were closed. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature in the Valley was 41 degrees.

MIRACLE ON ICE, REVISITED; 
</P>
<P>
JANASZAK COULD ONLY WATCH AS THE MIRACLE UNFOLDED

<P>
Steve Janaszak watched it all. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Craig, standing on the ice draped in the American flag, searching for his 
father in the stands after the gold medal-winning triumph over Finland. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Eruzione's game-winning goal against the Soviets two nights earlier that 
prompted broadcaster Al Michaels' memorable call in that game's final seconds: 
"Do you believe in miracles? Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
Steve Janaszak was there for every second as the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team 
made a nation briefly forget the hostages in Iran, Afghanistan, the impending 
U.S. boycott of the Summer Olympics, the ailing U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Janaszak watched every second from the bench. He was the only player on 
that team who did not play. Not one second. 
</P>
<P>
A year earlier he was the goalie who led the University of Minnesota to the 
national championship and was named tournament MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Yet his college coach, who was now the coach of the Olympic hockey team, didn't 
even put him in the lineup at Lake Placid. 
</P>
<P>
But understand Steve Janaszak is to understand why there ever was a miracle on 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks made Craig his No. 1 goalie almost from the start. He had led Boston 
University to the NCAA Division I hockey title in 1978 and started nearly half 
of Team USA's 61 exhibition games leading up to the Olympics; Janaszak and 
Bruce Horsch split the rest. Horsch was cut just before the team left for Lake 
Placid. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember going into Herb's office and him saying, 'You're going to go to 
Lake Placid, but I can't guarantee you that you're going to play,' " said 
Janaszak, who now sells bonds on Wall Street for Bear Stearns and Co. "I had 
the choice of whether or not I wanted to go and not play, or not go. There was 
no decision there to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Team USA played its first game Feb. 12. against Sweden, seeded third behind the 
Soviets and Czechs. Sweden led 2-1 going into the final minute of play, but 
defenseman Bill Baker's hard slap shot beat goalie Pelle Lindbergh with 27 
seconds left to salvage an important tie. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia was next. Paced by the Stastny brothers -- Peter, Anton and 
Marian -- the Czechs went ahead 1-0 in the first period. But the Americans 
dominated every phase of the game and won, 7-3, on Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Humbled, 10-3, by the Soviets at Madison Square Garden in their final 
exhibition game, the Americans had erased that game from their collective 
memory. They were on a roll, and Craig was leading them. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, with games against lesser threats like Romania and West Germany, there 
was time for Janaszak to make an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought there was plenty of opportunity for him to have been inserted in 
the lineup," said Baker, now a dentist in St. Louis studying to become an oral 
surgeon. "But once we got two, three games into the tournament, it became 
pretty obvious he wasn't going to play. He knew that. I think we all did. But 
Janny's personality was a big part of the team. It's kind of funny. You look 
back and you don't really think of him as not playing." 
</P>
<P>
"Right around the time we played West Germany, Jimmy had a bad period and Herb 
came in and threatened to put me in," said Janaszak, whose National Hockey 
League career after the Olympics consisted of three games -- one with the 
Minnesota North Stars and two with the Colorado Rockies. "I looked at Herb, I 
heard what he was saying and looked at his face. And I said to myself, there's 
no way." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a difficult thing," said Brooks, a television hockey analyst now. "I 
recruited him at the University of Minnesota, he played for me for four years 
and brought us an NCAA championship. That made it difficult. I knew he was a 
capable goalie. When you know that he can do the job and you don't use him, 
that adds to it. I had confidence in him, but Jimmy Craig had a hot hand and I 
wanted to play it." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprising, because in the realm of Olympic ice hockey, where even allowing 
an extra goal can jeopardize a team's chances of making it to the medal round, 
coaches are reluctant to tamper with success. 
</P>
<P>
So while Craig played the best hockey of his life, Janaszak was forced to sit 
and watch, and mask his disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a difficult position. It wasn't easy not to play," Janaszak said 
without a tinge of bitterness in his voice. "But that is a grain of salt in the 
entire experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was part of the team, that the team was 20 people, and that 20 people 
had to contribute. Otherwise, the thing wouldn't have worked. A team only works 
when everybody works." 
</P>
<P>
For Janaszak, who met his wife, Jackie, during the Games, his job was to stay 
ready if needed. He went even further. When he wasn't practicing -- he and 
assistant coach Craig Patrick worked together every day at 6 a.m. while the 
rest of the team slept -- he did everything from sharpening skates to timing 
shifts on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a terrific work ethic," said Craig, who sells advertising for Valassis 
Inserts in Brockton, Mass. "He worked real hard, which helped make me work 
harder because I never wanted anybody to work harder than I did." 
</P>
<P>
"Steve was as important as Jim Craig or Mike Eruzione," said Eruzione, who 
spends much of his time today promoting the Winter Games. "Everybody on the 
team was important, whether they played or didn't play, because if one player 
is disgruntled or is not happy, he could rock the boat pretty easy. He was very 
much a part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
The members of the team recently got together for a group photo for Life 
magazine, and 13 of them are returning to Lake Placid this week for a reunion. 
Apparently, not much has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a nice, very unique group of individuals," Janaszak said. "We were 
together not more than five minutes and the shots started flying around, the 
jabs. It was as if we'd never been apart."

MIRACLE ON ICE, REVISITED; 
</P>
<P>
BROOKS PLAYED HIS 'ROCKNE ROUTINE' AT THE RIGHT TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN RAPPOPORT, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 10 years to the month that a certain locker room scene took place at the 
Lake Placid Olympics that has been lost in time. But for Steve Janaszak, it's 
still as clear as the day it happened. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Brooks, coach of the U.S. Olympic team, was telling his players how it 
would be if they lost to Finland after their momentous victory over the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Herb did one of the better jobs of bringing the team back to reality," said 
Janaszak, a backup goaltender on the team. "Basically, he walked in and told us 
after the Soviet game that if we lost to Finland, we would take it to our 
grave. 
</P>
<P>
"There was incredible apprehension before this game (with Finland). We were 
horrified by the thought that we'd be sitting around 10 years later and 
wondering how we could lose the gold medal after coming so close. Essentially, 
we were afraid to lose." 
</P>
<P>
That one scene just about summed up Brooks in that element. Few could inspire 
teams as well as the Olympic coach, who brought Rockne-like qualities to his 
locker room talks. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a special ability to motivate people," Janaszak said. "He could be 
difficult at times, but from the standpoint of motivating people he was the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
This U.S. team had a sense of destiny about itself, thanks in large part to its 
authoritarian coach. Through a grueling exhibition season of some 60 games, 
Brooks pushed, prodded and even insulted his players. 
</P>
<P>
And at the right time, he inspired them. Just before the Americans were about 
to go out and meet the powerful Soviets in the medal round, he fished out a 
paper from his pocket and read to a hushed locker room: 
</P>
<P>
"You are born to be a player. You are meant to be here at this time. This is 
your moment." 
</P>
<P>
That was the closest Brooks ever came to praising his team. More often he was 
critical. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a disciplinarian," said Neal Broten, a forward on the 1980 Olympic team 
who was later reunited with Brooks on the Minnesota North Stars. "He expected a 
lot from his players and you expected a lot from him. He has very good systems, 
he's a good motivator and he knows how to get the best out of each individual, 
whether it's a pat on the back or a slap in the head." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, it was just cold water in the face, figuratively speaking. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do everything I could to be an honest S.O.B.," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, his players thought he might be too honest. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't have to like him, but you respected the stand he took and his 
hockey knowledge," said Mark Johnson, the New Jersey Devils' center who scored 
some key goals for the Americans against the Soviets. "We were behind him 100 
per cent. Sometimes you got frustrated and mad, but at the end you had to 
respect him." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the U.S. team was almost in a state of revolt because of Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
"Right before we went to Lake Placid for the Olympics, Herb was talking about 
bringing in some new players from Minnesota and shaking up the team and making 
(captain) Mike Eruzione an assistant coach," Janaszak remembered. "Well, he had 
a palace revolt on his hands. It was ludicrous to us." 
</P>
<P>
The team banded together and threatened a wholesale walkout if Brooks went 
through with his announced plan. Brooks met with the team and the whole thing 
was settled quietly. The team remained in tact and everyone was happy, 
including Brooks after Eruzione went out and scored a couple of goals in the 
next game. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the kind of anger Herb generated," Janaszak said. "I don't know if 
Herb just did it to stir us up or if he was actually going to carry it through, 
but it sure worked out well." 
</P>
<P>
Another incident took place, this time with an individual player, that seemed 
to create the proper emotional climate for the Americans and move them in the 
right direction. 
</P>
<P>
Rob McClanahan had suffered a thigh injury in one of the early Olympic rounds 
and taken himself out of the game. That brought Brooks storming into the locker 
room after McClanahan, screaming that he was a "baby" and a "spoiled rich kid." 
</P>
<P>
"McClanahan was crying and coming after Herb," Janaszak remembered. "It was 
some scene. They had to tear them apart. I remember guys were holding both of 
them down. That locker room scene is still vivid in my mind. But it was another 
piece of the puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
McClanahan responded to Brooks' challenge -- thigh injury and all. He put his 
equipment back on, went out and scored some key goals. "He pretty much stuck it 
in Herb's face," Janaszak remembered. "It was, basically, us against the coach. 
It was important for us collectively to help the guy out, stick together. I 
think this really brought the team together." 
</P>
<P>
Jack O'Callahan, a defenseman who later played several years in the NHL, agreed 
that there was a "love-hate" relationship between the players and Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
"They hated him because he was on them all the time, but they sort of liked him 
because he made them winners," O'Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks held himself aloof from the team, he said, because "I didn't want to get 
close to a couple of guys if I couldn't get close to all of them." 
</P>
<P>
And though an atmosphere developed that pitted players against coach, in the 
end they all had what they wanted -- a winner.

UNDERGRADUATES IN NFL DRAFT CREATE DILEMMA FOR NCAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY JENKINS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Record numbers of college undergraduates will exchange their scholarships for 
the more tenuous promise of the NFL draft this year, a trend disturbing to many 
collegiate and professional authorities. There are a variety of specific 
causes, but the overall ones may be the impatient nature of 20-year-olds, and 
the agents who murmur to them about salary caps and six-figure contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Eight prominent college football players with eligibility remaining have 
announced they will forgo their final seasons and petition for early entry to 
the NFL draft. Agents and league officials predict that 15 to 35 could declare 
that intention by the April 9 deadline, and Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware of 
Houston may be one. He acknowledged in a telephone interview he is rethinking 
his decision to return to school. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing in most players' cases is the ability to give your family 
financial stability for a long time," Ware said. "That and the fact that every 
young man who lives in the U.S. has a dream of playing in the NFL. Some just 
feel it's their time now. But it's a big decision and I'm not in any rush to 
make it. I'd like to hear some things. See who's interested." 
</P>
<P>
The potential flood could cause the NFL to set aside its rule barring players 
who have not completed their college eligibility from entering the draft. While 
the league does not want to be seen as encouraging underclassmen to leave 
early, the rule probably cannot withstand legal challenge. No underclassman has 
challenged it thus far, but legal experts see the rule as vulnerable to 
anti-trust law. The NFL routinely has granted exceptions to players, unwilling 
to be tested in court. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA also could make a rule change, to allow players to preserve 
eligibility while exploring the draft. NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz 
favors such a move, but he also said the decision to come out is potentially "a 
real disaster" for some athletes. The NCAA and NFL are holding talks to 
determine how best to grapple with the issue, which Schultz calls "a double 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
One force that seems to be driving players into the marketplace is the threat, 
oft-repeated by agents, of an NFL salary cap for rookies by 1991 or 1992. 
Fearing that waiting a year could limit their earning potential, some have 
decided to cash in now. Another reason is the success of Barry Sanders of the 
Detroit Lions, who petitioned for early entry after winning the Heisman as a 
junior at Oklahoma State and became the NFC rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
What those influences translate into, simply, are dollars and fame. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm ready for the big league," said Georgia running back Rodney 
Hampton, one of the earliest to announce. "It depends on how tough you are. . . 
. And sure enough, everybody wants some money. 
</P>
<P>
What many undergraduates may be overlooking is the cost of miscalculating their 
worth. The NFL Players Association and even several agents are issuing 
widespread cautions in an attempt to stem the flow. 
</P>
<P>
"I think absolutely some kids will make the wrong decision," said Sanders' 
agent, David Ware of Atlanta, who contends his client was an exception. 
"Teammates, agents, and in some cases even their mothers and fathers are 
telling them, 'Go ahead.' And they won't be picked highly at all." 
</P>
<P>
A few facts if life: According to the NFLPA, only 35 percent of the league's 
players have college degrees. And the average career span of an NFL player is 
less than four years. 
</P>
<P>
The NFLPA also has found that the career of a player with a degree is 50 
percent longer than one without. And the average salary of a player with a 
degree is 16 percent higher than one without. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, according to NFLPA director of research Mike Duberstein, is that 
NFL players are asked to spend considerable time in classroom situations. In 
the constant meetings, film sessions, etc., they are asked to absorb more 
technical information than they encountered in college. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference in NFL talent is minimal," Duberstein contends. "But the 
difference in intellectual capacity is not. Those with degrees have a little 
more mental acuity and discipline." 
</P>
<P>
There also are short-term financial considerations for underclassmen. 
Duberstein maintains it is only sensible to enter if a player is an assured 
first-rounder. At this point, only linebacker Keith McCants of Alabama and 
running back Emmitt Smith of Florida can claim that status. USC linebacker 
Junior Seau is a likely first-rounder, as is Ware, if he comes out. But no one 
else can be sure. 
</P>
<P>
Just 28 players can be first-round picks. There are roughly 80 players who 
either consider themselves or are being told that they are first-round 
material, which means several juniors could go as low as the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
What that also means is that NFL teams may acquire some first-round talent for 
fourth-round salaries in what some are calling potentially the deepest draft in 
years. "It makes absolutely no rational sense to come out and be a 
fourth-rounder," Duberstein said. 
</P>
<P>
So why risk it? In some cases a belief in their talent, in others financial 
hardship. For a few, the NFL offers longtime security and might make more sense 
than returning to college and risking injury. 
</P>
<P>
The process of evaluating their standing is painstaking and sometimes 
misleading. They can only ask others' opinions, as Andre Ware is doing, seeking 
advice from Houston Oilers quarterback Warren Moon and NFLPA Executive Director 
Gene Upshaw among others. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone can tell you one thing and think the opposite," Ware said. "A team can 
pass on you, and suddenly your worth goes way down. . . . A lot of it's 
instinct. You just have to try to sense what they feel about you." 
</P>
<P>
Ware has the advantage of being in good shape academically, just 18 hours short 
of graduation. "I can do that in a spring and a summer," he said, "And I'll do 
it no matter what." The salary cap is in his mind, "but it's not as dramatic as 
you might think," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Southern California, safety Mark Carrier is less certain of his value. The 
NFLPA has told Carrier he will be gambling and he is ambivalent. As for agents, 
he said, "They're going to tell you you're first round." Carrier is just two 
classes from obtaining a degree, and may return to USC to play while attending 
graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a business, a profession, and you take on new responsibilities," Carrier 
said. "Bills, notes, mortgages. I'm not accustomed to any of that. I've lived a 
nice, sheltered college life. And you start to appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia quarterback Major Harris will make an announcement next week that 
he is turning pro, sources said. His reasons, according to a confidant, are 
almost exclusively financial. His mother, Sandra, formerly worked in a steel 
mill in Pittsburgh and receives disability because of a bad back. He is the 
youngest of five children. 
</P>
<P>
McCants, when learning that he could potentially be the first player picked, 
also opted for the financial considerations. "I'm just doing what's best for my 
family," he said. "I'm not leaving because I want to. I have to do this." 
McCants is two years from a degree. 
</P>
<P>
Smith of Florida had several reasons to return to school: He would have been a 
leading Heisman candidate and never had won a championship of any sort. Instead 
he cited the potential salary cap and the high esteem he is held in. "This past 
season has helped me increase my stock and I don't want to risk decreasing it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
John Mackovic, former head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs who now holds the 
dual role as Illinois' coach and athletic director, is a vehement opponent of 
early entry. He maintains most underclassmen lack maturity for the NFL both 
physically and emotionally. He is adamant that their reach for short-term 
financial gain is wrongheaded. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very simple to say, 'Let's take the money now,' " he said. "And yet we 
are constantly reminded of our earning power at 40 (years old) in this society. 
I hate for young people to forego the opportunity of earning a good living at 
40, just for the chance of earning a living at 22." 
</P>
<P>
Mackovic, who is waiting for junior quarterback Jeff George to make the same 
decision, doesn't object if a player needs to protect his value and can make 
the kind of money that means long-term security. That was the case with 
Sanders, who signed a five-year contract worth $5.9 million. George could be 
one of the first quarterbacks chosen, and Mackovic is acquiring as much 
information as possible for the player. 
</P>
<P>
There is little empirical data to support the maturity argument, particularly 
among skill players. In fact, there are examples of players who came out early 
with great success, from Bernie Kosar to Craig "Ironhead" Heyward. 
</P>
<P>
But Mackovic counters by pointing to the example of Sanders's brother, Byron, 
who gained more than 1,000 yards for Northwestern in 1988. His experience was 
more typical. He chose to leave school with a fifth year of eligibility 
remaining and no degree. He was selected in the eighth round by the Chicago 
Bears, and was cut. He recently re-enrolled at Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to address both Barry and Byron Sanders," Mackovic said. "The 
reality is the stark contrast." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of motivation by NFL-bound college football players to earn degrees 
may be lamentable. But it applies to all athletes, not just college football 
underclassmen, and some contend it is a separate issue from the legal and 
economic ones. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Leigh Steinberg contends the NCAA can't hope to legislate academic goals 
for athletes. And it is hardly the primary interest of the NFL. Neither group 
can force an athlete to stay in school for four years, and most players are now 
taking five or more years to get degrees anyway, if they have the desire at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no natural connection between attending school and the ability to play 
pro ball," Steinberg said. "The two concepts don't flow together." 
</P>
<P>
Frequently the agent is blamed when an underclassman chooses the draft. Under 
the current rules, some athletes have been known to accept money to purposely 
sacrifice their eligibility and gain entry to the draft. For that reason, 
agents would be relieved to see an unrestricted draft, which would make their 
roles less suspect and would place responsibility on the players. 
</P>
<P>
"The messenger is being blamed for bringing the message," said Sanders' 
representative, David Ware. " . . . Blaming agents is like blaming a street 
that's wet because of the rain. Agents are hardly the problem. It's that these 
kids don't have enough information." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg contends that not only is a free flow of underclassmen to the draft 
inevitable, but that it could have a positive effect on college football and 
the NCAA. Legitimizing a free flow would mean a more open acknowledgement of a 
student athlete's lack of classroom motivation, and perhaps a truer college 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it could have a cleansing effect in alumni and agent transgressions," 
Steinberg said. "Right now we have a number of student athletes with no 
interest or academic proclivity. They're serving time. Those are the ones who 
are most open to taking money from agents and alumni. Because they resent being 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA's Schultz, for one, agrees with the point. He would like to see an NFL 
draft similar to that of Major League Baseball, in which players may be 
selected without having to formally declare they are relinquishing amateur 
status. The NFL is expected to do something -- Commisioner Paul Tagliabue 
acknowledging the need to relax the rule. The question is what. 
</P>
<P>
"The commissioner has said he feels it's important to set some standard," 
league spokesman Jim Heffernan said. "But he hasn't said we'll take anybody 
that walks in." 
</P>
<P>
Other options: a two-phase draft, adding one for juniors unsure whether they 
want to turn pro. Penn State Coach Joe Paterno has suggested NFL teams should 
offer contract incentives for players to obtain degrees. Schultz too is unsure 
of how it may be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is an athlete has the right to leave anytime he wants," Schultz 
said. "The thing is, a lot of kids come out for the wrong reasons. He doesn't 
make it, he has no eligibility, and he can't afford to go back to school. It 
can be a real disaster. We just want to make sure they stay or leave for the 
right reasons. I'm not sure what arrangement can be worked out. It's very 
sensitive, very touchy." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA could shoulder the burden by allowing a player to test his worth in 
the draft, but return to school if he decides his value is too low. An NFL team 
would not give up the draft pick unless the player signed. But at any rate the 
NCAA cannot do anything until its convention next year, so it appears there 
will not be an easy resolution. "The point to all this is that we all wish and 
hope every young athlete would also like to be a scholar, matriculate and 
prepare for life after sport," Steinberg said. "The reality is, that doesn't 
happen currently."

WALTRIP DOESN'T DREAD DAYTONA 500 NOW; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO RACING: LAST YEAR'S VICTORY WAS A RELIEF TO THE VETERAN DRIVER WHO HAD 
NEVER WON THE RACE BEFORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A foolish grin crosses Darrell Waltrip's face just about every time the thought 
pops into his head that he is the defending champion of the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
He will suddenly launch into an impromptu dance step or blurt out something 
like "Yeah! All right!" when he thinks about the victory that kick-started a 
nearly dormant career. 
</P>
<P>
For 17 humbling and frustrating years, the 2 1/2-mile, high-banked oval at 
Daytona International Speedway brought Waltrip to his knees and made him wonder 
if it simply was ordained for him to never win the crown jewel of NASCAR 
Winston Cup stock car racing. 
</P>
<P>
But Waltrip, 43, finally won the big one last February, taking the monkey off 
his back forever by taking the risk of running the last 125 miles without 
pitting for gas. 
</P>
<P>
He finished the race with little enough in his tank that crew chief Jeff 
Hammond said, "I could have drank what was left without getting sick." 
</P>
<P>
They won that race in a Chevrolet Monte Carlo -- the winningest model in NASCAR 
history. But Chevy introduced the Lumina to the NASCAR wars just before 
mid-season and this will be the new model's first Daytona 500, although the 
cars were used here in last year's Pepsi 400 in July. 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip, who was fourth in the 1989 season standings behind champion Rusty 
Wallace, said, "We're pretty happy with the Lumina at Daytona. We don't have a 
big advantage, but it will be as good or better than anything than will be 
there. I'm counting on it getting some good gas mileage." 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying for the Feb. 18 season opener begins this weekend, with Waltrip 
among the favorites to win the pole and the race. 
</P>
<P>
As much as Waltrip enjoyed winning the race last year and aborting the "Why 
can't you win at Daytona?" questions, it's now another season. Last year's 
victories -- six in all -- have to be put aside while Waltrip, rejuvenated not 
only by his Daytona 500 victory but also by being voted the 1989 most popular 
driver by the fans, concentrates on getting a good start toward what he hopes 
will be his fourth Winston Cup championship and first since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Waltrip, who was suspected of being over the hill or not hungry any 
more after poor seasons in 1987 and 1988, heads into 1990 as the favorite of 
many racing people to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're right," Waltrip said enthusiastically, a grin lighting up his 
face. "We feel like we'll win the pole at Daytona; we feel like we'll win as 
many races as we did in 1989, and we think we're gonna win the championship in 
'90. Do I sound optimistic?" 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip came to Hendrick Motorsports in 1987 after a very successful six-year 
run with Junior Johnson, who helped the driver to all of his Winston Cup 
titles. Only three victories and few other successes came along in the first 
two years carrying Rick Hendrick's banner. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty-seven was a particularly tough year," said Waltrip, who considered 
retiring when he turned 40. "Stevie (his wife) was pregnant, there was a lot of 
tension there and nothing was going right at the race track. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to a point (in 1988) where I didn't have a lot of confidence in the car 
or in myself," Waltrip said. "I got to thinking that my decision to quit 
(driving) at 40 was the right one. 
</P>
<P>
"But, by that time, we had (daughter) Jessica and we started out last year by 
winning the Daytona 500 and, now, I'm right back where I was in 1980. I'm 
starting the 1990s the same way I started the '80s. Last year was as good a 
year as I've had since the early '80s. I'm proud of it. This team did a great 
job (in 1989)." 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip was the winningest driver of the last decade, winning 57 races and 34 
pole positions, as well as tying Dale Earnhardt for the most season titles 
during that period. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite his success last season, some people have accused the Franklin, 
Tenn., resident, of lacking the killer instinct on the track, where the most 
recent superstars of Winston Cup racing -- Earnhardt and Wallace -- have gained 
a reputation for aggressive and sometimes nasty driving. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some guys out there who seem to be thinking lead at all costs, win 
at all costs," Waltrip said. "I just want to lead the last lap -- or the last 
three feet. I'm not willing to take the chances that some of these guys are. 
</P>
<P>
"If the gain is worth the chance, I'll go for it. If it isn't, I just won't do 
it. I've been able to win without taking those chances. If everybody races 
liked I do, it'd probably be boring for the fans, but there are enough guys out 
there who race the other way."

FOR MARYLAND'S TEAMS, NO MORE EXCUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The University of Maryland's immediate task in the wake of the Bob Wade fiasco 
was relatively simple. Don't run afoul of the NCAA, and win a few games. That, 
however, is apparently asking a lot in College Park. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Williams, the basketball coach who seems very close to turning things 
around quickly, broke an NCAA rule. He admits breaking one critical rule once, 
and sources say he broke it with the full knowledge of the athletic director -- 
Lew Perkins -- whose job it is to make sure his coaches uphold the NCAA rules. 
Where was Perkins said to be while Williams was breaking the rule? Standing 
beside him, watching him break it. 
</P>
<P>
Is the rule Williams broke -- watching practice before Oct. 15 -- as big a deal 
as paying a player or flying him home or letting him use the coach's phone 
credit card? Of course not. Is the rule Williams broke a legitimate one, as 
opposed to those hundred other picky guidelines the NCAA enforces selectively? 
Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, kids play basketball every day, whether or not adults watch. But without 
the 'no organized practice before Oct. 15' rule, every college basketball coach 
in the country would have players in a structured practice environment 365 days 
a year. This is one of the key rules separating professional basketball players 
from college students. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not be naive about this; Williams isn't the only coach in the nation who 
watches practice before Oct. 15. And plenty of coaches organize practices 
before Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
So why blame Gary Williams? He comes to the rescue at Maryland, his alma mater, 
at a time when he is desperately needed. He's already won more games this 
season than most people could reasonably have expected. The team is competitive 
in the ACC again, the players seem happier than they have been in four years, 
the fans and the excitement are back in Cole Field House. So why jump on 
Williams for doing something many of his colleagues do every year? Because 
Maryland can't afford any more bullet holes in its foot. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland is the school whose star basketball player (Len Bias) died of a 
cocaine overdose in June 1986, whose famous and successful head coach (Lefty 
Driesell) was forced out in October 1986 in the wake of that scandal, whose 
next head coach (Bob Wade) was so in over his head he got caught cheating to 
get back a player (Rudy Archer) who had flunked out and wasn't exactly a star. 
Now Williams gets caught watching practice. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has the burden, unfortunately for him, of having to improve not only 
the Maryland basketball program but what it is perceived to be. If anybody 
needed to get an early start on righting a sinking ship, Williams perhaps 
figured, it was him. But the perception is that Maryland, no matter how many 
times warned, cheated again. 
</P>
<P>
There are too many eyes on Williams at Maryland -- eyes belonging to those 
still loyal to Driesell and Wade and even the eyes of some NCAA investigators. 
With that microscopic examination, such an obvious rules violation as watching 
an early practice could hardly go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
You know how easy it is to observe a coach watching practice at Cole Field 
House? Nothing's easier. Cole is open to the public just about all the time. 
Anybody can see it, which is just the reason Williams should have put on a 
sleep mask every day when he left his office (which sits right on top of the 
open gymnasium) if necessary to avoid being perceived as another Maryland coach 
who will skirt the rules. 
</P>
<P>
But clearly he did not and so again we're forced to ask: What did Maryland know 
and when did Maryland know it? If the violation occurred in October, why did 
Perkins wait until January to report it? 
</P>
<P>
Now, we might expect to hear the voices of Wade's supporters, who may say that 
less than decisive action in this case would prove a double standard exists at 
Maryland, if a white coach who violates the rules isn't dealt with as was Wade. 
This is yet another reason university officials cannot simply look the other 
way and attempt to return to business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to know where exactly to draw the line at Maryland these days. 
But this much is clear: everybody will be watching Williams and now, Perkins. 
Inside and outside of Cole Field House. If they as much as jaywalk, they'll get 
nailed. Instead of slipping through its initial bout with the NCAA with nothing 
more than a firm slap on the wrist, Maryland now runs the risk of incurring a 
substantial penalty, which would prove to be the latest in a series of 
embarrassments. 
</P>
<P>
I've known Gary Williams for 10 years and there's never been anything that 
suggests he maliciously violates NCAA rules. As Wade was being shown the door 
last May, I thought Williams was the best man in the country for the Maryland 
job and I still do. He's bright, nobody works harder and nobody cares more 
about seeing Maryland rejuvenated than he does. 
</P>
<P>
Having been head basketball coach at American, Boston College and Ohio State, 
Williams knows the rules backward, or should. Maryland officials said during 
the Wade inquiry that not knowing the rules was no excuse for Wade (a novice 
with no collegiate head coaching experience before Maryland). So what could be 
the excuse for Williams? 
</P>
<P>
Williams himself said Thursday that what he did is inexcusable, which is more 
than Wade ever said following his involvement in 10 of the 18 violations 
Maryland admitted committing under his regime. At the least, Williams should be 
contrite. And he should be accountable. There can be no more next times at 
Maryland.

THIS BASKETBALL TRANSFER FIGURES TO GET A BIG FOLLOWING

<P>
Mike Lanier is the tallest player in college basketball and the tallest twin in 
the world. He's used to being the center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
But never like this. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier is turning heads at more than 80 universities, where recruiters promise 
to stitch a custom uniform to fit his 7-foot-6 frame. 
</P>
<P>
He is leaving Hardin-Simmons University at the end of the season because the 
small Baptist school in West Texas decided to drop its basketball program from 
NCAA Division I status next year. 
</P>
<P>
The school that lands Lanier also will have to remodel his dorm room, raise the 
shower head and build him a special bed. And when the team travels by air, 
they'll have to make sure Lanier sits alone in a first class row or at least 
gets the seat by the emergency exit. It has more leg room. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier, who weighs 285 pounds, is just a tad taller than twin brother Jim, who 
plays for the University of Denver. They're identical in weight and appearance, 
though Mike is a better basketball player. The Guinness Book of World Records 
lists them as the world's tallest twins. 
</P>
<P>
Hardin-Simmons Coach Dennis Harp said he gets an average of five calls a day 
regarding his 20-year-old center, who stands 7-7 when he dons his sneakers and 
can dunk the ball without jumping. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's one from Drake," Harp said, flipping through pink call-back messages on 
his desk. "UCLA, another from Kansas State. N.C. State. Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'll probably have two or three more at my house when I get home tonight. 
And every last one of them wants to know about Mike." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows him better than Harp, the only Division I coach who offered Lanier 
a scholarship when he graduated from high school in Troy, Mich., two years, 20 
pounds and 2 inches ago. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Lanier was another undiscovered, uncoordinated big center. 
</P>
<P>
Hardin-Simmons Athletic Director Merlin Morrow, who has supervised strenuous 
agility drills for Lanier, said Lanier's rampant growth rate had outstripped 
his body's ability to keep up in muscle development and coordination. 
</P>
<P>
Already as tall as Manute Bol of the Golden State Warriors, the tallest man in 
the NBA, Lanier said he could grow a few more inches by his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
But his growth has been stopped for a year now, and that has allowed him to 
improve his game dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to keep adjusting my shot every time I grow," Lanier said. "I hope this 
is it. I don't need to get any taller." 
</P>
<P>
Lanier is averaging 7.5 points, 4.4 rebounds and 1.2 blocked shots, a modest 
output, but considerably better than last season, when he averaged 2.1 points, 
1.7 rebounds and fewer than 10 minutes in 14 games. He blocked seven shots as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
But observers say that because of his height and stubborn work ethic, Lanier 
could develop into an effective professional player, much like Utah Jazz center 
Mark Eaton, who scored only 53 points in his final two college seasons at UCLA 
but since has emerged as one of the foremost defensive players in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
One college coach who saw Eaton as a sophomore at Cypress College, recently 
visited Hardin-Simmons to see Lanier. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is farther along at this stage than Eaton was," said the coach, who asked 
not to be identified because he is recruiting Lanier. "Mike is a little more 
mobile and has a little more skill in his shooting touch." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lanier "won't ever run down any rabbits, he will always have an impact 
on every game he plays simply because of his size," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the numbers are deceiving, said Harp, suggesting that if there were such 
a statistic as affecting an opponent's shot, Lanier would be the clear 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching films, you notice that he alters his man's shot at least eight times 
a game, forces them to try something they usually don't do," he said. "When you 
can do that, you're awesome." 
</P>
<P>
No explanation exists for the Lanier twins' size. Both were 7-4 by their 
sophomore year in high school, and medical tests reveal no abnormalities, 
Lanier said. 
</P>
<P>
Their father is 6-3 and their mother 6-1. But they have a 5-6 sister and a 5-9 
brother. Lanier jokes that he used to think his mother "might have taken some 
kind of growth pill when she was pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
Lanier has never had a car, because he doesn't fit in them. His parents had to 
tear the middle seat out of the family van in high school so that Mike and Jim 
could fit in the back and not have to walk everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Hardin-Simmons had to remodel Lanier's dorm room, building a 7 1/2-foot bed, 
raising the ceiling and lowering the floor in his shower. 
</P>
<P>
"And the shower head still hits me in the chest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He cannot work out at Hardin-Simmons' weight room because the angles of 
adjustment on the equipment are mismatched for his height, and the university 
has no free weights. 
</P>
<P>
Lanier, who would be eligible to play immediately after his transfer, hopes to 
redshirt a year so his skills can catch up to his height. And a key to 
improving his agility and strength are good weight training facilities. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to announce his choice of schools in late March. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will have a tall order to fill: Lanier doesn't want to play a 
run-and-gun offense. "I can't play for a fast team," he said. "My body won't 
let me." 
</P>
<P>
Lanier, who said he "used to hate being this tall," now describes his enormous 
height as "a burden that's becoming a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
"I realize I got a shot to play pro ball, if only I can find the right college 
program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
LSU Coach Dale Brown approached Lanier after a game last month to discuss the 
possibility playing for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Brown exulted his strength-and-speed coach and the advantages Lanier would gain 
from regularly practicing against LSU's 7-2 Stanley Roberts and 7-1 Shaquille 
O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
"I try harder against bigger guys," Lanier conceded. "Playing against small 
guys won't make me good enough to go pro." 
</P>
<P>
But Lanier refuses to say if he is leaning toward LSU or any other school. 
</P>
<P>
He'll only say that he won't attend Denver, where his brother is averaging 2 
points and 2 rebounds and also plans to redshirt next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair," Lanier said. "It wasn't fair in high school, where one of us 
was the 'practice guy' and one the 'game guy.' We had to share playing time. 
That's why we decided to go to different colleges." 
</P>
<P>
Lanier said he's looking forward to the summer, when he will hit the weights 
again and play some one-on-one with his twin. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my favorite game," he said, "one-on-one with Jim. He's the only one I 
can find that's my size."

MOSCOW YOUNGSTERS MAKING A BASKETBALL TOUR

GONZALES, La.

<P>
Fourteen young basketball players from Moscow began a 12-day, five-game tour of 
south Louisiana Friday, playing electronic games at a retail franchise, 
checking out the clothes at a Western wear store and watching their friends 
from St. Amant High play a game at Tara High in Baton Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
The visit follows a December trip by the St. Amant basketball team to Moscow 
for four games against Soviet prep teams. St. Amant was 3-1 against the 
Russians. 
</P>
<P>
St. Amant High raised about $50,000 to send its team to Moscow and another 
$15,000 to defray expenses of the Soviet team here, most of the money from 
corporate sponsorships, said St. Amant Coach Kent Schexnaydre. 
</P>
<P>
From such simple beginnings, it is hoped, great bonds will be forged between 
the world's two super powers. 
</P>
<P>
"You know this is a wonderful opportunity our countries have. If we start doing 
it at that level -- you know, small, 15 or 20 kids -- that's how you've got to 
start," said David Young, owner of a Gonzales consulting firm who helped set up 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"And so I mean it's been a good project to me because of that. If we're going 
to start building a bridge between our two countries, you've got to start at 
that level." 
</P>
<P>
The team's itinerary includes sightseeing throughout the bayou country of 
southeast Louisiana and games games at St. Amant on Feb. 12, in New Orleans 
against Archbishop Shaw on Feb. 14 and St. Augustine on Feb. 15, at East 
Ascension High on Feb. 17 and at Catholic High of Baton Rouge on Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Between games, the team and six chaperones have a full itinerary of 
sightseeing, including boat tours of the Mississippi River and Blind River, a 
visit to an alligator farm, a tour of the Houmas House plantation, a rodeo at 
Louisiana State, a visit to the French Quarter and a taste of pre-Mardi Gras 
festivities in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Young said the exchange was unique in that it brought together teams 
representing schools instead of national teams. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who arranged Louisiana chef John Folse's culinary exhibition in Moscow 
during the 1988 summit meeting between President Reagan and Soviet President 
Mikhail Gorbachev, said St. Amant coach Kent Schnexnaydre, a longtime friend, 
approached him with the team exchange idea early last year. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Gomelsky, a basketball commentator for Soviet national television 
serving as a team interpreter, said he was elated when Young brought up the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I had two thoughts in my mind when David explained to me about the exchange," 
Gomelsky said. "First, it will be very useful for the youth of both countries 
to get acquainted to communicate with each other on the basketball court and 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"The other thing is that I am from a basketball family. My grandmother, my 
mother, my father, all of them are coaches ... I like basketball so much that 
any possibility to enlarge basketball contacts between our two countries is 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"On every age level, I would like to enlarge basketball contacts between the 
United States and the USSR. That's why I liked the idea very much and tried my 
best to make it possible." 
</P>
<P>
Gomelsky's father, Alexander Gomelsky, is the president of the Soviet 
Basketball Federation and coached the 1988 Soviet basketball team that won the 
Olympic gold medal. He arranged the Soviet end of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The dangers of capitalist distractions were not lost on some of the Soviet 
players, however. 
</P>
<P>
Slova Zeshienov, 15, was already sizing up the possibilities -- five minutes 
off the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are very nice. They are very interesting," Zeshienov said. "And all 
the television and everything is different and is fascinating. But I want to 
try to concentrate on the games." 
</P>
<P>
And just how confident was the teen-age good will ambassador from one of 
Moscow's elite prep sports schools? 
</P>
<P>
"All of them, obviously," Zeshinov said when asked for a prediction on how many 
games his team would win in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Bezrodnov, 17, the oldest member of the Soviet team, said he hoped to 
hone his skills against the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see the American style of the game. I want to gain the 
experience and become a better all-around basketball player," Bezrodnov said. 
"Basically for me, the basketball experience will be -- speaking about my 
future career as a basketball player -- more important, but I am still very 
excited about all the other parts of our staying here." 
</P>
<P>
And like the smart American athlete, Bezrodnov was a little more cautious in 
assessing his team's chances in the series. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll win one, for sure," he said.

'89 MONTEBELLO COUNCIL RACE COSTLIEST YET; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: THE RECORD SPENDING WAS SPURRED IN PART BY AN ORANGE COUNTY GROUP 
SPENDING $50,600 TO BEAT TWO CANDIDATES.

MONTEBELLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hard-fought campaigns for three City Council seats last November were the 
costliest in city history, fueled in part by an Orange County political group's 
$50,600 effort to defeat two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Seven candidates and two political action committees spent about $250,000 in a 
race that sparked personal attacks in mailers and sharp exchanges over whether 
the city should be given more power to condemn land for redevelopment. Two 
other candidates listed no expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens for a Safer Montebello, a Costa Mesa-based organization, spent almost 
$30,000 on a mailing blitz attacking candidates William Molinari and Larry 
Salazar, who opposed a plan to expand the city's eminent domain powers, 
according to campaign financial statements. The committee spent another $21,000 
on telephone surveys and mailers in support of hospital administrator Joseph 
Coria's unsuccessful campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Molinari, who had served five years on the council before being defeated in 
1987, captured one of the council seats in the November race. Salazar finished 
fourth in the race for three seats. Mayor Ed Pizzorno and Councilman Arnold 
Alvarez-Glasman were reelected. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens for a Safer Montebello is headed by Brad Perrin, secretary and 
treasurer of a Santa Ana-based company that runs the Quiet Cannon restaurant 
and discotheque in Montebello. The committee's effort was funded entirely by 
Bear Tracks Corp., a Tustin-based construction consulting firm that lists 
Perrin as president. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials had hoped the issue of eminent domain had died when the 
city's residents voted 3 to 1 last May to keep the city from condemning land to 
redevelop portions of south and central Montebello, but the issue surfaced 
during the November council campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Though eminent domain was used to develop land in north Montebello, candidates 
were divided on whether the condemnation powers should be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
Some argued it was viable tool to revitalize the town's business district. 
Others described it as a plot to level old houses and business in the largely 
industrial south side of Montebello. The opponents argued that longtime 
business owners and homeowners would be unfairly moved off their property to 
make way for larger private developments. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Alvarez-Glasman, a target of eminent domain opponents, apparently 
emerged as the biggest spender in his successful effort to retain his seat. 
Alvarez-Glasman, who has yet to file his final financial statement, said in an 
interview last week that his campaign cost about $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, he voted with the council majority in 1988 to give the city 
Redevelopment Agency expanded condemnation powers. But as criticism mounted 
during the City Council campaign, he pledged he would not vote for eminent 
domain again as a city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez-Glasman said he was "amazed" at the high cost of last year's campaign 
and attributed the expense to the "mudslinging that goes on." He said smear 
campaigns have become so prevalent that the only way to combat them is with a 
high-profile campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that so much money has to go into a campaign," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the election -- about 47% higher than the 1987 council election in 
which four candidates ran for two seats -- and the heavy financial involvement 
of Citizens for a Safer Montebello, was criticized by Molinari and Salazar last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like we said all along," Salazar said. "Special interest groups are, for 
some reason, trying to control the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
One mailer, sent to Montebello residents by Citizens for a Safer Montebello, 
was a "Special Report" which proclaimed that the Montebello Police and 
Firemen's Assn. was concerned about Molinari's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer said a letter from the association accused Molinari of "spreading 
lies designed to terrorize senior citizens and homeowners to further his 
personal political ambition." 
</P>
<P>
The association denied any knowledge of the piece, and its lawyer demanded that 
Citizens for a Safer Montebello stop using the association's name, said 
Montebello Police Detective Ralph Newcomb, former vice president of the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar and his "ongoing circus act," -- a reference to his council campaign -- 
were also castigated in the mailer. Salazar said the day he became a leader in 
the fight against eminent domain, he became Perrin's political foe. 
</P>
<P>
Perrin did not return several phone calls last week. 
</P>
<P>
Molinari's adversarial relationship with Brad Perrin and his father, David, 
goes back to 1987 when he voted against the expansion of the Quiet Cannon and 
the creation of a $1.1-million parking lot to accommodate the expansion.

Molinari became the target of biting mailers by a David Perrin political action 
committee during the 1987 City Council election. The committee also requested 
that the district attorney's office investigate Molinari's campaign finances 
two weeks before the election, then almost immediately sent out a mailer that 
stated, "even the district attorney's office has been asked to investigate 
Councilman Molinari." The district attorney referred the request to the Fair 
Political Practices Committee, which later found no basis to investigate 
Molinari. 
</P>
<P>
Molinari lost the 1987 election. 
</P>
<P>
Molinari sued David Perrin; local developer Michael Minasian, who organized 
David Perrin's committee; Quiet Cannon Montebello Inc. of Santa Ana; chief 
operating officer Kenneth Dennis, and others for libel in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Because the suit is still pending, Molinari declined to comment specifically 
about the Perrins, Quiet Cannon Montebello Inc., or the Bear Tracks Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But he said: "Generally, I have a concern whenever any outside organization for 
political or financial reasons puts that kind of money into a local city 
council election. It's like bringing a battleship in to sink a rowboat. . . . I 
can't understand why any economic interest 40 miles away would have that kind 
of interest in a community they don't live in." 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Art Payan and Alvarez-Glasman, while expressing some concern over 
the amount of money Citizens for a Safer Montebello spent during the campaign, 
questioned the description of the committee's sponsors as "outside interests." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say they are truly outside interests," Alvarez-Glasman said. "I 
believe they are the No. 1 sales-tax revenue producers in the city. They 
certainly have an interest in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Before the election last November, Citizens for a Safer Montebello also 
declared its support for Alvarez-Glasman. But he did not receive direct 
contributions from the committee, according to its campaign statement. 
</P>
<P>
Payan, who in 1987 spent about $51,000 on his reelection campaign, said he 
would like to find a way to lower campaign expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for a candidate when he realizes that in order to be 
competitive he has to pour so much money into a race," Payan said. "It gets out 
of hand."

Council race -- A story about the cost of the 1989 Montebello City Council 
election (Times, Feb. 11) incorrectly listed Quiet Cannon Montebello Inc. as a 
defendant in a libel suit filed by Montebello City Councilman William Molinari. 
The same story referred to David Perrin as the organizer of a political action 
committee that opposed Molinari during the 1987 council election. Campaign 
disclosure statements do not list Perrin as either an organizer or member of 
the political action committee. The statements show only that Perrin 
contributed $950 to the committee.

OWNER GIVES UP ON OLD THEATER, DECIDES TO SELL

The owner of the rundown Whittier Theater is selling out because he is tired of 
fighting with the city and conservationists over the fate of the Depression-era 
landmark, according to an associate. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Doerkin has put the theater up for sale, making way for a buyer to either 
restore or demolish it, said Don Gerstein, an executive and spokesman for 
Doerkin Properties Inc. of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of dealing with Whittier," Gerstein said. "We're going to put our 
tail between our legs and go on to something else." 
</P>
<P>
Gerstein would not disclose how much Doerkin is asking for the theater, which 
he purchased for about $1.1 million from the Pacific Theater chain in 1987. "We 
are not asking an excessive amount," Gerstein said. "We want enough to recover 
our costs." 
</P>
<P>
The historic film palace at Hadley Avenue and Whittier Boulevard has been at 
the center of debate since before the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
When Doerkin purchased the theater in June, 1987, he told the council he was 
going to restore it and convert it to a performing arts center. But several 
months later, he asked the city for permission to replace the theater with a 
$14-million shopping plaza because, he said, fixing up the theater would be a 
losing proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The council had not yet acted on Doerkin's request when the 5.9-magnitude 
earthquake rocked the area in October, 1987, severely damaging the historic 
building. 
</P>
<P>
City building inspectors ordered that the theater be demolished because they 
said the earthquake had made it unsafe. A wrecking crew worked on the theater 
for about 45 minutes in November, 1987, before lawyers for the Whittier 
Conservancy -- which had successfully argued in court that the city had to 
obtain an environmental impact report before razing the theater -- arrived with 
a restraining order to stop the destruction.

EPA WANTS SUPER AGENCY TO HANDLE WATER CLEANUP 
</P>

<P>
Federal environmental authorities are urging designation of a single local 
"super agency" to take charge of cleaning up the San Gabriel Valley's 
contaminated well water. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a local super agency to coordinate cleanup efforts was suggested in 
a three-page report, released here recently, on the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency's analysis of the valley's polluted water. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been suffering from a lack of leadership," said John Wise, EPA deputy 
regional administrator who endorsed the super agency plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Without that driving force," cleanup efforts will fail, said Wise, whose 
agency has spent $10 million investigating pollution in the San Gabriel Valley 
water basin. 
</P>
<P>
His comments came as federal, state and local officials met here late last 
month to seek a unified strategy to improve water quality in the basin, which 
serves 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the state Water Resources Control Board embraced the 
proposal, although they said legislation might be required to create a new 
agency or expand the authority of an existing one. 
</P>
<P>
But some valley water officials expressed skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fear of another agency on top of existing ones," said Burton E. 
Jones, president of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Water Municipal Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
In the federal report, EPA officials caution that if one agency is not given 
broad authority to clean up water pollution, "EPA may be unable to implement 
necessary remedial actions even if . . . funding is available." 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, local political and water officials agreed to form a task force to 
hasten action against water pollution. At the time, Assemblywoman Sally Tanner 
(D-Baldwin Park) blamed EPA for delays. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, high levels of water pollution, partly the result of industrial 
solvents, were discovered in underground water supplies. Since then, EPA has 
determined that one-fourth of the 400 wells in the area are contaminated. 
Because of that, the agency has placed the San Gabriel Valley on its Superfund 
list and has studied the problem extensively.

UNIT TO EXAMINE MINORITIES IN TEACHER RANKS 
</P>

<DATELINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Curtis McCray, president of Cal State Long Beach, has established a special 
task force at the university to examine the shortage of ethnic minorities 
entering the teaching profession. 
</P>
<P>
"(There is a) national and local crisis in attracting minorities into teaching 
careers," McCray said in a press release announcing formation of the 12-member 
task force. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not just sit back and allow this situation to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the National Education Assn., minorities currently 
compose about 9% of all the teachers in America. But despite the fact that the 
nation's classrooms -- including those in Long Beach -- are being occupied 
increasingly by minority students, the association predicts that by the turn of 
the century only one public school teacher in 20 will be a member of a 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
"Teacher preparation is an important part of the mission of CSULB," McCray 
said. "An important dimension . . . must be minority recruitment strategies." 
</P>
<P>
The president's task force, which will meet regularly, is slated to present its 
recommendations on the matter before Sept. 1.

STATE SENATOR FOLDS EFFORT TO REVISE GAMING LAW; 
</P>
<P>
GAMBLING: THE BILL WAS WITHDRAWN WHEN NO AGREEMENT COULD BE REACHED ON ALLOWING 
JACKPOT POKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A bill introduced last year by state Sen. Robert G. Beverly to overhaul 
California's 99-year-old gaming law appears to be dead in Sacramento. But the 
issue could be revived if card club owners and law enforcement authorities can 
reach an agreement on whether to allow jackpot poker. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, drafted last year by city managers in Bell, Bell Gardens, Huntington 
Park, Gardena and Commerce, would repeal the present gaming law and clarify 
what games would be allowed in the state's casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly, a Manhattan Beach Republican, withdrew his bill from consideration by 
the Senate Governmental Organization Committee when an agreement could not be 
reached on whether jackpot poker should be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would outlaw jackpot poker, a provision endorsed by the California 
Peace Officers Assn. and opposed by the California Card Room Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Under present jackpot poker rules, players compete for two pots -- a regular 
pot that is won on each deal and a bonus pot that accumulates over days or 
weeks. The jackpot grows -- often to as much as $70,000 at the larger clubs -- 
until it is won by a player with a specific hand that varies depending on the 
game being played. 
</P>
<P>
If an agreement can be reached, it is possible that the measure still could be 
considered during this session, according to Joshua Pane, a spokesman for 
Beverly. 
</P>
<P>
"The bill did not get a hearing because there just wasn't agreement, so why 
move forward?" Pane asked. Beverly agreed to sponsor the bill, Pane said, 
because he had been assured that card club owners and law enforcement officials 
could reach a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens City Manager Claude Booker still hopes that a consensus can be 
reached. "We are not giving up on it," said Booker, who spearheaded efforts by 
the city managers to revise the current law. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which dates from 1891, includes regulations on such outdated games as 
hokey pokey and fan-tan. The new legislation would deal with more current 
games, such as pai gow, a popular form of Asian poker, and jackpot poker, both 
of which would be outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
Although both games are being played in Los Angeles area clubs, their legality 
has been the subject of recent court battles. The new law would allow two other 
forms of Asian poker, Super Pan 9 and double-handed poker, and would also allow 
7-card stud and draw poker. 
</P>
<P>
In the complex issue of jackpot poker, a Superior Court judge issued a 
temporary injunction last year that allowed the game to be played in Los 
Angeles County pending a trial. That suit was brought by the Eldorado Club and 
the Normandie Casino in Gardena, the Bell Gardens Bicycle Club and the 
California Commerce Casino. No date has been set for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
But jackpot poker has been halted in more than 300 card rooms elsewhere in the 
state, Department of Justice officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Clemons, chairman of the Peace Officers Assn. gambling committee, said 
the legality of jackpot poker is the last remaining "sticking point" in 
discussions that have been going on for years between law enforcement officials 
and card room owners about which games should be legal. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after the association's gambling committee asked for an opinion on 
whether jackpot poker violated state gaming laws, the state attorney general's 
office issued an opinion calling the game an illegal lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Clemons, who also is director of the division of law enforcement with the state 
attorney general's office, said club owners and police have worked "for months 
on end to define clearly what games could be played and how they could be 
played to get clarity in the law for the industry and for law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
But Clemons expressed doubt that an agreement can be reached about jackpot 
poker. "I don't see any way it can be resolved." he said. "It appears whatever 
clarity we're going to get (will be) from the courts and not the legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Clemons said law enforcement officials remain opposed to jackpot poker because 
some players have complained to police that when they win the jackpot, they do 
not receive the entire amount in the pot. 
</P>
<P>
"We know in some cases money is skimmed off and not given to the players," 
Clemons said. "The players say they don't get the whole jackpot." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Sarakbi, president of the Card Room Owners Assn., said the group has 
proposed that the licensing agencies that monitor club revenues also monitor 
jackpots. 
</P>
<P>
Sarakbi said his group will be meeting today to discuss a compromise proposal 
that would revise the jackpot poker rules. 
</P>
<P>
The game is often played as low-ball jackpot poker, in which the second-lowest 
hand possible wins the jackpot if another player has the lowest hand possible, 
which is ace, two, three, four and five. The second-lowest hand must be ace, 
two, three, four and six. While the second-lowest hand would win the jackpot, 
the lowest hand would take the pot for that particular game. The attorney 
general's opinion said the game is illegal because the aspect of chance 
dominates over skill. 
</P>
<P>
Under revised rules being proposed by card club owners, the best hand would win 
the jackpot, Sarakbi said, and therefore skill would be the decisive factor in 
who wins. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to definitely reach an agreement and get this legislation," said 
Sarakbi, who is also general manager of the California Commerce Club. "This 
would clear up the whole industry and get a definite understanding between the 
Police Officers Assn. and the club owners so each side would know exactly where 
they stand."

REFORMERS ASSAIL REDISTRICTING PROCESS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: TWO EXPERTS ON REAPPORTIONMENT SAY THE SYSTEM IS STACKED AGAINST 
NEWCOMERS. THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE WAY THE LINES ARE DRAWN.

Meet Alan Heslop and Leroy Hardy, reformed "datagogues." 
</P>
<P>
The oddly matched pair, senior researchers at the Rose Institute in Claremont, 
are experts on political reapportionment. Armed with census tract profiles and 
political data, the two have faced off in some of California's most notorious 
partisan brawls to draw realigned congressional and legislative districts. 
</P>
<P>
Both have worked for the "gerrycrats," legislators who concoct the 
octopus-shaped gerrymandered districts that, by most accounts, have served to 
ensure that incumbents get reelected. Heslop is a George Bush Republican, Hardy 
a Jesse Jackson Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Now the two want to reform the state's once-a-decade, line-drawing process. 
They want to take reapportionment out of the hands of the "datagogues" and 
"gerrycrats" (Hardy's and Heslop's own terms), make it more representative of 
the state's communities and shake up the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've both gagged at what's been going on," said Heslop, 51, a tall, 
lanky man with a shock of white hair. "The system has become more and more 
abusive, more and more corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent redistricting, in 1982, was "unconscionable," said Hardy, 62, a 
short, husky Democrat, with wire-rimmed glasses. "The worst cases represent the 
murder of representative government." 
</P>
<P>
Partly, they said, the redistricting process in California has suffered from 
the influence of men like themselves. So abundant and sophisticated is the data 
that is available now to the political technicians, so fine-tuned are the 
strategies devised by incumbents to protect their domains, that newcomers do 
not have a chance, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should the voter have to play in a game that's stacked?" Heslop asked. 
</P>
<P>
Heslop was a senior consultant to the Republican legislative leadership in 
1971, when then-Gov. Ronald Reagan vetoed a Legislature-approved redistricting 
plan. Hardy was a consultant to the California congressional delegation from 
the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, working on a series of controversial 
remappings. 
</P>
<P>
The two, who have relinquished their role as party consultants, see themselves 
as disinterested reformers now. But their practical experiences have given them 
authority, they said. "One problem with political scientists is that too many 
are removed from politics," Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposals that Leroy and I have developed do not come from the ivory 
tower," Heslop added. 
</P>
<P>
By federal law, the Legislature must draw new district lines every 10 years to 
reflect the population changes recorded by the U.S. Census. The next census 
count will take place this year; redistricting will be done in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, it was done with street maps and educated hunches, Hardy said. 
The majority party in the Legislature, which dictates the terms of 
redistricting, tried to draw lines that maximized its number of representatives 
and protected its incumbents against challengers. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in 1961, you'd draw a line over to, say, Vermont Avenue and try to 
estimate the population (in a would-be district)," Hardy said. "Now, you can be 
precise about exactly how many Republicans and Democrats, blacks or Latinos, 
there are in a given area. It's not good enough? Then why not extend the line 
over to Normandie Avenue?" 
</P>
<P>
"You can do it in minutes," said Heslop. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 17 years, the Rose Institute, a political research department at 
Claremont McKenna College, has been the source of the raw data that the 
"redistricters" have used. For example, it supplied the data used in 1981 to 
draw new districts for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, and it 
provided data to the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund to 
initiate a voting rights suit challenging the legality of those districts. 
</P>
<P>
The institute, which some Democrats have accused of being a "Republican think 
tank," is a modest little suite of offices on East 9th Street, with painted 
cinder-block walls and video terminals laid out on long tables. 
</P>
<P>
But its reach can extend across the state or it can stretch back a couple of 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Research Assistant Darren Schreiber spreads out a transparent map overlay and, 
using an electronic wand, circumscribes a large swath of the San Gabriel 
Valley. He punches some numbers into a keyboard, the computer chatters and 
burps and a set of statistics rolls across a video screen. 
</P>
<P>
This is politics in the 1990s -- bolstered with instantaneously available 
demographic and political data. 
</P>
<P>
The young man has outlined an area, stretching from Monterey Park to El Monte, 
which could become the heart of a new Latino-dominated County Board of 
Supervisors district. According to data displayed on the screen, 58.9% of its 
population is Latino and 63.3% of its registered voters are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
By tweaking the stored data, Schreiber can tell you how Michael S. Dukakis did 
there, precinct by precinct, in the 1988 presidential election, how people 
there voted on gun control or a nuclear weapons freeze in 1982, how a local 
congressman was rated in 1986 by Americans for Democratic Action or, if 
necessary, how many flush toilets there are on each block. There are 20,000 
political and demographic variables in the Rose Institute's data banks. 
</P>
<P>
With that kind of capability, districts can be drawn that are unassailably safe 
for either Democrats or Republicans, say Heslop and Hardy. Past 
reapportionments have produced -- with the admitted assistance of the two 
"born-again" critics of the system -- districts that cut across city or county 
boundaries or connect centers of population with narrow corridors. 
</P>
<P>
One result has been a suspiciously high rate of return for elected officials, 
Heslop and Hardy said. In the past three general elections, only one incumbent 
in the 40-member state Senate and three incumbents in the 80-member Assembly 
have been defeated. 
</P>
<P>
"The turnover rate is higher in the U.S. Supreme Court (whose members are 
appointed for life) than it is in the California congressional delegation," 
Heslop said. 
</P>
<P>
But the worst fallout, the two critics said, has been the spread of voter 
apathy. With little sense of community among constituents in oddly shaped, 
multicity districts, grass-roots movements give way to media consultants, they 
said. And minority groups and women have been largely dealt out of the system, 
they added. 
</P>
<P>
With redistricting only a year away, these issues are obviously on a lot of 
people's minds. Two redistricting initiatives have qualified for the June 
ballot -- one would establish a bipartisan redistricting commission and the 
other would impose new restraints on legislative redistricting. Atty. Gen. John 
Van de Kamp has also proposed that term limitations of 12 years be imposed on 
state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
But Heslop and Hardy have devised a system of "units of redistricting" -- URs, 
for short -- by which they divide the state into 180 or more units of equal 
population. "The essence of the UR," Heslop said, "is that it be a 
community-based, compact unit of territory. It really doesn't matter how many 
of them (there) are, as long as there are a lot more of them than districts." 
</P>
<P>
The URs, which would be numbered in sequence, could be drawn by a multi-ethnic, 
bipartisan commission, they said. "The commission's duty is to draw units that 
reflect today's neighborhoods, that have a sense of community identity," Heslop 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the actual districts would be pieced together by a strictly adhered-to 
system, free of political pressures. A UR would be selected randomly as a 
starting point, then electoral districts would be patched together, using the 
URs as sequential building blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Heslop said the greatest hope for the Heslop-Hardy system may be a deadlock 
next year between a Democratic-controlled Legislature and a Republican 
governor. A veto from the governor could land the state's redistricting dilemma 
in the state Supreme Court -- which, in a similar situation, imposed its own 
redistricting plan in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts don't want to be in the business of drawing political lines," 
Heslop said. If the court perceived the system as politically neutral, he said, 
the Heslop-Hardy system could be "a dream come true."

DIGEST: MARTIN CHOOSES N. ARIZONA OVER FULLERTON FOR FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lance Martin, The Times' Ventura County Lineman of the Year, made an oral 
commitment Saturday to attend Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a 6-foot-1, 218-pound middle linebacker who led Thousand Oaks High in 
tackles last season, chose between offers from Northern Arizona and Cal State 
Fullerton after visiting both campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked Fullerton too, but the difference was the college-town look at NAU," 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Deena Drossin, a junior from Agoura High, placed third in the junior girls' 
division of the U. S. World Cross-Country Trials in Seattle on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin placed third in 13 minutes 44 seconds over the four-kilometer course. 
Melody Fairchild, a junior from Boulder, Colo., who won the Kinney national 
cross-country title last fall, was first in 12:47. Jamie Park, a freshman at 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, was second in 13:07. 
</P>
<P>
By finishing among the top six individuals, Drossin will advance with the U. S. 
Junior National team to the world championships in France on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
John Johnson of Palmdale High has made an oral commitment to play football at 
Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
A defensive back and wide receiver, Johnson was the only player in the Golden 
League to be named to the all-league first team on offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
Tisha Walker of Thousand Oaks finished ninth in the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships, which ended Saturday in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old Walker placed eighth in free skating among 16 competitors in 
the senior women's division. 
</P>
<P>
She improved from 15th place in the compulsory figures earlier in the week.

GLENDALE PULLS INTO TIE FOR SECOND IN THE WSC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trailing by 14 points at halftime, the Glendale College men's basketball team 
came back to register an important 65-61 Western State Conference win over host 
Santa Monica on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's Bruce Heicke, who finished with 17 points and eight steals, capped 
the rally by making both ends of a one-and-one free-throw opportunity with 10 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (20-10, 8-4 in conference play) is tied for second place with Santa 
Monica (24-7, 8-4). Both teams trail first-place Valley by three games. 
</P>
<P>
In other men's games: 
</P>
<P>
Valley 107, Bakersfield 79 -- Five players, led by Steve Ward with 25 points, 
scored in double figures as Valley romped to a WSC win over host Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (20-9, 11-1) scored 62 points in the second half. Shawn DeLaittre scored 
19 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, and Andre Harrell (17 points), McArthur 
Wells (14 points) and Shelton Boykin (12 points, 10 rebounds) also had big 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark 84, Cuesta 64 -- Roger Thomas scored 23 points and teammates Sam 
Crawford and Mike Waggoner scored 16 and 15 points to lead Moorpark (20-8, 8-3) 
to a WSC Northern Division win at home. Crawford handed out 16 assists while 
Greg Taylor pulled down a team-high 10 rebounds for Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Canyons 11, Cerritos 3 -- Chris Vasquez went five for five with six runs batted 
in as host Canyons (3-1) defeated the defending state champions. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark 1, Mission 0 -- Jeff Berman outdueled Nick Lymberopoulos in a battle 
of right-handers in a nonconference game at Moorpark. Moorpark (2-2) scored its 
only run in the third inning when Darren Furlong singled and Mike Suarez 
doubled him home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Canyons 87, Pierce 60 -- Michelle Cabaldon scored a game-high 19 points and 
Tressie Millender and Debbie Bernardo scored 15 and 14 to lead Canyons (9-3 in 
conference play) to a WSC win at Pierce. Millender also had 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce (10-17, 3-9) was led by Carol Schoenmann's 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge 55, Chapman 53 -- Denna Mulverhill scored a team-high 10 
points for CSUN (10-14, 7-2), while teammates Haily Griffith (nine rebounds) 
and Julie Arlotto added nine and eight points to lead the Lady Matadors to a 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. win at home. 
</P>
<P>
Valley 78, Bakersfield 68 -- Claudia Rocha came off the bench to score a 
team-high 18 points -- 14 in the second half -- to lead Valley (25-4, 11-1) to 
a WSC win. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BOYS' BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>

SHAKY FINALES IN MARMONTE EXACT A PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who control their own destiny, as was learned from Friday night's 
make-or-break Marmonte League showdowns, often lose control. 
</P>
<P>
For openers, Royal High and high-scoring forward Russell Myers, a victory away 
from an outright league title, lost to visiting Simi Valley, 58-48. The 
Highlanders earned a co-championship -- Royal's first title since 1971 -- but 
allowed Simi Valley to lay claim to a share of its fifth consecutive league 
title. Both teams had 9-3 league records. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, based on its season sweep of Royal, Simi Valley grabbed the 
league's top playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
Royal never led Friday, and Myers, averaging 24 points, registered a season-low 
seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Westlake and Coach Greg Hess. On Wednesday, the Warriors still had 
a mathematical chance to win the league title. But after consecutive losses, 
including a puzzling 76-59 loss to last-place Channel Islands on Friday night, 
it is now a "mathematical mystery tour," Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake (7-5) finished in a three-way tie for third with Thousand Oaks and 
Camarillo. Hess, sharpened pencil in hand, turned to the league's confusing 
tiebreaker point system to discover which of the three had earned an automatic 
berth in the playoffs as the third-place Marmonte representative. 
</P>
<P>
Without belaboring the point system: Westlake, with a one-point advantage over 
Camarillo, earns the automatic berth. Camarillo, two points ahead of Thousand 
Oaks, is fourth. Both are seeking at-large entries in Tuesday's first round of 
the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Add playoffs: Kennedy might have sealed its fate in the City Section 4-A 
Division playoffs by falling to Taft, 55-53, Friday at home. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat dropped the Golden Cougars (11-11, 4-6) into a third-place tie with 
Taft (14-10, 4-6) in the North Valley League. But because Kennedy lost a coin 
flip with Taft, the Golden Cougars will enter the playoffs as the league's 
fourth-place entry and draw Crenshaw, the defending City 4-A and state Division 
I champion. 
</P>
<P>
Taft will play Dorsey in a match-up of unseeded teams. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia question: What do Valley-area basketball coaches Skip Adams (Antelope 
Valley), Howard Levine (Grant), Mike Lynn (Chaminade), Joe Malkinson (Royal), 
Ed Marek (Crespi), Mike McNulty (El Camino Real), Steve Miller (North 
Hollywood), Scott Smith (St. Genevieve) and Ira Sollod (Burroughs) have in 
common? Answer below. 
</P>
<P>
Ladies of the court: The Palmdale girls' basketball team won its fifth Golden 
League title in seven years, smashing Antelope Valley, 68-45, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
For the Falcons (20-3, 10-0), ranked 10th in the state and third in the 
Southern Section 5-AA Division, the entire season has been a smashing success. 
</P>
<P>
They were undefeated in league play for the fifth time in seven seasons. And 
consider these lopsided victories: 73-37 over Thousand Oaks, 74-18 over Victor 
Valley, 60-26 over Canyon, 62-25 over Ridgecrest Burroughs and 100-12 over 
Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked real hard the past eight years," 10th-year Coach George Corisis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And it shows. Several Palmdale alumnae -- including Linda Staley (UNLV), Rae 
Spears and Tracy Preter (Northern Arizona), and Michelle Jennings (Cal State 
Dominguez Hills) -- are playing for Division I colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: All are coaching at their high school alma mater.

FALL HELPS STANTON WIN SUPERCROSS

Jeff Stanton of Sherwood, Mich., took advantage of another rider's misfortune 
Saturday night to win the 250cc final during the third stop of the Camel 
Supercross Series at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Bradshaw, a 17-year-old from Charlotte, N.C., who had won the first two 
stops, tumbled coming out of the final turn of the ninth lap, making way for 
Jeff Matiasevich of La Habra Heights and Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
Although Matiasevich took the lead after Bradshaw's mishap, Stanton overtook 
him in the middle of the 14th lap and set the pace for the remaining six to win 
his first supercross of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Matiasevich was second and Mike Kiedrowski of Canyon Country third. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, who came into the event leading the series with 50 points, later said 
he thought he had broken his left ankle in his accident. He went to Sharp 
Memorial Hospital for examination. 
</P>
<P>
What was certain was that Stanton passed Bradshaw for the series lead with 55 
points. Bradshaw has 51. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Johnson, a 25-year-old El Cajon native and the most successful 
motocrosser on the circuit, was never a factor and finished eighth. Seems not 
even Honda could make it simple for Johnson. Not after a spill last March that 
left Johnson's right wrist broken and with ligaments in the same joint ripped 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that the right hand pretty much controls a motorcycle. You can't 
brake, accelerate or even steer properly if you have no motion in the hand. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Johnson rode his Honda and wound up with disappointment in front 
of 37,184 fans. He was hoping to win his fifth consecutive supercross at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium and use the event as a farewell to the sport that has 
made him a youthful millionaire. Doctors had convinced him he should quit, what 
with continuing talk of fusing the dangling hand back onto the forearm. 
</P>
<P>
But it was also a doctor who changed Johnson's mind last week when he told 
Johnson that the wrist couldn't get any worse. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson's will still didn't make it any easier to control a 250cc 
motorcycle with a shattered wrist. Johnson was back, all right, but just not on 
top anymore. In his preliminary heat, Johnson placed fourth and never pushed 
winner Matiasevich and his Kawasaki. 
</P>
<P>
If Johnson is the home-town favorite on the wane, then El Cajon's Mike Craig 
may be the home-town favorite wading in the wake, primed to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the 125cc final, Craig finished fourth, five months after breaking his neck. 
Ty Davis of Hesperia, who rides without any factory backing, gained the initial 
lead and took it 15 laps all the way to the finish line for his first series 
victory this year. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy McGrath from Sun City placed second and Steve Lamson of Pollock Pine was 
third. 
</P>
<P>
After Craig suffered a broken neck last September in an accident while racing 
in Sweden, doctors told him he would never ride again. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't listen. 
</P>
<P>
To get into the finals, Craig won his preliminary heat, the first race of the 
night, in much the same fashion that Davis took the finals. He never trailed, 
which gave him hope for the main event. 
</P>
<P>
Those hopes never materialized, however, as Craig got caught in a pack at the 
beginning and never recovered.

A PHOTOGRAPHIC FRENZY IN THE ART WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
NEW RESPECTABILITY FOR CAMERA ART HAS CREATED A PRICE EXPLOSION AND CELEBRITY 
STATUS FOR SOME PHOTOGRAPHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When attorney Michael Whalen was put in charge of his law firm's art budget in 
fall, 1988, he had to come up with a fine art collection for under $300,000 at 
a time when contemporary paintings were sometimes running that much -- or more 
-- apiece. 
</P>
<P>
So Whalen, who's been buying photographs himself for years, plunked down every 
penny for 250 photographs, enough to fill all nine floors of Latham &amp; 
Watkins' new downtown digs. "I was convinced -- and I convinced my partners -- 
that we could take the budget that we had for this art project and create an 
important collection of photographs," says Whalen. "But we couldn't take the 
same amount of money and buy painting and sculpture and end up with something 
we could be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
But the days of acquiring so much so easily are numbered, and it may not be 
long before major photography collections will be unattainable for under seven 
digits. Photography, the last major chunk of the art market to remain 
relatively affordable, is going the route of painting and sculpture. At last 
year's auctions, record crowds vied to pay prices that topped the 
$100,000-per-print mark for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, you probably could have assembled a very fine photography 
collection for $300,000 to $400,000," says Christie's director of photography, 
Claudia Gropper, "and in our last sale we sold one lot for $396,000." 
</P>
<P>
Dealer sales have similarly heated up. G. Ray Hawkins, one of the biggest photo 
dealers in the country, reports his best quarter ever and plans a move in May 
from Melrose Avenue to Santa Monica. And two of his former employees have 
opened their own galleries, on La Brea Avenue, that are doing good business. 
"In 1984, most important photography dealers had sold a $10,000 photo," Hawkins 
says, "but few had sold a $20,000 photo. By 1987, most important dealers had 
sold a $25,000 photo and a few had sold $40,000 photos. Currently, most have 
sold a $40,000 photo and some of us have sold $100,000 photos." 
</P>
<P>
The photography business today versus 1979, when he first opened Fraenkel 
Gallery in San Francisco, is "the difference between BC and AD," says Jeffrey 
Fraenkel. Adds former San Francisco dealer Simon Lowinsky, now in New York: 
"People buy it now. You don't have to sell it." 
</P>
<P>
From virtually nowhere, photography rushed to the marketplace in the '70s, 
toppled with the recession of the early '80s, then recovered and shot skyward 
again. The 1984 acquisition by the J. Paul Getty Museum of several major 
photography collections gave the market a big push by endowing photography with 
new art-world respectability. 
</P>
<P>
Then last year, the 150th anniversary of the discovery of photography gave the 
market another shove. San Francisco's Friends of Photography counted up 600 
exhibitions at 350 institutions worldwide, and the frenzy continues this year. 
The biggest crowds these days at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art are 
there to look at photographic exhibitions, says trustee Byron Meyer. Houston's 
biannual FotoFest, the nation's largest photo fair, is under way amid 
expectations of topping last year's attendance of 300,000. Still on view 
(through Feb. 25) at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is "On the Art of 
Fixing a Shadow," a major traveling show saluting photography's 150 years, and 
opening Wednesday at the Museum of Modern Art in New York is "Photography Until 
Now," that institution's photographic retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the museums, photography has also achieved a loftier profile. 
Publications from Time magazine to L.A. Style have produced special issues 
during the last year on photography, and photography has joined other 
contemporary artworks on restaurant and movie theater walls. 
</P>
<P>
Given all this attention and the relatively new respectability of photography 
in the world of art collecting, it's hardly surprising that people can't seem 
to get their money out fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, long-time Los Angeles collector and dealer Stephen White sold 
his huge, comprehensive photography collection to the Photographic Center of 
the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum in Tokyo. The collection spans the years 1839 to 
1988, and includes about 15,000 illustrated books, vintage projectors and 
cameras, albums and in-depth print holdings of such masters as Karl Struss, 
John Thomson and Lotte Jacobi. While White declined to reveal the purchase 
price, which certainly is in the low millions, he concedes that today's 
feverish marketplace contributed to both their approaching him and a very nice 
price. 
</P>
<P>
The current market covers the whole spectrum -- from vintage to contemporary. 
Sotheby's director of photography, Beth Gates-Warren, defines contemporary 
photographers as people whose reputations as photographers were established 
after 1960, such as David Hockney or the late Robert Mapplethorpe. She 
estimates that 90% of the material that comes up for auction today is vintage 
material. 
</P>
<P>
In the galleries, however, it's a different story, with the percentage of early 
or recent work varying from dealer to dealer. In fact, as vintage works get 
rarer and rarer, a growing cadre of new photography dealers and existing 
fine-art dealers are peddling contemporary work. And a photographer such as 
Herb Ritts is becoming as celebrated as the movie stars he photographs, drawing 
turn-away crowds to a gallery opening. (See accompanying story on Page 90). 
</P>
<P>
Another element that has contributed to the hyperinflation in the photography 
market is controversy. Mapplethorpe, the artist whose graphic photographs of 
male nudes became a part of last year's furor over National Endowment for the 
Arts funding, both contributed to and profited from the media attention -- 
rocketing to stardom and record prices. With plenty of Mapplethorpes on hand, 
Sotheby's reported a "sense of urgency" and Christie's "a mad rush" of buyers 
at last fall's photography auctions. 
</P>
<P>
The time is here when even those people who had doubts about photography's 
importance as either a collectible or an art form seem convinced. "People who 
collected photographs used to put them in plastic and in drawers," says New 
York dealer Holly Solomon. "Now people are putting them in the living room." 
</P>
<P>
Photography is the most familiar art form. It comes to us every day in the 
magazines and newspapers we read and in the images we see on television. 
Anybody can take a picture -- one reason for the low esteem that photography 
long held as an art form. But it takes only one glance at Edward Weston's 
sensuous 1930 photograph of a simple pepper to remind us that not all 
photographers see things the same way. From Weston to Hockney, photographic 
artists interpret old landscapes and reveal new ones, whether geographical or 
spiritual, real or imagined. 
</P>
<P>
But despite its rich, 150-year history, photography is relatively new to the 
marketplace. Although Alfred Stieglitz opened his "291" gallery in New York in 
1905, activity was pretty minimal for decades. Sotheby's and Christie's didn't 
even start having regular scheduled photo auctions until 1975 and 1978, 
respectively. And here at home, Los Angeles photographer Darryl Curran counted 
just 14 art photography shows between 1959 and 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the '70s. Collectors and speculators boosted the market to such a 
high level that by 1979 New York dealer Lee Witkin was able to splurge and take 
his nine-member staff to the Bahamas for five days to celebrate his 10th 
anniversary. But it turned out to be too much too soon, and the market 
essentially collapsed in the early '80s. The number of photography galleries 
around the country dropped from about 200 in 1980 to under 70 by 1983. 
</P>
<P>
When the Staley-Wise Gallery in New York opened its doors in 1981, at the depth 
of the recession, somebody asked co-owner Etheleen Staley, "Shall we 
congratulate you for buying a ticket on the Titanic?" 
</P>
<P>
But Staley -- who is now able to compare business to traveling on the Concorde 
-- simply waited; she and others felt growth would come -- slowly, but it would 
come. 
</P>
<P>
Things had started back up again when trustees of the J. Paul Getty Museum 
sniffed opportunity. In 1984, the Getty acquired more than 18,000 photographs 
in the collections of Arnold Crane, Samuel Wagstaff and other American and 
European collectors, becoming one of the world's foremost photo repositories 
for a sum reportedly less than the $26.4 million it paid last year at auction 
for one painting -- Edouard Manet's "Rue Mosnier with Flags." 
</P>
<P>
"The first generation of collectors -- people like Crane and Wagstaff -- who 
had fueled the market so completely had begun to taper off and there suddenly 
was a vacuum of individuals prepared to pay premium prices for the best there 
was," says Weston Naef, Getty curator of photography. " It meant a genuine 
flattening of the market and a window of opportunity for the Getty that 
director John Walsh and the trustees were perfectly poised to seize." 
</P>
<P>
The rush was on. "By taking that much off the market permanently, the Getty 
certainly contributed to the rarity of great things coming on the market in the 
future," says Sotheby's Gates-Warren, "and in terms of vesting photography with 
credibility, having a major institution like the Getty take that plunge so 
quickly and so wholeheartedly had a major impact on the way collectors began to 
view photos." 
</P>
<P>
A mere five years later, in 1989, Christie's and Sotheby's together sold about 
$11 million worth of photography -- as compared with under $170,000 each at 
their initial sales in the '70s. Estimates for the U.S. photography market 
today are running as high as $100 million. Howard Read, director of photography 
at New York's Miller Gallery, is so confident that he recently rejected a 
$250,000 offer for a Man Ray triptych called "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow." 
Read had bought the triptych for $20,000 in 1980, sold it for $40,000 a year 
later, and got it back last summer on consignment -- he's holding out for 
$325,000. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence of buyer resistance to these high prices, however. Even as 
prominent a collector as retired real estate developer Leonard Vernon says he's 
"consistently" frozen out by high prices these days. "You plan to bid and spend 
more than you ever conceived you would for a specific image and you don't come 
close," he says. "A (Edward) Steichen we wanted went for $110,000 at the last 
auction and we weren't even in the running." 
</P>
<P>
With all the publicity surrounding last fall's auctions, everybody knows what's 
happening at the top of the market. But the inflation isn't limited to the top. 
Like paintings, prints and sculpture, photography is a multi-tiered market, and 
photographs at every level are appreciating. Dealers and auctioneers also 
report inconsistencies and volatility in the marketplace, with prices varying 
thousands of dollars from one moment to the next for prints in identical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
"The tremendous success of photography as a collecting medium has made it 
impossible for a lot of serious collectors to continue collecting on the level 
they're used to," says one Los Angeles collector, who prefers anonymity. "You 
can understand people being closed out of paintings at $500,000 that were going 
for a tenth of that 10 years ago, but you don't think of people being closed 
out at $20,000. But a lot of us aren't necessarily wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought some (Paul) Outerbridge platinum prints in the mid-'70s for $1,200 to 
$2,000 each that are worth more than 10 times that now. I didn't buy those 
pieces because I thought they'd some day be worth a lot of money. I bought 
those pieces because I loved them and they were expensive to me then. There are 
pieces I would dearly love to have today that cost $20,000 or $25,000 and I 
can't think about spending that kind of money for a piece of art. So I have 
shut myself out, or been shut out, from collecting the same kind of work that 
maybe 10 years ago I could collect." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy sells. 
</P>
<P>
Prices paid for the works of Andres Serrano, the photographer whose work first 
provoked last year's National Endowment for the Arts controversy, have doubled 
and tripled since then, says New York dealer Stefan Stux. Stux says that 
Serrano's now-notorious photo "Piss Christ," which depicts a crucifix in 
Serrano's urine, is sold out and "very heavily in demand on the secondary 
market. It sold for about $2,000 two years ago, and you couldn't get one today 
for $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere has the frenzy been greater than for Mapplethorpe, whose photographs 
went at last fall's auctions for prices as high as $38,500 apiece -- 
considerably more than what the auction houses estimated. In the late '70s, 
says New York dealer Holly Solomon, she was selling Mapplethorpe photographs 
for less than the cost of custom silk frames that Mapplethorpe used. "If you 
bought the photo the way I sold it, the photo cost $150 and the framing another 
$300." 
</P>
<P>
One of the photos from that framed batch resold for $32,000 at auction last 
year, she says, and fortunately for Solomon, she bought some herself. She 
turned down a dealer's $12,000 offer in 1987 for "Tan Head and Flower," she 
says, which she sold last summer for $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't just controversy fueling the market, however. Big names from other art 
forms generally draw more money. Like Degas, Andy Warhol and Ed Ruscha before 
them, a great many painters and sculptors began in recent years to work both in 
and with photography. Artists such as Cal Arts' John Baldessari use photography 
as building blocks, influencing his contemporaries as well as his students. And 
when such work was exhibited in traditional art galleries alongside far more 
pricey paintings and sculpture, dealers were comfortable asking for prices they 
might have shied away from in traditional photography galleries. 
</P>
<P>
When Hockney started selling his photo collages in 1981, for instance, prices 
ranged from $6,000 to $20,000, and although L.A. Louver is pricing his 
"Graffiti Palace, New York, December, 1982" at $45,000 -- and sold his "Grand 
Canyon Looking North, September, 1982," last year for $35,000 -- prices are 
still low compared to Hockney's other work. Prints can run as high as $120,000, 
and at the gallery's most recent show of Hockney paintings, prices ranged from 
$200,000 to $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
While photographers used to print as many as 50 to 100 images of a given print, 
today's photographers have tried to limit their prints to the lower numbers 
common to lithographs and other original prints so as to reassure buyers that 
they're getting something relatively rare. Edition sizes today can be as small 
as two or three, and never run so large as the hundreds of prints made by such 
earlier photographers as Ansel Adams. Herb Ritts, for instance, works in 
editions of 12 or 25, depending on a print's size, and says his negatives 
aren't destroyed but rather are carefully logged and "retired" at edition's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
Consider also the one-of-a-kind assemblages by the 28-year-old Starn Twins, 
"photo objects" that dealer Stux is selling for $5,000 to $75,000. As recently 
as 1986, before the twins were canonized by the art world, works sold for $200 
to $300 that are today going for $2,000 to $3,000. At a recent Christie's 
auction, says Stux, "one object we priced at $10,000 sold at auction for 
$25,000, and another priced at around $10,000 or $12,000 sold for $34,000." 
</P>
<P>
"Given the money involved, even photographers who would have worked 
traditionally 10 years ago are working in mixed media, on canvas or linen today 
to be part of the contemporary art market," says dealer White. "It's a way to 
have their work accepted, plus get better prices." 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons, of course. Photographer Jo Ann Callis went back to 
drawings and sculpture she had worked with earlier, combining her interests in 
multimedia work on linen that sells for about $8,000. Today's lines are 
blurred, concedes Callis, recalling a time not so long ago when "the 
distinction of artist or photographer determined the price of your work, which 
galleries and general status. You could be very well respected in the 
photography community and the art community still may not have known who you 
were." 
</P>
<P>
What also happened, explains Willis Hartshorn, director of exhibitions at New 
York's International Center of Photography, is that "as photography becomes 
more of a collectible, it has taken on more of the vocabulary of painting. It's 
big, colorful, and able to stand on its own on a wall." 
</P>
<P>
Prices for contemporary photography were also suppressed for a long time 
because prices for historical photographs were too low, adds Mark Johnstone, 
local photographer and curatorial consultant. "You could buy a fairly good 
quality 19th-Century piece for just a little more than the price of a 
contemporary work. When historical work started getting what it deserved, a lot 
of work came out on the market, which ended up in collections where it wouldn't 
move very quickly. It dried up the market for 19th-Century prints and as a 
consequence started pulling up the prices for contemporary work." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the price can even go up during an exhibition. At a recent show of 
photographs by Herb Ritts at the Fahey/Klein Gallery on La Brea Avenue, for 
instance, prices shot up in just days as the supply dropped. The price for 
Ritts' large work (24-by-30-inch), "Djimon with Octopus," which has an edition 
of 12, started at $2,500 each when the show opened on Dec. 1. The first six 
prints were sold at that price, says Fahey. Then the price went up to $3,500, 
and prints No. 7 and No. 8 were each sold at that price. After that, prints 9 
and 10 were sold at $4,500 apiece, and 11 and 12 at $6,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite all the inflation, Washington dealer Kathleen Ewing and others 
swear that great buys are still available. "Some of the finest photographers of 
the '40s like Walker Evans are still available in the $2,000-to-$5,000 range," 
says Ewing. "Were you to look at paintings or drawings of a similar quality, 
you couldn't come near it." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Whalen talks of buying fine-quality prints as low as $750, and at 
Security Pacific Corp., Tressa Miller, vice president and director of cultural 
affairs, says "a lot of corporations are buying photos because you have really 
good artists working with the photographic process and it is still an area 
that's reasonably priced." 
</P>
<P>
Following the most basic law of economics, the appeal of photography has played 
a part in inflating the market: More collectors, both individuals and 
institutions, are competing, particularly for rare, older prints at the top end 
of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, I was one of a very small group of serious collectors," says 
Robert Shapazian, director of Lapiz Press here. Dealers say the number of 
collectors locally has jumped from maybe half a dozen in the '70s to hundreds 
today. Hawkins boasts that 600 collectors have bought from his gallery alone 
the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Locally as well as nationally, dealers and auctioneers alike report a 
broadening of the collector base to include new private buyers, many of them 
baby boomers. Photography collectors, says Sotheby's Gates-Warren, "tend to be 
under 45. They are people who have grown up with photography and television and 
the media. They are emotionally affected by that and relate very easily to 
photography as an art form and means of expression that moves them." 
</P>
<P>
The pool of local collectors has certainly grown with more and more movie 
people diving in. Dealers Hawkins and White both went to film school here, and 
photography dealer Jan Kesner estimates that half her customers are in the 
movie business. Hollywood collectors "are artistically oriented and work with 
images, narrative and photography," Kesner says. 
</P>
<P>
Competing with all these new private collectors are the museums. The Museums of 
Modern Art in New York and San Francisco have been collecting photographs since 
the 1930s, but most museum activity is a development of the '70s or even the 
'80s. At San Diego's Museum of Photographic Arts, director Arthur Ollman says 
the 7-year-old institution is one of at least 65 new museums started during the 
past 10 years in countries from India to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Rock musician Graham Nash is one private collector who is worried about how the 
competition will hurt the museums. "People willing to spend $1 million on a 
great painting and now being charged $5 million may put that money into classic 
photography and drive those prices up," Nash says with a sigh. "Add that to the 
Bush policy on donations, and museums are hurting. It could mean that museums 
won't have the budget to establish major collections." 
</P>
<P>
Nash, who holds a multimillion-dollar collection that is one of the nation's 
most highly regarded, is selling most of it at an April auction at Sotheby's. 
"One of the reasons I'm selling (my photographs) is that I've always been 
affected by waves of energy," says Nash. "In the '60s, it was rock 'n' roll 
music and still is. In the '70s, a lot of my passion was spent searching for 
and buying photographs. In the '90s, I feel a tremendous amount of creative 
energy is being shown by computer nerds. They're really moving forward, and I'm 
very turned on by what they're doing in photography." 
</P>
<P>
The musician is planning to donate to the County Museum of Art his most recent 
collection of computer-generated, experimental and other very contemporary 
photographs. He is also planning to share with the County Museum of Art a 
substantial chunk of the proceeds from the sale. And, says the musician, he's 
planning to ask photographer celebrities Hockney and Dennis Hopper to help him 
bolster County Museum activity. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley-based photographer Leland Rice estimates there are probably a dozen 
world-class private collections in the United States today, forecasting that 
financially-pressed museums will probably be wooing those collectors for 
donations, not to mention entire collections. Just last fall, for instance, New 
York's Metropolitan Museum of Art received a joint gift of about 500 
photographs from the Ford Motor Co. and New York collector John C. Waddell. 
</P>
<P>
Photography, says dealer White, "has achieved respectability as an art form. 
There isn't the concern you have when a field is just starting. The field has 
arrived, and it's very rare you get into something at the ground floor and see 
it being developed right before your very eyes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PRICES PEOPLE WILL PAY 
</P>
<P>
These lists of vintage and contemporary photographs are compiled from an 
informal survey taken by Calendar of Sotheby's, Christie's and selected 
galleries nationwide. The selection represents only a random market sample of 
top-tier prints and the most recent price paid for each and does not constitute 
a "Top 10" price list for photography sales.

ARE YOU SICK OF ART AND MONEY YET?;

<P>
THE AUCTIONING OF TWO MASTERPIECES THAT MAY FETCH $100 MILLION IS JUST A SIGN

"The portrait of Dr. Gachet shows you a face the color of an overheated brick," 
wrote Vincent Van Gogh in a letter to his sister, Wil, dated June 4, 1890. So 
began an enthusiastic description of what would turn out to be among his last 
paintings, a small but vivid canvas that today is poised in a dead heat to 
become the next big winner in the Art &amp; Money sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of this textbook masterpiece, which goes on the auction block May 15 
after hanging for several years in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, will be 
</P>
<P>
matched the next day by the auction of Pierre-Auguste Renoir's great scene of 
the newly ascendant urban bourgeoisie, "Le Moulin de la Galette" of 1876. Both 
are earlier versions of canvases hanging in Paris's Musee d'Orsay, and both 
will be closely watched as barometers of art-market health. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his enthusiastic letter, Van Gogh had explained his larger interest 
in painting the face of his friend, a homeopathic physician and amateur 
painter. "What impassions me most -- much, much more than all the rest of my 
metier -- is the portrait, the modern portrait," he wrote. "I should like to 
paint portraits which would appear after a century, to the people living then, 
as apparitions." 
</P>
<P>
Time's up. A century will have passed, almost to the day, when the Dutchman's 
"apparition" of a brick-faced obstetrician takes its place on the block. Only 
now, in the volatile new world of the salesroom and gallery, the art market has 
likewise been transformed into a strange and slippery specter. 
</P>
<P>
How much the Van Gogh and the Renoir will fetch is anybody's guess, but 
official estimates currently range between $80 million and $100 million. For 
two paintings. Two. 
</P>
<P>
Are you sick of Art &amp; Money yet? Tired of all the headlines about who sold 
what for how much to whom? Fed up with endless tales of how "I coulda bought it 
when it was dirt-cheap but now I'd hafta sell my house just to pay the sales 
tax"? Had it with the growing ranks of nouveau boors who are only interested in 
bagging trophies, but aren't at all engaged, as you are, with the long, slow, 
nonetheless wildly amusing deliberations necessary to a true accommodation to 
the rigors of art? Had it up to here with all that? 
</P>
<P>
Well, don't look to me for solace. I, for one, am as sick of all the 
belly-aching over the topic as I am of all the cash-conscious chatter, which is 
itself usually enough to bore the bark off a redwood. There are two reasons why 
the whining gets me agitated. 
</P>
<P>
The first is that, more often than not, the activity of complaining tends to 
signal the utter absence of self-conscious regard necessary to eye-opening 
creativity -- and we sure need some creative responses to the mess that's been 
made. Complaining makes you feel like you're accomplishing something useful 
when, cowed by an unfathomable and seemingly insurmountable dilemma, you've 
actually thrown up your hands in despair. It's far too late in the day for 
that. 
</P>
<P>
The other, no doubt related reason is that the wailing over Art &amp; Money 
harbors a distinctly idealizing tendency. As money gets cast as a horrific 
monster, art gets cast as an agent of divinity in a stabilizing effort to 
maintain equilibrium. Not unlike the present profiles of Manuel Noriega and 
George Bush, reality lies elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
For example, among the odder ideas to gain favor over the past many years of 
galloping Art &amp; Money-mania is the one that moans: Art has become a 
commodity. The claim is odd because it's anything but true. If it was true, it 
would mean there had been a moment in the past when art was not a commodity, a 
fanciful time of artistic purity and grace that simply never existed. In 
Western culture, art has been a commodity ever since there have been 
commodities to be. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons today certainly don't write contracts in which artists agree to make 
paintings with specified amounts of gold-dust and pulverized lapis lazuli mixed 
in the pigment, as they did in the 15th Century to insure the patron got his 
money's worth when buying a picture of, say, the Virgin and Child Enthroned. 
That kind of hard-core assurance of value just doesn't make sense in the modern 
world, an epoch in which wallets are filled with decorated pieces of green 
paper that can be traded for actual home appliances or nights on the town. The 
nature of the exchange value is different but hardly new. 
</P>
<P>
And who's to say that anyone who loves art would not, given unlimited 
resources, want desperately to spring for the drop-dead portrait of basset-eyed 
Dr. Gachet? (I've got a perfect spot for it in my living room.) The idealizing 
tendency is quietly insidious. One succumbs without a struggle to rose-colored, 
vaguely sanctimonious nostalgia precisely at the moment when clear-eyed 
engagement is most crucial to maintain. Art &amp; Money charges the very 
atmosphere in which thought occurs, resulting in rather peculiar judgments that 
unwittingly lead down perilous paths. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Museum of Contemporary Art. On March 3, the museum will host its 
biennial fund-raising auction. As the tally rises, generating much-needed funds 
to pay for all sorts of programs that are of clear and obvious benefit to you 
and me, it will be worth pondering a disaster barely avoided: Cash-cravings 
nearly capsized the thing. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth outing in what has become the largest revenue-producing event 
regularly sponsored by the museum, the gala evening may well top the nearly $1 
million pulled down in 1988. John Marion, the affable auctioneer who wields the 
gavel at Sotheby's high-ticket sales in New York, will once again stand behind 
the podium and do the honors in professional style, taking bids on paintings, 
sculptures, drawings and prints that have been donated, principally by artists 
and dealers, to the sale. So what's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
Artists are forever being hit-up for donations of their supposed non-commodity 
for charitable auctions of all kinds. At the Museum of Contemporary Art, as 
elsewhere, common practice now dictates that up to 50% of the sale price of art 
consigned to the auction be returned to the artist, if he or she chooses, since 
that would be the minimum split if sold by the artist's dealer. In this way, 
buyers exchange dollars for art, the dollars are put to the common good, and 
the artist is protected from charity-abuse. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, the museum came up with a new twist. Artists aren't the 
only ones with paintings and sculptures to give to charitable auctions. In 
order to entice private collectors to donate works of art, too, the museum 
offered them the very same deal they offer to artists: Give us your goods, 
we'll give you up to half of what we sell it for. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds equitable -- until you realize that a collector might easily receive 
more than his original outlay in having bought the art he's now chosen to 
donate, thus making some cash at a charitable event sponsored by a nonprofit 
museum. From protecting the artist, who produces the art, MOCA had slipped 
effortlessly into assisting the collector with financial investments. 
</P>
<P>
Practically speaking, any collector with cash seriously on his mind could sell 
the art at a commercial auction house, then donate however much he wished to 
the museum. 
</P>
<P>
And that, in fact, is the only way this scheme should happen. Otherwise, the 
traditional relationship between a museum and a collector, difficult in its own 
right, has been subtly transformed into an alliance between a commercial agent 
and an investor. 
</P>
<P>
I know, I know; the museum needs the money to maintain its beneficent programs, 
and this might fill its coffers. But at what cost? Awakening from its feverish 
flirtation with disaster, the Museum of Contemporary Art regained its composure 
at the 11th hour and, after due deliberation of an ethics committee of the 
board of trustees, rightly withdrew the offer to collectors. 
</P>
<P>
This narrowly avoided twist in the auction plan would have represented a 
fundamental embrace of conservative economic theory deep into the bosom of the 
museum. Conservative economic theory -- which, in the 1980s, is precisely what 
fueled the Art &amp; Money fandango that art mavens so eagerly bemoan -- 
assured us that if we all vigorously pursued our own private gain, the magic 
wand called the marketplace would wondrously reconcile these rival interests to 
produce a common good. If you believe it will, I direct your attention to a 
variety of items, ranging from numerous park benches now housing otherwise 
homeless families to a certain painting by Vincent Van Gogh that isn't likely 
to be hanging in a public museum after May 15. 
</P>
<P>
Museums certainly have an economic gun held to their heads these days, but it's 
hard to see why they should cheerfully help pull the trigger. Stranger things 
have happened, of course, including the recent revelation that the Armand 
Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, blithely under construction in 
Westwood, has prepared a business plan showing an anticipated profit of more 
than $1.5 million in its first year of operation, rising to nearly $2 million 
after five. The outlandish claim that a nonprofit museum would function 
brilliantly as a sturdy profit-center is the best joke of the art season to 
date -- an assertion positively Dada in the dazzling absurdity of its nihilism. 
And it could only have been pitched with a straight face at a cultural moment 
when the words Art &amp; Money have come to be spoken in a single, panting 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
A while ago, the critic Peter Schjeldahl put his finger on the deep well of 
light-headed stupefaction that greets such oddly embarrassing events as the 
1989 sale of an indifferent Picasso for $47.85 million -- an amount that might 
have cornered the entire modern market not so very long ago. "It's a moment of 
indecent exposure of the arbitrariness, the sheer pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey 
whimsicality, of assigned values," he observed. "The horror is not that art is 
overvalued but that, deep down, money is worthless." 
</P>
<P>
Money is an abstract unit of account in terms of which the value of goods, 
services and obligations can be measured. In a culture increasingly nervous 
over the possibility that cash is our only measure of value, the transformation 
of large quantities of it into art -- that pointedly "priceless" spirit-catcher 
-- resembles Oz's rusting Tin Man desperately yearning for a heart. 
</P>
<P>
Commonly used to treat heart disease, and technically known as Digitalis, two 
stems of foxglove of somber purple hue occupy a prominent place in the 
foreground of Vincent Van Gogh's melancholic portrait of Dr. Gachet. He had 
painted the emphatically modern portrait "with the heartbroken expression of 
our time," he wrote to Paul Gauguin on June 16. If the present climate of Art 
&amp; Money bespeaks a marked insanity in our culture -- well, art has always 
been a first-rate barometer of the state of things.

NAT KING COLE: AFTER 25 YEARS, STILL UNFORGETTABLE ON CD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nat Cole ranks with Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra as one of great names among 
American pop singers -- though many admirers of his early, jazz-minded works 
dismiss most of the hits for which Cole is best remembered today. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "The Great American Pop Singers," critic Henry Pleasants agrees 
that Cole -- who first gained attention as a pianist -- lost some of his 
artistic focus by moving in the '50s and '60s to a more conventional pop 
framework. Still, Pleasants finds much of value in Cole's pop ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"Even as a pop singer, (Cole) was an original. No one had ever sung quite like 
that before," he writes. That view is supported by the best moments of Capitol 
Records' new "Nat King Cole," a 20-song compact disc that will be released this 
week to mark the 25th anniversary Thursday of the singer's death. 
</P>
<P>
The selections on the album range from the early, critically admired hipster 
spunk of 1944's "Straighten Up and Fly Right" through Cole's remarkable string 
of 1946 hits with the Nat Cole Trio ("Route 66," "I Love You for Sentimental 
Reasons" and "The Christmas Song") and on to the more pop-oriented '50s ballads 
("Mona Lisa," "Too Young," "Pretend"). 
</P>
<P>
In his final decade, Cole, who died of lung cancer in 1965, registered hits in 
various styles -- from the R&amp;B punch of "Send for Me" to the county 
underpinnings of "Ramblin' Rose." The first thing that hooks you about his 
style is the precise enunciation. Where so many vocalists in the rock era 
express character by an aggressive blending or slurring of words, Cole sang 
each word with a deliberateness that made the words seem part of a conversation 
rather than formal lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Once dubbed "a singer of intimate conversations," Cole achieved his character 
by the nuances in his phrasing, the way he would caress certain words or cling 
briefly to others for extra emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the material and arrangements were sometimes corny near the end of his 
career, there was a dignity in the vocals themselves that gave even the worst 
concepts a touch of authority and class. Beyond the debate of jazz vs. pop, an 
intimate trio backing and a lush orchestral support, one thing remains 
indisputable: Cole was a magnificent vocal stylist. ROBERT HILBURN

'ROGER' AND REALITY; 
</P>
<P>
WHY IS 'ROGER &amp; ME' GETTING KNOCKED SO VEHEMENTLY FOR USING AGE-OLD 
DOCUMENTARY TECHNIQUES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Moore's "Roger &amp; Me" is at the center of the hottest debate in the 
movie world. Is it a "real" documentary or just an amazing simulation? The film 
has attained "more-than-a-movie" status, which in this case means an awful lot 
of people aren't sure just exactly what to make of it. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the confusion is the documentary committee of the Motion Picture 
Academy, which will reveal Wednesday whether "Roger &amp; Me" has been 
nominated into Oscarland. If you recall, last year's "more-than-a-movie" 
docuthingamajig, Errol Morris' "The Thin Blue Line," with its dreamy 
re-enactments and its Philip Glass score, was passed over by the committee -- 
and the film only ended up saving a guy's life. It may turn out that "Roger 
&amp; Me" will save the city of Flint, Mich., but, for now, it appears to exist 
primarily as a launching pad for Moore's burgeoning media career. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the debate being raged over the film has very little to do with 
its subject -- the effect of auto-plant closings in Flint instigated by General 
Motors Chairman Roger Smith -- and everything to do with Moore's character and 
motives resulting from revelations about the film's jumbled, misleading 
chronology. Every day seems to bring forth fresh revelations. What's next? Will 
the Roger Smith of the movie turn out to be some two-bit actor? Will Michael 
Moore turn out to be the real Roger Smith? 
</P>
<P>
I'm basically pro-"Roger &amp; Me." It's a black-comic jape on Reagan-era 
heartlessness, and maybe the only movie ever made that could appeal equally to 
Mark Twain and Diane Arbus. But certainly, Moore has a lot to answer for, both 
as film maker and media personality. The patchwork sequencing of events in 
"Roger &amp; Me" -- the way events occurring prior to February, 1987, appear to 
have taken place afterward -- represents at the very least a breach of 
journalistic etiquette. As a self-created persona, Moore has positioned 
himself, both on and off camera, as the auteur of this particular media drama, 
and he's also taken it upon himself to be the Ralph Nader of the '90s, and 
maybe the Will Rogers of the '90s too. 
</P>
<P>
But his standard working-class uniform of baseball cap and down jacket, his 
just-scraping-by demeanor and his talk of financing his $200,000 movie by 
setting up bingo games and selling his house, don't jibe with the man who, 
according to the Detroit Free Press, received a $250,000 advance in the summer 
of 1988 from Doubleday and Co. to write a book about two families living in 
Flint. You'd never know from this movie that Moore's dismissal as editor of 
Mother Jones in 1986 after a brief five-month stint was, in the minds of many 
-- but not his -- a direct result not of political head-butting but, rather, of 
managerial incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
There's lots more where this came from, but I don't think ad hominem attacks on 
Moore necessarily make a convincing case against his movie. Except in this 
sense: The film is steeped in Moore's "sensibility," which is often a lot 
closer to David Letterman at his most snide than to Will Rogers. Entertaining 
and purposefully enraging as it is, "Roger &amp; Me" doesn't show off its 
issues, or its people, with any real complexity. It's as if Moore thought too 
much brainwork would spoil the show. (The posture isn't helpful, it's 
condescending.) Like many a gifted political cartoonist, which is essentially 
what he is, Moore is interested in people as caricatures to prove his point -- 
in this case, that capitalism, at least as practiced by GM, is without a social 
conscience. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Moore is not the first film maker to promote a populist self-image; he's 
not the first to hog all the glory. If one judges documentaries by the 
personae, public or otherwise, of their creators, what is one to make of, say, 
Marcel Ophuls ("The Sorrow and the Pity"), Claude Lanzmann ("Shoah") or the 
late Emile D'Antonio ("Millhouse"), all film makers with notoriously 
"difficult" and self-aggrandizing personalities? For that matter, should we 
lower our opinion of "Guernica" because Picasso was a bad man? 
</P>
<P>
A more productive debate should address the question of what we mean when we 
call a movie a documentary. Does Moore's movie cross the line? 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, almost nobody is very satisfied with the notion that documentaries 
are undefinable. I think they are though, and, I think the form's very 
undefinition is its glory. The great film historian and documentarian Kevin 
Brownlow has written, "The gulf between the so-called pure documentary, which 
records only actuality, and the reconstructed documentary, which is branded a 
fake, is not as broad as we have been led to suppose. There are precious few 
documentaries that have not resorted to some kind of restaging . . . the 
bizarre truth is that the most effective films of fact have been subject to 
almost as much manipulation as fact films." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, documentaries are supposed to depict "real" events with real people, but 
what does that mean exactly? The very inclusion of the documentary film maker 
into the "real" event changes the nature of the event. Every camera angle, 
every cut, implies a choice, a position taken by the film maker. Objectivity no 
more exists in the documentary than it does in the fiction film. (And fiction 
films, let's not forget, draw on documentary techniques all the time.) In any 
event, it's the documentaries that most aspire to lordly objectivity -- those 
dreary "educational" films about the basic food groups, or some such -- that 
have given documentaries a bad name. The greatest documentaries have always 
been the ones that expressed the directors' minds and vision. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is self-serving when he talks about "Roger &amp; Me" being an 
undocumentary-like "fun" movie, and he's just plain wrong when he burbles on in 
Capote-like fashion about how he's created a new art form, the "docucomedy." 
(For starters, check out Ross McElwee's "Sherman's March.") But the implication 
of his argument is valid: A documentary that is boring is not a good movie. 
Boringness should 
</P>
<P>
not be a signifier of quality, though in the high-art movie world, it often is 
taken to be. 
</P>
<P>
Are Moore's offenses in "Roger &amp; Me" hanging offenses? I don't think so. 
Yes, he's flimflammed the audience into accepting his chronology of events. But 
the central point is this: Moore does not misrepresent the basic situation in 
Flint. He does not mischaracterize the city, state or federal response to 
Flint's plight. He does not distort GM's callousness. His re-ordering of events 
is an attempt to structure the film in a way that mimics traditional fictional 
narrative, and it could be argued that the re-ordering, though misguided, is at 
least an effort to make the movie and its "message" accessible to the widest 
possible audience. There aren't all that many movies that rummage around inside 
the debris of Reaganomics, or that point up the brutal class divisions in 
American society. Why is "Roger &amp; Me" getting knocked so vehemently -- and 
from the watchdog left as much as from the right -- for the same techniques 
that documentarians have been employing since the birth of movies? 
</P>
<P>
Is it because the film has a political edge, and gets a satiric kick out of 
sharpening that edge? 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, a number of apolitical documentaries have "transgressed" 
at least as much as "Roger &amp; Me." The most blatant example occurred several 
years back with "Pumping Iron II," George Butler's highly acclaimed female body 
builder movie. Butler ostensibly followed several contestants through their 
paces in preparation for the Caesar's Cup World Championship. What the film 
didn't tell you was that the Cup was mounted specifically for the film, with 
some of the prize money kicked in by the film's backers. Butler shot sequences 
with the women working out for the Cup six months after the competition. He 
coached them on their "roles" and scripted many of their scenes. There was no 
public outcry. 
</P>
<P>
If this example isn't elevated enough for you, how about the work of America's 
greatest documentarian, Robert Flaherty? Flaherty once wrote, "Sometimes you 
have to lie. One often has to distort a thing to catch its true spirit." And 
that's exactly what Flaherty did in some of the greatest documentaries ever 
made. In "Nanook of the North," Flaherty paid the Eskimos to perform re-enacted 
rituals for the camera. He staged hunts and insisted the Eskimos employ 
harpoons, though harpoons had long since been replaced by rifles. In "Man of 
Aran," Flaherty sent the island's inhabitants on a shark hunt years after such 
a practice had ended. In both films, "real" footage was fitted into a 
prearranged narrative that expressed Flaherty's romantic vision of life. 
</P>
<P>
In the modern age, documentaries have largely become the province of 
television. The financing is more readily available; the opportunities for 
topicality are greater; so is the potential viewing audience. "Roger &amp; Me" 
is one of the rare theatrical successes in the documentary field, and it comes 
out at a time when "infotainment" and "reality" TV are increasingly what passes 
for serious documentary news reporting. A lifetime diet of hype has supposedly 
made us super-wise to the trumpery of media manipulation. We're supposed to 
know what "reality" is. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, this emphasis on "reality" is essentially another media con -- a 
preemptive strike on our own wayward disbelief. We like to think we're too 
sharp to buy the obviously slick and staged, but the favored new "rough" look 
of reality is more difficult to dismiss -- whether it be presidential campaign 
spots or the simulation of events on the nightly news or the tell-all talkfests 
like "Geraldo" whose babble is the obbligato to our tawdry times. 
</P>
<P>
This is the climate in which "Roger &amp; Me" has opened, and probably it's a 
healthy sign that so many questions have been raised about its veracity. Better 
too many than too few. Michael Moore may palm himself off as a bumpkin who 
never set an f-stop before embarking on his movie, but he's slick enough to 
have co-opted the techniques of "reality" TV for his own political 
point-making. The points are eminently worth making, though. Just because 
"Roger &amp; Me" is "real" doesn't mean it isn't real.

 American folklore, as reported by Robert Hendrickson, "Lewd Food" 
</P>
<P>
There's been a lot of talk about gnawing on the bark of the West African 
yohimbe tree -- a drug derived from it has been used to treat impotence in 
humans . . . it can also sexually excite a horse, cow, sheep or dog. And the 
salt of strychnine has been used as a tonic for sexual impotency. But with 
death being one of the more irksome side effects, it's best to stick with 
oysters. 
</P>
<P>
But do oysters work? It depends on who you ask. The late gourmet Roy Andries de 
Groot reported, "I grew to manhood with the help of oyster." And Casanova 
himself is supposed to have downed 50 raw oysters first thing every morning. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, M.F.K. Fisher wrote about an insecure young man who ate so many 
dozens of oysters on the day of a hot date that he made himself sick. 
</P>
<P>
Science is on the side of skeptics like Fisher. But De Groot, like most other 
oyster lovers, makes much of the "sensual physical aura" of an oyster -- in 
other words, if it were federally funded art, Sen. Jesse Helms would find it 
offensive. And because oysters -- indeed all fish and shellfish -- contain a 
hefty dose of those bodacious minerals, iodine and phosphorus, the oyster's 
reputation holds strong. 
</P>
<P>
Phosphorous also turns up in wheat germ, sunflower seeds, soybeans, barley and 
brown rice -- health fanatics might not be as crazy as you think. Asparagus and 
ginseng are prized for their shape; carrots and pomegranate seeds for their 
estrogen-like chemicals; spinach by those who've watched too many Popeye 
cartoons. Cleopatra liked figs; Caruso liked marinara sauce. In fact, it's hard 
to find a food that's not somebody's idea of an aphrodisiac. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of men who think diamonds are a girl's best friend like to believe in 
the magical powers of lobster and caviar, foie gras and truffles, and bottles 
of chilled Cristal champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Men from other cultures swear by the private parts of sea turtles, the gall 
bladders of black bears, powdered rhinoceros horn, reptile parts, camel humps, 
snail heads and the velvet from deer antlers. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the Food and Drug Administration, there's little need to munch 
on endangered species or spend a bundle on luxury foods. Last month, the FDA 
began enforcing a ban on all over-the-counter aphrodisiacs. "(Aphrodisiac) 
claims have been transmitted largely though folklore and exploited by 
manufacturers who prey on the gullibility of people who most likely are in need 
of counsel or therapy," said the FDA's house journal. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Kinsey Institute for the Study of Human Sexuality is a spoilsport when 
it comes to love food. It reached the conclusion that there is only one true 
aphrodisiac: a combination of good health, plenty of rest and regular exercise.

DOUGLAS KOS TYSON IN TITLE FIGHT UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James (Buster) Douglas knocked out heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in the 10th 
round at the Tokyo Dome today in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, 29, the fourth-ranked contender, felled the previously unbeaten 
champion with a five-punch combination to the head at 1:23 of the round. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson rolled over at the count of five and reached for his mouthpiece. He was 
on his hands and knees when the referee counted him out. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who was 37-0 with 33 knockouts going into the fight, was such a 
prohibitive favorite that Las Vegas refused to put up a betting line. Douglas 
now is 30-4-1.

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday assured West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Soviet support for the early reunification of Germany 
at a pace and in a way determined by East and West Germany themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, reaffirming what Moscow regards as the German "right of 
self-determination," in effect cleared the way for the opening on Tuesday of 
preliminary negotiations between East Berlin and Bonn on reunification by 
pledging to respect the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"Germans themselves should make their choice in what state forms, what periods 
at what pace, and under what conditions they will be realizing their unity," 
Gorbachev told Kohl, according to an official statement. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, clearly jubilant, told a late-night press conference, "Gorbachev and I 
agreed that it is the sole right of the German people to decide whether they 
want to live in one state. He told me unmistakably that the Soviet Union will 
respect the German decision. This is a very good day for Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, said that an 
understanding was also reached during his talks with Eduard A. Shevardnadze, 
the Soviet foreign minister, on a negotiating framework and an accelerated 
timetable that envisions a fully ratified agreement by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached between East Berlin and Bonn will be put before the four 
victorious Allied powers of World War II -- Britain, France, the Soviet Union 
and the United States -- for approval and then for presentation to an 
all-European summit conference at the end of the year, Genscher said. 
</P>
<P>
While the negotiations are expected to be complicated, particularly because the 
question of German reunification is racing ahead of European security and 
disarmament issues with which it must be coordinated, the Soviet declaration 
was regarded by West German officials as laying the foundation for the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"The unification of the two German states will take place in an orderly way," 
Genscher said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet approval of the negotiating framework was also significant, West German 
officials said, because it recognizes the priority of the agreement between 
East and West Germany, effectively settles how the interests of Germany's 
neighbors will be dealt with and accepts the accelerated pace of change in East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
With popular and political pressure building in East Germany for speedy 
reunification, there has been growing apprehension that the negotiations 
necessary on such a difficult issue will be overtaken by actual events. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how quickly the two states could merge, Kohl said he believes this will 
follow the parliamentary elections in East Germany next month and the 
subsequent efforts to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who is on a diplomatic push that will take him to Paris, London and 
Washington after meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday with East German Prime 
Minister Hans Modrow in Bonn, is seeking to "get ahead of the curve," as a 
Soviet foreign affairs specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to get as much of the agreement in place, if he can, before the 
people on the streets in Germany start dictating its terms. We understand and 
want to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev cautioned the West German leader during their nearly three hours of 
talks in the Kremlin to take a "balanced," even "cautious," approach to the 
question of German reunification to ensure that present European stability is 
maintained, according to an official account of the meeting distributed by the 
Soviet news agency Tass. 
</P>
<P>
"German rapprochement should not damage positive results achieved in (the 
European security) process or in East-West relations as a whole and upset the 
European balance," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
"Only such a policy is acceptable that takes into account all realities and all 
possible aftermaths -- domestic and foreign policy and economic consequences 
and, naturally, a psychological reaction of Germans and other countries, 
especially those that participated in the Second World War," the Soviet leader 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution of the German question is inseparable from the success of the 
disarmament talks in Europe, from the changing role of the two military and 
political alliances and from questions concerning the presence of foreign 
troops in European states." 
</P>
<P>
Despite these strong Soviet caveats, Kohl felt that he had secured a major 
diplomatic breakthrough in his talks with Gorbachev, and he pledged that the 
negotiations, now certain to be accelerated, will be coordinated with the 
superpowers, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact 
and with other European countries. 
</P>
<P>
The understanding with Moscow is important for Bonn, West German officials 
said, because it means that the Soviet Union indeed recognizes the German right 
of self-determination and will not attempt to use its still considerable 
influence in East Berlin in an attempt to shape the agreement, nor will it 
impose conditions on the agreement with the threat of a veto. 
</P>
<P>
But Shevardnadze, addressing a news conference on Saturday morning before the 
Kohl talks, recalled the Soviet proposal, dating back to the 1950s, for a 
united but demilitarized Germany to remind Bonn and its allies in NATO that 
German reunification is a particularly sensitive issue for Moscow, not one that 
can be easily solved with just quiet diplomacy and a few ambiguous phrases. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been for the unity of the German nation from the beginning, but the 
neutrality principle has always been central to our thinking," Shevardnadze 
said -- although Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meeting with Soviet 
officials here last week, rejected neutrality and called for a united Germany 
to be at least an "associate member" of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
"There must be a solution to the problem that does not contradict general 
European interests," Shevardnadze said when pressed on the question, "and there 
are various possible solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Soviet officials do not exclude the possibility of Germany as an 
"associate member" of NATO, participating in the alliance's political 
activities but not in the military matters, if there were firm East-West 
understandings on the terms. 
</P>
<P>
Some Soviet foreign policy specialists, in fact, see such a status as 
preferable because of its implied limitations to a nominally neutral Germany 
with larger, better equipped and better positioned armed forces than any other 
European country. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union now has 380,000 troops stationed in East Germany, roughly 
two-thirds of those it has in all of Eastern Europe, and their future is an 
important question for Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze also warned that the question of postwar European borders, an 
issue that arouses strong nationalist feelings in West Germany and considerable 
fear among its neighbors, will have to be resolved in any agreement on 
reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow wants recognition of current borders as one way of reassuring the 
neighbors, which include its Warsaw Pact allies of Poland and Czechoslovakia 
and by extension even the Soviet Union, that a reunified Germany threatens no 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, questioned closely on the borders issue, said that acceptance will have 
to be left to the new parliament of a reunified Germany, that recognition of 
all Germany's present borders could continue but that the matter could be 
resolved only then. 
</P>
<P>
The West German leader said that he acknowledged in his talk with Gorbachev 
that the process of reunification is proceeding much faster than anyone 
anticipated and that there have to be ways of managing it.

CALIFORNIA IN STATE OF FAST DECAY; 
</P>
<P>
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRUMBLING AFTER YEARS OF NEGLECT. BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO 
SEE WHERE THE BILLIONS FOR REPAIRS AND NEW FACILITIES WILL COME FROM.

<TEXT>
<P>
It took the fury of nature to drive home a harsh fact of life that Californians 
have been ignoring for years -- the state is falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
When the Nimitz Freeway collapsed and a piece of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge fell during the devastating Bay Area earthquake last Oct. 17, the notion 
of California as a progressive state that keeps everything shipshape was 
destroyed as well. 
</P>
<P>
California is entering the last decade of the century with its "infrastructure" 
-- roads, bridges, school classrooms, airports and sewer systems -- in an 
advanced state of decay. Accelerating the decay are a rapidly growing 
population and voters and political leaders who show little interest in raising 
taxes to rebuild public works. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make an argument that California is beginning to look like a Third 
World nation," said Lewis H. Butler, president of California Tomorrow, a 
planning group that worries about the state's future. 
</P>
<P>
The most glaring case of neglect can be found on Oakland's Nimitz Freeway, 
where last October's quake killed 42 people because the California Department 
of Transportation did not have enough money to strengthen its most vulnerable 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
But there is other evidence that the state's infrastructure is crumbling 
dangerously: 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, where only two miles of new freeway were built in the 1980s, 
gridlock is a daily fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
* Much smaller Stanislaus County, in the San Joaquin Valley, has enough money 
to resurface only 20 miles of its 1,600 miles of road each year. In addition, 
50 of 250 county bridges need to be brought up to current earthquake safety 
standards, but there is little money to do that. 
</P>
<P>
* Raw sewage spills are a common occurrence in San Diego, where city officials 
must find $3 billion to build a new treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Jose sewer system runs so close to capacity that city officials 
pleaded with residents not to use their toilets en masse during halftime of 
last year's Super Bowl football game, for fear the system would overflow. 
</P>
<P>
* In fast-growing Moreno Valley, in Riverside County, school enrollment has 
doubled in five years, to 26,800, and is expected to double again by 1994. 
Almost half of the pupils are in portable classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
* Water officials fear breaks in the antique, leaky system of peat-and-sand 
levees in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta that helps to separate salt water 
from fresh and keeps the State Water Project flowing. 
</P>
<P>
* More state prisons and local jails are needed; more schools and colleges; new 
airports and intercity transit lines; disposal sites for garbage and hazardous 
wastes; parks, libraries and flood control facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The list goes on and on -- and the price is high. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a problem of dramatic proportions," said Angelo J. Siracusa, president 
of the Bay Area Council, an organization of major employers in the San 
Francisco area. "I can't quantify it, and I don't know who can, but surely 
we're talking about billions and billions of dollars" in new construction and 
repair. 
</P>
<P>
California ranks near the bottom among states in per capita spending for 
highways. The state also stands last in percentage of per capita income spent 
for public schools, as calculated by the U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
"The buzzword for the '90s is competitiveness," said Steven Levy, director of 
the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. "How can you be 
competitive if your roads are falling apart and your schools are lousy?" 
</P>
<P>
There are a few bright spots in this generally gloomy picture. 
</P>
<P>
More than $3 billion has been spent on new prison construction in the seven 
years George Deukmejian has been governor, but even that is not enough to keep 
pace with the swelling inmate population. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of new classrooms were built throughout the state in the 1980s, 
though again not enough to meet the need. And new buildings are rising on 
University of California and California State University campuses, after 
several years of relative inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
Finally persuaded that the state gasoline tax must be increased to pay for 
transportation improvements, the governor is pushing a state constitutional 
amendment on the June primary ballot that would lift the Gann limit on state 
spending and would generate about $18.5 billion for new highways and other 
transportation projects by raising the gasoline tax nine cents over a five-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
All three of the major candidates in next year's gubernatorial election -- 
Democrats Dianne Feinstein and John K. Van de Kamp and Republican Pete Wilson 
-- support this measure, which will be listed on the June ballot as Proposition 
111. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Feinstein has proposed a new state growth management commission 
that would try to direct California's explosive growth into areas that do have 
adequate infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
And, last fall, Deukmejian also signed a package of bills that could help 
California cope with its staggering output of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
But for most of the last 25 years -- through the governorships of two 
Republicans, Deukmejian and Ronald Reagan, and one Democrat -- Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown Jr. -- the state has failed to provide for the needs of its 
fast-growing and rapidly changing population. 
</P>
<P>
"We're facing the results of 20 years of negligence," said Robert Cervero, 
associate professor of city and regional planning at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Bodovitz, president of the California Environmental Trust and former 
executive director of the California Coastal Commission, called it "a breakdown 
of the social contract." 
</P>
<P>
California is not alone in allowing its physical plant to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
Federal spending for infrastructure has declined steadily since 1969 -- a 
victim first of the Vietnam War, then of inflation, and now of the staggering 
federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Spending for public works has dropped from 2.3% of gross national product to 1% 
in the last 20 years, according to U.S. Department of Commerce figures. 
</P>
<P>
"The budget deficit drives everything in Washington now, and the infrastructure 
problem has been tucked aside," said Pat Choate, vice president for policy 
analysis at TRW, whose 1981 book "America in Ruins" stirred interest in the 
problem for a time. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has been handed back to the states, "and they haven't done much 
either," Choate added. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, in California the decline in public works spending has coincided 
with a period of remarkable growth and change. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the state's population slipped past 29 million. It will climb to 
more than 35 million by the end of this century, if present trends continue. 
</P>
<P>
Thickly populated new communities are springing up almost overnight. The city 
of Moreno Valley, 10 miles east of Riverside, was incorporated only five years 
ago but already has more than 100,000 residents. San Joaquin Valley communities 
such as Lodi, Modesto and Tracy -- rural in nature not so long ago -- now are 
filling with commuters from the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
But many of these new residents must drive two hours or more, over congested 
roads, to reach their jobs. In many places, schools are overcrowded, local 
streets are jammed, sewer systems are inadequate, and water quality and 
quantity is questionable. Meanwhile, the cities these commuters left behind are 
filling mainly with ethnic and racial minorities who live in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
A new study by the state Assembly Office of Research notes that minorities 
probably will account for almost 50% of California's population by the end of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
The report warns about the "fracturing of California into a two-tier society of 
haves and have-nots," as whites and Asians dominate the better-paying 
occupations while "Hispanics and blacks are limited to the lower-paying jobs." 
</P>
<P>
"Development and jobs follow the Anglo flight from the costly and crowded 
cities to the affordable, uncongested dream life on the metropolitan fringe," 
the report states, "leaving the urban core to those who have the greatest need 
for public services but the least ability to pay for them." 
</P>
<P>
The state's failure to respond to population growth and demographic change has 
produced a staggering bill for unmet needs in public works. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the unfunded portion of the five-year state Transportation 
Improvement Plan now stands at $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In the big cities, this means potholes, road closures and traffic jams. In 
Stanislaus County it means a pitifully inadequate $7-million annual budget for 
construction and maintenance of roads and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
At least $8 billion is needed statewide to bring California sewage treatment 
plants up to federal water quality and health standards by the year 2005, the 
State Water Resources Control Board estimates. Much more than that would be 
required to meet federal air quality standards in the state's smoggiest 
communities -- Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Finance projects an increase in public school 
enrollment of 1.4 million between 1989 and 1998, and the state Department of 
Education said it will cost about $11 billion to house these additional 
students. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles alone, 50,000 more pupils are expected in the next five years, 
requiring construction of 35 new elementary schools, 10 junior high schools and 
five senior high schools, at a cost of about $500 million. Another $500 million 
is needed to repair existing schools. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of money is not available, so class size will increase and all 
schools will be placed on a year-round calendar. 
</P>
<P>
The University of California, the California State University system and the 
two-year community colleges say they need billions of dollars' worth of new 
facilities if the state is to continue to offer higher education to all who 
seek it. 
</P>
<P>
Additional billions are needed for airports, prisons, hospitals, port 
facilities, dams and a host of other projects. 
</P>
<P>
All of this will cost at least $10 billion a year for at least 10 years, most 
experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the Capitol quarrel with these estimates. 
</P>
<P>
State Finance Director Jesse R. Huff, for one, said needs have been overstated 
as a result of "some pretty simple ways of projecting." However, many of the 
forecasts -- those for the public schools, for instance -- come from his own 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Others believe the numbers cannot grow too large or they will breed a public 
sense of helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a major, a very substantial construction need," said Kirk West, 
president of the California Chamber of Commerce. "But I don't want to give the 
impression that the problem is totally overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem can be made to sound so massive that it defeats efforts to deal 
with it," West said. "That is not the case. It is affordable and it can and 
should be funded." 
</P>
<P>
Just how is not so clear. 
</P>
<P>
If Californians and their political leaders retain their aversion to new taxes, 
the money to rebuild the state's rickety physical plant must come from bond 
issues and from developer fees and user fees of various kinds. 
</P>
<P>
But there is growing concern in Sacramento about the extent of the state's 
bonded indebtedness. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting this concern, Deukmejian and legislative leaders agreed Friday to 
place only about $3 billion in new bond issues before the voters next June, out 
of a total of about $18 billion that had been proposed by individual 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Another $2 billion to $3 billion probably will be approved for the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If voters approve these measures, most of the money will pay for schools, 
prisons, higher education facilities and transportation improvements, but will 
make only a slight dent in the state's overall infrastructure problem. 
</P>
<P>
Fees are the other possible major source of infrastructure financing -- user 
fees, developer fees, special assessment districts. 
</P>
<P>
Mello-Roos districts, created several years ago by legislation authored by 
state Sen. Henry J. Mello (D-Watsonville) and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los 
Angeles), permit property owners in a given geographic area to assess special 
fees to pay for roads, schools, sewers and other public improvements. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago these districts generated only about $20 million a year. Now it 
is close to $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
Higher sewer rates are paying the interest on bonds that are financing a 
$3.4-billion upgrading of the Los Angeles sewer system. Higher rates also will 
help to finance the $3 billion in new treatment facilities needed in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Charges for water in much of Southern California will rise sharply to pay for 
the Metropolitan Water District's ambitious $3-billion expansion and renovation 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Fees paid by developers now account for about 25% of new school construction in 
fast-growing suburban areas. They also pay for parks, libraries, streets, 
traffic signals, even police and fire departments -- services that were 
provided by local government before the passage of Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the biggest source of infrastructure financing we have and it's largely 
invisible," said Dean Misczynski, a principal consultant in the Senate Office 
of Research. 
</P>
<P>
But developers pass most of these costs along to home buyers, which raises 
housing prices and forces many potential buyers out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Most fiscal experts agree that bond issues and fees cannot provide enough 
revenue to rebuild the state. New taxes are needed but they are also unlikely, 
except for the half-cent sales tax increases that now have been approved by 16 
counties, mostly for transportation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Most politicians in both parties think the "tax revolt" that led to Proposition 
13 in 1978 and to Proposition 4, the "Gann limit" the next year, is still very 
much alive. 
</P>
<P>
They may rail against the "anti-expansion, anti-government attitudes of the 
last 20 years," as state Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) does, but they 
are not about to propose higher taxes to rebuild the state's infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
So the neglect is likely to go on and the quality of life for most Californians 
probably will continue its downward drift. 
</P>
<P>
"People get the kind of government they deserve," said Lew Butler of California 
Tomorrow. "The voters of California have wanted to believe they could have 
lower taxes and still have a clean environment, safe cities and the rest. Maybe 
now they're beginning to see it can't happen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REBUILDING CALIFORNIA 
</P>
<P>
Cost estimates for the rebuilding of California's infrastructure vary widely. 
They depend on how infrastructure is defined, the time period being considered, 
whether deferred maintenance expenditures are included, the politics of the 
person making the estimate and many other factors. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the key problems and possible solutions: 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: 
</P>
<P>
PROBLEM: 
</P>
<P>
Construction of new highways and other transportation improvements has lagged 
far behind the state's booming population, creating serious traffic congestion 
in major urban areas and even in smaller cities. The five-year State 
Transportation Improvement Plan shows a $3.5-billion revenue shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
SOLUTION: 
</P>
<P>
Passage of a 9-cent state gasoline tax increase next June, which would make 
$18.5 billion available for transportation projects, if voters also agree to 
raise the Gann limit on state spending. County sales tax increases and fees on 
new development also will pay for some new roads and other transportation 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: 
</P>
<P>
PROBLEM: 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in kindergarten through 12th grade is expected to increase by 1.4 
million in the next 10 years. Another 26,000 classrooms, costing $11 billion, 
are needed to accommodate these students. All of the money from past 
voter-approved school construction bonds has been spent. 
</P>
<P>
SOLUTION: 
</P>
<P>
More bond issues -- $2 billion to $3 billion every other year -- plus developer 
fees in fast-growing suburban communities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HIGHER EDUCATION: 
</P>
<P>
PROBLEM: 
</P>
<P>
The University of California, the California State University and the community 
colleges all expect large enrollment increases. UC wants more than $1 billion 
in state construction funds in the next five years, plus another $1 billion to 
build three new campuses by 1999. CSU is asking for $1.4 billion over five 
years, plus $2.5 billion to $3 billion for five new campuses. Statewide 
community college officials say $700 million is needed for building on existing 
campuses and $1.1 billion for 16 new campuses by the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
SOLUTION: 
</P>
<P>
Bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PRISONS: 
</P>
<P>
PROBLEM: 
</P>
<P>
Despite $3.5 billion worth of new state prison construction in the Deukmejian 
Administration, state prisons remain seriously overcrowded. The inmate 
population is expected to swell from 87,000 currently to 137,000 in 1994, 
requiring another $3 billion to $3.5 billion in construction. 
</P>
<P>
SOLUTION: 
</P>
<P>
More bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEWERS: 
</P>
<P>
PROBLEM: 
</P>
<P>
State officials say it would cost $5.6 billion to bring all sewage treatment 
plants in California up to federal health standards and that figure will grow 
to at least $8 billion by the year 2005. Los Angeles alone is spending $3.4 
billion to upgrade its sewer system, while San Diego must build a new treatment 
plant that will cost at least $1.5 billion. The federal government is phasing 
out the grant program that once paid for up to 75% of these construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
SOLUTION: 
</P>
<P>
State loans and local bond issues, with interest on the bonds being paid by 
higher sewer fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOLID WASTE: 
</P>
<P>
PROBLEM: 
</P>
<P>
Californians generate 40 million tons of trash a year. The Little Hoover 
Commission reported last July that 15 counties will exceed their landfill 
capacity by 1996 and the entire state will run out of landfill space by the end 
of the century. Some communities burn their trash in large incinerators, but 
these are fiercely opposed on air pollution grounds. Recycling garbage is 
helpful but markets for the recycled cans, glass and paper products are 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
SOLUTION: 
</P>
<P>
Legislation authored by Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo Alto), and signed 
into law by Gov. Deukmejian, requires local governments to reduce solid waste 
25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. This will cost cities and counties $4 
billion to $5 billion, most of which probably will come from local bond issues, 
with interest repaid by higher garbage collection fees.

BUSH WON'T ADDRESS S.F. CONFERENCE ON AIDS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: PRESIDENT IS CRITICIZED FOR DECLINING TO ATTEND THE INTERNATIONAL 
GATHERING, BUT AN AIDE SAYS HE WILL TALK TO A BUSINESS-LABOR GATHERING ON THE 
DISEASE.

<P>
President Bush has declined an invitation to deliver a speech at the Sixth 
International Conference on AIDS here June 20-24, making it the first time in 
three years that the host nation's leader will not address the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who as vice president was booed and hissed at the 1987 AIDS conference in 
Washington when he discussed Reagan Administration plans for mandatory testing 
of immigrants and prisoners, also turned down a request to send a videotaped 
welcome, conference co-chairman Dr. John L. Ziegler said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed," said Ziegler, professor of medicine at UC San Francisco. 
"We felt this was a real opportunity to for the government to make a strong 
statement. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Canada's Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, addressed last year's session in 
Montreal, as did Sweden's Prime Minister, Ingvar Carlsson, a year earlier in 
Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said the President 
receives hundreds of speaking invitations and must set priorities. "Each 
scheduling request is looked at very carefully, and I know that was the case 
for this one as well." 
</P>
<P>
"The President, both as a candidate and in his Administration, has addressed 
the AIDS issue and the need for compassion many times," she added, citing the 
Bushs' Christmas Eve visit to the National Institutes of Health to meet with 
adult and child AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Glen noted that Bush has agreed to address the National Business 
Leadership Conference on AIDS, a group of business and union leaders, next 
month in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Sullivan, Health and Human Services secretary, and James O. Mason, 
assistant secretary for health, are considering invitations to address the 
conference, according to department spokesman Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's decision drew criticism from Stephen Morin, an aide to Rep. Nancy Pelosi 
(D-San Francisco) and a member of the conference's community task force. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the President has good reason for not coming," Morin said. "Neither 
the people of San Francisco nor the scientific community think much of his AIDS 
policies." 
</P>
<P>
One particular point of contention, which threatens to mar the conference, 
involves the long-festering controversy over U.S. policies restricting the 
freedom of foreigners infected with the human immunodeficiency virus to enter 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Although the federal government eased the restrictions last month, infected 
individuals are still required to reveal their condition when they apply for a 
visa and seek a waiver of rules barring them from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At least 16 organizations, including the International League of Red Cross and 
Red Crescent Societies, have announced that they will boycott the conference, 
which will attract 12,000 scientists and policy makers from around the world, 
unless the U.S. entrance restrictions on carriers of the AIDS virus are 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization, the National Commission on AIDS and conference 
organizers themselves also have protested the restrictions, arguing that the 
curbs perpetuate the notion that HIV is casually contagious. 
</P>
<P>
Morin acknowledged that Bush "has made good-faith efforts to get the message 
out on the need for compassion." He added, however, that, "the first budget 
that Bush has had control over has been harsh and cruel." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush's proposed budget for fiscal 1991 earmarks $1.7 billion for AIDS 
prevention and research, up from $1.6 billion a year earlier, programs for AIDS 
treatment and care -- including a $30-million drug subsidy program and a 
$20-million project for home and community-based care -- were eliminated.

NOISY CROWD DEBATES DESERT LANDS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 people flocked to a congressional hearing in Beverly Hills 
Saturday where they shouted, booed and whistled their support or opposition to 
a controversial proposal that would drastically alter the use of 4.5 million 
acres of the California desert. 
</P>
<P>
The opposing sides -- ranging from environmentalists and politicians to desert 
dwellers and motorcycle enthusiasts -- wore different colors to denote where 
they stood on the measure: yellow meant you supported passage of the 
legislation; orange meant you were against it. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is HR 780, commonly called the California Desert Protection Act, a 
bill now pending before Congress that would greatly expand Death Valley and 
Joshua Tree national monuments and also establish a new national park of 1.5 
million acres in the eastern Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would ban off-road vehicle traffic in 65,000 acres of desert 
spread around the state, restrict mining and establish wilderness areas to 
protect plants and wildlife in selected areas from Inyo County to the Mexican 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Emotions ran high at Saturday's meeting, the fourth and final congressional 
hearing before the subcommittee on national parks and public lands chaired by 
Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.) 
</P>
<P>
Vento repeatedly had to gavel the audience into silence as more than 100 
speakers took turns at the microphone to air their views on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
When supporters of the bill spoke, members of the audience wearing yellow 
T-shirts, caps, buttons and ribbons erupted in applause, while orange-clad 
opponents booed lustily. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the orange-clad crowd -- many of them off-road enthusiasts -- 
chanted "No! No! No! No!" while the yellow-clad crowd -- the environmentalists 
-- shouted "Yes!" on the off-beats. 
</P>
<P>
The overflow audience filled the Beverly Hills High School auditorium, even 
forcing state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to sit cross-legged on the floor 
as he awaited his turn at the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, hundreds of people carried placards or sported stickers with political 
slogans as they relaxed on the school's front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the noisy chants in the auditorium, Vento commented dryly: "It 
may be unusual for you to listen to views you don't agree with." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who spoke were Van de Kamp, state Controller Gray Davis, Los 
Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and various local officials from 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, who is running for the Democratic nomination for governor, said 
the bill would protect the desert for future generations of Californians by 
placing millions of acres under the protection of the U.S. Bureau of Land 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is fair, it's balanced," Van de Kamp said. "It has been carefully 
written to respect the needs and the rights of mining interests, of off-road 
vehicle users, of the military." 
</P>
<P>
Briefly mentioning his rival in the governor's race, Van de Kamp wondered out 
loud why Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) did not attend the hearing to support the 
bill. Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) upbraided Van de Kamp and said Wilson has 
supported legislation to protect the desert in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Your gratuitous slap (at Wilson) reflects a lack of understanding," Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis also released a letter from James M. Ridenour, director of the National 
Park Service, saying that the agency and the Bush Administration oppose the 
desert bill because it would unnecessarily expand the national park system and 
ignores earlier federal legislation that created a program to manage the 
California desert. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Minn.), a subcommittee member, prompted cheers from the 
orange-garbed part of the crowd when he said it was excessive to "lock up an 
area seven times the size of Delaware." 
</P>
<P>
"You have stolen recreation opportunities from California families," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert W. Bruesch, a Rosemead city councilman, said the bill would stop 
irresponsible sportsmen from destroying the desert. Once an avid off-road 
rider, Bruesch said his delight in the pastime paled after he "saw friends 
purposely driving over desert snakes." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Ryan, an off-road enthusiast who came dressed as a tortoise, said current 
federal laws protect the desert adequately. Ryan, of Mission Viejo, distributed 
flyers outside the packed auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest enemies are environmental extremists," he said.

BROWN PUSHING FOR BAN ON HONORARIUMS;

<TEXT>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), contending that the corruption 
scandal surrounding former Sen. Joseph B. Montoya has permanently tainted the 
practice of accepting honorariums, is pushing for an outright ban on the 
lucrative payments to legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the Legislature's leading recipient of honorariums, said legislators 
must shore up their image by imposing the ban on themselves regardless of 
whether they receive a pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to kill me," said the flamboyant Assembly Speaker, who reported 
receiving $92,111 in honorariums in 1988. "It's all the money I used to pay for 
the kids' schooling. It's all of the money I used to pay for my alimony. And 
it's some of the money that I used to pay for my ties." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he has been quietly lobbying members of the Assembly and is now 
confident that they will vote for a ban on honorariums. In the Senate, 
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti said his members also would vote for such a 
prohibition but may still prefer to link it to a pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
The differences between the Assembly and Senate may be resolved in the coming 
weeks in a two-house conference committee that will consider a variety of steps 
to improve the ethical conduct of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Roberti agreed in separate interviews that pressure on the 
Legislature to act has been intensified by the Feb. 2 conviction of Montoya on 
seven counts of extortion, racketeering and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, who resigned his Senate seat effective Friday, was found guilty by a 
federal court jury of using his position to extract honorariums and campaign 
contributions from people with business before the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most damaging evidence presented at his trial was a secret videotape 
of Montoya accepting a $3,000 "honorarium" for simply meeting with two federal 
undercover operatives for breakfast at a restaurant near the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the last year for which figures are available, members of the 
Legislature accepted $729,000 in honorariums, most of it from groups with an 
interest in matters pending before the Legislature. Unlike campaign 
contributions, honorariums are personal income for legislators and can be spent 
for any purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the term honorarium has meant a payment for a specific service 
on which there is no set price. In California, legislators usually make some 
sort of speaking appearance in exchange for their honorarium checks. But in 
some cases, members of the Legislature have received thousands of dollars in 
"honorariums" for merely touring a company or going to a meeting with company 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Brown said, Montoya's infamous videotaped breakfast at Pennisi's Cafe here 
has made it politically unacceptable for legislators to take honorariums, even 
as speaking fees for legitimate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who has long been at odds with Montoya, a Whittier Democrat, said a ban 
on honorariums for legislators would be "Joe Montoya's ultimate revenge." 
</P>
<P>
"There is never going to be any appreciation or understanding of the difference 
between conduct similar to that attributed to Joe Montoya and (public 
appearances by other legislators) if they're both called honoraria," the 
Speaker said. "In order to stop having to answer questions about it, let's just 
ban it." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Assembly and Senate voted to put a comprehensive ethics measure 
on the June ballot that would ban honorariums, limit the gifts legislators 
could receive, strengthen conflict-of-interest laws, require lawmakers to hold 
their meetings in public and restrict lobbying by legislators who leave office. 
</P>
<P>
However, the proposed constitutional amendment -- titled Proposition 112 -- 
links all these measures to the creation of an independent salary commission 
with the power to give legislators a pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from honorariums, the measure does not restrict legislators' outside 
income, such as the hefty fees Brown and other lawyers receive from clients who 
hire them. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti, the sponsor of Proposition 112, said he still favors tying a ban on 
honorariums to a potential pay increase. Without the receipt of speaking fees, 
he said, many legislators will have trouble surviving on their annual salary of 
$40,816, plus a tax-free expense allowance worth about $20,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for people to live on $40,000 a year and maintain two houses, 
send the kids to school and pay the mortgage," the Los Angeles Democrat said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Roberti said that if the proposal for an outright ban on 
honorariums were to come to a vote on the Senate floor, it would pass easily. 
"I'm open to debate," Roberti said. "The issue is not settled." 
</P>
<P>
The crucial decision on the precise shape of the legislation to be presented to 
the two houses will be made in the conference committee. That panel is likely 
to include Roberti, Brown and Republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the honorarium question, the conference committee will decide 
how to implement other portions of Proposition 112, including the tougher 
conflict-of-interest standards and a limit on gifts to legislators. 
</P>
<P>
The gift issue, in particular, may erupt into controversy. Brown opposes any 
restriction on gifts while others are pushing for annual limits ranging from 
$100 to $250 from a single source. In 1988, legislators reported receiving a 
total of $501,000 in gifts -- nearly as much as they received in honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
"The requirement ought to be, you have to report any gift over $250, not that 
you can't take it," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
For the Speaker, the top priority is to erase the public perception that 
legislators can be bought just by showing up for breakfast and receiving an 
honorarium check. 
</P>
<P>
"I really want to make sure that no one on this floor is perceived as being 
compensated for anything other than real work," Brown said. "The personal 
sacrifice is not as important as the institution." 
</P>
<P>

AD CAMPAIGN GETS FIRED UP; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION 99: ANTI-SMOKING SPOTS ON RADIO AND TELEVISION WILL BE AIMED AT 
PRETEENS, MINORITIES AND WOMEN. IT WILL BE THE LARGEST SUCH CAMPAIGN IN U.S. 
HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
California's tobacco-tax initiative, which already has cut into cigarette sales 
in the state, is about to finance a fresh assault on the smoking habit. 
</P>
<P>
Radio and TV spots paid for by Proposition 99 tax revenues are to begin in 
March, targeting preteens, minorities and pregnant women in the largest 
anti-smoking advertising campaign in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
The $28.6 million earmarked for the 18-month campaign is a fraction of what 
cigarette makers spend promoting their brands, but it far exceeds earlier 
efforts by state and federal health agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"For somebody who is in the field of health education, it's probably one of the 
most exciting things that could happen," said Dearell Niemeyer, chief of local 
programs for the state Department of Health Services' newly created Tobacco 
Control Section. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ronald Davis, director of the federal Office on Smoking and Health, a part 
of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control, said the California program 
will outstrip all previous anti-smoking media campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said federal agencies are spending only about $1 million per year on 
anti-smoking advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Only one other state, Minnesota, earmarks cigarette tax revenues for 
anti-smoking ads. The state's budget for the program is about $1 million a 
year, said Kathleen Harty, head of the Minnesota health department's section 
for nonsmoking and health. 
</P>
<P>
Besides production and placement of radio, television, print and billboard ads, 
the $28.6-million California campaign also will be used for market research on 
effective ways to reach target groups. 
</P>
<P>
"In a business where you get routinely to work on the socially trivial, it's 
kind of exciting to work on the socially significant," said Leonard Pearlstein, 
a partner in keye/donna/pearlstein, the ad agency chosen last month by state 
health officials to run the media campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99 increased the cigarette tax by 25 cents a pack on Jan. 1 of last 
year, triggering a strong decline in sales. During the first nine months of 
1989, cigarette sales in California slipped 14% below the same period of 1988, 
according to the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
Since many smokers stocked up on their favorite brands before the tax took 
effect, the real long-term decline may be closer to 10%, board officials said. 
But even that represents a sharp drop in cigarette sales, which had been 
falling in the state by only 1% to 2% per year during most of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Further thinning the ranks of smokers is the goal of the media campaign, the 
most controversial segment of a broader educational program to be financed by 
the cigarette tax increase, which voters passed in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, about $221 million is to be spent through June, 1991, on the 
anti-smoking program, Niemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry spent more than $20 million in its unsuccessful bid to 
defeat Proposition 99. The industry then tried and failed last September to 
delete funds for the media campaign from state legislation allocating the 
cigarette tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Although critical of the media campaign, tobacco-industry officials said they 
are not planning efforts to counter it. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Weiss, manager of media relations for Philip Morris USA, contended that 
the campaign may violate the First Amendment rights of smokers, since they are 
being made to "pay for speech against something that they've chosen to do." 
</P>
<P>
The industry's concern about the ads reflects its experience during the 
"Fairness Doctrine" era of the late 1960s, when anti-smoking messages hit the 
airwaves and per capita sales of cigarettes suddenly began to drop. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, after the Federal Communications Commission ruled that the Fairness 
Doctrine applied to cigarette advertising, free air-time became available for 
counter-advertising by health groups. 
</P>
<P>
One ad featured William Talman, a heavy smoker who played Perry Mason's legal 
adversary on television and who later died of lung cancer at the age of 53. 
Appearing very ill, Talman said he did not mind the courtroom defeats, but that 
he was "in a battle right now I don't want to lose. . . . Take some advice 
about smoking and losing from someone who's been doing both for years. . . . 
Don't be a loser." 
</P>
<P>
At their peak, the anti-smoking messages got about one minute of air time for 
every three minutes of cigarette ads, studies showed. But, reversing decades of 
steady growth, nationwide per capita cigarette sales dropped in four straight 
years from 1967-70, according to the 1989 Surgeon General's report. 
</P>
<P>
Health groups, which had campaigned for years for a ban on broadcast cigarette 
advertising, found themselves with a new ally: In a seemingly gracious and 
diplomatic gesture, the cigarette makers caved in and backed legislation in 
Congress that threw them off the air after 1970. 
</P>
<P>
But when cigarette ads vanished from the airwaves, so did most of the 
countering ads -- and per capita sales immediately resumed their historic rise 
before turning downward again later in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of those early no-smoking spots was one of the most compelling 
arguments for California's media campaign, said Niemeyer of the state Tobacco 
Control Section. 
</P>
<P>
State officials estimate that about 25% of Californians 18 years of age and 
older are smokers, less than the national rate of about 28%. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Californians bought more than 2 billion packs of cigarettes last year, 
and health officials say smoking remains the state's leading preventable cause 
of death and disease, accounting for $4.1 billion in direct health-care costs 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Federal Trade Commission, the tobacco industry spends nearly 
$2.6 billion per year on promotion and advertising -- perhaps one-tenth of that 
in California, although there are no state-by-state figures.

Nonsmokers' Rights, said the $28.6-million anti-smoking campaign "is not an 
enormous amount of money in the land of California radio and television. . . . 
I hope we see radio stations and television stations increasing the power of 
this campaign with some donated and discounted media time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the ad campaign, tobacco tax revenues are expected to supply about $70 
million to the schools and $70 million to local health departments for 
anti-smoking education, and about $53 million worth of grants to health and 
community groups involved in tobacco control. Hundreds of millions of dollars 
more are going to the counties for health care for the poor and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Niemeyer -- who said his father started smoking at the age of 13 and died of 
lung cancer at 49 -- said the anti-smoking message will focus partly on youth, 
since 90% of all people who smoke take up the habit in their teens. He said 
preteens are a target audience because they are in the process of deciding 
"whether to experiment with cigarettes or not." 
</P>
<P>
Minority groups also will be targeted, because they tend to smoke more and 
suffer higher rates of smoking-related cancer and heart disease, Niemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Other spots aimed at pregnant women could have the "most immediate impact," 
Niemeyer said, because not smoking during pregnancy pays quickly by lowering 
the risk of a low-birth-weight baby and other health complications. Expectant 
mothers, out of concern for their infants, also are more receptive to the 
anti-smoking message, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Niemeyer said he is concerned, however, that the massive effort will spawn 
unrealistic hopes among lawmakers and health groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The expectations are high, as they should be when we have this amount of 
resource," he said. "But changing behavior doesn't happen overnight."

DON'T RETREAT ON REFORMS, BAKER WARNS BULGARIANS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to keep up the momentum of reform in Eastern Europe, Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III stopped here Saturday night to warn the Communist 
government against backsliding on promises of democracy and to encourage the 
new-born opposition to remain united in the coming elections. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was briefly in danger of being jostled by several hundred enthusiastic 
anti-Communists who were waiting outside his hotel when he arrived to meet with 
17 leaders of various factions of the United Democratic Front, the opposition 
umbrella organization. 
</P>
<P>
"De-mo-crat-zi-a," they chanted, alternating with "U.S.A." to the visitor whose 
presence seemed to symbolize American concern for their future. One of several 
home-made placards proclaimed: "Your People's Democracy Is Our Dream." 
</P>
<P>
Baker was initially hustled into the entrance of the hotel by worried security 
men as the crowd pressed forward. But once on the steps, he turned and told 
them that Bulgaria is "on the threshold of the new age of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
"The United States supports free and fair elections for Bulgaria," he shouted 
to prolonged cheers. 
</P>
<P>
A main complaint of the opposition is that the Communists, with decades of 
organization in place, will have an unfair advantage in the coming elections, 
which are scheduled for May. One man in the crowd said the opposition wants 
elections delayed until November because there is not enough time for it to 
campaign effectively against the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Baker arrived here from Moscow in late afternoon and went directly to a 
government guest house outside Sofia for talks with President Petar Mladenov 
and other government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will visit Bucharest, Romania, today for a similarly brief meeting with 
government officials and opposition leaders. His two-hour visit there will also 
be aimed at encouraging democratic change. The Bush Administration has voiced 
its concern on a number of occasions about the new Romanian government's 
commitment to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's Communists are unique among East Europeans because they ousted their 
Stalinist strongman, Todor Zhivkov, in November but remain in power. Indeed, 
the present government, formed only last Thursday, has the first all-Communist 
Cabinet in four decades because Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov could not 
persuade allied parties or opposition leaders to join it. 
</P>
<P>
The party suffered another setback Friday to its efforts to acquire a more 
progressive image when three members of its reformist wing, the Alternative 
Socialist Organization, announced that they had resigned from the newly created 
153-member Supreme Council. 
</P>
<P>
Still, government officials appeared pleased that Baker had stopped here on his 
way from Moscow to Ottawa, noting that he is the first U.S. secretary of state 
ever to visit. Lukanov, speaking to reporters before Baker met the opposition, 
said the visit was an endorsement of the changes in the country, and "that will 
help everyone in the election." 
</P>
<P>
But according to a senior U.S. official, Baker "made it clear that if Bulgaria 
wants better relations with the United States, the government must respect the 
complaints of the opposition" about holding free and fair elections and making 
good on other pledges to democratize the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason he is here," the official said of Baker, "is to make as sure as we 
can that the elections will be free and fair. . . . The message he gave was 
that we'll be watching the elections closely" before responding to Bulgaria's 
request for better trade terms, help in bringing Western business ventures here 
and other economic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Before going to Moscow last week, Baker visited Prague, where he said the 
United States wants to help move the revolutions of the past three months from 
the streets of Eastern Europe into democratic parliaments. Free elections are 
the only basis for legitimacy for any government, he said, and the United 
States will give or withhold benefits depending on how well the region's 
nations meet this requirement.

REUNIFICATION COULD PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER 'SMALL TOWN IN GERMANY'; 
</P>
<P>
EUROPE: THE CAPITAL OF NEW NATION WOULD PROBABLY MOVE TO BERLIN. LANDLORDS FEAR 
A MASS EXODUS.

BONN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of trying to be taken seriously as the capital of West Germany, 
this sleepy, Rhine-side university town has the feeling that the political and 
economic rug is being pulled out from under it. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling at the rug is German reunification, a development likely to come sooner 
rather than later, which means that the capital of the Federal Republic will 
probably move to Berlin -- seat of past governments of kings, kaisers, 
republicans and Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn's first qualms surfaced a few days ago when the federal government 
announced that it was halting preliminary work on the new $150-million federal 
press and information center here. 
</P>
<P>
Construction was also ordered stopped on a new lobbying office here for the 
state of North Rhine-Westphalia. 
</P>
<P>
Feelings of panic are rising among landlords, who fear a mass exodus of 
politicians, diplomats and journalists to Berlin, depressing inflated rents and 
prices for houses and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be a city in ruins," commented a leading Christian Democratic 
member of Parliament, Kai-Uwe von Hassel, who urged that the capital remain in 
Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
And Bonn's Mayor Hans Daniels calls the issue "a red-hot poker." 
</P>
<P>
Bonn's worries come as the city of 300,000 has experienced the biggest building 
boom in its history: Last year six hotels were completed, increasing bed space 
by one third; a new legislative chamber for the Bundestag, or Parliament, is 
being finished, and new (and, in most cases, unsightly) federal office 
buildings are springing up all over town. 
</P>
<P>
At last, civic fathers had thought, Bonn, with its fine city orchestra, parks, 
restaurants, and new ministries, would cease being the butt of jokes about its 
provincialism and small scale. 
</P>
<P>
Now the question raised by many here is whether all the new buildings will end 
up as white elephants if the government and ministries decide to pack up and 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing cessation of construction for the information headquarters, an 
official said: "We don't know if we will stay here or move to Berlin." 
</P>
<P>
Bonn has long been sensitive about being described as "a small town in Germany" 
by spy-thriller writer John le Carre or being called by its more common 
nickname, the "Bundesdorf" -- the federal village. 
</P>
<P>
The guiding force behind Bonn's being chosen as the federal capital was the 
first postwar federal chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, who had been mayor of 
Cologne and lived across the Rhine from Bonn in a village called Rhoendorf, 
where he tended his roses. 
</P>
<P>
Adenauer's scheme in selecting Bonn was to keep alive the notion that an 
eventually reunited Germany would return its government to Berlin, and Bonn's 
function as the West German capital in the meantime would keep a major city 
such as Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg or Munich from being chosen and 
irreversibly established as the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn, then centered around the university, began annexing villages on both 
sides of the Rhine, but it didn't have the kind of facilities needed for proper 
government buildings and foreign embassies. 
</P>
<P>
So the Parliament was placed in a teachers college, and the president's and 
chancellor's official residences were former private mansions. Federal offices 
commandeered whatever space they could find, and major embassies such as those 
of the United States and Britain were housed in Spartan prefabricated 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary appearance of the government quarter contrasted with the fine old 
university buildings in the city where Beethoven was born. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, Bonn looked like a ghost town as politicians departed for their 
home constituencies and the more sophisticated pleasures of the bigger cities. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the best thing about Bonn?" ran an old joke. "The train to Munich." Or 
Frankfurt, or Hamburg. Another: "Bonn has half the population of a Chicago 
cemetery and is twice as dead." 
</P>
<P>
But in the early 1980s, the government seemed to decide that Bonn might remain 
the capital for some time to come, and a major building effort was undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow and orange cranes went up along Route B-9 between Bonn and the 
diplomatic community of Bad Godesberg to erect federal structures, embassies 
and lobbying group headquarters. Castles were renovated for government guests 
and new museums were established. An expensive remodeling of the Parliament 
building was begun. 
</P>
<P>
Just two months ago, Chancellor Helmut Kohl signed a $75-billion contract to 
support the extra needs of the city as the capital through the 1990s, ensuring 
that all the buildings under construction will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
With speculation rising over Bonn's future role, Mayor Daniels is mounting a 
campaign to hang onto the capital. He says, "We stand on the threshold of a 
fateful year." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100,000 people, a third of the population, rely on Bonn being the 
capital for their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
Other officials are urging that if the capital shifts to Berlin, most of the 
ministry staffs should remain in Bonn, since Berlin is already overcrowded and 
short of office and living space. 
</P>
<P>
The mood of Bonn workers who would be affected is mixed. 
</P>
<P>
One secretary said: "I like it here. Things are quiet and living is pleasant. 
Berlin is too big, noisy and dirty." 
</P>
<P>
But a newspaper bureau manager said: "I'm looking forward to moving to Berlin. 
Now that would be a real world-class capital." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the newly completed Maritim Hotel in Bonn said optimistically: "We 
are not too worried. We've got bookings well into 1995." 
</P>
<P>
But if there's no governmental reason to come to Bonn, bookings might be 
canceled, and, city officials fear, Bonn itself might be "canceled."

About 700 radical students shouting anti-government and anti-U.S. slogans 
fought riot police with firebombs and rocks in the second day of protests 
against a new conservative governing coalition. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 riot police used tear gas to stop the students at the main gate of 
Seoul's Jooang University. No police figures on injuries and arrests were 
immediately available. The fighting began after 1,000 riot troopers sealed off 
Korea University in eastern Seoul to stop an anti-government rally involving 
students from major schools in Seoul.

Persian Gulf newspapers renewed criticism of Moscow over the emigration of 
Soviet Jews to Israel, and accused the superpowers of striking a deal to settle 
them in the occupied Palestinian territories. One Saudi Arabian newspaper, 
Al-Riyadh, claimed there was "an international conspiracy to increase tension 
in the Arab situation." Up to 100,000 Soviet Jews are expected to emigrate to 
Israel this year although the Jewish state says it has no policy of settling 
them in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

U.S. LEADERS HAIL NEWS BUT STORM IS BREWING OVER LIFTING OF SANCTIONS 
</P>

<P>
While President Bush joined other U.S. leaders Saturday in hailing the imminent 
release of black activist Nelson R. Mandela, a political storm already was 
brewing over whether the move warrants relaxation of U.S. sanctions against 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
From his retreat at Camp David, Bush telephoned South African President 
Frederik W. de Klerk and "pledged U.S. willingness to help create a climate for 
negotiations" between the nation's white minority leadership and its black 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also invited the South African leader for talks at the White House, adding 
that Mandela would also be invited after his scheduled release today from 27 
years of imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, Bush praised De Klerk for showing "bold and 
imaginative leadership in recent days, which has earned the admiration of many 
of us who hope for swift and peaceful evolution in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Under De Klerk, South Africa has legalized the African National Congress and 
about 60 other banned political groups, freed leading black prisoners and 
pledged to negotiate a new constitution. In his dramatic announcement Saturday, 
De Klerk also said that a nationwide state of emergency would be lifted if no 
further violence accompanied Mandela's release. 
</P>
<P>
Although Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman J. Cohen said 
De Klerk's initiatives could lead to the lifting of U.S. sanctions "within the 
next few weeks," black leaders and key lawmakers cautioned the Administration 
not to move too fast. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), chairman of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, said the United States "should continue to use the moral and 
economic lever of even more stringent sanctions as a vehicle for helping to 
accelerate the end of apartheid in a nonviolent context. 
</P>
<P>
"While I welcome the release of Nelson Mandela from almost three decades of 
imprisonment for his political beliefs," Dellums said, "I am concerned that no 
mention has been made about the release of more than 2,000 other black South 
Africans still in prison because of their struggle to end apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of imprisoned blacks has been controversial because many held on 
criminal charges are considered by black opposition leaders to be political 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Sanctions imposed by Congress in 1986 over President Ronald Reagan's veto 
prohibit new U.S. investment and bank loans in South Africa; bar imports of 
South African iron, steel, coal, uranium and agricultural products; outlaw 
sales of computers to South Africa, and prohibit U.S. landings by South African 
Airways. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the law, Bush is empowered to modify or suspend the 
sanctions if political prisoners are freed and if South Africa meets any three 
of four other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The four conditions are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Repealing the 1986 state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lifting a ban on democratic political parties and allowing all races to 
participate in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Repealing the Group Areas Act, the apartheid law dictating where blacks can 
live and work. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Negotiating with the black majority without preconditions. 
</P>
<P>
The 3 1/2-year-old state of emergency allows South African police to detain 
suspects for up to six months without charging them or bringing them to trial. 
It also allows the government to restrict protests and to bar the press from 
areas of unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), House majority whip and author of the 1986 
sanctions legislation, also indicated his opposition to a quick lifting to 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we freed one man doesn't mean that we freed an entire nation," 
Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, an anti-apartheid group, 
also argued against lifting sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the U.S. has played a significant role in bringing the South African 
government to this historic point," Robinson said. "Progress could be seriously 
stalled by the failure of the U.S. and European governments to maintain 
sanctions and continue pressure for further reform." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson termed Mandela's release "a tiny step on a long road to dismantling 
the apartheid system." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Bush hinted that he was interested in lifting sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when people move in the right direction, it is certainly time to 
review all policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources stressed that Bush would not move precipitously without 
consulting Congress. But a congressional source involved in the issue expressed 
concern that the White House might try to loosen sanctions before serious 
negotiations between South Africa's blacks and whites are under way. 
</P>
<P>
Among the possible first steps would be lifting the ban on landing rights for 
South African Airways, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), chairman of a Senate subcommittee on African affairs, 
announced that he was "indefinitely suspending" further action by his 
subcommittee on a bill that would expand existing sanctions. But Simon also 
noted that Mandela's release and the conditional pledge to lift the state of 
emergency in South Africa "still fall short of an end to apartheid, and it is 
premature for the United States to begin lifting sanctions at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.), chairman of a House subcommittee on Africa who met 
with De Klerk in South Africa last month, urged the Administration to be "very 
careful" in handling the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still hundreds upon hundreds of political prisoners in South African 
jails, and the emergency is still in effect," Wolpe said in an interview. "The 
situation must be created in South Africa where anti-apartheid activists are as 
free as the government party to organize, to move about the country and to 
speak freely. Then we can talk about beginning negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Wolpe also called on the White House to use as a model America's recent 
approach to events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not move prematurely in relaxing pressures in place (in Eastern Europe) 
until we believed that the process of change was irreversible and that 
fundamental change was occurring," he said. "I hope we do not have a double 
standard as we approach South Africa."

World leaders welcomed South Africa's announcement Saturday of Nelson R. 
Mandela's impending release from prison, and international rejoicing began to 
build for an event so long awaited by so many. 
</P>
<P>
Britain said it is time to resume contacts with internationally isolated South 
Africa, but anti-apartheid campaigners warned against any reduction of pressure 
on the white-led government. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush praised South African President Frederik W. de Klerk for "bold 
and imaginative leadership," and the Canadian government expressed delight at 
the announcement that Mandela would be released today. 
</P>
<P>
In Lusaka, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, whose country has been a refuge 
for the exiled leadership of Mandela's African National Congress, said his 
first reaction was to kneel down and thank God. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, we must believe in the leadership of the people of South Africa to put 
their heads together and build on these developments," Kaunda said. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the announcement of Mandela's release date, the ANC's leadership 
announced from its headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia: "We welcome Nelson Mandela 
back from all those years of imprisonment into our midst with great joy." 
</P>
<P>
"Ireland rejoices that Nelson Mandela is free at last," said Charles Haughey, 
Irish prime minister and current president of the European Community, which has 
been using economic sanctions to pressure Pretoria to give up apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
"By his indomitable courage he has demonstrated once again that the human 
spirit can never be vanquished," Haughey said. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, current chairman of the Organization of 
African Unity, sent Mandela a message of congratulation, praising the 
"sacrifices of the great people of South Africa" and assuring him of Egyptian 
solidarity with his cause. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, Moscow Radio broadcast news of the announcement, then 
added: "Nelson Mandela has become the world's most famous political prisoner, 
put in jail for the struggle against apartheid in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Amsterdam's central Leidseplein square was temporarily rechristened Nelson 
Mandela Square. 
</P>
<P>
In London, a jubilant crowd of about 120, some waving pictures of Mandela, 
celebrated in the pouring rain outside South Africa House in Trafalgar Square. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by her 10 Downing St. office, Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher said, "We believe that the steps President de Klerk has taken merit a 
positive, practical response." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it no longer makes sense to discourage new investment in South 
Africa -- a restraint which in our case in any event has been voluntary -- and 
we shall be discussing this with our EC partners," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the European Community banned imports of South African iron, steel and 
Kruggerand gold coins, and barred new investment in the country. It had already 
frozen scientific and cultural relations. 
</P>
<P>
Britain regards the iron, steel and coin embargoes as mandatory, but not the 
investment ban, and has already announced that it is no longer observing the 
scientific and cultural embargo. 
</P>
<P>
In London, Bob Hughes, chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, said he was 
delighted at the news, which he called "a tremendous victory for the people of 
South Africa and for the international sanctions campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Secretary General Shridath Ramphal said Mandela's safety must be 
guaranteed by the South African government and that until change there becomes 
irreversible, the Commonwealth will sustain its pressure for the end of 
apartheid. "It is not yet time to demobilize the international support for 
apartheid's victims," he said.

APARTHEID: THE PRISONER'S SELF-SACRIFICE SYMBOLIZED THE LIBERATION THAT HIS

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nelson R. Mandela, the inspirational leader of the black rebellion against 
apartheid, has become during more than 27 years in prison a figure of almost 
mythic proportions among South Africa's black masses, millions of whom have 
never heard or seen him. 
</P>
<P>
The name Mandela is a rallying cry for black youths born years after he was 
sent to prison. "Mandela is with us!" say the graffiti painted on the walls of 
South Africa's black urban ghettos. 
</P>
<P>
His picture appears on clandestinely printed anti-apartheid pamphlets, posters 
and banners. Songs are sung and poems written about him in the urban black 
townships, and children are named for him even in the most remote villages. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the symbol of our people," Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel 
Peace Prize winner, has said. "His imprisonment represents our oppression. His 
self-sacrifice is what we would all like to be in resisting that oppression. 
His release has come to symbolize the liberation that we are longing for." 
</P>
<P>
Since he was arrested in 1962, convicted and sentenced to life after one of the 
longest and most important trials in South African history, Mandela has become 
the primary unifying force in the deeply divided politics of South Africa's 27 
million blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion surveys of urban blacks have shown again and again that he is more 
widely accepted than any other leader. Even rivals of Mandela's African 
National Congress, the principal guerrilla group fighting white minority-led 
rule, have not dared to criticize him. 
</P>
<P>
Black leaders, such as Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, who split with 
the ANC more than 30 years ago, have repeatedly told the government that 
without Mandela, they will not enter negotiations to share political power with 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
"No black leader worthy of the name will negotiate while Mr. Mandela and his 
colleagues are in jail," Oscar Dhlomo, a Cabinet minister in Buthelezi's 
Kwazulu homeland government, said after talks between moderate blacks and the 
white minority-led government fell apart last May. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the only black leader still able to reach across the ideological divide 
in black politics," Dhlomo added. "His years in jail have molded him into an 
astute and impartial elder statesman who can play a decisive role in capturing 
black unity." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's refusal to compromise his principles has given him an unprecedented 
stature in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
His life was at stake when, charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow 
the government -- capital crimes under South Africa's security laws -- he 
admitted leadership of the ANC's armed struggle and argued that the country's 
minority white government had given the black majority no option but violence 
to achieve equality. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, as international pressure has grown on the government to 
release him, Mandela rejected many government proposals that would have brought 
his release. He refused three times to accept banishment to Transkei, the 
nominally independent region of South Africa where he was born. He rejected 
exile, though he could have rejoined the ANC leadership at its headquarters in 
Lusaka, Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
And time and again, he has refused to forswear violence in the campaign against 
apartheid, because it would have meant backing away from the armed struggle 
that he started as commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, the 
military wing of the outlawed ANC. 
</P>
<P>
As Mandela pointed out at his trial, the ANC only reluctantly took up arms 
because 50 years of peaceful protest had failed to persuade the white 
authorities to remove apartheid and grant blacks equal rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Only free men can negotiate," Mandela declared in February, 1985, in rejecting 
a government offer to free him if he first renounced violence. "Prisoners 
cannot enter into contracts. . . . I cannot and will not give any undertaking 
at a time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your freedom and mine 
cannot be separated. I will return." 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide pressure on the South African government to release Mandela grew to a 
frenzy on July 18, 1988, when Mandela turned 70. A rock concert in London, 
televised around the world except in South Africa, was held in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
But the South African government banned all local celebrations and began to 
admit privately that it was being held hostage by Mandela's imprisonment. 
Release him, they feared, and he might lead a bloody revolution. But let him 
die in prison and widespread unrest would be the likely result. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, in August, 1988, Mandela contracted tuberculosis. He was 
transferred to a hospital and, after being successfully treated, to a suite in 
a private clinic to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
The country's white leaders, shocked by Mandela's illness, launched an 
elaborate plan to demythologize Mandela by "releasing him in steps," as one 
government official put it. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to wash away the mystique that, to a large extent, the government 
itself had created by painting Mandela as South Africa's most dangerous 
terrorist. Now, the government decided, was the time to show the world that it 
was removing Mandela's chains and giving him more freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Fully recovered from his illness three months later, in November, 1988, Mandela 
was transferred from the hospital to the Victor Verster Prison Farm in lush 
wine country near Paarl, about 40 miles from Cape Town. He was held in a 
three-bedroom house usually reserved for prison employees. A white cook and 
guard lived in the servants' quarters in the back. 
</P>
<P>
His visitation rules were relaxed and his wife, Winnie, previously restricted 
to 40-minute visits once a month, was offered unlimited visiting privileges. At 
first, she refused on the grounds that other prisoners were allowed no similar 
freedom. But soon Mandela was having lengthy visits, sometimes over lunch or 
dinner, with family, friends, current and former political prisoners -- and 
even high-level government officials. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1989, shortly before Mandela's 71st birthday, he met with outgoing 
President Pieter W. Botha, at the presidential mansion over tea. The government 
called it a "courtesy call" and said the two leaders had only discussed 
politics in broad terms, with both expressing their desire for peaceful change 
in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials had been meeting extensively with Mandela for 
years, but it was the first face-to-face meeting between the president and his 
most famous prisoner. It raised hopes in overseas capitals that Mandela's 
release, and negotiations between blacks and whites over South Africa's future, 
were near. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, though, Mandela, in his first officially sanctioned public 
statement since his conviction, said his position had not changed in 28 years 
-- that "the only way of ending violence and bringing peace to our country" is 
for the government to open a "dialogue with the African National Congress." 
</P>
<P>
But the government has refused to talk with the ANC until the organization 
renounces violence. And the ANC has refused to talk with the government until 
Mandela is freed, the state of emergency lifted and bans on anti-apartheid 
groups rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela added that his release "is not an issue at this stage. . . . I only 
would like to contribute to the creation of a climate which would promote peace 
in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
The government of President Frederik W. de Klerk, elected in September on a 
promise to lure blacks to the negotiating table, began to view Mandela as the 
key to opening that process. 
</P>
<P>
"He's someone the government feels it can talk to," said a political analyst 
privy to the thinking of De Klerk and his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Mandela was instrumental in obtaining the October release of 
seven ANC leaders, including Walter Sisulu and four others who had been 
convicted with him in 1964. Mandela watched De Klerk announce those releases on 
television in his prison living room, surrounded by Sisulu's wife, Albertina, 
and three other anti-apartheid leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In December, De Klerk met Mandela for the first time, and the black leader 
offered a lengthy policy statement entitled, "A Document to Create a Climate of 
Understanding." That document, the contents of which remain secret, is under 
study by the ANC's exile headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's carefully chosen words have long carried special force in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial in which he and seven other leaders of the ANC and the South 
African Communist Party were sentenced to life imprisonment, Mandela testified 
that he had dedicated his life "to this struggle of the African people." 
</P>
<P>
"I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black 
domination," he said then. "I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free 
society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal 
opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if 
needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die." 
</P>
<P>
That personal creed has echoed through the intervening years, becoming part of 
the political manifesto of South Africa's blacks, and transforming Mandela into 
a larger-than-life figure, a Moses who blacks think will lead them to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
He has been honored by the United Nations, European parliaments and human 
rights organizations. Universities have bestowed honorary doctorates on him, 
cities have named streets and parks after him and past winners of the Nobel 
Peace Prize have nominated him for the award. His face even appears on a 
postage stamp in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's refusal to compromise has been more than a matter of personal 
integrity. The government has tried to persuade blacks to work within the 
present political system, accepting advisory roles in the government instead of 
a one-person, one-vote system. Mandela's stand has made it possible for others 
to campaign not for the reform of racial segregation and white rule but for its 
abolition. 
</P>
<P>
"Many more people might have succumbed to this false promise of gradual change 
were it not for his example. Others, but for his counsel, might have rushed 
precipitously into revolution that would turn into a racial civil war that no 
one wants," said Patrick Lekota, a leader of the United Democratic Front who 
served five years on a treason conviction that was recently overturned on 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
While on Robben Island, a penal colony off Cape Town and for seven years at 
Pollsmoor Prison in the city's suburbs, Mandela trained two generations of 
cadres for the African National Congress and reshaped the outlook of scores of 
political prisoners, some of whom were ideologically opposed to the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know Mandela best are confident that upon release, he will at once 
rejoin the campaign against apartheid. But they describe him as a practical man 
who will also reassure the country's 5 million whites of his commitment to a 
nonracial society. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Suzman, 72, a leading liberal member of the white house of Parliament, 
has seen Mandela a half-dozen times over the years. After lunch with him at his 
prison quarters last summer, she described him as "an extraordinary man." 
</P>
<P>
"As always," she said, "I was impressed by his obvious leadership qualities, 
his moderation and his appreciation of the fear of the white minority. His 
unconditional release and his presence at the negotiating table is an absolute 
prerequisite to" peace in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike white people anywhere else in Africa, whites in South Africa belong 
here -- this is their home," Mandela told Samuel Dash, a law professor and 
former chief counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee, four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Mandela also made clear his determination to see apartheid ended 
completely, not adapted through the government's step-by-step reforms, Dash 
wrote in the New York Times Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"If white leaders do not act in good faith toward us, if they will not meet 
with us to discuss political equality and if, in effect, they tell us we must 
remain subjugated by whites, then there is really no alternative other than 
violence," Mandela told Dash. "And, I assure you, we will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
It was the same sense of conviction and reasonableness that he showed in 1964 
when he explained why he had turned to sabotage after two decades of nonviolent 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not deny that I planned sabotage," he told the court from the prisoner's 
dock. "I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness, nor because I have any 
love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of 
the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, 
exploitation and oppression of my people by the whites." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, born in 1918, was the eldest son of a chief of the Xhosa-speaking 
Thembu people in Transkei, and he was raised with the self-assurance of African 
royalty in the household of the Thembus' paramount chief. 
</P>
<P>
He studied at South Africa's Fort Hare University, where Zimbabwe's prime 
minister, Robert Mugabe, and other leaders of independent black Africa have 
studied. He was expelled for helping organize a student strike. 
</P>
<P>
He went to Johannesburg, worked for a time as a mine policeman and clerk, 
graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand and then became apprenticed 
to a white law firm before he established his own practice with Oliver R. 
Tambo, a friend from Fort Hare, who is now the president in exile of the 
African National Congress. (He earned a formal law degree in 1989 through 
correspondence courses.) 
</P>
<P>
In 1944, Mandela joined the congress, which had been founded in 1912, and with 
Tambo and other young men turned it from petitions for redress of blacks' 
grievances to protests on a broader scale. When the National Party came to 
power in 1948 and began to impose its apartheid policies on the country, the 
congress, under Mandela's and Tambo's direction, launched renewed campaigns of 
civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was at first given a suspended sentence for violating the country's 
security laws, then was silenced and restricted in his movements by a 
government "banning" order. Later, he was detained along with 155 others, 
charged with treason and, after a four-year trial that ended in 1961, acquitted 
along with the other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress was outlawed in the wake of the protests that 
followed the fatal police shooting on March 21, 1960, of 69 blacks engaged in 
passive resistance at Sharpeville, a black township about 50 miles south of 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
The congress then turned to sabotage and away from its campaigns of passive 
resistance that, following the example of India's Mohandas K. Gandhi, were 
aimed at pressuring the government to end apartheid and convene an all-race 
national convention to write a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was a central figure in this shift, drawing up the plans to establish 
the congress underground and becoming the first commander of its military wing. 
Sabotage was to be the strategy to disrupt the economy and scare away capital. 
But, to avoid loss of life, terrorism, guerrilla war and a full-scale rebellion 
were ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time, as it came in my life," he declared at his trial, "when a 
man is denied the right to live a normal life, when he can only live the life 
of an outlaw because the government has so decreed to use the law to impose a 
state of outlawry upon him. I was driven to this situation, and I do not regret 
the decisions that I did take." 
</P>
<P>
Slipping across the border, Mandela visited Ethiopia, Algeria and other African 
countries, arranging military training for congress members and undergoing a 
brief training course himself. His secret return to South Africa and his 
daredevil underground existence earned him the title of the "Black Pimpernel" 
and added to his romantic image among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
He was caught eventually, sentenced to five years in prison for incitement to 
violence and leaving the country illegally. While serving that term, he was 
brought back to court, charged with treason and eventually convicted of 
sabotage along with most of the Spear of the Nation's high command. 
</P>
<P>
This was to be the temporary end of Mandela and of the African National 
Congress. Most of its leaders were in jail or exile, and scores of its 
grass-roots members were arrested. Its guerrillas made occasional bomb attacks, 
but were usually caught quickly. The underground organization was heavily 
infiltrated by the police. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela, now 54, a social worker by training, took up the cause but was 
quickly "banned" herself, barred from politics and eventually exiled to the 
small farming community of Brandfort in the Orange Free State. She returned to 
Soweto in 1985, defying the government's restrictions, and was allowed to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Married 31 years, they lived together for only four months, and for only a few 
weeks at a time. For years, they were separated by thick glass when she made 
closely supervised visits in prison, unable even to touch. Not until 1984, when 
Mandela required surgery for removal of his enlarged prostate gland, did the 
whole family get together for the first time since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Their daughters, Zenani, 30, and Zindziswa, 29, have joined what is now a 
family cause, speaking and traveling on behalf of their parents. Mandela also 
had three children from his first marriage. One son, Makgatho, 39, runs a 
general store in the Transkei homeland, and a daughter, Makaziwe, 35, is 
working on a doctorate in anthropology at the University of Massachusetts. One 
son died in an auto accident several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
When he was first imprisoned on Robben Island, Mandela spent most of his time 
at hard labor, quarrying limestone, but through repeated protests he won 
permission to study and garden. In recent years, he has exercised vigorously, 
using an exercise bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
With daily newspapers, a radio, television and a steady flow of books and 
magazines, Mandela managed in recent years to keep himself fully informed on 
developments in South Africa and elsewhere. Until 1988, political discussions 
with other black nationalist leaders who were his cellmates were daily fare. 
</P>
<P>
Close friends said that although Mandela enjoyed the large house on the prison 
farm, he felt isolated and missed the daily contact of other prisoners, who 
were allowed infrequent visits. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's long incarceration did not, contrary to the expectations of the 
government, turn him into a non-person, forgotten by his supporters. Instead, 
his leadership image of self-sacrifice and refusal to compromise with apartheid 
has been enhanced to the point of legend.

<TEXT>
<P>
From behind bars, Nelson Mandela has dominated the fight for black rights in 
South Africa. The following are some of the key events in his life. 
</P>
<P>
1944 
</P>
<P>
Mandela joins the African National Congress at age 26, later becoming president 
of the group's Youth League. In a short time, the ANC becomes the force behind 
black protests. When the National Party comes to power in 1948, the ANC begins 
planning a campaign of civil disobedience to fight the party's apartheid 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
June, 1952 
</P>
<P>
Mandela is named leader of the campaign and breaks curfew as the first act of 
defiance. In December, he is arrested and charged under Suppression of 
Communism Act. He gets a suspended sentence and is barred from attending 
meetings or leaving Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
December, 1956 
</P>
<P>
A campaign of civil disobedience by the ANC results in Mandela being detained 
along with 155 others and charged with treason. The trial, which lasts until 
1961, ends in acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
March, 1960 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine black protesters are killed by police in Sharpeville; a state of 
emergency is declared and the ANC is outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1962 
</P>
<P>
Attends Pan-African Freedom Movement Conference in Ethiopia; travels to London 
to meet with leftists. In August he is charged with incitement and leaving the 
country illegally; gets five-year jail term. 
</P>
<P>
July, 1963 
</P>
<P>
With Mandela in jail, police raid ANC offices, seizing documents outlining 
guerrilla campaign. Mandela, seven others are charged with sabotage and 
conspiracy to overthrow the government. 
</P>
<P>
April-June, 1964 
</P>
<P>
Mandela and seven others are sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
May, 1984 
</P>
<P>
Mandela is allowed a visit with his wife -- the first since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1985 
</P>
<P>
President Pieter W. Botha offers to free Mandela if he renounces violence; 
Mandela refuses until the government takes steps to dismantle apartheid and 
grants full political rights to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
July, 1988 
</P>
<P>
Mandela turns 70. A rock concert in London is held in his honor. But South 
Africa bans all local celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
August, 1988 
</P>
<P>
Mandela contracts tuberculosis and is transferred to a hospital. Three months 
later he is taken to a prison farm in Paarl and placed in a house usually 
reserved for prison employees. 
</P>
<P>
July, 1989 
</P>
<P>
Mandela meets with outgoing president Botha at the presidential mansion. One 
week later, Mandela is allowed to make his first officially sanctioned public 
statement since his conviction. His statement makes clear his position has not 
changed in 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
December, 1989 
</P>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk meets Mandela for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
February, 1990 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk lifts ANC ban and says Mandela will be released. On Feb. 11, the 
nation's best-known black leader becomes a free man at last.

Robbers forced seven people into a bowling alley office Saturday and shot an 
employee, his two young daughters and another girl to death before setting a 
fire to try to cover up the crime, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is a very vicious crime, the assassination of kids," said 
Las Cruces police Capt. Fred Rubio. 
</P>
<P>
"A whole family was assassinated." 
</P>
<P>
The three survivors, and residents living near the Las Cruces Bowl, gave police 
a description of two men believed to have committed the robbery and shootings. 
</P>
<P>
State police and U.S. Border Patrol agents joined Las Cruces police in a search 
for the two men, who were reported driving an older model van or utility 
vehicle. Roadblocks were set up on streets and highways near the city. 
</P>
<P>
The three survivors, all adults, were taken to Memorial General Hospital where 
they were reported in critical condition, Rubio said. He would not release 
their names. 
</P>
<P>
The three dead girls were 3, 7 and 13 years old, Rubio said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said a fire was reported at the bowling alley at 8:33 a.m., a 
half-hour after it opened. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not disclose the amount of money taken.

3-MONTH PERRIER SALES HALT SEEN POSSIBLE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE AMERICAN IMPORTER OF THE FRENCH MINERAL WATER BELIEVES THAT 'HUMAN 
ERROR' CAUSED THE BENZENE CONTAMINATION.

<P>
The American importer of Perrier said Saturday that it will stop selling the 
French mineral water for two to three months while the company seeks the source 
of a cancer-causing chemical that showed up in tests of the product last week. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials believe that "human error" was involved in the contamination 
of the water, possibly in the production of its famed green bottles, or in the 
shipping from its plant in Vergeze, France. 
</P>
<P>
But Ronald V. Davis, president of Perrier Group of America Inc., said that he 
would not elaborate until the company is certain of the cause. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, speaking at a news conference at the company's U.S. headquarters in 
Greenwich, Conn., called the contamination "a very freak accident" that he said 
did not appear to involve criminal intent. 
</P>
<P>
Although the source of the water -- a natural spring in Vergeze -- has been 
found to be free of contamination, Perrier is temporarily shutting down its 
entire production operation in France and is blocking further shipments to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Perrier recalled an estimated 72 million bottles of the mineral 
water from stores and restaurants across the nation after a relatively small 
amount of benzene was found in a sample in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration said that consumers of Perrier faced no 
immediate danger to their health because the levels of benzene found were so 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
FDA tests of 13 product samples found benzene levels from 12 to 20 parts per 
billion, an amount that nevertheless exceeds the federal standard of 5 parts 
per billion. 
</P>
<P>
Benzene, a colorless, flammable chemical used in making paint, detergent and 
other products, has been found to cause leukemia and blood disorders in people 
exposed to high doses for lengthy periods. 
</P>
<P>
No recall of Perrier has been ordered in Europe, even though Davis said it was 
possible that the same problem that afflicted the water sold in the United 
States also affected water sold in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Perrier is the best-selling carbonated, or "sparkling," water in the United 
States, with sales of about $160 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the business of selling purity," Davis said. "We think that this 
decision is right because we think in the long run our consumers will come 
back," he said. Davis said it would take between two months and three months to 
import enough new Perrier from France to resume sales in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The company will lose about $40 million in sales if the product is off the 
market for three months, he said, in addition to any lost business owing to 
potential damage to the product's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
William F. Deal, executive vice president of the International Bottled Water 
Assn. in Alexandria, Va., said that the Perrier incident would strengthen his 
group's argument that the FDA should establish its own standards for acceptable 
benzene levels in food and beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Although the FDA does do random testing for benzene, he said, it relies on 
standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Severe thunderstorms slashed through parts of the Southeast late Friday and 
early Saturday with tornadoes and high winds, killing four people, injuring 
dozens of others, knocking out power to thousands and damaging buildings and 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
In the Atlanta area, two people died Saturday when trees fell into their 
bedrooms, and a woman in north central Louisiana was killed Friday night when a 
wind gust threw her mobile home 30 feet, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a band of severe storms that developed over northeast Texas and spread 
eastward during the afternoon," said Ernest Ethridge of the National Weather 
Service. "We've had rainfall across the area of 4 to 14 inches." 
</P>
<P>
The thunderstorm line, moving east overnight, brought reports of tornado 
touchdowns in Louisiana, Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas, and high winds at 
one point knocked out power to 112,000 utility customers in Alabama and 300,000 
in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Ethridge said winds up to 50 m.p.h. knocked down trees, and hail knocked out 
windows in buildings and cars in northern Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
In Calhoun, La., Shirley Robinson, 47, died and her 5-year-old grandson, 
Darrell Robinson, suffered minor injuries Friday night when a gust flipped her 
trailer home almost 30 feet, Ouachita Parish sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm knocked out power to about 10,000 Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. 
customers, and the blackout continued into Saturday morning for about 2,100 in 
Sterlington, said LP&amp;L District Manager Bill Turnbough. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia authorities said Elizabeth Stevens, 72, of Norcross died when a 
3-foot-thick pine tree fell into her bedroom, and Mantrell Crowley, a 
10-year-old boy, was killed by a tree that fell on his bedroom in southwest 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
In Henry County, south of Atlanta, Thomas A. Henderson, 69, was killed when he 
was crushed by a tree as he stood near his mailbox, county Coroner Ronnie 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon, repair crews had restored power to 200,000 customers in 
metropolitan Atlanta, but isolated areas could be blacked out until today, 
Georgia Power Co. spokesman Trip Cagle said. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama Power Co. estimated 112,000 homes and businesses without electricity in 
the southern two-thirds of the state, and called in repair crews from 
Mississippi and Florida, company spokesman Mike Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 24 people were injured, two of them seriously, in Alabama's Talladega 
County, and Sheriff Jerry Studdard said at least 15 mobile homes were 
demolished. National Guard troops cleared fallen trees that closed U.S. 280. 
</P>
<P>
The storms brought gusts of more than 80 m.p.h. in Atlanta and Macon, with 
tornadoes damaging structures in Columbus, Americus and other parts of 
northeastern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Albert McManus of Huntsville, Ala., said he and his wife, Pamela, were visiting 
relatives in the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, Ga., and were awakened by howling 
winds around 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard something that sounded like an F-15 jet," McManus said. "Then the wind 
took the roof completely off. The wall fell on my wife and me, and I somehow 
managed to lift the wall and get my wife out." 
</P>
<P>
Columbus police Maj. Ross McCain said tornadoes touched down in the central and 
east portions of that city, inflicting substantial damage to buildings, but no 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
In Americus, authorities said a tornado touched down about 6:30 a.m., ripping 
the roof off a convenience store and throwing it 150 yards where it landed atop 
a house. A man sleeping inside was injured slightly. 
</P>
<P>
The storm line advanced into the Carolinas, bringing tornadoes and slashing 
winds early Saturday to western North Carolina and northwestern South Carolina, 
where two people received minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
A twister also touched down Saturday in the Florida Panhandle city of Milton, 
damaging 50 to 60 homes, but causing no injuries, officials said.

LONG BEACH OFFICER KILLS ROBBERY SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man suspected of robbing the customer of a bank automated teller machine was 
shot and killed by a Long Beach police officer who apparently believed he was 
armed and aiming at him, officials said Saturday. No gun was found with the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
A second suspect, 24-year-old Keith Hughes of Compton, was arrested. The 
robbery occurred Friday night at a Bank of America building near the corner of 
Willow Street and Daisy Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the dead man had not been released by late Saturday. He was 
pronounced dead at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center shortly after the 8 p.m. 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when officers discovered two suspects beating a victim who 
apparently had just made a withdrawal from the teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
When ordered to surrender, the suspects fled in different directions, police 
said. Officer Jim Hill, a 13-year veteran, said he observed one of the suspects 
turn toward him with an object in his right hand. The officer said he fired at 
him, but the suspect continued to run. 
</P>
<P>
About two blocks away, Officer Ralph Robbins, an eight-year veteran, caught up 
with the suspect, who he said was crouched behind a car. 
</P>
<P>
"He was still holding the object in his right hand," Long Beach Police Lt. 
Philip King said. "Thinking that the suspect had a weapon and was preparing to 
fire at him, Officer Robbins fired at the suspect." 
</P>
<P>
He was hit by about four shots, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said no gun was found on or near his body. 
</P>
<P>
As is the procedure in all officer-involved shootings, the district attorney's 
special investigations division was called in to determine whether the officers 
were justified in using lethal force. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery victim, who was not identified, was treated at the scene for his 
injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was booked for investigation of murder as well as robbery. Police 
alleged that by fleeing, Hughes provoked the use of deadly force against the 
second suspect.

GALILEO'S CAMERA GOES AWRY, KEEPS SNAPPING FOR 5 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Galileo's camera shutter snapped uncontrollably for five hours Saturday after 
the spacecraft zipped around Venus, but officials said it should not endanger 
the $1.35-billion, eight-year mission to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory shut off the television camera 
while they diagnosed the problem, which apparently involved faulty software 
that made Galileo's computer send incorrect commands to the camera, mission 
director Neal Ausman said. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo cruised around Venus at about 10 p.m. PST Friday, coming three to four 
miles closer to the planet than the planned point of closest approach of 10,028 
miles above the surface, said mission science and design manager Bill O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
The camera appeared undamaged, but its shutter opened and closed twice per 
minute for a total of 468 times over five hours, Ausman said. As planned, only 
16 pictures taken late Friday and early Saturday were stored on Galileo's tape 
recorder, Ausman said. 
</P>
<P>
The malfunction did not harm those pictures, and the 452 unwanted shutter 
snappings were "just like taking pictures with no film in the camera," project 
manager Dick Spehalski said during a Saturday news conference. 
</P>
<P>
However the problem threatened another five dozen photos the spacecraft was 
supposed to take during the coming week to make a time-lapse movie of Venus' 
cloud and wind patterns, said project scientist Torrence Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo was deployed from space shuttle Atlantis last Oct. 18 on a looping 
2.4-billion mile, six-year route that requires Venus and Earth to be used as 
gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
Once there, the spacecraft will deploy a probe to study Jupiter's atmosphere, 
then orbit the giant gas planet for at least two years.

<P>
Three men accused of smuggling heroin from China sewn inside the bellies of 
goldfish have asked that the case be dismissed because a prosecution witness 
from China has asked for political asylum. U.S. District Judge William Orrick 
set Monday for a hearing on how to proceed with the trial. Shanghai witness 
Wang Zong Xiao threw the trial into turmoil last week when he asked for asylum, 
claiming he was told to lie about portions of the smuggling case and to refuse 
to talk about prison conditions in China. 
</P>
<P>
Orrick placed Wang under court protection until the resolution of his asylum 
request, now pending before the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, to 
prevent his sudden return to China. The State Department refused to comment on 
the case, but is expected to review and recommend how to handle Wang's request. 
The Chinese Consulate in San Francisco condemned Orrick's action as "utter 
defiance of basic international laws and norms governing international 
relations." Wang said in a written statement that he was beaten and tortured in 
Shanghai during 1988 and witnessed the beating and torture of pro-democracy 
students and journalists while he was held by the Public Security Bureau. He 
also said he was ordered not to discuss the conditions in Shanghai and fears 
for his life if he is returned to China.

SPILL AT A GLANCE THE SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ship: American Trader. 
</P>
<P>
Oil spilled: Nearly 400,000 gallons, Southern California's biggest in two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
When: About 4:30 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Washing ashore along a 14-mile stretch as far north as Seal Beach. 
Several fingers of the slick were within two miles of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean depth: As little as 50 feet in some spots in the sea berth, 60 feet or 
more in area where ship maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
How: Coast Guard suspects the ship ran over its port anchor while maneuvering 
into a U-shaped nest of seven mooring buoys off Huntington Beach. As crew 
pulled up anchor, it apparently wrapped around bow and put two holes and a dent 
in the starboard bottom of hull. Ship also may have hit sea bottom, causing 
anchor to puncture hull. 
</P>
<P>
The slick: At least 60 square miles. About 10% of the oil was recovered by 
skimmer boats. 
</P>
<P>
Oil left: Damaged tank still contains more than 19.32 million gallons of oil, 
but it apparently is not leaking. Steel and wood patches are likely to be 
placed over the two holes in the tanker by early this week. 
</P>
<P>
THE SHIP 
</P>
<P>
Built: In 1969 by Sun Shipbuilders and Drydock Inc. of Philadelphia, now 
defunct. Named America Sun. Acquired by American Trading Transport Co. Inc. on 
July 11, 1989, and renamed American Trader. Chartered by British Petroleum Co. 
of North America, which was operating it at time of spill. 
</P>
<P>
Width: 125 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Length: 800 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Hull depth: 42 or more feet below water surface at time of incident. 
</P>
<P>
Anchor: More than 10 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Oil capacity: 23 million gallons. More than a dozen tanks, some of them for 
ballast and ship waste. Fully loaded at time of incident. 
</P>
<P>
Itinerary: Planned to unload more than 12 million gallons at the sea berth, 
where a pipeline connects to a Santa Fe Springs Refinery. The rest was to be 
delivered to the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
THE CLEANUP 
</P>
<P>
Offshore: At least 13 skimmer boats are on scene. Coast Guard was also there to 
monitor operation. 
</P>
<P>
Beaches: As oil comes ashore, cleanup crew in slickers use absorbent pads on 
sand. More than 500 workers were scheduled to be involved in the cleanup by 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Preventive measures: Rubberized booms have been set up to keep oil from 
estuaries at Bolsa Chica State Reserve, Anaheim Bay, Upper Newport Bay and 
Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
Options: Officials have ruled out chemical dispersants, which break up the 
slick. Dispersants can reduce the chance that oil will wash ashore but cannot 
be used in shallow areas because of possible toxic effects on bottom-dwelling 
organisms, fish or shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
Birds: Sixty-six oil-covered shore birds washed up after spill, 31 of them 
dead. If slick reaches Bolsa Chica wetlands at north end of Huntington Beach, 
it could be devastating to one of California's largest ecological reserves. 
California brown pelican, California least tern, the light-footed clapper rail 
and the salt marsh bird's beak, an upper marsh coastal plant, are endangered 
species in the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Other wildlife: One dead sea lion washed ashore in Huntington Beach Saturday 
night, but it was unclear late Saturday whether oil caused the death. The oil 
could take a deadly toll on fish and perhaps marine mammals such as sea lions. 
Oil mats mammals' fur, making them susceptible to cold and less buoyant. About 
30 seals were spotted Friday on mooring buoys near the tanker but apparently 
were unharmed. More critically endangered may be tiny links in aquatic food 
chain -- anchovies, mussels and barnacles.

INFRASTRUCTURE: AFTER PAT BROWN, GOVERNORS CUT SPENDING. BUT ANTI-TAX 
INITIATIVES AND ANTI-GROWTH SENTIMENT ALSO CHANGED THE PICTURE.

<P>
Who is to blame for California's failure to maintain its physical plant over 
the last two decades? 
</P>
<P>
In part, it is the federal government, which has amassed such an enormous 
budget deficit that it has been forced to reduce construction grants to the 
states for roads, sewers, airports, higher education facilities and many other 
building programs. 
</P>
<P>
California political leaders share the blame, especially recent governors. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later, government has to lead on this issue and the one with the 
best pulpit is the governor," said Lewis H. Butler, president of the planning 
group called California Tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
But Democrat Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, who governed from 1959 to 1967, was the 
last to use this pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
With Brown proposing the programs, and with powerful allies providing the 
political muscle to move them through the Legislature, California expanded the 
freeway system, launched the State Water Project and built several new 
university and state college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat Brown had the vision," said Gerald Meral, executive director of the 
California Planning and Conservation League. "That was just as important as the 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Even some Republicans agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody will deny that Pat Brown made a tremendous contribution 
to the state's infrastructure," said state Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim). 
</P>
<P>
But in 1967 Brown was replaced by conservative Ronald Reagan and the mood 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"When Old Man Brown was escorted out by Reagan, the era of maintenance came 
into existence," said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Reagan argued that Brown's profligate spending had left the state in such 
terrible financial shape that major programs had to be curtailed. The voters 
seemed to agree, reelecting him easily in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"After Pat Brown, the voters were clearly of a mind to have a slightly 
different approach," said Ray Remy, executive director of the Los Angeles 
Chamber of Commerce. "There was a feeling that we had grown too fast, spent too 
much . . . people were comfortable with Reagan's more limited view of 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan was succeeded by Pat Brown's son, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., a 
puzzling political figure who seemed to be much influenced by the "small is 
beautiful" thinking of British economist E. F. Schumacher and who also seemed 
to lose interest in governing during his second term. 
</P>
<P>
No one is more critical of Jerry Brown than liberal Democrats, among whose 
number he once was counted. 
</P>
<P>
"He was part of the anti-growth, anti-government attitude of the last 20 
years," said state Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove). "This bad-mouthing of 
government has placed the state's future in serious jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
George Deukmejian, the conservative Republican who became governor in 1983, 
inherited a substantial budget deficit from Jerry Brown and spent much of his 
first term in office balancing the budget and resisting new spending 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has spent billions on prison construction, and on buildings for the 
University of California and the California State University, but as the 
state's infrastructure has begun to collapse, the governor's parsimonious 
approach often has been compared unfavorably to Pat Brown's. 
</P>
<P>
State Finance Director Jesse R. Huff thinks that is unfair because state 
government is responsible for many more kinds of infrastructure than it was 25 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat Brown was a builder, there's no doubt about that," Huff said, "but it was 
mainly in water, highways and higher education. Now we have energy, mass 
transportation, solid waste, public schools -- a long laundry list of 
infrastructure needs." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a different game," he added. "I think this Administration has done a good 
job of keeping up and hasn't been parsimonious at all." 
</P>
<P>
Many think the voters have no one to blame but themselves for the state's 
deteriorating physical plant and for declining state services. In 1978 they 
approved Proposition 13, which sharply cut property taxes, reducing drastically 
the construction funds available to local government. A year later, voters 
endorsed Proposition 4, the Gann limit on state spending. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not 'them,' it's all of us," said Steven Levy, director of the Center for 
the Continuing Study of the California Economy. "We all voted for Proposition 
13 and the Gann limit." 
</P>
<P>
Some believe the public now is more willing to pay for needed construction and 
repair and for better government services. 
</P>
<P>
They point to the $5.5 billion in state bond issues that were approved in 1988, 
the 16 counties that have voted for local sales tax increases in recent years, 
and the public's willingness to support a temporary quarter-cent statewide 
sales tax increase to pay for Northern California earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Others are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't have anything like the critical political mass needed for a 
major push on infrastructure," said Edward K. Hamilton, a Los Angeles economic 
consultant and a former deputy mayor of New York City. "Even in transportation, 
the interest is limited mostly to Southern California."

DEPUTIES RESPONDING TO CALL KILL MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was shot to death Saturday night by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
after they were summoned to a quiet residential neighborhood in Lynwood to 
break up a dispute between two men, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Details were sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred at 7:18 p.m. in the 3500 block of Brenton Avenue. 
Neighbors reported hearing at least four shots. One woman said the unidentified 
dead man apparently was shot in a scuffle with deputies after refusing orders 
to lie on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has been criticized by blacks after the shooting death 
by a deputy of a Nation of Islam member who allegedly had taken the deputy's 
gun. The victim Saturday night was described by witnesses only as a middle-aged 
white male.

BILLBOARD'S BLUNT MESSAGE GETS THE WORD OUT TO VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, the billboard in San Francisco's downtown featuring a young, 
denim-clad Vietnamese man with a cigarette dangling from his mouth may look 
like just another smoking ad aiming to entice. 
</P>
<P>
But a double take at the brand name of the cigarette pack the model holds shows 
the universal symbol of death: a skull and crossbones. 
</P>
<P>
And in Vietnamese, the billboard reads: "You wouldn't want your friend to get 
cancer -- so why offer him a cigarette?" 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by a Bay Area health group, it is the first Vietnamese-language 
anti-smoking billboard to appear in the United States. The sign also is a 
harbinger of messages to come throughout the rest of California as the state 
readies a $28.6-million anti-tobacco campaign. The primary targets: pregnant 
women, young people and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The campaign will definitely have a minority focus since minorities are at 
high risk for lung cancer and heart diseases as a result of (high rates of) 
smoking," said Dearell Niemeyer, chief of local programs for the Tobacco 
Control Section of the state Department of Health Services in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Niemeyer added that although the Vietnamese-language billboard is not 
officially part of the state campaign, it "is a foreshadowing of what's to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
Niemeyer said that getting the anti-smoking message across to the state's Asian 
population will be particularly challenging. 
</P>
<P>
"The multiethnic Asian population will require special attention," Niemeyer 
said. "Unlike the black and Latino populations which have a common language, 
this group will be a real tough media target because of the language 
differences and geographic concentration of the various communities." 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese-language billboard in San Francisco is the brainchild of the 
Vietnamese Community Health Promotion Project, a state-funded research group 
based at UC's San Francisco Medical Center. The sign was unveiled in January. 
</P>
<P>
"We came up with the idea after we conducted a study of Vietnamese male 
smokers," said Chris Jenkins, project director. "They told us that carrying a 
pack of cigarettes and offering their friends cigarettes is very important to 
them. We're trying to get the message across that what they're really offering 
them is cancer." 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 project survey of 215 randomly selected Vietnamese men and women in the 
San Francisco-Oakland area found that 56% of the males were smokers. In 
contrast, a recent study by the Altanta-based Centers for Disease Control found 
that among all California men, 26% are smokers. 
</P>
<P>
The project's findings sparked a "real fear" among the group's officials that 
an epidemic of cancer and heart disease could break out among Vietnamese men 
within the next two decades, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The project's 1988 survey found that only 9% of Vietnamese women were smokers. 
In contrast, the Centers for Disease Control study found that among all 
California women, 25% are smokers. 
</P>
<P>
"We think men are actually starting to quit, as more and more acculturate to 
American society and find (smoking) less acceptable," Jenkins said. "But as 
Vietnamese women acculturate, their numbers might increase as they become more 
like their California counterparts."

STABBED DRIVER HITS HOUSE BEFORE DYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 29-year-old Rowland Heights man who had been stabbed in the chest lost 
control of his car and smashed into the side of a La Puente house early 
Saturday before dying en route to a local hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputy Rafael Estrada said the victim, Nathan Wayne Atwood, crashed 
into a residence at 17341 Azalea Court, just north of the Pomona Freeway, 
around 12:20 a.m. Paramedics "discovered that he had been stabbed in the upper 
torso and he died on arrival at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina," 
Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said homicide investigators were looking into the case. He said Atwood 
was the only person in the 1970 AMC Hornet when it careened off the road and 
hit the house. No one inside the home was injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said damage to the house was "moderate."

4 INJURED IN CRASH AT LONG BEACH AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A twin-engine plane crashed and skidded off the runway while aborting a landing 
at Long Beach Airport Saturday, injuring four people and temporarily closing 
two of the airport's five runways. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot and three passengers were only slightly injured in the accident, 
which happened at 1:06 p.m. when the Piper Apache was coming in for a landing 
behind other aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Art Morriston, a Federal Aviation Administration duty officer in Hawthorne, 
said the control tower had ordered the pilot to "go around" because the plane 
was following too close behind another aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"He started to climb and it appears the pilot lost control and he went left 
wing down . . . until he hit the ground," Morriston said. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said the plane, which was heavily damaged, came to a stop in 
a grassy area but did not catch fire. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the injured, identified as Richard Houston, 37, and his wife, Ella, both 
of Lakewood, were taken to St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach where they 
were both in stable condition. Houston was cut on his leg while his wife 
suffered a possible concussion, a hospital spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
The other passengers, Brian E. Beamer, 27, of Garden Grove and James A. Michel, 
35, of Huntington Beach, suffered minor injuries and were treated and released 
at Long Beach Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known who was piloting the plane during the crash or 
where the flight originated. 
</P>
<P>
Lonnie Mitchell, an airport spokesperson, said two of the airport's runways 
were closed for several hours after the crash.

JAMES FLANIGAN: CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR ENTREPRENEURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The entrepreneur, the much ballyhooed hero of U.S. business in the 1980s, is in 
for tough times in the years ahead and, in fact, hasn't had it too good lately. 
</P>
<P>
The flow of seed money that wealthy families and corporate pension and 
development funds invest in new companies declined last year to $2.6 billion, 
according to Venture Economics, a Wellesley Hills, Mass., research firm. That 
was down from a $3-billion-plus average for 1983 to 1988 and well down from the 
$4.2 billion of 1987 -- the year the stock market crashed. 
</P>
<P>
The crash clobbered small company chances. Only 203 new companies sold stock to 
the public in 1989, according to the trade magazine IPO Reporter, down from 
almost 700 companies in 1986. And the decline in enterprise extends to private 
companies. Openings of new businesses are probably down 20% from the mid-'80s, 
according to an informal estimate by Dun &amp; Bradstreet. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook is not optimistic, say venture capital firms nationwide. "It's 
tough to raise money," says Eric Schiffer, a partner in Los Angeles' Oxford 
Partners, which helped launch computer retailer Businessland in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
So what? So plenty. Entrepreneurial companies are what this system thrives on. 
In small business of every variety, some 250,000 new companies spring up each 
year -- with perhaps one company in 25 surviving. Yet out of that teeming 
activity come most of the new jobs in the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
And venture capital-backed entrepreneurs hold special honor for creating not 
simply companies but whole new industries, from electronics in the 1970s to 
biotechnology in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
That there's less money around for such heroes today is ominous for the 
economy, casting a shadow on expectations of strong new growth in the 1990s and 
reflecting a worrisome lack of confidence in the present. 
</P>
<P>
It's not really that risks have changed in venture capital; it has always been 
a reach for the brass ring. An entrepreneur raises an initial stake from family 
and friends -- or a second mortgage on the house. And venture capital funds 
help at the next stage with money and expertise to develop the young company's 
product or service. If successful, the fledgling may be acquired by a larger 
firm or it may sell stock to the public. Either way, the initial backers win 
big: Venture capital funds such as Boston's 22-year-old TA Associates have 
earned 25% to 30% a year compounded. That is, one or two winners out of the 10 
or 12 companies that they back each year more than offset the losers. 
</P>
<P>
A big winner is the kind of payoff that Pathfinder Venture Capital Funds of 
Minneapolis had when it backed Advanced Cardiovascular Services (ACS) with 
$700,000 in 1981. ACS developed balloon angioplasty, a life-saving method of 
keeping veins and arteries open in heart attack victims. The company was 
immediately successful and was acquired by pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly in 
1984, with ACS' venture capital backers getting a $10-million return on their 
$700,000 investment and three times that much if they held on to the Eli Lilly 
shares that they received in the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
So why, with gains like that, isn't everybody rushing to back new companies? 
Lack of confidence dating to the crash of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The crash scared investors more than has been generally acknowledged in the 
past two years as the big institutions have put money back into stocks and the 
market has recovered. But in that recovery, investment has favored the big 
companies, even though big firms declined as much as small ones two years ago. 
Why is that? Because big companies, as well as having size to weather economic 
storms, also tend to have large numbers of shares outstanding -- meaning that 
investors can sell quickly if necessary. So the tendency has been to invest 
with an eye on the exit door, not to invest with confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, though money has been scarce for venture capital funds, it has been 
available until recently for spurious investments -- like the leveraged buyout 
takeover funds of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Such schemes promised venture 
capital-type returns without the effort needed to develop new products or 
create new industries. Instead, they steered money to seemingly risk-free, if 
wasteful, activities like splitting whole companies into parts and selling them 
-- as butchers do with pigs and chickens. 
</P>
<P>
Now LBOs and junk bonds are failing -- and good riddance. But their collapse 
may only cause investors to further avoid venture capital and small business 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
So what can be done to revive support for the entrepreneur? "Pass capital gains 
tax reduction," says Howard Cox, partner in Greylock Management, a Boston-based 
venture capital firm. And to be sure, a cut in the capital gains tax has 
spurred new business before. 
</P>
<P>
But a tax measure won't be enough to do it. What U.S. business, and government 
and society, too, must do is recover confidence -- easier said than done -- and 
a sense of priorities. A recognition that an investment in angioplasty is 
inherently more valuable than one to break up a tobacco company might be a good 
start. A recollection that it was real scientific knowledge and commitment -- 
not card-shark investment banking -- that gave us advances in electronics and 
biotechnology would be helpful, too. 
</P>
<P>
But needed most of all is a renewed willingness to take risks for the kind of 
rewards that only entrepreneurial ventures can bring. The country of the 
entrepreneur, in short, needs to recover the spirit of enterprise.

THE INLAND MIGRATION; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE SEARCH FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS FUELING BUILDING BOOMS IN 
RURAL AREAS. LAKE ELSINORE AND SOLANO COUNTY ARE SHOWING THE STRAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In their eternal quest for open space and affordable homes, Californians are 
moving inland in larger numbers than ever before, sparking an unprecedented 
development boom all through the center of the state. 
</P>
<P>
While average single-family home prices have soared far beyond $200,000 and 
cooled sales in most coastal areas, affordable prices that are still well under 
$200,000 are turning rural towns from Tracy to Temecula into middle-class 
bedroom boom towns. 
</P>
<P>
Two inland counties, Riverside and Sacramento, passed 1 million in population 
in 1989 for the first time. California's total population is increasing fast as 
well, indicating that the torrid pace of development is not about to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
"The economic forces are too strong," said Stephen Levy, economist for the 
Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy. "The growth won't 
disappear." 
</P>
<P>
More people moved to California last year -- 421,000 -- than at any time since 
World War II, according to estimates from the California Department of Finance. 
The state now has more than 29 million people and is expected to have around 35 
million early in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
The inland growth has brought all the unpleasant side effects so familiar on 
the coast -- jammed freeways, unsightly sprawl, overcrowded schools. The 
Central Valley, home to fast-growing cities such as Modesto and Sacramento, is 
spreading out so haphazardly that some planners warn that the region will 
resemble the sprawl of Los Angeles or San Jose someday. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the fast-growing regions grappling with change are Solano County 
northeast of San Francisco and the Lake Elsinore area southeast of Los Angeles. 
Until recently, crowds were scarce and agriculture was king in these regions, 
but both are now showing the strain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Solano County 
</P>
<P>
Vacaville used to be a quiet farm community in rural Solano County midway 
between San Francisco and Sacramento, known primarily for its onion dehydration 
plant, the largest private employer in town. 
</P>
<P>
"You could (always) tell it was Vacaville because you could smell the onions on 
the way through," recalled William J. Carroll, Vacaville's 54-year-old mayor 
and a local businessman who has lived there nearly all his life. 
</P>
<P>
The onion dehydration plant closed a few years ago, and Vacaville's identity 
has been changing ever since. Today, it's a fast-growing suburban community 
where Bank of America, the nation's third-largest bank, plans one day to be the 
biggest non-government employer. 
</P>
<P>
Vacaville and the rest of Solano County have seen explosive growth because they 
are among the last affordable areas left in the nine-county San Francisco Bay 
Area -- and the latest hot spot for business relocations. 
</P>
<P>
The county is in the first stages of a development boom that promises to alter 
its agricultural and military-base character every bit as profoundly as when 
early Spanish settlers dislodged the Southern Patwin Indians in the last 
century. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth is unbelievable," real estate developer Scott R. Sheldon said. 
"It's like Riverside County was a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Solano County is already well on its way to being another ring in the 
suburbanization of the Bay Area, fueled in part by the fact that its neighbor 
to the south, Contra Costa County, is increasingly congested and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Young families are flocking to Solano County in search of a less crowded place 
to live and, most important, homes costing well under $200,000. Typical home 
prices in central Solano County range from $140,000 for resale houses to 
$175,000 for new ones, local real estate experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Solano County is the most affordable area in the Bay Area," said Thomas B. 
Cook, director of housing and land use for the Bay Area Council, a 
business-funded research group. "It has the cheapest houses and the cheapest 
rents." 
</P>
<P>
Affordable homes are a major reason that Cori Curtola Gormley drives 54 miles 
to her secretarial job south of San Francisco. She and her husband live in 
Vallejo, where she was raised. 
</P>
<P>
Once primarily known as a military town, Vallejo is so filled with young 
families that its overloaded school system is on a year-round schedule. "It's 
more a bedroom community now than anything else," Gormley said. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that Solano County had little draw for outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield was the primary staging area for troops 
going to Vietnam, while Mare Island in Vallejo was the shipyard where nearly 
400 combat vessels were built during World War II. Vacaville has a maximum 
security prison. 
</P>
<P>
These days, though, investors are staking claims on agricultural land all over 
the county, which encompasses 834 square miles. "There is not any prime 
agricultural land in the county that is sacrosanct now," state Rep. Thomas 
Hannigan (D-Fairfield) said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The region's population, estimated at 326,000 today, is expected to reach 
455,000 by the year 2005, according to a report by the Assn. of Bay Area 
Governments. The county had 235,000 people in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The growth has taken a toll on everyone. Newcomers are finding school systems 
all over the county ill equipped to handle the influx of students, and the 
freeway system is far from adequate to accommodate the added cars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's traffic, traffic, traffic," said Anthony J. Intintoli, a high school 
teacher and mayor of Vallejo. "That's all everyone wants to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
Fairfield, a fast-growing town of 78,500, has proposed the controversial step 
of establishing a special annual tax on all new homes as a means of funding 10 
new schools costing more than $100 million. Voters turned down a $60-million 
bond issue last year. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities have slapped lids or moratoriums on new-home construction until 
more classrooms are built. Vacaville has proposed a 1,400-unit ceiling on new 
tract homes for 1990, less than half what developers would like. 
</P>
<P>
By the standards of crowded Orange and Los Angeles counties, though, Solano 
County remains relatively open, with a landscape that varies from strikingly 
beautiful and tranquil to Kansas flat. 
</P>
<P>
Though the 25 miles from Vallejo to Vacaville is becoming increasingly 
developed along Interstate 80, miles of hills and postcard-perfect valleys 
remain unblemished. All the county's major towns are located along the freeway 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the future that has locals apprehensive. The sprawl, if not shaped 
properly, may eventually stretch unbroken from the Bay Area all the way to 
Sacramento and perhaps even to Reno, some locals believe. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the potential for explosive growth here, and that's what worries me," 
said Craig McNamara, a local farmer and son of former Defense Secretary Robert 
McNamara. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose and Santa Clara County epitomize the Bay Area sprawl that Solano 
County least wants to emulate. "Will Vacaville Become Another San Jose?" asked 
a recent flyer from the Committee for Orderly Growth, which McNamara heads. 
</P>
<P>
Solano County has avoided some development through a partnership of voters and 
environmentalists who have taken their case to court and the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfield has a program to preserve open space on either side of its borders by 
acquiring property through an agency known as the Solano County Farmlands and 
Open Space Foundation. The foundation just bought a 2,100-acre ranch for about 
$1,000 an acre that it plans to keep as open space. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation was formed after McNamara's group sued the city and agreed to an 
out-of-court settlement for what it claimed was an illegal annexation of 
property for an upscale residential development in Fairfield known as Rancho 
Solano. The foundation's initial funding came in part from a loan from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
McNamara's alliance also played a pivotal role in the passage of Proposition A, 
a hotly contested initiative approved in 1984 that cut off new development in 
unincorporated areas of Solano County. The initiative was drafted after 
residents objected to construction of a new town, which would have been called 
Manzanita, on county land. 
</P>
<P>
Though its proponents were heavily outspent, Proposition A passed narrowly, and 
development on county-controlled land came virtually to a halt. Development is 
now allowed only on property located in a city or in an area that a city is 
planning to annex. 
</P>
<P>
"With some exceptions, it really put the county of Solano out of the 
development business," said Norman J. Repanich, president of the Solano 
Economic Development Corp., a privately funded business group. 
</P>
<P>
Though Proposition A is set to expire in the mid-1990s, it's likely that an 
extension will be put to another vote. Whether it passes again "may be the 
single greatest influence on what the county looks like 10 years from now," 
Hannigan said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, new businesses ranging from a candy factory to a mattress plant have 
moved to Solano County, attracted by affordable land and labor. "You can find 
twice the land at half the price," boasts Gary Falati, the mayor of Fairfield. 
</P>
<P>
One real estate development firm has acquired 4,000 acres of farmland along 
Interstate 80 between Vacaville and Dixon that it plans to develop in the mid- 
to late-1990s. Another investment company has bought more than 1,000 acres from 
Chevron near Vacaville that it plans to develop for homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The most attention, though, has focused on plans by Bank of America to build a 
$125-million office complex on 100 acres near Vacaville in a picturesque area 
known as Lagoon Valley. The development, unveiled in November, is expected to 
employ up to 2,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based bank has obtained an option to buy the property, now 
owned by developer Peter McCuen, and hopes to begin construction next year. The 
property is expected to be annexed by Vacaville, where Mayor Carroll hailed the 
news as "a great day for Vacaville and Solano County" because of all the local 
jobs that it will create. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll clearly has mixed feelings about the growth, though, as do many in 
town. Carroll supports the 1,400-unit limit on new tract homes because the city 
is short of school capacity. 
</P>
<P>
He waxes nostalgic about the old days, fondly remembering the onion dehydration 
plant as the symbol of a different time. "It was the passing of an era" when it 
closed, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Small-town Vacaville is indeed gone. Its population of 66,000 today is expected 
to double in the next 20 years. "I think it has grown too fast," said Margie 
Carroll, the mayor's wife. "I wish it had not happened this way." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Carroll believes that the county can avoid wall-to-wall suburbs only by 
mandating that plenty of open space be provided by developers. "In the final 
analysis, I see the only open space will come from within the areas that are 
being developed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lake Elsinore 
</P>
<P>
Pick the fastest-growing part of the fastest-growing county in California and 
you get a 15-mile patch of freeway along Interstate 15 stretching from Lake 
Elsinore to Temecula in southwest Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Young families fleeing primarily from Orange County, bolstered by retirees from 
Los Angeles and some refugees from San Diego County, have turned this region 
into the newest hot spot for middle-class living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Though a pleasant climate and terrain along with cleaner air are big draws, 
it's the affordable tract homes priced between $100,000 and $250,000 that are 
the main attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"It enabled us to get into our first house, which we couldn't do (in Orange 
County) unless we lived in the ghetto," said one publishing company executive 
who drives from south of Lake Elsinore to Costa Mesa to work. 
</P>
<P>
The influx of people has provided new vigor for Lake Elsinore, a 102-year-old 
city with a highly unpredictable lake on its flank, and given a distinctly 
suburban look to Temecula, which only a few years ago was a quaint village 
encircled by citrus groves, horse farms and wineries. 
</P>
<P>
The combined population of the Elsinore and Temecula valleys, from Corona to 
the San Diego County border, is about 115,000 and could balloon to 400,000 by 
the year 2020, according to Vick Knight Jr., a retired educator and consultant 
to the Lake Elsinore Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds scary as hell," Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
The population in the five communities from Lake Elsinore to Temecula has 
tripled to more than 55,000 since 1980 and it likely will triple again in the 
next 10 years, according to the Economic Community Development Agency for 
Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, Temecula's population has increased to 17,300 from 4,839, while 
Lake Elsinore's has grown to 13,769 from 5,982. A key reason for the increases 
was that Interstate 15 was finally completed all the way from Corona to San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Those moving to the Elsinore and Temecula valleys often endure monstrous 
commutes because the region is so isolated. It's about 90 miles southeast of 
Los Angeles and 60 miles northeast of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Wieland, a machinist who lives in Wildomar just south of Lake Elsinore, 
said it used to take him 2 1/2 hours to get home in the afternoon from his job 
in Santa Ana. Commuters say it often takes an hour to travel the short stretch 
from Anaheim to Corona during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
But Wieland now lives in a house that is nearly twice as big as the one that he 
used to have in Santa Ana, and it cost only about $6,000 more. He bought the 
home three years ago for $117,000. 
</P>
<P>
He is also fortunate because he found a job in Temecula, where an increasing 
number of companies are building plants, among them a Japanese automotive 
products firm and a computer company from El Segundo. Shopping centers abound. 
</P>
<P>
Wieland welcomes the development as progress that is making his life easier. "I 
wanted the growth to happen," he said. "When I first moved here, you had to 
drive all the way to Riverside if you wanted something." 
</P>
<P>
The change is everywhere: 
</P>
<P>
* Lake Elsinore now has a Sizzler restaurant and K mart department store, both 
of which are said to be doing land-office business. But the city's only 
synagogue, once the house of worship for a vibrant Orthodox Jewish population, 
closed recently because many have either moved away or died. 
</P>
<P>
* The Ortega Highway, the scenic Highway 74 that runs through Lake Elsinore, 
has become a heavily traveled and dangerous thoroughfare for commuters who work 
in southern Orange County. It's a 35-mile drive through the Cleveland National 
Forest on a winding, two-lane road never intended to handle rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic has increased tremendously," said Ken Daily, a California highway 
patrolman. "And whenever you have people late for work, you have a lot of 
unsafe passing." 
</P>
<P>
* Temecula has growth indigestion. Crime is up sharply, and, according to Mayor 
Ron Parks, the city needs another seven schools, estimated to cost $65 million, 
to alleviate overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic gridlock is common at rush hour as drivers endure long waits just to 
get across the freeway overpasses. "Traffic is the biggest problem that has 
resulted from the growth," said William A. Harker, general manager of the 
Temecula Town Assn., a promotion and preservation group. 
</P>
<P>
Temecula was incorporated as a city only last year, though its long history 
goes back to the early 1800s, when it was an overnight stop on the stage route 
from Missouri to San Francisco. (The stage depot still stands on a ranch 
outside town.) 
</P>
<P>
The incorporation combined the old town of Temecula with the booming new area 
known as Rancho California, a suburban-style planned community that has been 
built at a furious pace in recent years by the master developer, Bedford 
Properties. 
</P>
<P>
After a spirited debate, voters last year overwhelmingly approved Temecula as 
the name for the newly incorporated city. 
</P>
<P>
The seeds for Rancho California go back more than 25 years when Vail Co. sold a 
huge cattle ranch for $21 million to an investment partnership headed by Kaiser 
Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. The partnership, which later included Aetna Life 
&amp; Casualty, eventually bought nearly 100,000 acres for a planned 
development that did not begin in earnest until after the severe real estate 
recession of the early 1980s receded. 
</P>
<P>
"As inflation got under control and interest rates fell, all hell broke loose," 
said Harker, Temecula's unofficial local historian and a retired engineer for 
Hughes Aircraft. "It has been the rate of growth that has surprised everyone, 
not the growth itself." 
</P>
<P>
Bedford Properties, headed by real estate developer Peter Bedford, bought the 
development from Kaiser in 1986 for more than $400 million, and development has 
accelerated even further since then. 
</P>
<P>
Another 6,000 houses and 3,000 apartments are planned in the next two to three 
years, Harker said. Peter Bedford could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Temecula area is also a miniature Napa Valley. About a dozen wineries have 
been developed in the past two decades, with Callaway Vineyard the oldest and 
probably best known. It's owned by Hiram Walker &amp; Co., the Canadian liquor 
company. 
</P>
<P>
The wine region has become a popular tourist attraction. A San Francisco real 
estate development company, Pacific Union, is planning a $25-million resort, to 
be called the Wickets, that will have a 135-room hotel along with a winery, 
croquet court and 40 acres of vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
Temecula has also had its share of famous residents over the years. Former 
President Ronald Reagan had a ranch there, and actor Jack Klugman is such a 
familiar figure around town that the locals don't pay any attention to him 
anymore, Harker said. Klugman has a ranch a few miles outside town. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Elsinore, by contrast, is not as upscale as its neighbor to the south. It 
was labeled the "City of Hate" in a Los Angeles television documentary in the 
1950s because of alleged anti-Semitism in the area. Yet, it is an ethnically 
diverse town that had a black mayor in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the lake has been as much a curse as blessing. It has alternately 
flooded and dried up, playing havoc with the town and its residents. 
</P>
<P>
In 1948, thousands of carp mysteriously died in a nine-day period, followed by 
an infestation of gnats that appeared as the lake level dropped lower and 
lower. In 1951, the lake dried up for the first time in recorded history, but 
heavy rains filled it up to 11 feet in 1952. Then it dried up again in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
These flows and ebbs caused one local newspaper to remark in 1958: "Lake 
Elsinore is the only lake in the world that you can walk across without getting 
your feet wet and in the process be simultaneously engulfed by a sandstorm and 
bogged down in the mud." 
</P>
<P>
The latest calamity occurred in the early 1980s, when heavy floods wiped out 
hundreds of homes around the lake and caused property damage of more than $70 
million. Lately, though, the lake has shrunk because of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
The city has nearly finished a levy as part of a $42-million-plus effort to 
stabilize the lake at manageable levels. Business officials expect that the 
project will open up for development the huge flood plain at the south end of 
the lake.

MOTOR RACING DAYTONA 500 QUALIFYING; 
</P>
<P>
SCHRADER ON THE POLE IS GETTING TO BE A HABIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qualifying day for the Daytona 500 turned out cool, cloudy and windy Saturday, 
but that didn't make any difference to Ken Schrader, qualifier extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
He put a Chevrolet Lumina on the pole for next Sunday's $2-million race with a 
lap of 196.515 m.p.h. It was the third consecutive year that the former sprint 
car champion from Concord, N. C., had the pole position speed in one of Rick 
Hendrick's stable of Chevrolets. 
</P>
<P>
While other drivers complained wind buffeting their car in the turns and 
whitecaps were whipped up on the infield lake, Schrader calmly posted his time 
midway through the qualifying session, and then sat back and worried about 
anyone beating it. 
</P>
<P>
No one came close. 
</P>
<P>
Second fastest, and the only other driver to lock in his position for the 500, 
was three-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt, who is still looking for 
his first victory in the Daytona 500. Earnhardt, who ran 195.767 early in the 
day in another Lumina, was not challenged until Schrader came out. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the 42-car field will be determined by finishing positions in 
the Twin 125-mile qualifying races Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Schrader's speed was slightly slower than last year's 196.997 in a Chevy Monte 
Carlo SS. In 1988, he qualified at 193.823. 
</P>
<P>
The Daytona record is 210.364, set by Bill Elliott in a Ford in 1987, the year 
before carburetor restrictor plates were mandated to slow the cars. 
</P>
<P>
"We were slower than we'd hoped to run, maybe a couple of tenths, but it was 
the same for everyone," Schrader said. "The wind hurt, especially in (turn) 
four, but the track was slicker than we'd have liked. It hasn't rained since 
the 24-hour race (last weekend) and all those sports cars laid down a lot of 
rubber. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real problem getting the car set up right to get around the track as 
fast as I figured we had to go." 
</P>
<P>
Schrader joined the late Fireball Roberts and Elliott as the only drivers to 
win the pole for the 500 in three consecutive years. Roberts, a stock car 
racing pioneer, did it in 1961-62-63 and Elliott in 1985-86-87. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting my name alongside Roberts and Elliott is nice, because they're great 
names, but it wouldn't do near as much for me as it would be to see my name as 
a one-time winner of the Daytona 500. Especially this year." 
</P>
<P>
Schrader was referring to the $212,800 bonus for the first driver to win a 
Winston Cup race after winning the pole. For Saturday, Schrader collected 
$8,500. 
</P>
<P>
The Busch Clash, a 20-lap, 50-mile dash today that pays $50,000 to the winner, 
has one of the strangest lineups in stock car racing history. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Waltrip, the defending Daytona 500 champion, and Earnhardt, runner-up 
in last year's Winston Cup, are not in it. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Hensley, who will start on the pole, has never driven in a Winston Cup 
race on a superspeedway. Greg Sachs, who will start alongside Hensley, will 
drive a Hendrick Motorsports research and development car that has been used 
recently to film scenes in the Tom Cruise motion picture, "Days of Thunder." 
</P>
<P>
The Clash is for pole winners from the previous season, and neither Waltrip nor 
Earnhardt earned one. Neither did Sachs. He got in the 10-driver field as a 
wild card selection among drivers who posted the best second-day time during 
the 29-race season. 
</P>
<P>
Hensley, 44, drives an oil truck out of Horsepasture, Va., for a living and has 
raced sportsman cars for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
He qualified first in Earnhardt's car at Martinsville, Va., when Earnhardt was 
unable to get from Charlotte, N. C., to Martinsville because of Hurricane Hugo. 
When car owner Richard Childress learned that Earnhardt would be late, he 
called Hensley, who lives about seven miles from the track. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life, I'd dreamed about qualifying (for) a Winston Cup (race), 
especially at Martinsville, and when I got the chance I decided to make the 
most of it," Hensley said. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost didn't get the chance. Earnhardt walked into the pits just as I was 
qualifying. A few minutes earlier and I'd have missed the opportunity. One of 
the big thrills for me was having Dale shake my hand when I came in." 
</P>
<P>
Behind Hensley and Sachs will be the giants of NASCAR -- excluding Waltrip and 
Earnhardt. Row by row, it will be Schrader and Elliott, Geoff Bodine and Alan 
Kulwicki, Rusty Wallace and Morgan Shepherd and Davey Allison and Mark Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Also today will be the American Racing Club of America (ARCA) 200 for late 
model cars. 
</P>
<P>
Patty Moise, stock car racing's top-rated female driver, will start on the pole 
for the second year in a row. The Jacksonville, Fla., driver qualified her 
Buick V-8 at 194.536 m.p.h., nearly two miles faster than second-place Bob 
Keselowski, defending ARCA Permatex series champion from Rochester Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Richie Petty, a nephew of Richard and cousin of Kyle, qualified for his Daytona 
debut in the ARCA race, but late Saturday he was involved in a six-car crash 
during practice that knocked him out of today's race. Petty was not injured, 
but the family's Chevrolet, prepared by his father, Maurice, was said to be 
unrepairable. 
</P>
<P>
The chain-reaction accident was started when an Olds driven by Ben Hess broke 
loose at the front of a pack of cars and following drivers, including young 
Petty, could not avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing I could do," Petty said. "I was out there learning to draft 
behind Red Farmer and suddenly I saw Hess get sideways. Everyone threw their 
hands up, and the next thing I was in a big cloud of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I could make it through, and then it was like I hit a ton of bricks. 
I couldn't see a thing and I hit Slick Johnson in the back. We're out of the 
race, that's for sure."

<P>
Damon Bradshaw lost control of his Yamaha coming out of the final turn of the 
ninth lap and eventually lost to Jeff Stanton of Sherwood, Mich., Saturday 
night in the 250cc final of the Camel Supercross Series at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, 17, from Charlotte, N.C., said after the race that he believed he had 
broken his left ankle in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to a hospital for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
In the 125cc main event, Ty Davis of Hesperia took the initial lead and rode it 
15 laps to the finish for his first first-place finish in three supercrosses 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, fourth in Anaheim and second last week in Houston, leads the series with

<TEXT>
<P>
Questions, questions, questions. Everybody asks questions. What do I look like 
-- directory assistance? 
</P>
<P>
OK, let's make with the Ann Landers bit and get it over with: 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think of these stories that former baseball commissioner Bowie 
Kuhn is in hiding, on the lam from a $3.1-million loan debt? 
</P>
<P>
A: I always thought Bowie Kuhn was the kind of guy who seemed to be in hiding 
even when he wasn't in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How could Bowie Kuhn come up with $3.1 million in a hurry? 
</P>
<P>
A: Become a mediocre baseball pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you feel sorry for Steffi Graf, injuring her thumb the way she did while 
running away from photographers? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Cher's old boyfriend had the right idea. When you see a photographer 
coming near you, try to run him over with a Ferrari. Cheaper cars are OK, but 
they're not as fast. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is your opinion of George Mikan's bid to bring an NBA franchise to 
Anaheim? 
</P>
<P>
A: Fine. Make it the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Should Karl Malone feel insulted, not getting as many votes for the NBA 
All-Star game as A.C. Green? 
</P>
<P>
A: Karl Malone should worry a little more about the Utah Jazz and a little less 
about Karl Malone. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why do the Minnesota North Stars want to pick up their hockey team and move 
it to Northern California? 
</P>
<P>
A: So that after games, their cars will start. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What caused the ear problem that Coach Tom Webster of the Kings has been 
having? 
</P>
<P>
A: Hearing the news of the Bernie Nicholls trade. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In your mind, what is the worst part of baseball players being locked out of 
spring training camps? 
</P>
<P>
A: It gives Jose Canseco more free time to spend on the highways. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you think the Denver Broncos will be able to do anything right during 
Super Bowl XXV in Miami? 
</P>
<P>
A: Possibly, since the NFC champions will be playing that day in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are executives around CBS-TV calling Andy Rooney these days? 
</P>
<P>
A: Andy the Greek. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it really possible that Bill Shoemaker deliberately ran fourth in his 
final horse race? 
</P>
<P>
A: Could be. I think the poor man might have been trying to avoid having 
another photograph taken. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's the worst idea you've heard all year? 
</P>
<P>
A: The Patchy Groundfog farewell tour. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How are you fixed for fireplace kindling these days? 
</P>
<P>
A: Fine. Just got another swimsuit issue in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you think USC's Junior Seau was wise, applying for the NFL draft? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Now maybe he can afford to buy some better-looking shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How come the Charlotte Hornets fired their coach? 
</P>
<P>
A: They wanted to stay on the front page of the sports section, and stock-car 
season was almost here. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does Don King really want Mike Tyson to step into a ring with Hulk Hogan? 
</P>
<P>
A: For money, Don King would want Mike Tyson to step into a ring with Steffi 
Graf. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who would the Japanese people prefer to see Tyson fight? 
</P>
<P>
A: The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Which teams are currently the leading scorers in college basketball? 
</P>
<P>
A: 1. Oklahoma. 2. Nevada-Las Vegas. 3. Kimble &amp; Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What exactly did NBC-TV offer to Notre Dame for its football rights? 
</P>
<P>
A: Thursday nights, right after Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are ABC and ESPN still intending to take NBC to court over this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, but Lou Holtz has threatened to resign if they don't stop fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Have the Miami Hurricanes toughened up their college football schedule any? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Next year, they're adding Seton Hall and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you think Michigan will do without Bo Schembechler? 
</P>
<P>
A: I'd still like to know how come the basketball coach couldn't take part in 
the NCAA playoffs because he was taking another job, but it was OK for the 
football coach to take part in the Rose Bowl even though HE was taking another 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you think Illinois should get the death penalty? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Work with it, give it a good job in the machine shop, try to 
rehabilitate it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Were you surprised the U.S. soccer team lost to Colombia? 
</P>
<P>
A: I sure was. I didn't even know the studio had a team. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What's on CBS right after the NBA All-Star game? 
</P>
<P>
A: 60:00.00 Minutes.

IS THIS RITE OF SPRING NECESSARY?; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: OTHER PLAYERS MIGHT NOT NEED SIX WEEKS OF PREPARATION, BUT MOST 
PITCHERS APPARENTLY DO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
How best to describe and define spring training: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A special time of hype and hope, a signpost as traditional as the 
groundhog? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A reawakening and rebirth of optimism, erasing the often bitter memories of 
the previous season? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A proving ground for rookies and a survival test for certain veterans? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A montage of snapshots, from Jimmie Reese, at 84, hitting fungoes in Palm 
Springs to Ramon Martinez, 21, working on a curveball under the eye of Sandy 
Koufax in Vero Beach? 
</P>
<P>
It is all that and more, and now there is the likelihood that it will be shut 
down by baseball's owners in response to a negotiating impasse with the 
players. That raises questions that have been asked before but seem now to 
carry new relevance. 
</P>
<P>
Is a six-week camp necessary when most players maintain their condition over 
the winter? 
</P>
<P>
Can the 1990 season open April 2 as scheduled if the lockout ends in early 
March, three weeks after the previously scheduled Feb. 15 opening of camps? 
</P>
<P>
Is spring training merely a public relations vehicle in which the media happily 
goes along for the ride, or has the publicity value diminished now that 
baseball continues to make headlines most of the winter? 
</P>
<P>
The answers come in different forms from different people, but the consensus 
seems to be: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although position players can prepare in two or three weeks, a starting 
pitcher still needs five or six to be able to go seven innings in early April. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although the use of spring training as an advertising and sales vehicle has 
changed somewhat, the five-six weeks are beneficial in building team chemistry 
in an era in which free agency is consistently altering rosters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although players generally stay in better shape now, a greater number are 
playing longer and need the five-six weeks, and some always seem to be coming 
off surgery and need a full spring training as part of their rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bob Rodgers, Montreal Expo manager: "You could go to camp for two weeks 
and have a facsimile of Opening Day, but your starting pitchers would be ready 
to go only three innings at most, and the slower(-preparing) players would be 
(at a big disadvantage). They'd have to be sent out. Some guys simply need a 
month (to get ready)." 
</P>
<P>
Marcel Lachemann, pitching coach of the Angels, said that no matter how much 
throwing a pitcher does in the off-season, it takes four weeks to build to 
being able to pitch seven innings, and that's after two weeks of working on 
fundamentals -- such as covering first base -- and readjusting to live hitters 
in batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
"The minimum time is four weeks," Lachemann said. "If you don't have that 
you're looking at your starting pitchers going five innings or less and 
probably having to tear up your bullpen every night and risk (physical) damage 
to your club. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel that anything less than six weeks is simply getting by. I mean, 
if we didn't feel we needed it, we wouldn't be there. No one goes to have a 
picnic. It costs the club a lot of money. But for the starting pitchers, six 
weeks is optimum." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bert Blyleven, 38 last year when he won 17 games with the Angels: 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who live in Southern California and pitch for the Angels or 
Dodgers have an advantage in that we can throw three times a week all winter, 
but it's still not the same. You're looking at a catcher's glove instead of 
trying to make quality pitches to a hitter. It's not like a game situation. 
There's not the competitiveness and intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"And you can run all you want during the winter, but you're still getting your 
legs and body in shape during the first two weeks of spring training, 
readjusting mentally to fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
"Spring training may be a week to 10 days too long for the position players, 
but as a pitcher and older player, I feel I need that time. I like going to 
spring training in mid- February." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, then with the Cleveland Indians, was 30 in 1981 when the season was 
interrupted for 52 days by a player strike. He threw regularly during the 
strike, but clubs were given only a few days of formal preparations before play 
was resumed. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to do too much too soon, and tore a muscle in my elbow," he said. "It 
was diagnosed as a strain and I continued to pitch with it, but I eventually 
needed surgery." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven appeared in only 28 games in 1982 and '83. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel that the strike (and the limited time to come back from it) cost 
me two years of consistent pitching," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Drysdale, the Dodger Hall of Famer, went through a comparable experience in 
1966 when he and Koufax conducted a contract holdout. Neither pitcher joined 
the club until the final week of spring training. Drysdale, 23-12 the year 
before, struggled early and finished 13-16. "That proved to me that a pitcher 
needs six weeks of spring training and no less than five," he said. "Of course, 
we didn't have the guaranteed contracts they do today and weren't in a 12-month 
conditioning program. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we were always expected to go nine innings in our first 
start (of the season), and now that mentality has changed some, too. Now it's 
something of a rarity when a guy goes nine at any time." 
</P>
<P>
The groundwork, Drysdale said, should be laid in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd go to Vero Beach, expecting to have fun but knowing we'd work like 
mules," he said. "Of course, Joe Becker was the pitching coach then, and he 
trained mules during the off-season in Missouri. We'd cuss him out and he'd 
say, 'You can cuss me now, but you'll love me in August.' " 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed since 1966, and certainly since 1886, when Cap Anson took 14 
Chicago White Stockings to Hot Springs, Ark., to "boil out the alcoholic 
microbes," according to a reporter who accompanied the team. 
</P>
<P>
This, according to Dr. Harold Seymour in his book, "Baseball: The Early Years," 
was when some players returned from a winter of loafing and dissipation looking 
like overweight aldermen. 
</P>
<P>
That 1886 trip -- during which the White Stockings pledged to abstain from 
alcohol until the season was over -- is generally considered the first spring 
training, though the 1870 White Stockings are known to have trained briefly in 
New Orleans, and Boss Tweed took the New York Mutuels, a team composed of city 
street workers, to New Orleans in the late 1860s. 
</P>
<P>
Teams traveled by railroad then, and the growth of spring training generally 
paralleled the spread of the rails. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans and Hot Springs remained popular far into the new century. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "Babe," Robert Creamer wrote of Ruth: "Early in 1925 he left New 
York for Hot Springs for his traditional pre spring training trip. He was fat. 
In January, he weighed 256 pounds. In Hot Springs, he played a little golf, 
jogged a little, took hot steam baths. But he also drank and ran around town 
with women and stayed up all night and ate like a hog." 
</P>
<P>
In 1888, two years after Anson had taken the White Stockings to Hot Springs, 
the Washington Senators became the first team to train in Florida, living in 
shacks on the outskirts of Jacksonville. If the Senators had a curfew, they 
broke it regularly. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Mack, a young catcher with that team, later told reporters: "By the time 
we arrived in Jacksonville, four of the 14 players were reasonably sober. The 
rest were totally drunk. There was a fight every night, and the boys broke a 
lot of furniture. We played exhibitions during the day and drank most of the 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Now clubs respond to alcoholic microbes by putting the player in a 
substance-abuse program. And most players have fewer microbes and calories to 
burn off in February. 
</P>
<P>
"I go back to when I played in Brooklyn, and most guys then lived where they 
played," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. "The only place they could work out 
was indoors, which meant they'd have to start from scratch in spring training 
and then spend a week just getting rid of the blisters, shin splints and muscle 
soreness. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, most guys seem to live in warm-weather cities or have access to better 
gyms and equipment. They work out all winter and come to camp ready to play the 
exhibition games. They keep coming in better and better condition, but I still 
feel the pitchers need six weeks and the team does, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We're building up a spirit, a togetherness, a feeling we can finish first. 
We're working physically, mentally and fundamentally." 
</P>
<P>
This year, with Kirk Gibson and Kal Daniels coming off surgery, with a new 
right fielder-third baseman in Hubie Brooks and a new center fielder in Juan 
Samuel, spring training seemed to be particularly important to the Dodgers, but 
the only players expected in camp Feb. 16 are about 50 minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Vice President Fred Claire, looking back to a time when spring 
training was used to cultivate headlines and season-ticket sales, said that 
spring training is still an important public relations tool for the Dodgers, 
but that is secondary to what the team tries to accomplish on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"If the media looked at spring training and said they no longer saw the news 
value in it and no longer saw a reason to cover it, we wouldn't be thrilled, 
but we'd go ahead with the preparation of our team and program," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need those six weeks to look at the players we have in rehab and develop a 
composition. And no matter how sophisticated training has become, there's no 
shortcut for getting a pitcher's arm in shape." 
</P>
<P>
With expansion having diluted talent, there is seldom the competition for major 
league jobs that kept a pitcher named Lasorda returning to the Dodgers' 
triple-A farm club at Montreal each spring. And seldom does a prospect arrive 
unannounced anymore. 
</P>
<P>
In the years immediately after the Dodgers took over the Vero Beach Navy base 
in 1948, the barracks were filled to capacity. The organization had as many as 
28 farm clubs and 700 players. Practices went from sunup to sundown. Branch 
Rickey delivered nightly lectures in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember getting my first look at the meal line and wanting to go home," 
Lasorda said. "It stretched from the cafeteria to the street. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition then was tremendous, and there wasn't much chance for 
advancement. I don't know how many shortstops Pee Wee Reese put out of 
business, but it was tough cracking that lineup. We worked hard just to be one 
of the three extra players that the club could carry during the first month of 
the season." 
</P>
<P>
Now, most organizations have only five or six farm clubs, all of which may 
emerge from their comparative anonymity during this spring of the anticipated 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
The Major League Players Assn. has already cautioned its members against team 
workouts during the lockout because of insurance risks, and executive director 
Don Fehr said that he would recommend that the start of the season be delayed 
if the lockout goes beyond the first week of March because of the risk of 
injury to players rushing to get ready. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Raines, the Montreal center fielder, may laugh at that, and the suggestion 
that six weeks of spring training are mandatory. Raines did not rejoin the 
Expos until May 2 of 1987 because of free-agent restrictions. He was prohibited 
from going to camp with the team and worked out with his former high school 
baseball team and a women's aerobic class. 
</P>
<P>
In his first game, against the New York Mets, Raines hit a grand slam his first 
at-bat and went four for five. He hit .330 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Lasorda, "but Tim Raines doesn't have to pitch."

NEBRASKA'S KIRKSEY WINS ALL-AROUND AT UCLA MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the beginning of the meet it was clear that Patrick Kirksey of Nebraska 
could still be considered the top college gymnast in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The defending all-around NCAA champion was the best all-around gymnast again 
Saturday night when he led his team to victory in the UCLA Men's Gymnastic 
Invitational at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska, the top-ranked team in the country, scored 283.075 points to easily 
beat UCLA. The Bruins, however, provided the only intrigue of the night when 
they edged Minnesota by .55 in the final event to finish second with a score of 
279.2 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota finished at 278.8, followed by New Mexico at 273.075 and Arizona 
State at 271.5. Illinois, the defending NCAA champion, finished last at 269.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Next to the NCAA championship, this is our biggest meet of the year," said 
Kirksey, who is also the defending all-around champion of this meet. "There is 
so much competition in this meet that I can't worry about it or I would go 
crazy. I've got three people on my own team who are excellent and then at UCLA 
there's Chris Waller, (Chainey) Umphrey and Scott Keswick. Minnesota has John 
Roethlisberger. It's a great meet." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota stayed close to Nebraska for the first three rotations. But the 
Cornhuskers pulled three points ahead of the Gophers with a strong team 
performance in the floor exercise in their fourth event. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, trailing Minnesota by 1.3 points after the fourth rotation, pulled 
to .15 of the Gophers with the top team score of on the parallel bars. 
</P>
<P>
Falls by Waller and Keswick in the high bar, the Bruins' final event, appeared 
costly, but the Gophers scored low enough on the parallel bars to put UCLA 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"This is only our second meet of the year so I feel good about our 
performance," said Keswick, who won the parallel bar event with a 9.85. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was not ranked because it had not competed in two meets until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Umphrey, a member of the U.S. national gymnastics team, seemed to be the 
biggest crowd pleaser. His explosive performance on the rings, which he won 
with a score of 9.8, and on the high bar brought the most applause from the 
crowd of 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
The top score of the meet was by Licurgo Diaz-Sandi, when his near-perfect 
floor exercise brought the Arizona State gymnast a 9.9.

MISTER FRISKY KEEPS RECORD PERFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris McCarron was speaking for a lot of people when he yelled to Gary Stevens 
with about an eighth of a mile to run in the $106,075 San Vicente Breeders' Cup 
Stakes Saturday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess he's the real thing," McCarron shouted after Mister Frisky had surged 
past favored Tarascon in the seven-furlong San Vicente. 
</P>
<P>
The pride of Puerto Rico, 13 for 13 before leaving the island, proved he can 
compete on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
The first 2-year-old to be named Horse of the Year in Puerto Rico since Bold 
Forbes, Mister Frisky defeated Tarascon by a length in 1:22 3/5, and it was 
another eight lengths back to Top Cash. 
</P>
<P>
In front every step in almost all of his previous races, Mister Frisky, the 
Marsayas colt, was fourth after breaking a step slowly. He moved up to join 
Tarascon, the 13-10 choice, nearing the quarter pole, then took charge and 
provided Stevens with his fourth winner of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a helluva good horse," said trainer Laz Barrera, who didn't do badly 
after taking over Bold Forbes 14 years earlier. "This sucker can run. 
</P>
<P>
"When my friend in Puerto Rico (Enrique Ubarri) told me he's as good as Bold 
Forbes, I believed him. The day he left Puerto Rico, 2,000 people came to say 
goodby. That puts a lot of pressure on me. 
</P>
<P>
"When Bold Forbes came, he didn't win his first race for me. It's a great thing 
for me to bring this horse from Puerto Rico and win a stakes here. There's 
going to be a lot of dancing in the streets there when they find out that he 
won."

Mister Frisky, the 5-2 second choice of the 30,371 spectators, will be pointed 
toward the Santa Anita Derby. His next appearance is scheduled in the mile San 
Rafael Stakes on March 3. He won at a mile and a sixteenth in Puerto Rico and 
Stevens said distance won't be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll run all day," he said. "The farther, the better. He can gallop 
two miles, and you can breeze him and he'll still give you a strong last 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very excited about today. I was a little nervous. I never rode a horse 
with a record like this one, and his owners came all the way from Puerto Rico. 
I knew he was genuine after working him twice. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't break real square; he was off balance. But, by the third jump, he 
was right there. I'm happy with the way the race turned out because we got to 
see he could relax and be rated behind (another) horse. He actually liked it. 
He's definitely one of the better (3-year-olds) around. 
</P>
<P>
"I just nudged him at the five-sixteenths pole and he moved up alongside 
Tarascon. He really shied from the noise in the grandstand. That's why he 
lugged in through the stretch and, afterward, he didn't want to gallop back." 
</P>
<P>
Tarascon, making his first start for John Franks, who purchased him from 
Georgia Ridder earlier this week, had no excuses in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"He sure ran his race," McCarron said. "When I asked him to run, he felt like a 
jet. I couldn't believe the other horse was still outside me." 
</P>
<P>
The San Vicente disappointment was Farma Way, who turned in his second 
consecutive dull effort. The Hollywood Futurity runner-up was extremely washy 
going to the gate when finishing last in the Los Feliz on Jan. 10, and he 
looked like he had been hosed down again in the post parade Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's washing out every time," jockey Ray Sibille said of the Marfa colt, who 
was fourth, beaten almost 11 lengths. "When he leaves the paddock, he's a 
nervous wreck. He came out of the gate, but then showed no run at all." 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann and Present Value head the field for the $328,500 San Antonio 
Handicap, the major prep for the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap next month. 
</P>
<P>
Away since defeating stablemate Lively One in the Native Diver Handicap Dec. 23 
at Hollywood Park, Ruhlmann has a series of sharp works for Charlie Whittingham 
and he's shown a fondness for Santa Anita in the past. McCarron will ride 
again, but a mile and an eighth isn't really his preferred distance. 
</P>
<P>
Present Value, who will get a two-pound edge from Ruhlmann, the 122-pound 
highweight, was third as the 6-5 favorite in the San Pasqual Handicap two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
However, that was his first start since the Breeders' Cup Classic and he 
figures to improve with the race behind him. He returned to work six furlongs 
in 1:11 3/5 for Jerry Fanning. The 6-year-old son of Halo should also get his 
preferred trip today because he is more effective from off the pace, and in the 
San Pasqual he was on the lead most of the way. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the lineup includes Criminal Type, who won for the third 
consecutive time in the San Pasqual; Payant, who has performed horribly in two 
outings after being away for several months; Variety Road; Complicate; Stylish 
Winner and Hollywood Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay, who broke a collarbone in a harness mishap at Los Alamitos Jan. 
26, galloped Patchy Groundfog Saturday morning for Julio Canani and said he 
hopes to be back soon. "I didn't feel any soreness," said Pincay, who was 
injured while competing in an exhibition race for charity. "My legs just got a 
little tired. I'll get on two (this) morning. I hope to start riding again next 
Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
If Pincay does come back Saturday, he'll be able to ride Bayakoa in her 
anticipated battle with Gorgeous in the $300,000 Santa Margarita the next 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, who also won with Kennedy's Knockout, Phil's Illusion and Paisano 
Pete, is starting to pull away in the jockey's race. He has 46 victories, eight 
more than Chris McCarron and 18 better than third-place Alex Solis.. . . Eddie 
Delahoussaye and Martin Pedroza both had two wins. The former won the sixth 
with Turbo Trick and the finale with Vysotsky while Pedroza swept the daily 
double with Smilin' Smiley and Key To Ding. . . . Mister Frisky paid $7.60 to 
win and earned $47,325 for his owners, Solymar Stud.

THE GREGARIOUS AUTHOR IS BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT. HIS LATEST BOOK IS A JOINT 
VENTURE WITH 13 OF HIS STUDENTS, BUT HE'S REGAINING HIS RHYTHM AND HIS SOLO 
VOICE.

EUGENE, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We've got him cornered. 
</P>
<P>
Keeeeesssey! Ken Keeeeeeeeesssey! We want to talk to you. 
</P>
<P>
For three decades or so, we, The Mainstream Media, have swarmed around Ken 
Kesey like cultural moths, whenever the hallucinogen-inspired, macho author's 
strobe-light brain stuttered to life. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Wolfe squeezed the best journalistic juice from the trickster in "Electric 
Kool-Aid Acid Test." But that was back in 1968, when Kesey was still throwing 
flash powder on the flames of the so-called revolution by leading his band of 
Merry Pranksters on a psychedelic cross-country pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Kesey has given us the slip -- darting from one goofy project The 
Media doesn't understand to the next. 
</P>
<P>
But now we've got him, his back to the wall, in a vinyl booth at the Eugene 
Veteran's Club, a dimly lit bar where he entertains visiting heroes of the 
counter-culture: William S. Burroughs, Hunter S. Thompson, Gregory Corso. 
</P>
<P>
This evening, however, he is surrounded by his latest gang, a bunch of graduate 
students from the University of Oregon. In December, Kesey and this class of 
his released a book they cooked up together in pressurized bursts of group 
creativity. They called it "Caverns," and gave it the pseudonymous author O.U. 
Levon (spell that backwards). 
</P>
<P>
"Caverns" is an amusing lark, full of weird characters and goofy plot twists. 
It was a sufficiently intriguing project to make The Mainstream Media swarm 
around Kesey again. 
</P>
<P>
But no one is calling "Caverns" literature. 
</P>
<P>
As a New York Times Reviewer snipped, it lacks "a recognizable authorial style 
. . . a distinctive voice." 
</P>
<P>
And that's why we've arrived in the drizzly Willamette Valley, at the tail end 
of the latest Media migration, determined to follow Kesey wherever he leads -- 
as it happens, from a bookstore to bar to a Super Bowl party. 
</P>
<P>
What we want to know is this: What happened to Kesey's own voice, one of the 
most original, defiant, inspiring voices in American fiction? What happened to 
the booming voice of Randle P. McMurphy, the "bullgoose loony" who raged and 
joked against conformity, passivity and wimpiness in the 1962 classic "One Flew 
Over the Cuckoo's Nest?" 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the integrity-drenched voice of "Sometimes a Great Notion's" 
Hank Stamper, the lumberjack with "never give a inch! " emblazoned over his 
cradle? 
</P>
<P>
Keeeeeeesey! Ken Keeeeeeeeessey! You owe us an explanation! Why, with the world 
turning into everything you apparently dislike, why haven't you been writing? 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by his newly minted fellow authors in this perfectly dark and 
Oregonian bar, Kesey handles such questions with the gentle ease of a 
world-class wrestler (which he once was) swatting away a lunging toddler. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a point where people just want an artist to keep doing what he's been 
doing," he says in his soft growl. "Kandinsky (a pioneer Expressionist) had 
been a great landscape painter. Then he started doing these things that had 
nothing to do with landscape." 
</P>
<P>
The Establishment of his day rejected it, Kesey says. Just as they reject the 
extra-literary things he's been doing for 20 years: The carnival-like road 
shows, with jazz and jugglers and a guy who played a mean William Tell Overture 
on the harmonica; the quirky video projects, and, most recently, the concerts 
in which Kesey, decked out in top hat and tails and accompanied by the New York 
Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra, reads his children's story, "Little Tricker the 
Squirrel Meets Big Double the Bear." 
</P>
<P>
Even raising his family out on their 65-acre farm -- all of it is art, Kesey 
says. Just as the Merry Pranksters' long, strange trip in their wildly colored 
bus "Furthur" was "as good an art work as anything Warhol did." 
</P>
<P>
But The Media want to know: Isn't all this hamming around and hoo-ha just a 
dodge? Don't you owe America new characters who will speak in the undiluted 
Keseyan voice that rang out so clearly in the days before 1973's "Garage Sale," 
when you slipped into "like, far out" hippie-dip jive? 
</P>
<P>
"What are you giving me (trouble) about?" Kesey demands, a touch of weariness 
creeping into his voice. 
</P>
<P>
The once-great marathon star, Alberto Salazar, lives in Eugene, Kesey says. "He 
owns a restaurant not far from here. Why don't you go give him (trouble) for 
not running more marathons? You can only do so many marathons without running 
out of steam." 
</P>
<P>
Kesey takes a sip of his drink. "I haven't just been loafing," he says, pain 
and anger edging out the weariness. "I've been doing stuff. But the press, they 
don't see something until it's all tied up in a bundle." 
</P>
<P>
As Kesey talks, Alison, a dancer and the wife of co-author Jeff Forester, 
massages the ring-bedecked fingers of Lidia Yukman, another co-author, who met 
and fell in love with co-author Ken Zimmerman during the three-semester 
novel-writing class. 
</P>
<P>
Now Yukman's eyes blaze. "Novels are being published every day!" she snaps. "En 
masse. Who needs another novel?" 
</P>
<P>
Kesey was a fantastic teacher, she says. He was willing to share his knowledge 
and talent with 13 other writers. What could be more important than that? 
</P>
<P>
Kesey smiles at his friend's loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
"In this class, the work for me was not the novel or the movie that might get 
made," he says. "It was the class. That's the piece. That's the chunk. That's 
the consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
"But you want it wrapped up," he says. "You want it to look a certain way." 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in the course of the conversation, Kesey catches a glimpse of the 
television hanging over the bar by the racks of booze. 
</P>
<P>
"Look!" he hollers. 
</P>
<P>
The others glance up from the shadowy ambience of the bar and see themselves in 
beaming bright color on the television screen as they were, earlier that day, 
at the university bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
At the University of Oregon bookstore, 10 of "Caverns' " 13 co-authors are 
seated in a row, happily greeting each of the several hundred people of all 
ages and descriptions who have waited in line for up to two hours to have their 
copies of the book signed. 
</P>
<P>
Kesey sits at the head of the table, wearing a blue-and-gray tie-dyed T-shirt 
over a red long-sleeved T-shirt and red socks under black loafers. A plastic 
fish skeleton is pinned to his chest. 
</P>
<P>
There's an old photograph of Kesey on the wall of his home. He looks a lot like 
Paul Newman, who, as it happens, played Hank Stamper in the 1971 movie based on 
"Notion." 
</P>
<P>
Now Kesey, 55, concedes that he looks 10 years older than Newman, who just 
turned 65 (but looks 45). The curly hair that sprouts out from under a 
seemingly omnipresent hat is gray now. Webs of wrinkles fan out from his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
They are laugh lines. 
</P>
<P>
But Kesey has done some crying, too. When his son, Jed, died in an accident in 
1984, Kesey was devastated. His face still shows the impact of that wreck. 
</P>
<P>
The eyes, however, still spark with mischief. And when he is amused, as he 
often is, his barrel chest pumps out laughter in big, foghorn blasts. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the autograph party, with television reporters wagging 
microphones at Kesey, the author's mother shows up -- a petite, energetic woman 
with neatly coiffed hair and a suit that would fit right in at the Eugene 
Women's Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken was always gregarious," she says. "If he had to tie his shoes, he needed 
someone around to watch him." He was also a strong-willed kid, she says, but 
was "absolutely no problem as a boy. He never went out with the boys and got 
beered up. 
</P>
<P>
"Later I could have killed him," she adds, refusing to discuss the days of 
drug-fueled adventures that eventually landed her son in jail for six months. 
"You just hang in with them and tolerate them and hope they find the right 
trail." 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't my mom great?" Kesey asks later, as he cheerfully signs books and sips 
peppermint schnapps from a red aluminum flask sporting a Grateful Dead skull. 
"To her it's all part of a continuum." 
</P>
<P>
That continuum again. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in high school," he explains, "I did a really strong ventriloquist 
show with a dummy. That's not unlike writing. You've got a character. He sits 
on your knee. You put words in his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Kesey went from ventriloquism to a hypnotism act, which he performed at 
fraternity houses. "It wasn't a far jump from hypnotism into drugs and 
writing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I have grandkids and my brother has grandkids and all my friends have kids 
of 5 or 6. I'm beginning to get my magic tricks back out. To me, it's all the 
same stuff: The magic shows, the writing, the acid trips, the readings. It's 
what I've always been trying to do, the focus of my attention has always been 
magic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Read 'A Farewell to Arms,' " Kesey continues, "and you think, this is a great 
magic trick Hemingway pulled on us. It is. It's a very good artistic trick. But 
it's a trick." 
</P>
<P>
And now, Kesey says, he is trying to pull off the magic of a traditional novel 
again. He's not doing it for the Media who keep bugging him. Or for the culture 
that would seem to need a good jolt of "bullgoose looniness." He's doing it for 
himself. Sometime you have to decide, he said, "Are you the artist or the art? 
I want to be the artist again." 
</P>
<P>
Wander from the book signing for a moment, and look, there is Kesey's literary 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a Great Notion" is on the shelf. Look what The Media said about it 
when it came out in 1964: 
</P>
<P>
Playboy: "Raw American power." 
</P>
<P>
Time: "As big and brawling as the country it describes." 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland Plain Dealer: "It gasps, pants, whoops and shrieks. You have to 
stand back in awe of Kesey's ability. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
As for "Cuckoo's Nest," the store even has Cliffs Notes on it for Pete's sake! 
</P>
<P>
Remember McMurphy, the character who arrives in the psychiatric hospital and 
immediately begins to incite the repressed, passive patients to rebel against 
the authorities -- psychiatric and societal -- that have cowed them? 
</P>
<P>
Here's what the Cliffs Notes say: "He is an ace con man, but at the same time 
curiously honest -- for he never pretends to be anything other than what he is 
. . . (But) as the patients become stronger, McMurphy becomes weaker. . . and 
he is forced to be what the others think he is. They can recognize themselves 
only through him, and he must continue to give them something to emulate." 
</P>
<P>
Could the same be said of Kesey? Made a hero by the Mainstream Media, did he 
lose his ability to simply sit back and crank out powerful prose? 
</P>
<P>
Or, more tragically, did he somehow lobotomize his talent with the enthusiasm 
for drugs that propelled him through the '60s? Would his fictional voice have 
been stronger if he hadn't kept using and didn't still use drugs? 
</P>
<P>
"Could be," Kesey says. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably so," he sighs. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I could go back and trade in certain experiences I've had for brain 
cells presumably burned up, it would be a tough decision." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "I want to do the best work I can do," he says. So he has been 
writing long and hard at a cottage he owns on the Oregon coast and in the study 
of his farmhouse outside Eugene. The new novel is tentatively called "Sea 
Changes." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting my rhythm. Getting one word hooked to another, building tension, 
excitement -- (but) you don't just pick it up and do it right away." 
</P>
<P>
Kesey gets reflective. 
</P>
<P>
"I reach into the mist and try to find the valve to turn this (literary voice) 
on . . . " he says. But "you can stand there and crack the whip at the Muses 
all you want, and they may not obey you. If they did, if discipline were all it 
took, Republicans would all be great writers." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd still like to get two more Super Bowl rings," he says later, in one of his 
frequent comparisons of writing to sports. "But I'm also willing to admit it 
may not be within my capacity to do it anymore. You know when you're clicking 
and when you're not clicking. With this new book, if I am, I am. If not, not. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have to feed the cows every day." 
</P>
<P>
At the Kesey family farm, 15 minutes on winding roads from Eugene, folks slouch 
on a sagging couch, in beanbag chairs, on stairs -- friends from the old days, 
neighbors, "Caverns" co-authors, Prankster Ken Babbs' son, the bass player from 
the "Tricker Squirrel" gig among others. 
</P>
<P>
It's Super Bowl Sunday and they couldn't have found a finer, friendlier place 
to gather than this big red barn that Kesey himself converted. 
</P>
<P>
Faye Kesey, Ken's high school sweetheart and wife of more than 30 years, 
putters in the kitchen, cooking up a big spread. 
</P>
<P>
Someone has brought marijuana. Kesey rolls a joint in a cardboard box top. A 
2-year-old, someone's daughter, tosses around a fuzzy red football. Joe, an old 
black dog, balances on a huge ball of twine. 
</P>
<P>
In one direction, a television blazes. In the other, a huge picture window 
features a sweeping green landscape of sopping fields and dribbling trees with 
an intermittent rainbow thrown in for color. 
</P>
<P>
Color is a major presence here: The floors in the big living 
room-kitchen-dining room are a red, blue, green and Day-Glo orange patchwork, 
with walls and stairs to match. 
</P>
<P>
At half time, as everyone dines on salmon and salads, Kesey brings out a new 
book he has been talking about, a collection of stunningly stark, grisly 
photographs of war victims, shot by James Nachtewey in Beirut, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Haiti and Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Deeds of War," the book features an introduction written by Robert 
Stone, one of several illustrious authors -- Larry McMurtry, Wendell Berry, 
Tillie Olsen -- who were students with Kesey in Stanford University's writing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
An inscription by Stone in the book reads: "For Ken and Faye. With love always, 
these hard pictures are about endurance and perception which may be the things 
that get us by in the end." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Kesey refers back to the book, using it as an illustration of why the U. 
S. government still needs nonconformists to stand up to it, whether over 
official policy in El Salvador, or a drug war that penalizes people who smoke 
pot. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a theme I always deliver in my work, and I do it well," Kesey says. 
"There's a snake in the grass. Sometimes it's the government. Sometimes it's 
evil spirits. Sometimes it's some part of yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's an evil force and it attacks you (where) you are most vulnerable . 
. . It's the same force that causes fathers to shake their kids to death. 
Husbands to beat their wives." 
</P>
<P>
It's the force that art opposes, Kesey thinks. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what 'Cuckoo's Nest' is about. That's what 'Great Notion' is about: The 
small trying to stand up against a great force," he says. "But that force is 
getting stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Kesey continues. One evening soon after his son died, he was watching 
television, he says. "And I saw a father coming down from the hills of Lebanon 
with a dark bundle in his arms." 
</P>
<P>
The television reporters had just interviewed a U. S. Navy captain, who proudly 
said that, while he was unsure what his ship's big guns were hitting when they 
fired into the hills, he knew they were wreaking havoc. 
</P>
<P>
"Then this man came down holding this dark bundle -- his son," Kesey says. "I 
didn't know if he was a Shiite or Christian. All I knew was that he was a 
father, and he was hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Kesey's eyes moisten and his tough wrestler's face goes slack. "All I know is 
that I'm on the side of the people who hurt, and against the people doing the 
hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Kesey sips his schnapps. The gears shift. But that's later. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the day, the gracious party host is in fine form, kicked back in a 
battered chair in a corner that his presence makes the center of the room. 
</P>
<P>
When the local cable station's line blows out, smack in the middle of the Super 
Bowl, Kesey switches on a videotape of Carnaval in Rio. Bare-breasted women in 
feathered headdresses dance wildly as John Madden gives a play-by-play of the 
49ers' Super Bowl rout. 
</P>
<P>
And in the midst of it all Kesey abruptly stands up. 
</P>
<P>
"Gotta feed the cows," he says. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, he's bouncing along on the seat of a blue tractor, towing 
a trailer laden with hay bales and a bunch of helpers: a couple of friends from 
the old days, a "Caverns" co-author and his girlfriend, several dogs and a 
reporter from The Mainstream Media. 
</P>
<P>
As the tractor growls out over the green fields, a herd of cows falls in 
behind. When Kesey gives the word, his crew starts tossing hay off the side. 
</P>
<P>
Joe, the old black dog, jumps down and gives the cows some trouble, snapping at 
their hoofs, then hops back onto a bale behind Kesey with his nose in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Proud of yourself, aren't you?" Kesey shouts, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Cheeks flushed from the cold, he wheels the tractor around by a boneyard of old 
cars and equipment, then heads back toward the barn. 
</P>
<P>
The tractor's wheels slurp in the mud. Cows low. An orchestra of wind chimes 
sings from the trees. 
</P>
<P>
And out in one of the green fields, the infamous old "Furthur" bus rests, 
settling into the mud, psychedelic paint faded and crinkling, lookout turret 
cracked, rain dripping on the rotting carcasses of old mattresses inside. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Media seems to notice it. 
</P>
<P>
That night, when everyone has gone, Kesey works on his new novel until dawn.

In an item in last week's Outtakes, Richard Gere was quoted as saying that he 
would like to get a film project going about the life of Buddha and portray the 
religious leader in that movie. 
</P>
<P>
Gere, through his publicist, has denied speaking with the author of the item 
and says that he would never consider casting himself in such a role, which he 
feels should be played by an Asian. Gere, in fact, was never interviewed.

2ND GROUP FORMED TO FIGHT ACID CURB ON TORRANCE BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A second campaign committee has been created to oppose a March 6 ballot measure 
aimed at banning the use of hydrofluoric acid at Mobil Oil Corp.'s Torrance 
refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The group, "Citizens for a Safe Torrance Environment -- No on Measure A," filed 
papers with the Torrance city clerk Friday. Spokesmen for the group said their 
committee will be independent of the one formed by Mobil at the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to have local South Bay people who are directly affected by this 
talking to their neighbors about it," said committee Treasurer Bob Bush, 
president of Contract and Business Consultants Inc., a company that helps 
developers work with cities on construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
The group plans to raise about $10,000 to send out a mailer and coordinate a 
door-to-door campaign against Measure A, a March 6 ballot measure sponsored by 
Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker. The measure, which seeks to limit storage 
of hydrofluoric acid at any place in the city to no more than 250 gallons, 
would effectively force Mobil to stop using the chemical at its Torrance 
refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will solicit support from the business community, organized labor 
and Torrance residents, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agent Tony Kriss, a 1988 City Council candidate, and Warren 
Bennett, a longtime resident who works as an energy coordinator for the county, 
will be co-chairmen of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Walker sponsored the initiative after a series of accidents at the refinery 
raised concerns about Mobil's safety procedures. A November, 1987, explosion 
and fire involving hydrofluoric acid focused attention on the lethal chemical. 
Mobil officials say they since have tightened safety at the refinery and that 
Measure A is not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 2, Mobil announced plans to spend several hundred thousand dollars to 
fight the initiative through its Mobil Refinery Safety Committee -- No on 
Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
"Mobil has a right to say what it wants to. We'll try to do what we can on a 
grass-roots level," Bush said of the new committee. "If we raise $10,000, we'll 
be doing pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said Jack Foley, executive director of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic 
Workers Union, asked him to help create the committee. The union represents 
most of Mobil's workers. 
</P>
<P>
Foley said he had spoken with Bush, but the union also plans to create its own 
committee against Measure A.

CENTINELA SCHOOL BOARD MAY SEEK RACE BIAS PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pressured by complaints that the district has been slow to respond to a spate 
of race-related incidents, the Centinela Valley Union High School District 
Board of Trustees this week will consider asking a state, federal or civil 
rights organization to investigate racial tensions in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Pam Sturgeon called for an investigation last month, saying that 
continuing complaints from parents and representatives of the NAACP about 
race-related problems in the district have kept the board from focusing on 
education. 
</P>
<P>
"I am asking for an investigation by the Civil Rights (Commission), the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and the state of 
California to put these allegations to rest," Sturgeon said at the Jan. 22 
board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Supt. McKinley Nash said that in response to 
Sturgeon's request he will give the board a list of state, federal and civil 
rights authorities that he believes are qualified to investigate racial 
problems. He said he will ask the board members to choose one or more agencies 
they want to handle the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Among the agencies that the superintendent will propose at the board's Tuesday 
meeting are the state office of the NAACP, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 
the state Department of Education and the state Department of Fair Employment 
and Housing, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
The race-related allegations, which began to surface several weeks before last 
November's school board elections, include a racial slur by a teachers union 
leader and the confiscation at Hawthorne High School of a grisly mannequin 
designed to look like a dead black man. 
</P>
<P>
Although the board is scheduled to discuss the issue further this week, Jose De 
Sosa, president of the state conference of the NAACP, said his organization 
started investigating racial tensions in the district the day after Sturgeon 
made the request at the January board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"She gave us the message (and) that gave us authorization to start the 
investigation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said NAACP volunteers have begun interviewing teachers, administrators, 
parents and students to discuss such incidents as the confiscation in April, 
1989, of the black mannequin and two recent incidents in which black students 
were allegedly physically abused by white staff members. 
</P>
<P>
De Sosa said the NAACP will submit its findings to the state Department of 
Education or the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Reuben Burton, director of the state Department of 
Education's Intergroup Relations Office, said he has not talked with Centinela 
officials, but said his agency would -- if the district requested -- conduct an 
assessment of the racial tension in the district and then suggest ways to 
address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Burton said his agency has worked on similar problems in other school 
districts, including the Clovis Unified School District near Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Burton said racial tensions were high because members of the Ku 
Klux Klan and other white supremacy groups were recruiting students on campus. 
He said his agency drafted a report to the school board suggesting, among other 
things, that district teachers be required to attend special classes on race 
relations and that the board form an advisory committee to oversee race-related 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Montez, regional director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, said 
that because the regional office must respond to complaints in 17 Western 
states, his agency probably would investigate Centinela only if complaints were 
filed against the district by a parent or a group of parents. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to move that way because we don't have the resources and people to 
look at everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Annabella Hwa, district administrator for the state Department of Fair 
Employment and Housing, said her agency would not investigate unless formal 
charges were filed by a district employee against the district. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Lomax, the school district's attorney, said she supports an 
investigation because it would indicate that the district is moving to address 
the problem. She said bringing in an agency from outside the district would 
give the investigation more credibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a cancer that cannot be addressed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lomax said the previous school board asked her last year to investigate alleged 
incidents of racial insensitivity toward black administrators by members of the 
teaching staff at Hawthorne and Leuzinger high schools. She said her 
investigation -- which she recently submitted to the newly elected board -- 
concluded that a handful of teachers have harassed minority administrators by 
anonymously sending them a number of racially insensitive notes and cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
The racial problems, she said, stem from dramatic ethnic changes in the 
district. Since 1979, the percentage of Latinos and blacks in the district has 
risen significantly. To accommodate the change, Nash, a black who became 
superintendent in the 1983-84 school year, has hired several minority 
administrators, including Hawthorne Principal Ken Crowe, who is black, and 
Leuzinger Principal Sonja Davis, who is of mixed race. 
</P>
<P>
When Nash became superintendent, four of the district's 19 top-level 
administrative posts were held by minorities. Of the district's 20 top-level 
posts today, nine are held by minorities -- six blacks, two Latinos and one 
Asian-American. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1989, teacher's union President Nancy Nuesseler referred to Nash 
in a meeting of Leuzinger and Hawthorne high school teachers as a "Stepin 
Fetchit" for state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
Nuesseler says she meant no racial slight. She later apologized for the remark. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, Hawthorne Principal Crowe confiscated a mannequin owned by Michael 
Gold, a film teacher who is white. Crowe says the mannequin, used in the movie 
"Coma" to portray a dead black man, is racially offensive and should not have 
been brought on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Gold's attorney, Timothy Dallinger, says his client has kept the dummy on 
campus for the past 10 years and used it to demonstrate the power of special 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
As for the recent incidents involving two black students, Lomax declined to 
provide details until the board completes a review of the matter.

FILLING A PRESSING NEED OF HOME WINE-MAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
SAN PEDRO: IMMIGRANTS WHO BROUGHT TRADITIONAL SKILLS WITH THEM COUNT ON TONY 
MARABELLA TO PROVIDE THE GRAPE JUICE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO PRODUCE THEIR HOMEMADE 
VINTAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a little-noticed nook in downtown San Pedro, next door to the A-1 Meat Co. 
and across the street from a senior citizens center, Tony Marabella spends each 
fall doing what he has done at harvest time for more than half a century: 
crushing and pressing the fruit of the vine. 
</P>
<P>
Ferdinando DiBernardo is one of Marabella's steady customers. The 92-year-old 
retired fishermen, who has been making wine in his garage for as long as he can 
remember, buys 50 gallons of grape juice from Marabella every year. 
</P>
<P>
This annual exchange, which the two men have repeated for at least 40 years, is 
more than a simple business transaction. It helps keep a dying tradition alive. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Old Country, yes, they drink a little bit," DiBernardo acknowledges 
after uncorking a bottle of last year's burgundy and pouring a sip into a small 
juice glass. It is potent stuff -- more than twice the alcohol content of 
store-bought wine, by the estimation of DiBernardo's son, Fred. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a big family," the old fisherman declares. "Sometimes I got 30, 35 
people at my house for dinner. I put wine on the table. I enjoy! But," he 
insists with a shake of his forefinger, "I've never been drunk in my life." 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro was built on the backs of men like DiBernardo, immigrants from Italy 
and Yugoslavia who came here because the fishing was good and the balmy weather 
reminded them of home. And they brought their wine-making talents with them; 
longtime residents say that 50 or 60 years ago, there was so much wine being 
made in San Pedro that you could smell it in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
And although the custom has dwindled over the years, evidence of it remains. 
</P>
<P>
Many homes in the seaside community, including DiBernardo's, were built with 
cellars -- an unusual feature in Southern California -- expressly for making 
wine. There is an older section of town called Vinegar Hill, so named, 
according to a local historian, because residents were in the habit of throwing 
their leftover wine sediment into the gulch below, where it created a terrible 
stink. And there is Marabella's business, the Marabella Vineyard Co., founded 
in 1932 by an uncle of Marabella's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Marabella had a handful of competitors. But today he is the only 
grape and grape juice supplier left in San Pedro. It is a position he retains 
with a sense of pride and duty. 
</P>
<P>
"The old-timers," he says, "they get used to homemade. They drink store-bought, 
they get sick." 
</P>
<P>
Customer Paul Marinkovich, 77, agrees that homemade wine is best. Store-bought 
wine, he says, "is lacking something. I like my own wine. I know what's in it." 
</P>
<P>
These old-timers are the mainstay of Marabella's business, says John Daume of 
The Home Winemaking Shop in Woodland Hills, who believes he is the only other 
grape supplier in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done that for a zillion years," says Daume, who caters to a younger 
clientele. "He's into the Old World approach to wine-making where we're into a 
more up-to-date approach. Tony, he's making nice wine like they did 50 years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, while Daume runs wine-making clinics where his customers can have their 
Chardonnays and Zinfandels analyzed, the 65-year-old Marabella dispenses 
over-the-counter advice from his barn-like building on 8th Street, just on the 
edge of Vinegar Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The place, cool and dark as the inside of a wine barrel, hasn't changed much 
over the years. It is chock-full of oak presses and redwood fermenting vats, 
many of which Marabella says have been around since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
A 1966 black-and-white photo of Marabella, pressing grapes, has been taped to 
the wall of his cubbyhole office since it was taken. The whole scene is 
straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting, complete with a sign above the 
entryway that says: "Grapes and Juice Sold. Cash. No Credit." 
</P>
<P>
The grape supply business is seasonal. In September, October and November, when 
the fruit is ripe, Marabella and his wife work seven days a week, 15 hours a 
day, crushing and pressing the grapes they grow on their 200-acre vineyard in 
Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
Marabella sells about 300 tons of grapes and juice each season, 200 of it to 
individual customers and 100 to wineries. The juice goes for $2.50 a gallon, 
the grapes for $400 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
"I could probably make more money renting this building out than working," 
Marabella says, and given San Pedro's booming real estate market, he may be 
correct. "But I enjoy it. A man's got to have a place away from home." 
</P>
<P>
During the off-season, Marabella farms his land and opens for business on 
Fridays and Saturdays, mostly to answer questions from customers and to operate 
a small store. 
</P>
<P>
There, he sells wine- and beer-making supplies, as well as wine bottled under 
his family name, including a "Dago Red," which Marabella said goes over well 
with folks who "remember it from the old days." One recent Friday morning, a 
woman called to order two cases of it. 
</P>
<P>
That same day, customer Maitrano Francesco dropped by to pick up some corks and 
to pay Marabella for the ton of grapes he purchased back in October. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, he buys the same amount. And every year, he pays the bill a few 
months late. 
</P>
<P>
Marabella says he doesn't worry about the money: "This town is a small town. 
I'm not afraid. They pay whenever they want to." 
</P>
<P>
Francesco, who emigrated from the Italian fishing port of Gaeta to San Pedro 18 
years ago, says he is fermenting 150 gallons of wine this year in the cellar of 
his house on 18th Street. "I no drink every bit," he says in broken English, 
explaining he shares the wine with friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
And though 150 gallons may seem like a lot of wine, Marabella says it goes 
quickly; some immigrant families consume half a gallon a day. To them, wine is 
a food item, an essential component of any meal. To those who grew up in the 
European tradition, wine is as much a part of the dinner table setting as a 
fork and knife. 
</P>
<P>
No one seems to know how much wine is fermented each year in the garages and 
cellars of San Pedro. But Marabella says the tradition is clearly dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
At 65, he says he has no plans to retire. But he also says his three sons have 
no interest in taking over the business, and that once he quits, that will 
probably be the end of it. He predicts that by that time, there will be little 
need for someone like him. 
</P>
<P>
Those who still make their own wine -- and those who quit years ago -- say 
Marabella is probably correct. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to crush a ton of grapes every year," recalls Tony Perkov, whose 
family has been in the restaurant business in San Pedro for 45 years. 
"Everybody in the neighborhood made wine. Every household. Now, there's a few 
families and I don't even know who they are." 
</P>
<P>
Says Andrew Bonacich, president of the Yugoslav-American Club of San Pedro: "I 
remember when I was a kid I used to help my dad make it, but among the 
Yugoslavs, that's almost a lost art." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Marinkovich agrees. He has been making wine for 60 years; he learned the 
trade from his parents, who owned a vineyard in Yugoslavia. A retired 
restaurateur and one-time fisherman, he says he still makes 50 gallons a year, 
even though his eyesight is failing him. But, he says, he is one of a few. 
</P>
<P>
"Not very many people that I know make wine anymore," he says. "The old people 
don't drink wine any more, not too much anyway. And the young ones, I don't 
think they are interested in making the wines. If they drink wine, they buy 
it."

GAY GROUP'S CAMPUS ACCESS REQUEST SPARKS LMU DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: STUDENT GROUP'S QUEST FOR RECOGNITION HAS TOUCHED OFF CAMPUSWIDE 
SOUL-SEARCHING ABOUT LOYOLA MARYMOUNT'S ROLE AS A CATHOLIC INSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They began meeting last spring, half a dozen gay students from Loyola Marymount 
University, gathering in an off-campus apartment away from the school's serene 
setting on a bluff overlooking the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
As students at a Catholic university, they often felt isolated and fearful of 
allowing others to know about their homosexuality. They sought each other out, 
as group President James Munselle puts it, "just to have a base where we could 
talk to other gay students." 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Alliance of Gays and Lesbians, which has grown to include about 
a dozen members, is seeking the right to meet on the Jesuit-run campus. And 
that quest has sparked wide-ranging debate among the university's nearly 4,000 
undergraduates. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the group argue that the issue is one of human rights and freedom 
of assembly, while opponents cite the church's view that homosexual acts are 
sinful. 
</P>
<P>
Alliance members argue that they should have the same access to campus 
facilities as any other group. Without official recognition, the group cannot 
meet on campus, advertise in the campus newsletter or receive funding from the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what happens a lot at Loyola is that because gay people can't or don't 
always feel comfortable on campus, a lot of the time the only arena they see as 
an option is the gay bars in West Hollywood," Munselle said. "To be forced to 
go to that arena because it's the only place you feel comfortable is a 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
One 19-year-old club member, who asked not to be named, said the meetings have 
changed his life: "We talked about religion, about family -- everything about 
the experience of being gay. . . . Last year I was lost and I felt away from 
God. Now that I'm speaking out, I feel like a whole other person, like I'm 
closer to God." 
</P>
<P>
The alliance has drafted a constitution, enlisted English department chairman 
Mel Bertolozzi as faculty sponsor and submitted an application to the Student 
Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee approved the application by a 9-2 vote in December and forwarded 
it to Father James N. Loughran, the university president. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the faculty senate passed a resolution by a 9-8 secret ballot urging 
university recognition. On Feb. 1, the student senate voted 12 to 4 in favor of 
a resolution urging Loughran to grant the group recognition. Although the 
president of the Associated Students vetoed the resolution on procedural 
grounds last week, it may be reintroduced in revised form this week. 
</P>
<P>
The only vote that really matters, however, belongs to Loughran. 
</P>
<P>
Munselle said the president told him in a Jan. 19 meeting that he could not 
approve the club, but alliance members hope Loughran ultimately will decide in 
their favor. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Gaulene, the university's director of public relations, said last week 
that Loughran "feels it is premature to comment" on the issue. "It is a major 
and serious decision," Gaulene said, "and one he plans to make very shortly." 
</P>
<P>
Whether he will -- or should -- grant recognition to a homosexual students' 
group has been the subject of a campuswide debate that goes to the heart of the 
university's role as a Catholic institution. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which monitors 
adherence to church doctrine for the Vatican, sent Roman Catholic bishops a 
letter that called homosexuality "an objective disorder" and urged the bishops 
not to yield to "enormous pressure" to condone pro-homosexual views or 
behavior. The church urges abstinence rather than engaging in homosexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
Brother Jeffrey Seeger, a German professor and assistant registrar, said 
although there are church documents "which allow for homosexuality as a natural 
variant of human sexuality," any sexual act outside of marriage is viewed as 
sinful. "You help the sinner while condemning the act," he said. Seeger added 
that the group's constitution does not transgress church teachings and he 
therefore found it "difficult to find any grounds not to allow it." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the university's 16-member student senate released the results of a 
poll sent to 2,000 students. The poll asked whether the university should 
approve the club and outlined arguments for and against approval. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 269 students who responded, 59% were against the proposed club, 35% 
in favor and 6% undecided, said Travis Lawmaster, a student senator who 
supervised the polling. 
</P>
<P>
Alliance members discounted the poll's methodology, saying the arguments relied 
on unsubstantiated statistics and focused on the church's stance on the 
homosexual act rather than on the issue of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, alliance members and students from the university's Peace Studies 
group collected signatures on a petition asking for student support of the 
club's application. They estimate they have gathered more than 200 signatures, 
which they plan to submit to Loughran this week. 
</P>
<P>
Munselle -- who has retained attorney Gloria Allred to represent the group -- 
believes there may be as many as 400 gay and lesbian students among the 
school's undergraduates. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think that's a significant number of people for the university to say 
we don't want to affirm you as a human being because of your (sexual) 
orientation," said Munselle, 25, who is not a Catholic. "I think the fact that 
there are only about 12 active members of this group indicates the problems 
these students are having about coming out on campus or speaking about gay 
issues on campus." 
</P>
<P>
Opinions are widely diverse among faculty members and students as to whether 
Loughran should recognize the group. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter published in the campus newspaper, history professor Susan Rabe 
argued that "what the Gay and Lesbian Alliance is asking of the university, and 
of each of us, is that we confront homophobia and stand for human dignity. By 
the very fact that we are a Catholic university, we have a particular 
responsibility to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Father Robert Caro, an English professor and member of the faculty senate, said 
many students and professors want to provide some sort of campus support for 
homosexuals, whether the club is approved or not. "I think everybody wants to 
find a solution that is sensitive and compassionate for all our students," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But in random interviews on campus last week, some students expressed 
misgivings about the group. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want that kind of stuff, go to a state school," said senior Caryn 
Herlihy, 21. "This is a Jesuit, Catholic school, so students should come in 
with the knowledge of what it's founded on. To get in here and try to change it 
is definitely wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Said Daren Kalish, 18: "The argument I've heard is (the university) doesn't 
have a heterosexual group, so why have a homosexual group?" 
</P>
<P>
Junior Dave Holden said that more education about homosexuality is needed, but 
he added: "If it's a matter of Catholic teachings, I don't see how they can 
have (a club) on campus. But in principle alone I don't see anything wrong with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Another student, who did not want to be named, said: "I really don't like the 
fact that there's a gay and lesbian group, but if they keep it to themselves, I 
don't mind." 
</P>
<P>
Lawmaster, one of the four student senators who voted against the resolution, 
said he is opposed to the club for religious reasons. When the issue was 
discussed at an emotional student senate forum, Lawmaster quoted from the Bible 
in arguing against approving the club. 
</P>
<P>
"My argument was since one of the goals was to uphold the Christian and 
Catholic traditions, if we allow this club we would be condoning 
homosexuality," Lawmaster said. 
</P>
<P>
During the forum before the student senate vote, Lawmaster said, some students 
became tearful and a few admitted their homosexuality for the first time in 
public. Lawmaster said he was moved but did not change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went into the meeting I knew I wouldn't be swayed because I was 
following God's law," he said. "I had to follow what I felt was right." 
</P>
<P>
A fundamental issue among students, Rabe said in an interview, is "confusion 
about whether the church is against homosexuals per se." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the real fear on the part of a lot of people is that what this group 
will do is advocate behavior the church does not condone," said Rabe, a 
Catholic. But, she said, supporters argue that the group's opponents are 
"reading in a motive that is not justified on the basis of the group's 
constitution, nor by the students themselves, who are a fine group of 
students." 
</P>
<P>
According to its constitution, the group's purpose is to support gays and 
lesbians on campus and to promote sensitivity to the homosexual community, to 
educate the community about the history of gays and lesbians, and to support 
human rights. Membership would be open to all LMU students and faculty and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"Recognition of a club does not mean endorsement of its position," Rabe said. 
"We have all kinds of groups on campus that take positions of which the 
Catholic church might not approve. . . . The broad consensus of the Student 
Affairs Committee was that we are demanding of this group, for no apparent 
reason, criteria that we do not demand of any other group." 
</P>
<P>
Some students say the university set a precedent when it approved a similar 
group at Loyola Law School 15 years ago. That group, the Lesbian and Gay Law 
Union, was recognized during the administration of former Loyola Marymount 
President Donald P. Merrifield, who approved the group on the basis that it 
advocated human rights but did not promote a gay life style. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Gurwitz, a member of the student senate who sponsored the resolution to 
support the proposed undergraduate club, said the two groups have nearly 
identical goals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really an insult to the students to hold the undergraduates to a 
different test," said Gurwitz, who is Jewish. "In my view, Father Loughran can 
either approve this club or revoke the recognition that's previously been 
granted to the club at Loyola Law School." 
</P>
<P>
Another element in the LMU debate is the eight-year legal battle for 
recognition by gay students' groups at Georgetown University in Washington. 
After a ruling by the Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals, the Jesuit university 
agreed under that city's Human Rights Act to provide funding and meeting space 
to gay groups. 
</P>
<P>
However, under First Amendment rights protecting religious freedom, the 
university was not obligated to officially recognize gay groups. Gary Krull, a 
spokesman for Georgetown University, said under a settlement outlined by the 
court, Georgetown's gay rights groups must print a disclaimer on all their 
literature stating that they are not recognized or endorsed by the university. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Loughran is likely to choose a similar course is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
Munselle said he is hoping to meet with Loughran again before a final decision 
is made. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping with all the manifest support . . . that if it doesn't encourage 
Father Loughran to approve the application, that at least it would speed up the 
process of releasing an approval or a rejection, so that we know where we 
stand," Munselle said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the university's decision, one gay Catholic student said he will 
remain steadfast in his beliefs. "Religion is in no way relevant (to) what I 
am. God has a place for me. It takes a long time for things to change in the 
Catholic church. I'm a Catholic and I'll always be one. There's a place for me 
in the Catholic church."

YES, THERE IS LIFE AFTER THE BURGES FOR PALOS VERDES GIRLS; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: HEIDI AND HEATHER BURGE WERE TALL AND TALENTED. NOW THEY'RE 
GONE. A DISASTER FOR THE SEA KINGS? A 47-GAME LEAGUE WIN STREAK SAYS NO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The temptation for a basketball coach who is losing a couple of talented 
6-foot-5 players to graduation might be to grab onto an ankle or two and hold 
on for dear life. 
</P>
<P>
But for Palos Verdes High School Coach Wendell Yoshida, the transition to 
post-Heidi and Heather Burge, the team's standout players for three years, has 
been a pleasant one. 
</P>
<P>
For opponents, it's been a shock. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers believed that the loss of the Burge twins, two of the most 
highly recruited players in the country as seniors last year, would leave the 
Sea Kings' program defenseless. It didn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings have a 23-4 overall record and are ranked No. 2 in the 
sportswriters CIF-Southern Section 3-AA poll. Palos Verdes went undefeated in 
Bay League play, 13-0, captured its fourth straight league championship and 
extended its league winning streak to 47 games. 
</P>
<P>
"People are surprised now," Yoshida said of the Sea Kings' continued success. 
"It has made believers. Palos Verdes is a legit program. We're not an 
up-and-coming program anymore. This year has proven we're not a fluke." 
</P>
<P>
The team believes that the talent was always there, with or without the twins. 
It just got overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Without Heidi or Heather to depend on, Palos Verdes had something to prove. The 
Sea Kings will get their chance when the CIF playoffs begin this week. 
</P>
<P>
"All the stories and headlines that were written (predicting we'd fail) gave us 
extra drive," said senior guard Lisa Humphreys. "I think we wanted to prove 
everyone wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida said the Burges' departure has motivated the team to do better than 
last year's team, which was expected to bring home a state championship but was 
eliminated in the 4-A semifinals by Katella, 56-55. 
</P>
<P>
That game left behind more than disappointment. Some critics said Yoshida 
hadn't kept the team focused on each game and had been looking ahead to the 
state final. 
</P>
<P>
"We remembered what happened last year (against Katella)," senior point guard 
Susan Wilhite said. "Maybe we thought too far ahead last year." 
</P>
<P>
When the Sea Kings fell short last year, Yoshida asked himself the same 
question the critics did: How could a team with two outstandingly talented 
players fail? He even considered quitting. 
</P>
<P>
But over the spring and summer, Palos Verdes teams continued to win, sometimes 
beating top-ranked teams such as Inglewood Morningside. Yoshida knew he'd still 
have a good lineup this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing going into this year was, number one, I didn't know the 
team's personality, and number two, I'd almost forgotten how or what the team 
would be like without (Heidi and Heather) in there," Yoshida said. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview last week at the University of Virginia, Heidi Burge 
said: "I expected them to do this well. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed to me the big reason everyone was saying they'd lose this year was 
based on losing two players who scored 24 and 22 points (Heidi's and Heather's 
averages per game last year). That's over half of your scoring. When you lose 
it, either you have to develop diversity or get stronger players." 
</P>
<P>
Diversity was the key, and Palos Verdes even may be a better team this year 
because its success has depended on team effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Palos Verdes got stereotyped last year," Wilhite said. "It was the twins' 
team. (The rest of the team) got mentioned, but it was always the twins did 
this or they did that. We knew there was more to the team than the twins. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt they are excellent, but even without them, the program's strong at 
Palos Verdes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Sea Kings' success no longer depends on simply getting the ball inside. 
And those air-ball shots that last year ended up looking like great passes to 
Heidi or Heather are just bad misses this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We need all five players this year," said senior forward Mary Maloney. "We 
don't depend on any one person. And we're looking to our first CIF playoff 
games rather than to the state finals." 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings are balanced between perimeter shooting among three starting 
players -- Humphreys, Wilhite and Maloney -- and the post play of sophomore 
center Monique Morehouse and senior center Kristen Jaconi. 
</P>
<P>
Morehouse missed nine league games with pneumonia last year, when she weighed 
only 130 pounds. This year she's put 30 pounds on her 6-foot-3 frame and has 
averaged 12.1 points and 11.7 rebounds a game. Jaconi averages 6.5 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Humphreys leads the team in scoring with 15 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.7 
assists a game, and Wilhite averages 10.1 points, 5.6 rebounds and 3.4 assists. 
</P>
<P>
At first it was hard to get away from the concept of a two-star team -- 
especially for Wilhite, who had played with the Burges for three years. No 
clear leader stepped forward, and there was pressure to measure up to a high 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
But, paradoxically, it was the unexpected loss to Katella last year that 
pointed the way. "When Katella beat us, they beat us as a team," Humphreys 
said. "We realized that was what it would take to win this year." 
</P>
<P>
And that team attitude may be the difference between unfulfilled dreams and a 
state championship for the Sea Kings.

TORO ASSISTANT COACH IS AHEAD OF THE GAME; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BART YAMACHIKA, 23, HAS BEEN COACHING AT CAL STATE 
DOMINGUEZ HILLS FOR FIVE YEARS. HIS FUTURE, PLAYERS AND PEERS SAY, IS 
UNLIMITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scenes were getting ugly a couple of weeks ago as the Cal State Dominguez 
Hills men's basketball team wallowed in its season-long doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
After a 1-4 start in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn., the Toros had 
dropped to 5-13 overall, on a pace to become the first team in the school's 
history to lose 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't count us out yet," assistant coach Bart Yamachika stoically told a 
reporter after a crushing four-point loss to 11th-ranked Cal State Bakersfield. 
"Don't count us out." 
</P>
<P>
Three straight victories later, the Toros went into this weekend's games tied 
for third place, playing their best ball of the year and becoming the talk of 
the CCAA. Now a playoff spot appears likely. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Yamachika's optimism in the face of what appeared to be 
insurmountable odds wasn't surprising to those who know him. His keen mind is 
like a sixth sense, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so bright, he can see pitfalls before they happen," said Anne Schwab, one 
of Yamachika's former teachers at Carson High School. 
</P>
<P>
Toro head Coach Dave Yanai agreed: "He's a sharp kid. A bright young man." 
</P>
<P>
Very young, by coaching standards, Yamachika is considered one of the South 
Bay's up-and-coming basketball minds, a shoo-in for a head coaching job of his 
own. Yamachika is in his fifth season as an assistant to Yanai, having started 
as a volunteer team manager in his freshman year. He was top assistant by the 
time he could legally enter a bar. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart is a hard-working, dedicated kid," said Carson High basketball Coach 
Richard Masson, who coached Yamachika and later hired him as a "C" level coach 
when he was only 18. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very, very reliable," Masson continued. "He gets things done without you 
having to tell him to do it twice." 
</P>
<P>
"He is a quick study," said Yanai. "He learns by observation and experience." 
</P>
<P>
Yamachika credits his mental sharpness to his love for mathematics, his college 
major. He compares solving math equations with solving problems on the 
basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a new problem out there," he said. "To get to that answer is 
kind of neat." 
</P>
<P>
What surprises most people, however, is Yamachika's ability to act years older 
than he is. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a young kid, but he has his own identity," said Masson. "Bart has always 
been able to take charge of kids that were just his age." 
</P>
<P>
When he wasn't yet 19, Yamachika entered the Dominguez Hills basketball program 
by boldly asking Yanai if he needed an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai remembered Yamachika as a teen-ager, a scrappy little kid who had 
attended five of his summer basketball clinics at Dominguez Hills. The two 
discovered they had a lot in common. 
</P>
<P>
"We go back a long way," Yanai said. "He was right on campus, so I let him be a 
student assistant. . . . It's now obvious he will be a head coach someday." 
</P>
<P>
Toro Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, then an assistant administrator, was 
impressed by Yamachika's savvy. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a real student of the game," Guerrero said. "He gathered extensive 
knowledge. Dave (Yanai) relied on him quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Like Yanai, Yamachika is of Japanese descent, a rarity among college coaches. 
Yanai is the only active college head coach of Japanese ancestry in the United 
States and one of only a handful ever to coach on the college level. 
</P>
<P>
Masson, an assistant to Yanai at Fremont High School in the early 1970s, sees 
similarities between Yanai and Yamachika. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was younger, Dave was a little more flamboyant than Bart is now. But 
coaching-wise, philosophy-wise, they are the same." 
</P>
<P>
The two share the belief that education comes first, basketball second. 
Initially, Yamachika's greatest asset at Dominguez Hills was his ability to 
tutor players in their studies while pursuing his own college degree. 
</P>
<P>
Said Guerrero: "He spent lots of hours with the players. On weekends he would 
be in here working with them. That was not in his job description, and he was 
going to school too." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the players were four or five years older than Yamachika. Said Yanai: 
"In the early years, there were some players who kidded him. But after a while 
they forgot he was so young." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Yamachika stepped up to the No. 1 assistant's job -- full-time 
work for part-time pay. He was still two or three years younger than the 
seniors on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Said former point guard Derrick Clark, now a rookie assistant coach under 
Yanai: "We would tease him from time to time about his being younger than us. 
But you have to understand, Bart has had a great big role in this program, and 
we all respected that." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, 24, called Yamachika "a role model for me. I'm trying to watch and learn 
from him." 
</P>
<P>
Masson is not surprised by how well Yamachika has handled age differences. 
</P>
<P>
"The youth factor. . . . It amazes me with Bart. Any young assistant coach that 
I have had has had trouble with the discipline aspect of coaching. It's amazing 
that Bart has no problem with that." 
</P>
<P>
Yamachika, the youngest member of his family, including cousins, explains: "I 
was in an environment with older people. To tell you the truth, many times I am 
more comfortable with people much older than me than with people my own age." 
</P>
<P>
Yamachika disagreed with others' assessment of his maturity: "I don't know if I 
am that mature. I have a lot of faults." 
</P>
<P>
Making the basketball team at Carson High his senior year, Yamachika said, was 
his "greatest sports moment." 
</P>
<P>
It was also the only moment of a short-lived high school career. 
</P>
<P>
A respected youth baseball player when he grew up in Carson, Yamachika still 
waited until his senior year to go out for an athletic team. 
</P>
<P>
Then he chose basketball. Baseball, he said, "wasn't fast enough for me." 
</P>
<P>
Masson tried to discourage him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not the most talented player, skill-wise. To tell you the truth, I 
didn't think he would even make the team." 
</P>
<P>
But Yamachika stuck. He gutted out the punishing runs that Masson and other 
coaches use to weed out "wannabes" who lack the determination to play hard in 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember (Masson) running us and telling us if we didn't like it, 'There is 
the door. You can quit.' " 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, the experience paid dividends for both men. 
</P>
<P>
Said Yamachika: "When you do something like that, you find out about yourself, 
what kind of person you are. You can cry and whine, or you can play hard. I 
learned a lot about myself that year." 
</P>
<P>
By his own admission, Yamachika was "the 15th man on a 14-man team." He did not 
see much playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Masson said, Yamachika "surpassed all of my expectations. He worked his 
butt off." 
</P>
<P>
The experience persuaded Yamachika that he should go into coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the positive things you can do in coaching. Success doesn't always have 
to be with superstars." 
</P>
<P>
He learned discipline, too. 
</P>
<P>
"If a guy was better than me, he was better than me. He beat me. But he didn't 
beat me because of a breakdown on my part." 
</P>
<P>
It is a view Yamachika carries into other phases of life. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart will be an outstanding coach," said Guerrero. You can't be disillusioned 
by his size or his lack of experience. He'll get the job done. He relates well 
to people, and he is very respected here." 
</P>
<P>
The bungalow door swung open, but the diminutive Yamachika was lost in a swirl 
of students passing between classes at Wilmington Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
The math whiz returned to the classroom recently, not to tutor but to teach 
full time. Recent state legislation allows school districts to hire people who 
do not hold teaching credentials in designated emergency subjects, such as 
math, where teachers are in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Yamachika has to take a minimum of six college units each 
school year toward obtaining his credential. 
</P>
<P>
His first assignment at Wilmington, in a bungalow at the back of the school, 
could be a scene out of the late television show "Welcome Back Kotter." 
</P>
<P>
"Yo, Yamachika." A Latino youth hailed the new teacher in his sixth period 
pre-algebra class, a bouncy, racially mixed group that would test the patience 
of most adults. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching mathematics -- an important subject, yet one many students perceive as 
boring -- is a challenge that Yamachika has met with fervor. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think every new teacher can succeed as well as he has. He's doing a 
very good job," said Anne Schwab, now an assistant principal at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Yamachika went into the teaching job cold. His only prior experience was on the 
gymnasium floor. So it was not surprising that, after the initial weeks, 
Yamachika adapted a teaching pattern that he learned from Yanai. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to remember when I was a kid. I was kind of squirrelly in class. So I 
give these guys a little freedom to move around. Kind of like basketball. You 
teach them how to do something, but you have to give them a chance to make 
decisions on the floor as to how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
It took several weeks for him to realize his shortcomings in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I was too tough on them. Then I saw that only seven of 28 students were 
turning in homework. I loosened up a little bit. Grades went up, and now 75% of 
students are doing their homework regularly." 
</P>
<P>
Schwab called Yamachika "a native teacher." 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever method he is using, it works," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The mathematics position provides extra income to Yamachika, solving a problem 
for Cal State Dominguez Hills. The university, short on funds, could not offer 
Clark, its rookie assistant, coaching pay, although he had agreed to remain 
with the program while completing his degree. 
</P>
<P>
When he took the math job, Yamachika solved Clark's problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart was still the No. 1 assistant coach here," Guerrero said, and he could 
have kept the pay that went with the job. "But he forfeited the official title, 
so the pay went to Derrick Clark." 
</P>
<P>
Brian (Buff) Johnson looks more like a linebacker than a basketball player. For 
the past two seasons he has mostly spread his 245 pounds on the Toro bench, 
playing sparingly since he transferred to Dominguez Hills after two failed 
attempts at playing for small universities in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
At Dominguez Hills the 6-foot-4 forward is known as Yamachika's project. 
Johnson is an adept three-point shooter but never figured to gain more than a 
spot role. Then, two weeks ago, an illness to the team's leading scorer, Robert 
Barksdale, forced Johnson into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
To Yamachika's delight, Johnson has played a crucial role in the Toros' 
turnaround, gaining confidence in each game. 
</P>
<P>
The knock on Johnson, by his own admission, was that he could not always keep 
his head in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of zone out, forget to concentrate," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the year, Yanai assigned Yamachika to shepherd Johnson. 
When the big forward is on the floor, Yamachika shouts instructions at him. He 
also speaks to Johnson before practice and after games, reminding him of his 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Yamachika's tactic bore fruit in back-to-back games with Chapman College last 
week. On defense, Johnson helped hold the Panthers' leading scorers under their 
seasonal averages. And when he got free on offense, he made enough long-range 
jumpers to keep the Toros in command. 
</P>
<P>
"He keeps my mind on the game," Johnson said. "You can't tell the guy is 23 
years old. He is so in control of what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, also 23, was quick to put Yamachika's role at Dominguez Hills in 
perspective. The assistant coach knows when to be firm, he said, but can also 
joke around like one of the guys. 
</P>
<P>
"He's ahead of his time," Johnson said. "And I don't think the guy even shaves 
yet."

GIVING A FRESH SPIN TO HISTORY'S LESSONS; 
</P>
<P>
BILLY JOEL'S 'WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE' IS POPULAR -- AND PERHAPS IT WILL LEAD 
LISTENERS TO REDISCOVER SOME FAR MORE WORTHY SONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM

<TEXT>
<P>
The philosopher George Santayana once issued a warning to people in a position 
to shape history: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe somebody should issue a new warning to pop songwriters who take on 
historical subjects: Those who cannot put the past into some sort of 
perspective are condemned to regurgitate annoying lists of facts. 
</P>
<P>
That's the problem with Billy Joel's recent No. 1, "We Didn't Start the Fire." 
Damning the torpedoes (of critics such as yours truly) and rushing full speed 
ahead, Joel packed 40 years' worth of rhyming names and events into his song, 
starting with Harry Truman and ending with "rock and roller cola wars." In his 
staccato rush, Joel couldn't pause for a line or two to explain what any of 
those names and events might have meant, or how they might have affected the 
people who lived through them. 
</P>
<P>
Still, at a time when educational horror stories abound about high school 
students who don't know Mussolini from minestrone, any focus on history is 
welcome -- and Joel's hit seems to be serving a need. Reacting to feedback from 
teachers who used the song in their classrooms, educational publisher 
Scholastic Inc. has sent schools across the country cassettes of the song, 
along with suggestions for incorporating it into their lessons. While verses 
such as "Pope Paul, Malcolm X, British politician sex/J.F.K. blown away, what 
else do I have to say?" strike me as unutterably banal, who's to argue if they 
wind up serving as starting points for compositions or class discussions that 
go into greater depth? 
</P>
<P>
However. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If a ridiculous song like "We Didn't Start The Fire" is doing some good in 
classrooms, what might be made of some of the first-rate historical rock songs 
that have come down over the years? 
</P>
<P>
Songwriters such as Ray Davies of the Kinks and Robbie Robertson of the Band 
have given us songs and albums that not only deal in facts but engage our 
emotions. Once students learn that history isn't the stuff of disconnected 
factoids, but of sadness, anger, pride and suspense, the door to learning can 
be flung wide open. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some songs that teachers, students, history buffs and plain old music 
fans might find worthwhile. (The list takes into account songs about pre-1960s 
history. For students of more recent events -- Vietnam, the U.S. civil rights 
crusade and racial unrest, South African apartheid -- rock and pop have offered 
a running commentary of songs too numerous to mention by such great writers as 
Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder and Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
(As for Billy Joel, songs like "Allentown," "Goodnight Saigon" and the recent 
"Leningrad" show that, when he pauses long enough to tell a story, he is 
capable of writing a decent song from historical material.) 
</P>
<P>
"Acadian Driftwood." This song from the Band's 1975 album, "Northern Lights -- 
Southern Cross," tells the story of the Acadians, the French-speaking 
inhabitants of Canada's maritime provinces. Uprooted from their homes in the 
mid-1700s when the British seized Canada from the French, the Acadians trekked 
south to the nearest French-controlled territory, Louisiana, where they became 
known as the Cajuns. That's the historical gist of it. But Robertson's story, 
sung from the viewpoint of a single Acadian refugee, goes beyond mere facts to 
explore what it's like to be one of history's victims. This eloquent, 
fiddle-accented song is full of sadness and longing for a lost homeland. 
Listening to "Acadian Driftwood" once more, I thought of how history does 
repeat itself: The Vietnamese war refugees who have settled in Orange County 
are the Acadian driftwood of today. 
</P>
<P>
"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down." Another one from the Band, this time 
about the fall of the Confederacy. The song captures the potent mixture of 
poverty, pride, anguish and bitterness among white Southerners that doomed the 
Reconstruction to failure. Again, the key to the song is Robertson's ability to 
center a historical tale on a character who, more than just narrating facts, 
brings home the emotional experience of living through great events. 
</P>
<P>
"Past, Present And Future." This 1974 album by British folk-rocker Al Stewart 
is full of first-rate songs drawn from 20th-Century history. Included is 
probably the only rock song that will ever be written about President Warren G. 
Harding (Stewart even tells you what the 'G' stands for), whose pathetic 
incompetence in office is evoked in a sprightly, mocking tune. "The Last Day of 
June, 1934" illustrates how blissfully unaware we usually are of the history 
going on around us, shaping our lives. Verses about carefree lovers enjoying 
themselves on a balmy June day in England and Germany are set against the story 
of Hitler, on that same day, consolidating his power with a bloody purge among 
his own Nazi followers, setting Europe -- and those happy, unknowning lovers -- 
on a course for disaster. In the album's epic masterpiece, "Roads To Moscow," 
Stewart -- like the Band -- tells of earthshaking events through individual 
eyes, giving an account of the crucial Eastern Front warfare during World War 
II from the viewpoint of a Soviet foot soldier. The song, like Soviet history, 
is tragic: Nazism is crushed, only to give renewed free reign to the terror and 
paranoia of Stalinism. 
</P>
<P>
"Arthur (or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)." With "Arthur," a 1969 
album often regarded as the first rock opera (it was originally the soundtrack 
for a BBC TV drama), the Kinks' Davies shows the sweep of British history from 
World War I to the socialist experiments of the 1950s and 1960s, and what it 
all means to one average English family. Like life itself, this great album is 
alternately funny and sorrowful. Just as the Band couldn't play a song during 
its heyday without reflecting deeply on the American soul, the Kinks' music in 
the middle to late '60s captured a specially British essence of character. Both 
bands realized that you couldn't delve into the nature of a nation's soul and 
character without closely considering its history. 
</P>
<P>
"Sympathy for the Devil." People who haven't really listened to this famous 
Rolling Stones song tend to assume that it is a worshipful ode to Satan. 
They're ignoring the bitterly ironic historic commentary embedded in the 
lyrics. Mick Jagger does play the role of Satan in "Sympathy for the Devil" -- 
a Satan who cackles and gloats over how readily mankind has done the devil's 
bidding throughout the 20th Century. This Satan points to the horrors of the 
Russian Revolution, the Second World War and the Kennedy assassinations, 
implying that only creatures in close sympathy with the devil could have 
written such a grievous history for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)." The Zombies, one of the most underrated 
bands of the British '60s rock invasion, ended their career in 1968 with a 
great album, "Odessey &amp; Oracle" (available on a Rhino Records re-release). 
Included is "Butcher's Tale." The song's angry, unflinching account of World 
War I trench warfare is given by a shellshocked British soldier infuriated by a 
preacher's militaristic fight-for-God-and-country sermon. The song's harrowing 
details, which presage the welcome war-really-is-bloody-hell realism of Oliver 
Stone's Vietnam War films, make it one of the definitive anti-war statements in 
rock history: 
</P>
<P>
"And I have seen a friend of mine hang on the wire like some rag toy 
</P>
<P>
 And in the heat the flies come down and cover up the boy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the preacher he could see those flies, wouldn't preach for the sound of 
guns." 
</P>
<P>
 "Butcher's Tale" makes us see the flies. 
</P>
<P>
"Cortez the Killer." The tricky thing about history is that it's so easy to 
twist. In this song about the Spanish conquistadores' destruction of Aztec 
civilization, Neil Young does more than a little twisting to make the Aztecs 
look like innocent, spiritually lofty victims of greedy, morally bankrupt 
Europeans. "Hate was just a legend/War was never known," Young sings, extolling 
the Aztecs. In fact, they were ruthless conquerors themselves, who enslaved 
their neighbors and spilled vats of their war prisoners' blood in human 
sacrifice (Young's lyric tries to put a happier face on that little 
circumstance by implying that the sacrificial victims gave their lives 
voluntarily and altruistically for religious reasons). Cortez and his gang were 
greedy and morally bankrupt, of course, but Young draws the conflict in stark 
moral terms that defy historic fact. "Cortez the Killer," from the album 
"Zuma," is worth hearing because it is a terrific rocker, and also because 
Young's distortions illustrate how tempting -- and how wrong -- it can be to 
paint history in simple black and white.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As dawn broke on a sparkling Saturday, Huntington Beach was eerily empty. For 
as far as the eye could see, there were no walkers, no surfers, no couples 
playing in the waves -- only occasional piles of plastic bags stuffed with 
oil-soaked cloths and soiled sand. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, small groups of people ventured toward the surf to check out the 
damage wrought by Wednesday's oil spill. But after a few steps on the sand, a 
disembodied voice would boom from a lifeguard tower: "Attention on the beach. 
The beach is now closed. Please leave the beach immediately." 
</P>
<P>
"I come here every day," said Debbie Goodwin, a nearby resident who was shooed 
off the beach. "This is where I walk as I set my goals for the day. But look at 
it now! This is so sad." 
</P>
<P>
Right after the spill, Huntington Beach officials ordered people to stay out of 
the ocean. Friday night, officials announced the sand tainted by oily foam 
would be off limits as well. 
</P>
<P>
But by midday, the curiosity seekers outnumbered the lifeguards. The crowd was 
solemn as it stood squinting into the sun at yellow-suited cleanup workers 
laboring in the shadow of the wounded tanker. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad thing for all the wildlife and all the fish, seals and dolphins," 
said 60-year-old Paul Petzold, a visitor from Illinois who surveyed the scene 
from his beach chair. "They can't look out for themselves so we have to look 
out for them." 
</P>
<P>
Up and down the Orange County coastline, the oil spill was the talk of the day. 
For Greenpeace members picketing at Pacific Coast Highway to nature lovers 
inspecting fragile wetlands to hordes of cleanup volunteers, the disaster 
created a sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Verlench of Newport Beach arrived at the Newport Pier at 8:30 a.m. to set 
up a headquarters for volunteers. By 12:30 p.m., she had 500 inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been nice," said Verlench, who was surrounded by a mountain of cardboard 
boxes for carrying off oil-soaked birds. "We've had a lot of high school 
teen-agers. They've been going door to door getting supplies . . . boxes, rags 
and gloves." 
</P>
<P>
At the border of Newport and Huntington beaches, the smell of petroleum was 
strong. Cleanup crews waded into the water swinging bright red, green and blue 
pompons. The oil sticks to the plastic strands when they are swished in the 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
"Primitive," said Norm Kent of Santa Ana as he observed the effort. "It's 
really primitive." 
</P>
<P>
It was a day of frustration for many would-be volunteers who were turned away. 
Both beach and bird cleanup workers must undergo training before being 
sanctioned to pitch in. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Walcott, a registered nurse who lives in Huntington Beach, came to 
volunteer at a lifeguard center set up to treat birds that washed ashore. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't let the volunteers do anything because they're afraid of 
liability," Walcott said. "They have pages and pages of volunteers. . . . They 
say that they have more volunteers than birds. I think a volunteer would put 
more heart in it because we'd be here because we want to. It's beautiful here. 
It was beautiful."

ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.

<P>
Landfall -- Few seemed to notice as the first small globules of oil hit the 
sands near Newport Pier on Thursday night, but by later in the evening, 
onlookers had clustered on the beach in small groups, staring glumly out at the 
waves. The strand was dark, lit only periodically by the glare of television 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
Kristy Peters and Greg Reece had driven down from Lake Arrowhead to see the 
spill and to volunteer their help, but so far there was no organized cleanup. 
Curious, both had scooped up some of the oil-fouled sand with their hands and 
were now trying, rather unsuccessfully, to get it off. "It's like the oil off 
the bottom of your car," Reece observed. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Anderson, an environmental engineer from Belmont Shores, had arrived at 
the beach at 6:30 p.m. with a bag of rags to clean up any oil-soaked birds that 
might come ashore. At first, he had watched as small balls of tar, pushed along 
by the surf, left thin lines of black along the beach. But a couple of hours 
later, the water had turned a foaming, uniform brown. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, contracted cleanup crews in blue jumpsuits had arrived to soak up the 
incoming muck with large absorbent pads. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be here because I want to see what's done, and I want to see the 
effects myself," Anderson said. "I wish I was an expert, but then I guess I'd 
be more depressed."

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: TRASH YOUR NEIGHBORS WILL ENVY

<TEXT>
<P>
Old habits are hard to break. Starting new ones can be even tougher, 
particularly when others keep telling us it's a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling is one of those new habits people are talking about. But I'll wager 
that some of you, the minute you spotted the word recycling, decided to turn 
this page. 
</P>
<P>
If that's you, wait! Like it or not, sorting your trash for recyclables is fast 
becoming a way of life. Six county cities offer some form of curbside 
collection for glass bottles and jars, aluminum and tin cans, plastic soda and 
milk containers, newspapers and even cardboard. Statewide, about 140 
municipalities have curbside programs, triple the number of just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Most cities have adopted recycling strategies because it's the law. By 1992, 
all California cities are required to establish recycling programs to reduce by 
half the amount of solid waste being dumped at landfills before the end of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
So get ready to separate your garbage, because recycling is coming to your 
neighborhood -- soon. And when it does, you'd best get in the habit, or run the 
risk of getting the evil eye from your neighbor. I know. I was the target of 
such a stare. 
</P>
<P>
About a month ago my Los Angeles County town began curbside recycling. Every 
resident was given a bright orange plastic basket for recyclables -- bottles, 
cans and newspapers. Items have to be bagged separately, then put on the curb 
in the basket on trash day. 
</P>
<P>
The flyer that arrived with the plastic basket said the program is voluntary. 
But tell that to my neighbor, who dutifully hauled out his load of recyclables 
on the first day of the program. I, of course, forgot to save my beer cans, 
applesauce jars and newspapers that first week. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I am an ardent believer in recycling. Southern California generates more 
waste than any region in the nation. And nowhere is the trash pile bigger than 
in Orange County, where 4.4 million tons of solid waste is produced every year. 
That's roughly 2.1 tons for every man, woman and child -- the highest 
per-capita ratio of any county in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
These staggering numbers worry me -- as they should anyone planning to live in 
the Los Angeles basin in the next century, when the shortage of landfills and 
the glut of trash could create a noxious mess. Recycling makes sense, and to 
that end I have tried to remember in recent years to stack my newspapers in the 
garage and take them periodically across town to a local recycler. Same with 
bottles and cans. 
</P>
<P>
But work, kids and weekends often sidetracked my efforts. My spirit was 
willing, but the results were erratic. 
</P>
<P>
That's why I welcomed the city's curbside program. How easy can it get? Valet 
service for recyclables. Trouble is, when the program started, I wasn't in the 
habit of saving bottles and cans and old papers. So when the day arrived to 
haul the stuff out in the bright orange basket, I was caught without a single 
contribution by my neighbor, who wisecracked from his driveway: "Don't you care 
about the environment?" 
</P>
<P>
For a reporter who thrives on covering debates over air quality or ocean 
pollution, it was an embarrassing exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Trust me, it has not happened since. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, thousands of Orange County people have joined the recycling ranks. 
An estimated 175,000 to 200,000 county residents voluntarily participate in 
curbside collection programs in Anaheim, Brea, Costa Mesa, Laguna Beach, Orange 
and Irvine. Half a dozen more cities may start such recycling by the end of 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere has recycling been as successful as in Irvine, the first city in the 
county to adopt a program, in September, 1987. More than 71% of the 26,000 
residences eligible for the program are participating, officials say. In some 
pockets of the city, participation is nearly 90%. 
</P>
<P>
In the first two years of the program, 13,196 tons of old cans, glass bottles, 
plastic soda containers and newsprint were collected. City officials say enough 
newspapers were recycled to save about 192,000 35-foot trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thought we were nuts, just nuts when we started this program," said 
Maryanne Hetherington-Wysard, an Irvine public works official. "Now others are 
following. A lot of people are getting into the habit." 
</P>

Aaron Hoke usually plays basketball or baseball on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday was different. Hoke, 15, of Santa Ana, and a handful of other Boy 
Scouts took time off from their usual activities and collected canned and 
packaged food for the hungry in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing this for the needy, for the people without any food," Hoke said. 
"It makes us feel proud and lucky that we have enough food ourselves and can 
give it away." 
</P>
<P>
Hoke, an Eagle Scout, attacked a table laden with hundreds of canned and boxed 
foods, stacking them into brown boxes with the speed of a grocery store bagger. 
</P>
<P>
He and his fellow Boy, Cub and Explorer Scouts from Orange County had 
distributed plastic bags in neighborhoods Feb. 3 as part of the "Scouting for 
Food" campaign. They collected the bags, filled with canned goods, Saturday 
morning and boxed the food to be trucked to the Food Distribution Center 
Serving Orange County by evening. 
</P>
<P>
Their efforts were part of a national campaign by the Boy Scouts of America to 
combat hunger. Most regions ran their food drives before Thanksgiving, but the 
Boy Scouts' Orange County Council and five other councils in Southern 
California waited until this month to start their drives, anticipating the 
post-holiday shortage, said George Trosko, Orange County Boy Scouts director of 
support services. 
</P>
<P>
"We've become so self-centered these days. We all say, 'Me, me, me,' " said 
Carl N. Karcher, chief executive officer of Carl Karcher Enterprises, the 
parent company of the Carl's Jr. restaurant chain. "This gives us . . . the 
chance to take a little time off to express concern for the other person." 
</P>
<P>
Karcher was chairman of the Scouts' food drive in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The local Scouts expected to collect 1 million containers of food. Last year, 
they gathered 810,000 containers. Only the Boy Scouts' Council in St. Louis 
collected more, Trosko said. 
</P>
<P>
The Boy Scouts "expect people to put a can or two in the bag when (the Scouts) 
leave it at their door," Trosko said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Orange County they don't do that. They fill the whole bag. The bags are so 
full some of them are splitting." 
</P>
<P>
National Guard trucks hauled the boxes of food from 36 collection centers at 
church parking lots throughout Orange County, such as the one in Orange where 
Andrew Ashton worked. 
</P>
<P>
"We could be playing baseball, but we decided to be here today to give our 
time," said Ashton, 16, of Santa Ana. "It's only one Saturday in a year, and 
the people need it. We have all the other Saturdays. The poor people aren't 
going to benefit from us playing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Once at the Food Distribution Center, the canned goods will be dispersed to 217 
nonprofit agencies that reach an estimated 150,000 hungry and homeless, said 
Dan Harney, the center's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so affluent here, we don't understand it," Harney said. "We don't have 
starvation or swelled bellies, but we do have hungry people."

VIEW FROM THE BENCH ISN'T ANY BETTER FOR TITANS 
</P>

<P>
Exasperated, John Sneed turned on his heel and walked down the bench, picking 
out one player after another. 
</P>
<P>
You, you, you and you -- into the game. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't like what he saw on the court of the Spanos Center, where his Cal 
State Fullerton team was trailing University of the Pacific by two points in 
the second half of Saturday's Big West Conference game. So he sent in the 
substitutes with 15:32 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he sent the starters back, 2 1/2 minutes later, Fullerton had 
fallen behind by six. The Titans never recovered and finished with a 78-73 
loss, their 10th defeat in 13 road games this season. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sort of coaching move that cuts both ways. Win, and he's a master 
motivator. Lose, and it's open season for second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed said he had no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"We were as flat as we've been in a long time," he said. "For whatever reason, 
we were flat. I was upset with our play at both ends of the floor. I thought it 
would be good if I got them out for a second so they could see the view from my 
seat." 
</P>
<P>
With the starters sitting, Fullerton (12-10 overall, 6-7 in the Big West) had a 
lineup on the floor that was averaging a combined 12.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line was they weren't much better, either," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
When the starters returned, the score was 55-49 with 13:03 to play. But they 
didn't come back and turn it around, instead falling further behind. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the sit-down, Fullerton wasn't at full strength for much of the 
second half. Mark Hill was on the bench after picking up his fourth foul with 
10 minutes to play. He played only nine minutes in the second half, finishing 
with 18 points. Wayne Williams sat out much of the second half, too, playing 
only 12 minutes after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Hill and Williams returned for the stretch run, Fullerton trailed 
by 11, at 70-59, with 2:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to do what I could the last few minutes," said Williams, who hit 
back-to-back three pointers around the one-minute mark and finished with 17 
points. "I can't speak for the rest of the team, but I came ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific (13-9, 6-7) has won more games this season than in the past two 
combined, when they went 5-24 and 7-21. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers held on down the stretch, led by Anthony Woods' 16 points, including 
eight consecutive free throws in the final 1:26, and Dell Demps' 16. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the Titans' second on the road in three days, both against teams 
below them in the conference standings. 
</P>
<P>
But losing on the road is nothing unusual for this team. For all their good 
intentions, the Titans are 3-10 away from home this season, 1-7 against 
conference opponents, with the only victory over Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's struggle Saturday was more pronounced than usual. Cedric Ceballos, 
averaging 23 points, scored only 15 on five-of-17 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"Like always, we get out a little but can't put it away," Ceballos said. "I 
don't know why, but it's hard for us on the road for some reason. We go through 
the same pregame plan as at home. I don't know. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos played 35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (the starters' sit-down) made a difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come out too well," he said. "I've got faith in the other players on 
my team. I don't know if everyone has that point of view. But I don't think 
that was the critical point of the game." 
</P>
<P>
The road has been critical to the Titans' season. 
</P>
<P>
In Titan Gym, Fullerton is averaging 85 points a game. On the road, the average 
is 69. At home, Fullerton is shooting 50% from the field. On the road, 41%. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why," Ceballos said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Ceballos has been chosen to compete in a dunk contest at the Final Four 
in Denver in April. Ceballos is one of eight players selected for the contest, 
which will be televised by ESPN. The list of other participants is not yet 
final. . . . Look-alikes: Fullerton reserve guard Dareck Crane and Michael 
Jordan, in the opinion of Mel Franks, Fullerton sports information director.

<P>
Rancho Santiago College defeated Fullerton, 88-70, Saturday in an Orange Empire 
Conference game that was stopped with 25 seconds left because of a player 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
While reaching for a loose ball, Jevon Hunter, a Rancho Santiago reserve, 
became caught between two Fullerton players in the scramble. He fell to the 
ground holding the back of his neck. He had feeling in his hands and feet when 
he was taken from the gym. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter was taken to St. Jude Hospital in Fullerton for X-rays and further 
examination, which revealed a bruised neck. According to his mother, Ella 
Hunter, the injury was not serious and Hunter was up and walking after the 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago led at the half, 50-37, but Fullerton went on a 6-0 run to 
start the second half and closed to 50-43 with 18:16 left. 
</P>
<P>
After a Rancho Santiago timeout, the Dons scored on three consecutive baskets 
by Matt Lien and led, 56-43. Fullerton could get no closer than 10 points the 
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Corie Blount, a freshman forward, led Rancho Santiago with 20 points and Lien, 
a sophomore center, had 19. Blount had seven rebounds and Lien six. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago shot 74% in the first half and 66.7% in the game from the 
floor. Alvin Loftis was eight of 11 and had 16 points. Lien was nine of 12 and 
Blount seven of 12. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Rancho Santiago (26-2 overall, 9-1 in conference), trails 
conference leader Cypress by only a game with two regular-season games 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago Coach Dana Pagett was pleased with the victory, but not at the 
expense of a player. "It was a win, sure," Pagett said. "But it sure puts the 
whole thing in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton tried to counter with sophomore forward Rashone Lewis, who had a 
game-high 30 points. Lewis was 11 of 19 from the field, including four dunks, 
and made eight of 12 free throws. Lewis is averaging 26.5 points a game in his 
last six games and has a 22.5 average on the season. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Cross, who added 13, was the only other Hornet in double figures. 
Fullerton dropped to 11-17, 2-8. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago plays host to Cypress at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Golden West 101, Saddleback 88 -- Tom Dever, playing for the injured Craig 
Rice, scored a game-high 26 points for host Golden West (20-10, 7-4). Terrell 
Malone and Matt Thompson scored 17 each for Saddleback (8-18, 1-9). 
</P>
<P>
Riverside 70, Orange Coast 58 -- Alan Schlines scored 18 for visiting Orange 
Coast (13-12, 2-8). Greg Stienstra scored 20 for Riverside (16-14, 5-6).

OIL-POLLUTION TROUBLE-SHOOTER WITH 200 SPILLS' EXPERIENCE HIRED TO COORDINATE 
HUNTINGTON BEACH CLEANUP EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Jim O'Brien, all oil spills have just one thing in common: they happen at 
night or on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, a roving oil-pollution trouble-shooter hired to coordinate the 
Huntington Beach cleanup, was summoned at 10:30 Wednesday night from Lake 
Shore, La. He was on a plane for Los Angeles at 5:30 the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
With 200 spills under his belt, O'Brien is recognized as one of the nation's 
leading cleanup specialists. A spokesman from BP America, a cleanup company, 
called O'Brien the Red Adair of the oil-spill business, in reference to the 
legendary oil-well fire specialist. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien is no stranger to these shores. His 20 years in the Coast Guard 
included a stint as head of the Pacific Strike Team, responsible for 
coordinating the cleanup of all oil spills in the West. He also was cleanup 
manager for the 1987 Pac Baroness spill in the Santa Barbara Channel and the 
1988 Shell Oil Co. spill at Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Since he started his company, O'Brien Oil Pollution Services Inc., in 1983, he 
has worked spills from Antarctica to Valdez, Alaska, site of the last big oil 
spill on the West Coast last year. 
</P>
<P>
The spill off Huntington Beach is challenging, although not out of the 
ordinary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at 'em all, and say, 'This is not going to be the easiest thing,' " 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Each spill has its own peculiarities. In this case, the "wide variety of beach 
profiles" near the American Trader is one of the most difficult aspects of this 
project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Brien was impressed by the "level of intensity from all the parties," 
including BP America and the industry cleanup cooperatives that are involved in 
the effort. The focused commitment, combined with the broad experience of many 
of the people involved, will be crucial in getting the job done, he said.

<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH MAYOR -- AND FORMER SURFER -- BECAME CITY'S CHIEF SPOKESMAN ON 
THE NATIONAL SCENE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is tall, slim, boyish-looking. Although he is 36, Huntington Beach Mayor 
Thomas J. Mays could easily pass for a college graduate student in his early 
20s. He also could pass for being a hot-dogging young surfer, the kind who 
happily frequent the city's famous beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Mays, in fact, is a former surfer, as he told about about 50 radio, television 
and print reporters from throughout the nation at a news conference last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember from my surfing days about how the wind conditions on the ocean 
would change," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
Mays, elected mayor by his fellow City Council members about three months ago, 
has been catapulted into national attention by the oil catastrophe that hit his 
city on Wednesday. By virtue of his position, he has become the city's chief 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
He has been low-key in his news conferences and national TV talk-show 
interviews. He has not engaged in emotional hand-wringing over the oil spill, 
nor has he angrily pointed fingers of blame. His statements have been objective 
recitations of facts and figures involving the oil slick and the city's 
response. He seldom uses adjectives; he almost never raises his voice. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just my style," the mayor said. "I get more accomplished -- I get 
better results -- by getting the facts first and not overreacting." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his personal sentiments about the spill, Mays also was 
low-key. "I feel really bad about it and disappointed it happened. I've surfed 
on these beaches. When you live in a city like this, you become emotionally 
involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mays, who is married and has two daughters, has a master's degree in political 
science from the University of Chicago. He is staff manager in charge of 
strategic planning and market analysis for McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. 
in Huntington Beach.

The oil disaster has taught him a major lesson involving future needs with 
intergovernmental relations, Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become very obvious to me that Huntington Beach -- and every city for 
that matter -- needs to become a little more involved in national issues," he

us in our cities." BILL BILLITER

NEWPORT BEACH CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND ENVIRONMENTALIST, HELPED MOP UP OIL SPOTS 
ON CITY BEACHES AND MONITORED RESPONSE OF LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES

As in any crisis, political leaders are often thrust into roles outside their 
ordinary areas of expertise. Evelyn R. Hart is no different. 
</P>
<P>
By vocation, Hart is a Newport Beach councilwoman and an environmentalist. But 
as the oil slick approached the hitherto pristine shores of her community, she 
found that she quickly had to become an expert in a wide range of areas. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a day after the tanker American Trader began spewing oil from its 
punctured hull, Hart became an expert in meteorology. 
</P>
<P>
"On Thursday afternoon at 4:30, the wind was blowing at 15 knots from south to 
north, meaning that the oil slick had a good possibility of hitting our shore," 
she said. "When it started coming to our shore at 20 knots, we got a little bit 
nervous." 
</P>
<P>
When the slick did come ashore, Hart found herself in yet another role -- 
emergency management and damage control. 
</P>
<P>
"At 9:30 on Thursday night, we (herself, the mayor and other council members) 
went out in a jeep and checked the beach -- that was our first indication oil 
was coming in," Hart said. "Then yesterday (Friday), I was up in the police 
helicopter so I could get an overview of what was going on. That indicated to 
me that some oil was still coming out of the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was on-line as soon as we heard Thursday," she added. "Our 
emergency preparedness team has got to be complimented. They were in place and 
ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
By next week, Hart will be back to her "real" job as a councilwoman -- and 
that, she noted, could be the most important job of all. As media and public 
interest wanes, she said, local politicians must keep the heat on to ensure 
that safeguards are enacted to prevent a similar incident in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We are so lucky that oil has not totally wrecked our shore for 30 years," Hart 
said. "The important thing is to move ahead with our legislation." TONY MARCANO

HELPED FOUND HUNTINGTON BEACH WETLANDS CONSERVANCY AND WORKED TO KEEP OIL OUT 
OF SANTA ANA RIVER.

If the oil was going to come to newly restored Talbert Marsh in Huntington 
Beach, Gary Gorman was going to be there to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"He went down there when he first heard it on TV," said Gorman's mother-in-law, 
Juanita Jones. "He and his son went, and they got in at 3 a.m. He slept a 
couple of hours, and then he went back out again." 
</P>
<P>
Gorman, a fireman-cum-environmentalist, helped found the Huntington Beach 
Wetlands Conservancy in 1985 to restore a dusty, 26-acre tract near the mouth 
of the Santa Ana River to its natural condition as a saltwater marsh. Last 
year, with the help of a state grant, the sea returned at last to Talbert 
Marsh, located behind Gorman's house, when a channel was opened at the 
Huntington Beach levee. 
</P>
<P>
When the water returned, so did the wildlife: endangered least terns, stopping 
on their migratory path from South America; Caspian terns, diving gracefully 
into the water from 25 to 50 feet for fish; the tiny Belding's savanna sparrow, 
another endangered species; grebes, pelicans and others. 
</P>
<P>
After all the work that Gorman, his wife, Lynn, their sons Chris, 15, and Gary 
Scott, 8, and his mother-in-law had put into nurturing the marsh back to life, 
he wasn't about to let black goo from an oil spill destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
Officials placed vinyl booms at the mouth of the Santa Ana River, as well as at 
several other ecologically sensitive locations. But Gorman and conservancy 
members didn't believe the plastic would withstand the high-velocity waters of 
the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
They were waiting with bulldozers to push sand into the opening, even though it 
would mean shutting off the saltwater for the tidal pools. But officials said 
the dam could cause flooding upstream if there was rain. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on Friday afternoon, officials gave the go-ahead for a temporary dam. 
And as darkness fell over the oil-slick sea, Gorman and the bulldozers held it 
back from the river. MARIA NEWMAN

SURFACE-DIVING BIRDS MOST VULNERABLE TO OIL; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE: SPILL COULD ALSO HARM PRIMARY FOOD SOURCES FOR COUNTLESS MIGRATING 
BIRDS AND THE ENDANGERED LIGHT-FOOTED CLAPPER RAIL IF IT ENTERS SENSITIVE 
WETLANDS AREAS.

<P>
Each fall, the distinctive black-and-white western grebe wings south from its 
breeding grounds in Alaska to winter off the coast of Southern California and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of the birds bob in the waters off Orange County, where they are 
joined by other surface-diving sea birds: common murres and several species of 
scoter. 
</P>
<P>
These birds are the most vulnerable to the floating oil released Wednesday by 
the ruptured tanker American Trader. 
</P>
<P>
"Grebes and murres spend most of their time sitting on the water, so they're 
highly vulnerable to oil," said Michael Fry, a research physiologist in the 
avian sciences department at UC Davis. And because oil is not a natural aspect 
of the birds' environment, they don't know to avoid it. In fact, Fry said, the 
oil has a flattening effect on the water that may actually attract the birds as 
they fly in search of choice feeding locations. 
</P>
<P>
Fry has seen his share of oil-soaked birds. He oversaw the pathological study 
of birds killed by last year's spill off Valdez, Alaska, in which an estimated 
30,000 sea birds and 127 bald eagles died. 
</P>
<P>
There are two life-threatening problems that occur when a bird's feathers are 
fouled with oil. 
</P>
<P>
First, a bird will try to clean itself with its bill, called "preening," thus 
ingesting some of the oil. "They do eat substantial quantities of the oil when 
they're trying to get it off their feathers," Fry said. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil, such as that spilled off Huntington Beach, has a certain percentage 
of gasoline that gradually evaporates. If swallowed, it can cause serious 
damage to liver and kidneys. The oil itself causes anemia in the birds, which 
can lose half to two-thirds of their red blood cells, which carry oxygen 
through the body. For diving birds, which must hold their breath to feed, that 
can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
The other main problem is that the oil mats the feathers, interfering with the 
bird's ability to float and to insulate itself from the cold waters. The body 
temperature drops, and the bird can die from hypothermia, or can literally 
starve to death as its metabolism increases to make up for the escaping heat. 
</P>
<P>
The oil spill can effect other aspects of the marine food chain, down to its 
most basic elements. If the spill enters any of the county's sensitive wetlands 
areas, it could smother the invertebrates that live in the ground. These are 
the primary food source for shore birds, including the endangered light-footed 
clapper rail, which nests in Anaheim Bay and Upper Newport Bay, and the myriad 
migrating birds that depend on the wetlands as vital refueling stops on their 
long journeys. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, I don't think things are going to be disastrous" if some oil 
enters the marshes, said Louann Murray, a specialist in wetland invertebrates 
and a member of Amigos de Bolsa Chica. Microbes in the mud will eventually 
break down the oil that isn't scooped out, and the marsh will eventually 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
The short-term effects, however, could be disastrous for the migrating birds 
and especially for the clapper rail. Half of the remaining clapper rails in the 
United States live in Upper Newport Bay, and "could be wiped out by this 
spill," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
If the oil hits tide pools, the results could also be devastating, according to 
Harry Helling of the Orange County Marine Institute in Dana Point. "There's 
nothing you can do to rescue a tide pool," Helling said. 
</P>
<P>
In the ocean waters near shore, mussels and snails can ingest the oil without 
apparent harm. But it accumulates in their systems, and can contaminate the 
birds that feed on them, such as harlequin and goldeneye ducks and oyster 
catchers. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs and young fish are vulnerable, but because this is not breeding season, 
adult fish won't be severely impacted. However, if the oil settles to the 
bottom it could kill such bottom-dwelling fish as halibut. 
</P>
<P>
In Alaska, sea otters -- which depend on their fur for insulation -- were the 
biggest victims of the spill among marine mammals. Otters no longer live off 
the Orange County coast, but there are numbers of California sea lions, 
bottle-nose and common dolphins and the migrating gray whales. 
</P>
<P>
Large mammals are usually able to escape the oil, says Jacqui Michel, a South 
Carolina-based scientific consultant who worked the Valdez spill and is heading 
to Orange County. While evidence is inconclusive, the oil does not seem to 
stick to the skin of whales and dolphins when they swim through. 
</P>
<P>
One concern is that dolphins, which accumulate toxins in their systems, may 
suffer long-term effects if they eat fish contaminated by the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Overall though, some experts are optimistic that wildlife off the Orange County 
coast will not suffer major long-term consequences if the spill is kept out of 
wetlands and other inlets. 
</P>
<P>
"You hate to say it, but in the grand scheme of things, if you had to have a 
spill, this was the time and the place," said state biologist Robin Lewis, who 
is helping assess potential environmental damage for the state Department of 
Fish and Game. "A month later, a few miles farther to the south, in that rocky 
reach near Corona del Mar and Laguna, and it would have taken years to 
recover."

Here are descriptions of five birds threatened by the oil spill off Huntington 
Beach, shown above from left. 
</P>
<P>
Western grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis) 
</P>
<P>
Because it spends most of its time on the surface of coastal waters, this 
wintering bird is among the most vulnerable to the early effects of a spill. 
</P>
<P>
California least tern (Sterna antillarum browni) 
</P>
<P>
This endangered gull-like bird nests on the sand in wetlands such as Bolsa 
Chica. Now wintering farther south, its nesting grounds would be threatened if 
oil enters the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) 
</P>
<P>
This endangered bird flies along the surface and dives for fish; at least two 
have been found with their feathers covered with oil. 
</P>
<P>
Common murre (Uria aalge) 
</P>
<P>
Like the grebe, this sea bird bobs on the water's surface, diving occasionally 
for fish. 
</P>
<P>
Light-footed clapper rail (Rallus longirostris levipes) 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the state's population of this sedentary marsh bird lives in 
the dense cordgrass stands of Upper Newport Bay. Any damage to this nesting 
site would be devastating to the bird's future prospects.

DR. ARNOLD O. BECKMAN: Scientist, philanthropist and founder of Beckman 
Instruments in Fullerton, lives in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
I live on a bluff over the ocean in Corona del Mar just east of the Newport 
Harbor jetty. I looked down (Friday) morning and the oil hadn't gotten there 
yet. I'm apprehensive we may have a period here in which our shoreline will be 
spoiled. It is just too bad. 
</P>
<P>
We have to do some heavy thinking to anticipate these things. There was a lot 
of talk before Valdez about the necessity of requiring double-hulled tankers. 
Let's not wait any more. This is something for Congress to address. 
</P>
<P>
In the pharmaceutical industry, if a company develops a new drug, it has to 
apply to the Food and Drug Administration before it is marketed to see if the 
drug is effective at doing what it was designed for and if any side effects are 
harmful. We should apply that same two-sided test to everything that we do. 
</P>
<P>
We should have a risk-benefit study of every major thing that we do, whether it 
is a proposal to build a nuclear power plant or another new highway through 
Orange County or hundreds of new low-cost housing units. We allow the vocal, 
single-issue people to dominate the scene. I am sitting in the office of the 
(Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center of) the National Academies of Sciences and 
Engineering in Irvine. It is devoted to encouraging study groups on major 
issues. And that is the way decisions should be made. I think we don't make the 
extra effort to study all sides of an issue because, as a society, we have 
become too soft, too complacent. Life has become too comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT S. COHEN: Chairman of the drama department at the UC Irvine School of 
Fine Arts, author of eight books, lives in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the tanker spill is a horror. I've been in Laguna Beach for 25 
years, and this confirms our worst fears. We've been waiting for this to 
happen, just like the madwoman of Chaillot. 
</P>
<P>
You know, the first great post-World War II play in France was "The Madwoman of 
Chaillot" by Jean Giraudoux. The "madwoman" of the title was an 
environmentalist. That's why they called her mad, because she believed that art 
and beauty and nature should have a higher value than technological progress. 
</P>
<P>
What an ironic forecast Giraudoux gave us. The play is a fantasy about some men 
who discover oil under Paris, and they are trying to destroy the city in order 
to get the oil. Giraudoux called these people "mecs," which means pimps. At the 
end of the play, all the pimps are sent down to hell. 
</P>
<P>
I guess we need a liberation from the technological pimps. 
</P>
<P>
JAMES DOTI: Professor of economics at Chapman College, lives in Anaheim Hills 
but spends his summers in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In any disaster, it's easy to overreact, and some perspective is necessary. We 
live in a complex economy, and these things will occur, trying as they are. We 
use oil and refined petroleum products, and we tend to take them for granted, 
not realizing the complex process it takes to bring these things to market. 
</P>
<P>
I would hate to see an overreaction, some kind of ban on oil shipping, or 
refining, or drilling off-shore. Anything that is done to limit the transit, 
entry or exit points of these products will affect the cost. People have to 
realize the trade-off between a marginal increase in safety and higher prices. 
Economically, our dependance on foreign oil has increased significantly and 
that's a problem as well, though not as visible as an oil spill. When we go to 
fill up our tank we take it for granted and don't realize the complexity of the 
process behind it, and any restriction on this process raises prices. A 
decision needs to be made as to whether people are willing to pay that price. 
We have to keep that in perspective. 
</P>

MAXINE O'CALLAGHAN: A writer of seven mystery novels, has lived in Mission 
Viejo since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
I've been reading about the spill in the paper. The pictures of the birds are 
just heartbreaking. You have to wonder, even if they are able to corral all the 
oil with their little boats, how many blobs of that stuff are going to remain 
loose and floating around to foul all the beaches here? 
</P>
<P>
I've already written about the environment in Orange County in "Hit and Run," 
my last Delilah West book. Only I used chemical spills, the midnight dumping of 
toxic chemicals, as a plot element in that one. I'm using county 
overdevelopment as an element in another book I'm writing now. This spill 
becomes one more fact of life that you bring up for your reader to show what's 
happening here. It gives a picture of the county, and not a very nice picture, 
to balance the palm trees and the beautiful weather. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of real life, the thing that occurs to me is this: What will this 
spill mean to us in the future? I wonder if it's going to change the way we 
think about our beautiful beaches and our clean water, and whether we're going 
to take them for granted any more. It would be nice to think that all this 
would add up to some good, that people will become a lot more militant about 
protecting the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Is that going to happen? Or are we just going to forget this disaster as soon 
as the spill is cleaned up and the little dead birds are all carted off to the 
landfill? I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
T. JEFFERSON PARKER: Author of "Laguna Heat" and "Little Saigon," lives in 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not that miffed by the thing. I think it's a neat little mini-tragedy and 
everyone wants to rush down and book rooms in Huntington Beach and stare at the 
thing. But it doesn't rate very high on my list of concerns right now. Now, if 
we were talking 5 million gallons, I'd be singing a different tune, but it 
hasn't bludgeoned its way into my consciousness the way other things have. It 
strikes me as a lot of hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
It's so easy as we consume our billions and billions of tons of fossil fuel to 
scream, shout and holler when something like this happens. As Philip Levine, 
the poet, said, "To enter the fire is to burn." If we're going to pump and 
refine oil to run our cars and our city and state, we're bound to spill some of 
it once in a while. It doesn't seem like a huge amount of negligence (was 
involved in the spill) to me. Accidents happen. I think I'm pretty 
environmentally conscious, contrary as that may sound to what I've said. I 
think one of the risks you run when you refine and transport that amount of 
crude is that things like that are going to happen. It's a sorry sight, with 
all the birds getting stuck together and dying and the seal out at the end of 
Newport Pier. I love this environment and I hate to see it tainted, but at the 
same time I wouldn't want to overreact to this in a kind of knee-jerk way.

</P>
<P>
That which evaporates is going to blow off in a few days, so whatever level of 
hydrocarbons that exists doesn't pose a long-term effect. It's the heavy 
hydrocarbons, the oily, gunky part (that may have long-term effects). The ones 
that do boil off become an air-quality problem, but only for a few days. The 
heavier ones that stay in the water or on the land if they wash ashore are 
going to last much longer. 
</P>
<P>
I think it's almost inevitable in any form of transportation that it's not 
always going to work, so I guess that is to be expected. Airplanes crash, oil 
tankers spill. Any time you're operating tankers close to the shore, you've got 
a recipe for trouble. You don't know when, but you can count on the fact that 
it will happen. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think we ought to be offshore drilling off Huntington Beach and the 
California shore. Too many people are using the beach, and it's such an 
important aspect of life here that the offshore drilling doesn't belong. It's 
just a question that sometime you're going to have the equivalent of this spill 
from the drilling. 
</P>
<P>
The question of how much damage has been done remains to be seen. The only 
conclusion you really draw is that there are bound to be accidents in any kind 
of operation. 
</P>

since October, 1984, lives in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
I came to California from Texas -- I lived (inland) in San Antonio, but all my 
life I went to Texas beaches. I took my children there and watched as the 
beaches became worse and worse over the years. The beaches in Texas were almost 
destroyed because cars were allowed to drive on the sand and a tremendous 
amount of tar accumulated. They are working to clean up the waters, but things 
got very, very bad before they did that. We have all seen places we love 
disappear because of (pollution). 
</P>
<P>
I think California is the most beautiful area of the United States, and one of 
the reasons I'm here is the beauty of the place and Californians' concern for 
the environment. I give money to various groups to support the environment, but 
because I have very limited time, I'm not active in these groups. If I knew 
something specific I could do to help in this situation, I surely would. I hope 
those of us in the neighborhood can find out soon how we can help. 
</P>
<P>
I hope it will call enough attention to this problem that our legislators will 
act accordingly. Most of all, I wish we had an alternative energy source that 
didn't require that we use all this oil. I would like to see alternative 
sources of energy that do not pollute our environment become practical enough 
for us to use. And I say that as I prepare to get in my car and drive home -- 
by myself. 
</P>
<P>
KEM NUNN: Author of "Tapping the Source," set in Huntington Beach, has lived in 
Huntington Beach for five years, in the county for nearly 15. 
</P>
<P>
It's terrible. I was down there Friday and it's amazing how strong the fumes 
are just coming in off the ocean. This is a very dramatic thing, so it calls a 
lot of attention to itself. Apparently there's some legislation going on, 
trying to get these tankers to be double-hulled, so if the hoopla being raised 
helps in that regard, good. 
</P>
<P>
The thing you have to keep in mind, you have to put this in perspective and 
realize that the ocean is being polluted every day and stuff is washing up on 
the beach every day and a lot of the time it is stuff you can't taste or see or 
smell, but that doesn't mean it's not dangerous. This spill is something that's 
very obvious and draws a lot of attention, but I happen to be one of those 
people who thinks the threat to our environment is the most serious threat we 
face. 
</P>
<P>
I know some people have a visceral sort of reaction to this. I don't know that 
I can claim any such reaction, other than (to say) I used to surf in the ocean 
every day and, within the past couple years, I've started getting a lot of ear 
infections, sinus infections; I've started having second thoughts about 
spending a lot of time in the ocean every day in some of the heavily populated 
areas where it simply is not as clean as it was 20 years ago. So I look at 
something like this and say, what's happening is bad, but I also see it as a 
part of a much larger problem.

RHODA MARTYN: Huntington Beach resident and a founding member of Amigos de 
Bolsa Chica, the activist group that has fought since the mid-1970s for

</P>
<P>
I guess we've been somewhat fortunate that the oil hasn't really gotten in to 
the Bolsa Chica. It would be a real travesty if it ever came down the Bolsa 
Chica after all the work we've done. 
</P>
<P>
There has been such concern over this spill. The beauty parlor operator Friday 
was just so concerned and upset that she couldn't leave work and go down and 
volunteer at the beach. And she was feeling so personally about it. And here's 
this apolitical person. It's so neat that people are doing something about 
their environment. While it's a horrible thing, maybe some good will come of 
it. Maybe we'll get some legislation calling for double hulls on tankers. There 
was a similar push in 1973 after an Alaskan spill. 
</P>
<P>
I think you are seeing a tremendous concern with the environment more and more. 
And it's really nice. I'm gathering that they are having lots of volunteers 
(along the shore and to help oil-covered birds). But it is distressing to have 
an accident occur like this. 
</P>
<P>
MITSUYE YAMADA: Retired English professor at Cypress College and now active in 
Amnesty International, has published three books of poetry and is editing a

</P>
<P>
I'm really appalled by the lack of foresight that would create something like 
this. I understand we do have the technology to clean it up immediately, 
because they notified people immediately, unlike the one involving the Exxon 
Valdez, where they waited three hours, apparently, before letting anyone know. 
I think it's really criminal that something was not done immediately before oil 
had spread the way it seems to be doing. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not actively involved in any environmental activism; I'm in human rights 
work, but I am concerned about the environment. As a citizen, I think we all 
need to be concerned about it. It's really too bad we don't do something. We 
kind of leave it up to experts to take care of these things for us, and we all 
have other concerns, and I haven't paid that much attention to the prevention 
of these kind of things. Perhaps more of us should to maintain a quality of 
life that's important here. And quality meaning more than being able to surf on 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
I'm in human rights work, I'm concerned about human life, but I'm also 
concerned about the lack of concern we have toward things that we think are 
lesser or less important than human life. I think we should be concerned about 
things like that -- wildlife and plants and the land. All these things are 
connected.

MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: SCHWANN SONG FOR YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC CATALOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chunky Schwann catalogue, beloved of music librarians, record collectors 
and trivia buffs everywhere, is no more. Or rather, it is now a triumvirate of 
publications, two quarterly catalogues led by a monthly magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The first isssue of the magazine, inMusic, is out now. According to Gary 
Higgins, the production editor, the initial circulation was 10,000 copies, 
60-70% to record stores and the rest to individual subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get as much detail into the new releases as possible," Higgins 
says of the magazine. "Basically, we're trying to keep it to little notes and 
reviews, centered around the new releases." 
</P>
<P>
This is a far-flung endeavor, with the editorial and advertising offices in 
Boston, the publisher in Chatsworth, the printing facility in Santa Monica and 
the individual subscription office in Nashville. "We've got it under control," 
Higgins laughs. "We do alot of faxing and overnight mailing." 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the current 76-page issue is devoted to listings of new classical 
releases, in the format familiar to Schwann users. Look closely, though, and 
you'll discover a wealth of informative editorial asides in fine print, blunt 
in opinion and breezy in style. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
"Among this month's avalanche of historic live broadcast releases are 11 
Koussevitsky (mostly Boston Symphony Orchestra) CDs from Italy. . . . The 4th 
movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony sung in French with Koussevitsky 
conducting the French National Radio Orchestra &amp; Chorus (AS Disc AS-555), 
for example, is marred by constant tape print-through, many sound dropouts, 15 
seconds of what sounds like someone tinkling on a celesta or glockenspiel 
off-hall a little over 3 minutes in, a complete half-second break mid-movement, 
two repeated bars 23 minutes in as a result of a bad tape splice, and bits of 
extraneous conversation audible in two soft passages. . . . As a final fillip, 
the tape speeds up 25 seconds from the end, just as the chorus has begun its 
rousing finish, sending everybody up approximately 3/4 of a tone for the rest 
of the ride. Those excitable French engineers, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
"This is one ("Carmen" excerpts) of five releases on vanity label GDS -- 
Giuseppe Di Stefano Records -- from Italy. . . . The unauthorized recordings 
are of standard pirate (oh, sorry, we're not supposed to say that anymore; make 
that 'public domain') quality sound, and reflect poorly on a great artist that 
he would lend his name to such an enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
"The back of this CD (vol. 2 of Szymanowski's piano music by Andrzej Stefanski) 
bears the legend DIGITAL RECORDING in large bold type. It is not. The 
recordings are from 1978-1981 and the SPARS code is A-A-D. This information is 
also displayed on the back of the package, so perhaps it is not an attempt to 
mislead. We have seen the phrase 'Digital Recording' misused by several labels 
. . . often enough that we are persuaded that it is on occasion employed by 
certain record labels in a deliberate effort to falsely represent their 
product. More common is the use of the single word "Digital" printed on the 
front or back of the CD, usually, though not always, on analog recordings. 
Since all CDs are digitally mastered, signified by the (always 'D') third 
component of the three-letter SPARS code, the term conveys no information as to 
either the original recording or subsequent editing processes, and is, at best, 
meaningless, but confusing and misleading to the unwary. While most labels are 
not guilty of either practice, those irresponsible few that are do real injury 
to the reputations of all." 
</P>
<P>
Not your usual catalogue listings. 
</P>
<P>
With inMusic concentrating on new releases in all fields, the traditional 
Schwann cataloguing will devolve to the quarterlies; Spectrum for pop musics, 
and Opus for classical recordings. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past it's been geared a lot toward the classical audience," Higgins 
says. "We're trying to broaden that audience." 
</P>
<P>
ON THE ROAD: The current North American tour of the Alvin Ailey American Dance 
Theater began in Birmingham, Ala., on Tuesday, and continues through June, 
touching down on, among other stops, Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Boston, Los 
Angeles (at the Wiltern Theatre, May 8-13, sponsored by the UCLA Center for the 
Arts) and Washington, D.C. The tour is sponsored by the Philip Morris 
Companies, Inc. . . . The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, under Christopher 
Hogwood, its music director, embarks on its second European tour March 5. The 
tour begins in Geneva March 8 and ends in Zurich March 23. In between, the 
orchestra will play in East Germany, Liechtenstein, Italy, the Netherlands, 
Spain and Portugal. . . . In Adare, County Limerick, Ireland, the New Jersey 
Symphony, under its music director Hugh Wolff, will be a major participant in a 
new music festival to be housed in Adare Manor. The first Adare Festival takes 
place July 13-29. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE: Pianist Rosalind Runcie, wife of The Most Rev. Robert Runcie, 
Archbishop of Canterbury, will make an appearance with the Chamber Orchestra at 
St. Matthew's in Pacific Palisades Feb. 23 to benefit the new Episcopal 
Diocesan Center to be built in Echo Park. Runcie will play Shostakovich's Piano 
Concerto No. 2 on a program to be conducted by Thomas Neenan; the remainder of 
the agenda: Mozart's "Coronation" Mass and Vaughan Williams' "The Lark 
Ascending". . . . Frederick Swann, Robert Preston, Peter Sweeney, Jacques 
Taddei and Ian Tracey are the international organists set to perform on the 
1990 summer recital series at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. Swann, 
organist at the Cathedral, opens the series May 4 with a program given in 
memory of Virgil Fox, who died 10 years ago, and who designed the Hazel Wright 
organ there. Preston, organist at First Presbyterian Church of San Diego, 
appears June 1 with a brass ensemble; Sweeney, organist at Christ Church 
Cathedral in Dublin, Ireland, plays July 12; Taddei, who succeeded Jean 
Langlais as titulaire of St. Clotilde in Paris, France, appears July 27. 
Tracey, organist at Liverpool Anglican Cathedral in England, closes the series, 
Aug. 10.

<P>
BOOKSHELF: "We Build a School of Music," written by the late USC professor 
Pauline Alderman, is an informal history of the 110-year-old USC School of 
Music. Filled with facts, pictures and Alderman's observations, the 353-page 
book, originally intended for release during the school's centennial in 1980, 
has just been published by the Alderman Book Committee. 
</P>
<P>
After Alderman's death in 1983, a group of volunteers assembled to complete the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't write it. We just put it together," said Dorothy Jean Hartshorn, 
retired music education chair from USC. "Her style of writing and usage of 
words is part of the charm." 
</P>
<P>
The book (at $24.95) can be obtained from Carol Skinner, 1806 Hollyvista, Los 
Angeles, Calif. 90027. Proceeds from the purchase will benefit the Alderman 
Scholarship Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Cariaga and David Sweet contributed to this column.

 For the Record: In some editions of last Sunday's Calendar, Martin 
Bernheimer's byline was left off the commentary in the music section entitled 
"The Supertenor Calls the Shots in Los Angeles."

BASIA / "LONDON, WARSAW, NEW YORK" EPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the best songs on her million-selling debut album "Time and Tide" two years 
ago, the Polish singer coolly meshed Brazilian jazz and pop, establishing 
herself as a dazzling re-creation of '60s bossa nova star Astrud Gilberto. 
Basia even did a better Gilberto than Sade, who's been mimicking Gilberto since 
the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Basia, though, embellished that style, using it as a jumping off point to 
something more gritty and soulful. 
</P>
<P>
Basia's follow-up album, again co-written with Danny White (who co-produced the 
album with Basia), surpasses the first one, boasting more elegantly-crafted 
songs -- most floating along on those sleek, intoxicating Brazilian rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Though she flaunts her soul chops on a gently funky version of Aretha 
Franklin's oldie "Until You Come Back to Me," it's Basia's jazz-style vocals 
that make this collection so outstanding. Her voice isn't powerful, but rather 
slight and teasing. To add flavor, she often sings tantalizingly off-key. Her 
vocals are the showpiece of lush, loping numbers like "Cruisin' for Bruisin' " 
and "Baby You're Mine." 
</P>
<P>
Basia doesn't break new ground with this album, but revitalizes and spruces up 
old turf -- in the process coming up with the best pop-Brazilian album in 
years. DENNIS HUNT

*** TANITA TIKARAM "THE SWEET KEEPER" REPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only 20, Tikaram has written two good chapters now on how to be young, 
sensitive and deep without sounding arch, prissy and cloying. A lot of the 
credit belongs to co-producers Peter an Hooke and Rod Argent, whose musical 
pedigrees (Van Morrison, Zombies/Argent) are even more interesting than 
Tikaram's exotic Asian-British background. 
</P>
<P>
The producers etch appropriate, distinctive markings into nearly every song -- 
a fetching Celtic fiddle, somber flute and strings, some humid trumpet or 
evocative bottleneck guitar. 
</P>
<P>
These colorations are vital, because Tikaram's vocal range is narrow, and her 
songs tend toward sameness of tone. With singing that emphasizes exploratory 
phrasings and adventurous shifts of intensity, she does a lot to overcome these 
limitations. For example, Tikaram is able to try on different accents -- a 
Jamaican lilt or an Irish brogue -- and sound expressive rather than affected 
(Natalie Merchant should ask her how she does it). 
</P>
<P>
The songs on "The Sweet Keeper" are impressionistic, but never pointless. 
Unlike her predominantly world-weary debut, "Ancient Heart," this album conveys 
a low-key exuberance. Tikaram's songs about lovers and family never minimize 
how cloudy emotional weather can be, but that only makes her more believable 
when she sings about wanting to seek out the sun streaks in between. MIKE BOEHM

THEY'RE WILD ABOUT PITINO; 
</P>
<P>
HIS FIRST TEAM AT KENTUCKY IS SHORT AND ON PROBATION, BUT COACH WINS OVER FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LEXINGTON, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As construction continues on Rick Pitino's new home, so does the steady stream 
of drive-by gawkers, who cruise past the work site as if it were a shrine, not 
a residence-to-be for Kentucky's latest basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Pitino stopped by one Sunday to check on the building's progress and found a 
caravan of cars about 300 yards long weaving through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
One disc jockey went so far as to sneak into the yard, steal some dirt and then 
tell Kentucky athletic department officials that he planned to reward lucky 
listeners with the stuff. He would have done it, too, had not university public 
relations types begged for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Pitino-mania isn't limited to the work of a deejay's shovel. Readers 
of the Lexington Herald-Leader recently were treated to "The Ballad of Rick 
Pitino," a heartfelt poem penned by an adoring fan. Emily Dickinson, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
In the school's bookstore are "Pitino's Bombinos" sweat shirts. In the magazine 
racks are nearly a half-dozen basketball preview magazines, many of them with 
Pitino's smiling mug on the cover. And at one of the nearby hotel gift shops 
are copies of Pitino's biography, "Born To Coach." 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing comes close to this," Pitino said. "There's nothing else in the 
people's lives bigger than Kentucky basketball. Vacations, social life . . . 
everything they do with their family revolves around Kentucky basketball. These 
people could talk about Kentucky basketball the entire year, every minute of 
their lives. It's a pleasure for them to do that. It's a lot different from 
everything else I've experienced. 
</P>
<P>
"I've signed more autographs in the short time I've been here than I have in my 
life, maybe 10 times over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is what happens when a boy wonder from the North, wearing a Final Four 
ring the size of an infant's clutched fist and sporting a New York accent as 
thick as a pastrami-on-rye from the Carnegie Deli, steps up to the podium and 
promises to restore a shamed Kentucky basketball program to past glories. 
</P>
<P>
Pitino did this and more last June. He vowed that the Wildcats' recovery would 
be relatively swift and done according to the NCAA rule manual, a copy of which 
seemed to be permanently misplaced during previous coach Eddie Sutton's era. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the speech and the surprising 11 victories that have been recorded 
by a team short on seniors, stars and scholarships, Pitino has become as valued 
by Kentucky faithful as one of those national championship banners that hang 
from the rafters of Rupp Arena. After nearly 19 months of unwanted notoriety, a 
university is beginning to feel good about itself and its basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons: former UK President David Roselle, Athletic Director C.M. 
Newton and, of course, Pitino, only the fourth Kentucky coach since 1931, but 
the third in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Roselle guided the school through the embarrassing NCAA investigation and 
sanction process, and later enacted measures to ensure it never happened again. 
He was branded a traitor by some factions of school supporters, a savior by 
most others.

Newton, a respected former coach, earned praise for his hands-on administrative 
style. He hired Bill Curry, last seen on the Sugar Bowl sidelines with a 10-2 
Alabama team; and Pitino, 37, who last season led the New York Knicks to a 
division title, their first since 1971, in only his second season as an NBA 
coach. Before that, Pitino directed Providence to a surprising Final Four 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The normally reserved Newton couldn't contain himself the day he introduced 
Pitino to the media last June 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We have just . . . named the very best head coach in the country," he gushed. 
"Today begins a new day in Kentucky basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Added a beaming Roselle: "It's a historic day and a happy day." 
</P>
<P>
There have been few moments in the past two years that have brought smiles to 
Kentucky followers. Sutton's tenure often was marked by crisis and controversy, 
to say nothing of Kentucky's first losing season in almost 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
Still, had everything gone as planned by Sutton, the Wildcats would have begun 
the year as a likely Final Four participant. The roster would have included 
such stars as Rex Chapman, Shawn Kemp, Eric Manuel, Chris Mills and LeRon 
Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Chapman opted to turn pro and is in his second season with Charlotte 
Hornets. Kemp, one of the country's most sought-after high school players, 
decided to forgo a college career and jump directly to the NBA. He is a rookie 
with the Seattle SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel, a gifted offensive player, was forbidden to play for any NCAA member 
school because of a cheating scandal. Mills, the team's leading rebounder last 
season, transferred to Arizona after becoming the focal point of the NCAA's 
investigation. Mills was sent the infamous Emery overnight package, allegedly 
containing $1,000 from then-Kentucky assistant coach Dwayne Casey. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, UK's leading scorer in 1989, fled to Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky was left with eight scholarship players, only one of them a senior. 
When Pitino took his place for the preseason team photograph, he found that his 
coaches and support staff outnumbered his players almost two to one. 
</P>
<P>
According to the NCAA sanctions, Kentucky cannot make any live television 
appearances this year and won't be able to participate in the Southeastern 
Conference or NCAA tournaments until 1992. Probation ends after the 1992 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Pitino had only three scholarships to offer this year but will be under no NCAA 
restrictions next year, meaning he can offer up to five for the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with such an array of constraints, Pitino asked for and received a 
seven-year contract -- worth a reported $5 million -- from Newton. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he was promised remodeled basketball offices, weight room and 
practice facilities. So old was the Memorial Coliseum locker room, that the 
same hook Newton used to hang his clothes when he played at Kentucky in 1951 
still was being used in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Pitino considered the program's possibilities and told Newton he had a deal, 
thus ending a four-month courtship that had begun with a simple no. 
</P>
<P>
"(Newton) called me probably sometime in February and told me he had four 
people he was going to talk to: Mike Krzyzewski, Lute Olson, myself and Pat 
Riley," Pitino said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought to myself, 'Well, you're oh for four right off the bat.' I knew I 
wasn't leaving. I knew Pat Riley wasn't going to leave the Lakers, that Mike 
Krzyzewski certainly wasn't going to leave Duke and I wondered, you never know, 
if Lute Olson possibly may be interested in it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told (Newton), 'Thank you very much,' but I just wasn't interested in 
leaving the Knicks." 
</P>
<P>
Newton persisted. 
</P>
<P>
Pitino suggested he consider Seton Hall's P. J. Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
Newton did but decided to work on Pitino instead. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, when the playoffs are over, I'll come visit," Pitino told Newton. 
</P>
<P>
And? 
</P>
<P>
"I came here to visit and I just fell in love with the potential of the place," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
There were other factors. Pitino didn't consider his efforts fully appreciated 
in New York. He helped turn around a struggling franchise in two seasons, but 
still he heard the occasional remarks concerning his coaching style (too 
rah-rah, critics said) and his playing scheme (too heavy on the press and 
three-pointers). Nor did Pitino get along well with Knick General Manager Al 
Bianchi. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have never left Providence, in hindsight," Pitino said. "Though my 
experience in New York was invaluable, I should have never left Providence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an emotional time for me. It was a thing that if you're a New Yorker 
and you grow up 10 streets away from Madison Square Garden, how do you turn 
down the New York Knicks' job? A year later, the Providence job reopened, and I 
was offered the job to come back. In hindsight, I felt that I couldn't do that, 
but that's what I should have done. 
</P>
<P>
"When this job opened up, I just wanted to get back to college basketball at 
that point. And there's no finer place to go than Kentucky if you're going to 
come back to college basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Pitino's impact has been immediate and noticeable. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Without a player taller than 6-foot-7, the Wildcats have won with a 
stifling defense and an offense that specializes in the three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-man rotation works only because Pitino ran the Wildcats in their 
preseason conditioning drills until they dropped . . . or worse. A large 
garbage can strategically placed near courtside was a multipurpose container. 
</P>
<P>
"It was basically for cups, but it wasn't uncommon to see someone hanging 
around there, if you know what I mean," said John Pelphrey, a forward who 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Kentucky traveled to Somerset, Manchester, Maysville and Frankfort for 
its traditional in-state scrimmages, Pitino took the on-court microphone and 
conducted a question-and-answer session with fans, as well as detailing the 
proper techniques for cheering. 
</P>
<P>
"In one year, he's gotten the crowd to do what cheerleaders have been trying to 
do here for years," said Chris Cameron, the school's sports information 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 -- During a practice session the day before Kentucky played North Carolina, 
Pitino organized a slam-dunk contest for his players, answered questions from 
the assembled fans and then invited everyone down to the court to meet the 
Wildcat players. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, he conducted a team scrimmage exclusively for Kentucky students, 
staff and faculty -- no general public allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitino actually put in some serious time at his own UK basketball camp, 
something of a first for the people used to the cameo appearances made by 
Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He appealed for the school's best musicians to try out for the pep band. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He happily agreed to include such state schools as Eastern Kentucky and 
Western Kentucky on future schedules, heretofore considered sacrilegious by 
Adolph Rupp, Joe B. Hall and Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize that Kentucky didn't play in-state schools before, figuring 
it had everything to lose and nothing to gain," Pitino said. "(Kentucky) wanted 
fans border to border. I said, 'That's ludicrous.' If they wanted to play us, 
we're no better than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 -- He already has plans to hang the jerseys of Kentucky's All-Americans from 
the Rupp Arena rafters, to attach plaques to each player's locker. Engraved on 
each plaque will be the names of previous UK players who wore that particular 
jersey number. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, in what amounted to the Kentucky equivalent of merging church and 
state, Curry was invited to appear on Pitino's weekly television show. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody made such a big deal about it," Pitino said. "I said I had him on 
for two reasons: one, to make him feel welcome; and, two, for the ratings." 
</P>
<P>
Little things, but all designed to give Kentucky back some of its pride. 
</P>
<P>
Pitino can do little wrong these days. Kentucky fans loved it when Pitino, 
during a game against Indiana, told the game officials never to allow Indiana 
Coach Bobby Knight to intimidate them. And despite a later reprimand from the 
SEC commissioner's office, Kentucky followers weren't overly upset when Pitino 
nearly traded punches with Louisiana State's Dale Brown at courtside last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
So popular is Pitino that about 5,000 fans remain in their seats to watch the 
coach do his postgame radio show. One time, as forward Reggie Hanson walked 
toward an exit, Pitino called him over to the microphone and asked him on the 
air why the player was so well dressed. Hanson smiled nervously. 
</P>
<P>
"No, really," Pitino said. "Is this a big date or a regular date?" 
</P>
<P>
Pitino's workday usually begins about 5:30 a.m., when he and the rest of his 
coaching staff arrive at Memorial Coliseum for their daily pickup basketball 
game. According to Ralph Willard, associate coach and longtime friend, Pitino 
is the best player because of sheer will. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what he does, he wants to win," Willard said. "He has a real passion 
for what he does. Rick takes it to another level. He lives, breathes, eats, 
sleeps, drinks (basketball)." 
</P>
<P>
Willard, who coached with Pitino in New York, said his boss becomes so involved 
in games that he often returns to the locker room at halftime with shirt and 
suit coat soaked in sweat. Nor is it unusual for Pitino to become so enraged 
over a costly error that he turns to Willard and, in all seriousness, says, 
"You're fired." 
</P>
<P>
Said Willard: "Sometimes he doesn't even realize he said what he said. He's 
fired us a hundred times." 
</P>
<P>
It is a Pitino coaching tradition to have a cup of diet root beer or cream soda 
nearby at all times. It keeps his throat moist, allowing him to yell 
constantly. Last year, as the Knicks played the Detroit Pistons, Pitino reached 
for his cup and found it empty. His face filled with rage, Pitino turned to the 
team trainer. "What do you think I am, a camel?" he screamed. "Get me a drink!" 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since he began coaching college teams, Pitino is telling 
recruits that he will be there to see them graduate. It is his way of informing 
Kentucky that he has made an honest commitment to a program in dire need of 
one. 
</P>
<P>
At times, he misses New York, when he could dine at a restaurant and have to 
sign only the credit card receipt. The Knicks used to play in Los Angeles, 
Seattle and Chicago. Kentucky visits Starkville, Miss.; Tuscaloosa, Ala., and 
Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
It is a different life, complete with some local wise guy entrepreneurs selling 
hats that read, "Rick Pitino: Brought to you by Emery." 
</P>
<P>
The hats are gone, but Pitino remains. He said he plans to stay for a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever I've been, I've been happy," he said. "But my life is not the life of 
a normal person. My life goes as basketball goes. That may sound shallow, but 
it's true." 
</P>
<P>
And right now, life couldn't be better.

APARTHEID: THE PRISONER'S SELF-SACRIFICE SYMBOLIZED THE LIBERATION THAT HIS

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nelson R. Mandela, the inspirational leader of the black rebellion against 
apartheid, has become during more than 27 years in prison a figure of almost 
mythic proportions among South Africa's black masses, millions of whom have 
never heard or seen him. 
</P>
<P>
The name Mandela is a rallying cry for black youths born years after he was 
sent to prison. "Mandela is with us!" say the graffiti painted on the walls of 
South Africa's black urban ghettos. 
</P>
<P>
His picture appears on clandestinely printed anti-apartheid pamphlets, posters 
and banners. Songs are sung and poems written about him in the urban black 
townships, and children are named for him even in the most remote villages. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the symbol of our people," Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel 
Peace Prize winner, has said. "His imprisonment represents our oppression. His 
self-sacrifice is what we would all like to be in resisting that oppression. 
His release has come to symbolize the liberation that we are longing for." 
</P>
<P>
Since he was arrested in 1962, convicted and sentenced to life after one of the 
longest and most important trials in South African history, Mandela has become 
the primary unifying force in the deeply divided politics of South Africa's 27 
million blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion surveys of urban blacks have shown again and again that he is more 
widely accepted than any other leader. Even rivals of Mandela's African 
National Congress, the principal guerrilla group fighting white minority-led 
rule, have not dared to criticize him. 
</P>
<P>
Black leaders, such as Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, who split with 
the ANC more than 30 years ago, have repeatedly told the government that 
without Mandela, they will not enter negotiations to share political power with 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
"No black leader worthy of the name will negotiate while Mr. Mandela and his 
colleagues are in jail," Oscar Dhlomo, a Cabinet minister in Buthelezi's 
Kwazulu homeland government, said after talks between moderate blacks and the 
white minority-led government fell apart last May. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the only black leader still able to reach across the ideological divide 
in black politics," Dhlomo added. "His years in jail have molded him into an 
astute and impartial elder statesman who can play a decisive role in capturing 
black unity." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's refusal to compromise his principles has given him an unprecedented 
stature in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
His life was at stake when, charged with sabotage and attempting to overthrow 
the government -- capital crimes under South Africa's security laws -- he 
admitted leadership of the ANC's armed struggle and argued that the country's 
minority white government had given the black majority no option but violence 
to achieve equality. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, as international pressure has grown on the government to 
release him, Mandela rejected many government proposals that would have brought 
his release. He refused three times to accept banishment to Transkei, the 
nominally independent region of South Africa where he was born. He rejected 
exile, though he could have rejoined the ANC leadership at its headquarters in 
Lusaka, Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
And time and again, he has refused to forswear violence in the campaign against 
apartheid, because it would have meant backing away from the armed struggle 
that he started as commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, the 
military wing of the outlawed ANC. 
</P>
<P>
As Mandela pointed out at his trial, the ANC only reluctantly took up arms 
because 50 years of peaceful protest had failed to persuade the white 
authorities to remove apartheid and grant blacks equal rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Only free men can negotiate," Mandela declared in February, 1985, in rejecting 
a government offer to free him if he first renounced violence. "Prisoners 
cannot enter into contracts. . . . I cannot and will not give any undertaking 
at a time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your freedom and mine 
cannot be separated. I will return." 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide pressure on the South African government to release Mandela grew to a 
frenzy on July 18, 1988, when Mandela turned 70. A rock concert in London, 
televised around the world except in South Africa, was held in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
But the South African government banned all local celebrations and began to 
admit privately that it was being held hostage by Mandela's imprisonment. 
Release him, they feared, and he might lead a bloody revolution. But let him 
die in prison and widespread unrest would be the likely result. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, in August, 1988, Mandela contracted tuberculosis. He was 
transferred to a hospital and, after being successfully treated, to a suite in 
a private clinic to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
The country's white leaders, shocked by Mandela's illness, launched an 
elaborate plan to demythologize Mandela by "releasing him in steps," as one 
government official put it. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to wash away the mystique that, to a large extent, the government 
itself had created by painting Mandela as South Africa's most dangerous 
terrorist. Now, the government decided, was the time to show the world that it 
was removing Mandela's chains and giving him more freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Fully recovered from his illness three months later, in November, 1988, Mandela 
was transferred from the hospital to the Victor Verster Prison Farm in lush 
wine country near Paarl, about 40 miles from Cape Town. He was held in a 
three-bedroom house usually reserved for prison employees. A white cook and 
guard lived in the servants' quarters in the back. 
</P>
<P>
His visitation rules were relaxed and his wife, Winnie, previously restricted 
to 40-minute visits once a month, was offered unlimited visiting privileges. At 
first, she refused on the grounds that other prisoners were allowed no similar 
freedom. But soon Mandela was having lengthy visits, sometimes over lunch or 
dinner, with family, friends, current and former political prisoners -- and 
even high-level government officials. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1989, shortly before Mandela's 71st birthday, he met with outgoing 
President Pieter W. Botha, at the presidential mansion over tea. The government 
called it a "courtesy call" and said the two leaders had only discussed 
politics in broad terms, with both expressing their desire for peaceful change 
in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials had been meeting extensively with Mandela for 
years, but it was the first face-to-face meeting between the president and his 
most famous prisoner. It raised hopes in overseas capitals that Mandela's 
release, and negotiations between blacks and whites over South Africa's future, 
were near. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, though, Mandela, in his first officially sanctioned public 
statement since his conviction, said his position had not changed in 28 years 
-- that "the only way of ending violence and bringing peace to our country" is 
for the government to open a "dialogue with the African National Congress." 
</P>
<P>
But the government has refused to talk with the ANC until the organization 
renounces violence. And the ANC has refused to talk with the government until 
Mandela is freed, the state of emergency lifted and bans on anti-apartheid 
groups rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela added that his release "is not an issue at this stage. . . . I only 
would like to contribute to the creation of a climate which would promote peace 
in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
The government of President Frederik W. de Klerk, elected in September on a 
promise to lure blacks to the negotiating table, began to view Mandela as the 
key to opening that process. 
</P>
<P>
"He's someone the government feels it can talk to," said a political analyst 
privy to the thinking of De Klerk and his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Mandela was instrumental in obtaining the October release of 
seven ANC leaders, including Walter Sisulu and four others who had been 
convicted with him in 1964. Mandela watched De Klerk announce those releases on 
television in his prison living room, surrounded by Sisulu's wife, Albertina, 
and three other anti-apartheid leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In December, De Klerk met Mandela for the first time, and the black leader 
offered a lengthy policy statement entitled, "A Document to Create a Climate of 
Understanding." That document, the contents of which remain secret, is under 
study by the ANC's exile headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's carefully chosen words have long carried special force in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial in which he and seven other leaders of the ANC and the South 
African Communist Party were sentenced to life imprisonment, Mandela testified 
that he had dedicated his life "to this struggle of the African people." 
</P>
<P>
"I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black 
domination," he said then. "I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free 
society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal 
opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if 
needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die." 
</P>
<P>
That personal creed has echoed through the intervening years, becoming part of 
the political manifesto of South Africa's blacks, and transforming Mandela into 
a larger-than-life figure, a Moses who blacks think will lead them to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
He has been honored by the United Nations, European parliaments and human 
rights organizations. Universities have bestowed honorary doctorates on him, 
cities have named streets and parks after him and past winners of the Nobel 
Peace Prize have nominated him for the award. His face even appears on a 
postage stamp in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's refusal to compromise has been more than a matter of personal 
integrity. The government has tried to persuade blacks to work within the 
present political system, accepting advisory roles in the government instead of 
a one-person, one-vote system. Mandela's stand has made it possible for others 
to campaign not for the reform of racial segregation and white rule but for its 
abolition. 
</P>
<P>
"Many more people might have succumbed to this false promise of gradual change 
were it not for his example. Others, but for his counsel, might have rushed 
precipitously into revolution that would turn into a racial civil war that no 
one wants," said Patrick Lekota, a leader of the United Democratic Front who 
served five years on a treason conviction that was recently overturned on 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
While on Robben Island, a penal colony off Cape Town and for seven years at 
Pollsmoor Prison in the city's suburbs, Mandela trained two generations of 
cadres for the African National Congress and reshaped the outlook of scores of 
political prisoners, some of whom were ideologically opposed to the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know Mandela best are confident that upon release, he will at once 
rejoin the campaign against apartheid. But they describe him as a practical man 
who will also reassure the country's 5 million whites of his commitment to a 
nonracial society. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Suzman, 72, a leading liberal member of the white house of Parliament, 
has seen Mandela a half-dozen times over the years. After lunch with him at his 
prison quarters last summer, she described him as "an extraordinary man." 
</P>
<P>
"As always," she said, "I was impressed by his obvious leadership qualities, 
his moderation and his appreciation of the fear of the white minority. His 
unconditional release and his presence at the negotiating table is an absolute 
prerequisite to" peace in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike white people anywhere else in Africa, whites in South Africa belong 
here -- this is their home," Mandela told Samuel Dash, a law professor and 
former chief counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee, four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Mandela also made clear his determination to see apartheid ended 
completely, not adapted through the government's step-by-step reforms, Dash 
wrote in the New York Times Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"If white leaders do not act in good faith toward us, if they will not meet 
with us to discuss political equality and if, in effect, they tell us we must 
remain subjugated by whites, then there is really no alternative other than 
violence," Mandela told Dash. "And, I assure you, we will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
It was the same sense of conviction and reasonableness that he showed in 1964 
when he explained why he had turned to sabotage after two decades of nonviolent 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not deny that I planned sabotage," he told the court from the prisoner's 
dock. "I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness, nor because I have any 
love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of 
the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, 
exploitation and oppression of my people by the whites." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, born in 1918, was the eldest son of a chief of the Xhosa-speaking 
Thembu people in Transkei, and he was raised with the self-assurance of African 
royalty in the household of the Thembus' paramount chief. 
</P>
<P>
He studied at South Africa's Fort Hare University, where Zimbabwe's prime 
minister, Robert Mugabe, and other leaders of independent black Africa have 
studied. He was expelled for helping organize a student strike. 
</P>
<P>
He went to Johannesburg, worked for a time as a mine policeman and clerk, 
graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand and then became apprenticed 
to a white law firm before he established his own practice with Oliver R. 
Tambo, a friend from Fort Hare, who is now the president in exile of the 
African National Congress. (He earned a formal law degree in 1989 through 
correspondence courses.) 
</P>
<P>
In 1944, Mandela joined the congress, which had been founded in 1912, and with 
Tambo and other young men turned it from petitions for redress of blacks' 
grievances to protests on a broader scale. When the National Party came to 
power in 1948 and began to impose its apartheid policies on the country, the 
congress, under Mandela's and Tambo's direction, launched renewed campaigns of 
civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was at first given a suspended sentence for violating the country's 
security laws, then was silenced and restricted in his movements by a 
government "banning" order. Later, he was detained along with 155 others, 
charged with treason and, after a four-year trial that ended in 1961, acquitted 
along with the other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress was outlawed in the wake of the protests that 
followed the fatal police shooting on March 21, 1960, of 69 blacks engaged in 
passive resistance at Sharpeville, a black township about 50 miles south of 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
The congress then turned to sabotage and away from its campaigns of passive 
resistance that, following the example of India's Mohandas K. Gandhi, were 
aimed at pressuring the government to end apartheid and convene an all-race 
national convention to write a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was a central figure in this shift, drawing up the plans to establish 
the congress underground and becoming the first commander of its military wing. 
Sabotage was to be the strategy to disrupt the economy and scare away capital. 
But, to avoid loss of life, terrorism, guerrilla war and a full-scale rebellion 
were ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time, as it came in my life," he declared at his trial, "when a 
man is denied the right to live a normal life, when he can only live the life 
of an outlaw because the government has so decreed to use the law to impose a 
state of outlawry upon him. I was driven to this situation, and I do not regret 
the decisions that I did take." 
</P>
<P>
Slipping across the border, Mandela visited Ethiopia, Algeria and other African 
countries, arranging military training for congress members and undergoing a 
brief training course himself. His secret return to South Africa and his 
daredevil underground existence earned him the title of the "Black Pimpernel" 
and added to his romantic image among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
He was caught eventually, sentenced to five years in prison for incitement to 
violence and leaving the country illegally. While serving that term, he was 
brought back to court, charged with treason and eventually convicted of 
sabotage along with most of the Spear of the Nation's high command. 
</P>
<P>
This was to be the temporary end of Mandela and of the African National 
Congress. Most of its leaders were in jail or exile, and scores of its 
grass-roots members were arrested. Its guerrillas made occasional bomb attacks, 
but were usually caught quickly. The underground organization was heavily 
infiltrated by the police. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela, now 54, a social worker by training, took up the cause but was 
quickly "banned" herself, barred from politics and eventually exiled to the 
small farming community of Brandfort in the Orange Free State. She returned to 
Soweto in 1985, defying the government's restrictions, and was allowed to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Married 31 years, they lived together for only four months, and for only a few 
weeks at a time. For years, they were separated by thick glass when she made 
closely supervised visits in prison, unable even to touch. Not until 1984, when 
Mandela required surgery for removal of his enlarged prostate gland, did the 
whole family get together for the first time since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Their daughters, Zenani, 30, and Zindziswa, 29, have joined what is now a 
family cause, speaking and traveling on behalf of their parents. Mandela also 
had three children from his first marriage. One son, Makgatho, 39, runs a 
general store in the Transkei homeland, and a daughter, Makaziwe, 35, is 
working on a doctorate in anthropology at the University of Massachusetts. One 
son died in an auto accident several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
When he was first imprisoned on Robben Island, Mandela spent most of his time 
at hard labor, quarrying limestone, but through repeated protests he won 
permission to study and garden. In recent years, he has exercised vigorously, 
using an exercise bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
With daily newspapers, a radio, television and a steady flow of books and 
magazines, Mandela managed in recent years to keep himself fully informed on 
developments in South Africa and elsewhere. Until 1988, political discussions 
with other black nationalist leaders who were his cellmates were daily fare. 
</P>
<P>
Close friends said that although Mandela enjoyed the large house on the prison 
farm, he felt isolated and missed the daily contact of other prisoners, who 
were allowed infrequent visits. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's long incarceration did not, contrary to the expectations of the 
government, turn him into a non-person, forgotten by his supporters. Instead, 
his leadership image of self-sacrifice and refusal to compromise with apartheid 
has been enhanced to the point of legend.

PICTURE HERB RITTS AS THE KING OF LENSES; 
</P>
<P>
HIS COMMERCIAL WORK EARNS HIM UP TO $20,000 A DAY, HIS COFFEETABLE-BOOK SALES 
ARE BOOMING AND HIS EXHIBITIONS ATTRACT MOBS OF CELEBRITIES

<P>
There they were, actor Richard Gere and Lucite furniture sales rep Herb Ritts, 
out in the desert waiting at a gas station for a flat tire to be fixed. Ritts, 
who had just started taking photographs of his friends, picked up his camera 
and shot three rolls of film. 
</P>
<P>
Gere took the film to his publicist, the publicist got it to Mademoiselle, 
Esquire and American Vogue, and Ritts started getting checks in the mail. Never 
mind that he never studied photography, was using only natural light and was 
fooling with a camera with an automatic light meter. A little while later 
Mademoiselle sent him out to shoot Brooke Shields, a friend's friend connected 
him up with Italian Harper's Bazaar, and a star was born. 
</P>
<P>
That was 1979, and 11 years later, 36-year-old Ritts may well be the nation's 
hottest photographer. He commands $20,000 a day on commercial work, has 
contracts with such major-league magazines as Vanity Fair and Rolling Stone and 
exhibitions that start at his dealer, Fahey/Klein, on La Brea Avenue, then move 
on to New York, London, Japan and elsewhere. His publisher, Jack Woody at 
Twelvetrees Press in Altadena, says the rush for Ritts' two books -- at $60 and 
$65 apiece -- has rivaled that for Cabbage Patch dolls. 
</P>
<P>
Why Ritts? Why now? Part of his appeal is obviously society's eternal 
fascination with its celebrities. Prominent 20th-Century photographers from 
Edward Weston to Irving Penn to Annie Leibowitz have photographed stars, 
showing us Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich or Diane Sawyer, respectively, in ways 
we hadn't seen them before. 
</P>
<P>
As for the nudes that dotted Ritts' first two shows and filled his entire third 
show, says David Fahey, they're simply classics, "not manipulated or 
structured, just more or less focusing on the lines and reinterpreting the nude 
in a romantic, traditional way. . . . They're beautiful photos by an important 
emerging photographer who has done well in establishing himself." 
</P>
<P>
Ritts' collector base is very broad, Fahey says, and most people buy more than 
one piece. Screenwriter Franc Caggiano, for instance, has seven of Ritts' 
photos: "I have photographs of male bodies going back into the 1890s," says 
Caggiano, "and Herb's work sort of summarizes what male beauty is as we move 
into the 1990s. I have Mapplethorpe but he seems like the late '70s and early 
'80s, and Herb seems like what's coming up." 
</P>
<P>
Despite or perhaps because of his success, Ritts is often compared with Robert 
Mapplethorpe, and not always favorably. One dealer sniffs that Ritts simply 
"panders" to current tastes, while others say Ritts' nudes just capitalize on 
the Mapplethorpe boom. Ritts, in turn, denies the influence of Mapplethorpe. 
More likely, he says, is the influence of '40s and '50s photographer George 
Platt Lynes, who also photographed both celebrities and nudes, "and I think 
even Mapplethorpe was influenced by him." 
</P>
<P>
Voted "most likely to succeed" at both Paul Revere Junior High and Palisades 
High School, Brentwood-raised Ritts studied economics at Bard College, got into 
law school but opted instead for the family business of designing and 
manufacturing Lucite and acrylic furniture and accessories. He went to work as 
a sales rep and, he says, did well. 
</P>
<P>
But opportunity intervened. When in New York on a business trip, he showed his 
paper bag full of fashion prints to "the girl friend of a friend" who happened 
to work for Italian Harper's Bazaar, and, a few weeks later, big metal cases 
arrived from Milan full of men's clothes. And when he had to rent out rooms of 
his Hollywood Hills house to help pay the mortgage, one of the people he rented 
to just happened to be male model Matt Collins, whom he took out to Santa 
Monica and, with no assistant, no lights, no nothing, photographed under the 
pier in those great-looking Italian clothes. 
</P>
<P>
When Ritts started with his agent, Marysa Maslansky at Visages, in 1979, his 
fee was in the $750-a-day range. For the last six months, says Maslansky, his 
rate has been in the $20,000-a-day range, and that doesn't include buyouts and 
other rights, materials, expenses or his two assistants. Citing an average for 
such work at about $5,000 daily, Maslansky guesses Ritts could be the 
highest-paid commercial photographer working in the United States today. 
</P>
<P>
According to Maslansky, his clients today are mostly ad agencies, movie studios 
and record companies; "the top advertisers and fashion houses can afford him," 
she says. Calls come in from all the world, she says, adding that he can 
comfortably turn down work such as shots of a foreign-based recording star who 
was not only willing to pay those prices but fly to California for the shoot. 
</P>
<P>
Ritts employs two printers full-time at his Hollywood studio, a former ballet 
studio. There and on location, he does his fashion shoots and his portraits of 
such personalities as David Bowie, Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone or 
Shirley MacLaine. 
</P>
<P>
There's such an ingenuousness about Ritts as he shows a visitor his books, a 
recent magazine spread and even his house that it's easy to understand how he 
gets his photo subjects relaxed and cozy with him. He seems simultaneously 
embarrassed and thrilled about his gorgeous, newly remodeled home, and, during 
a tour of the place, he tosses off that he's now redoing a Malibu beach house 
as well. He refers to himself as "nerdy looking" in college, and he still is 
anything but glitzy with his tentative smile, glasses, slicked-back hair and 
black T-shirt, jeans, socks and loafers. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a great confidence as well. This is a man who can photograph 
Madonna in his own back yard, Mel Gibson in a parking lot and suggest that Sam 
Shepard wear Ritts' old black T-shirt instead of his own nice dress shirt. For 
a fashion shoot for the British publication Tatler, he came up with the idea of 
a hunting story, then eschewed male models for young aristocrats he shot on 
location. 
</P>
<P>
He still hasn't studied photography, but he clearly knows his photographers. 
His home is filled with photographs by such masters as Weston and 
Cartier-Bresson, Outerbridge and Man Ray (nearly all displayed on built-in 
ledges so Ritts can move them around easily). He was introduced to and then by 
Bruce Weber early on, and he numbers among his influences Edward Weston (for 
his "classic simplicity"), Helmut Newton (for his risk-taking), Joel-Peter 
Witkin (for his "daring eroticism") and Irving Penn (for his "continual 
strengths"). There's a wonderful Berenice Abbott photo of New York at night in 
his library. 
</P>
<P>
High-profile photographers such as Leibowitz and Ritts, much as Irving Penn and 
Richard Avedon before them, are well known for editorial and/or commercial work 
that brings in money as well as visibility. (Leibowitz' famous photograph of 
John Lennon and Yoko Ono is currently selling for about $7,000.) But dealer 
Fahey estimates that only about 100 fine arts photographers today can live off 
their work -- as compared with maybe 30 just five years ago -- and most 
photographers still teach, make frames, sell art or otherwise supplement their 
income. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, there are simply more photographers. At the Los Angeles 
Photography Center, director Glenna Avila says technical classes that used to 
attract three or four people are today drawing 45. The 500 photographers in 
their registry who want exhibitions compare with about 75 just two years ago. 
"In the past, we were doing more solo exhibitions," says Avila. "Now we do 
almost entirely group shows to accommodate demand." 
</P>
<P>
Even so successful a photographer as Leland Rice figures he gets only about 50% 
of his income from the sale of his work. The Berkeley-based artist says that 
although he may get $6,000 for a photograph, he gives half to his dealer, then 
subtracts the sizable costs of producing his large-scale color pieces. 
</P>
<P>
John Divola, a well-received local photographer whose work is showing at Jan 
Kesner's gallery, works full time as an associate professor at UC Riverside and 
says candidly, "I would have a hard time living on the money I make selling 
work. Any rational person thinking about a vocation would not choose fine arts 
photography." 
</P>
<P>
Ritts says even he is making no killing in the fine arts market. He is pleased 
about his gallery sales but says it isn't the money. "In a few days worth of 
advertising, I could probably make as much as I made from my half of the print 
sales in this show. And it takes a lot of time and effort to supervise (the 
gallery installation). The fact it does well is icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
The books are more icing. Both his shows have traveled extensively, timed to 
publication of his books, and publisher Woody say the two Ritts publications 
have been his best-selling books yet, despite their high prices. "Herb Ritts' 
Pictures," a $60 coffeetable-size book of celebrities and some nudes, went 
through three printings totaling 24,000. The second, "Men/Women," is smaller, 
composed of two books in an elegant slipcase, and has already gone through two 
printings at $65 each. 
</P>
<P>
Woody figures each will eventually sell as many as 40,000 copies. "When we ran 
out of the first printing, people were screaming," says Woody. "They wanted 
their books. It was kind of a frenzy." 
</P>
<P>
Turning the pages of each of his books very, very slowly, Ritts looks at his 
photographs of Sylvester Stallone or Jack Nicholson or a female nude with the 
affection of a parent showing photos of a newborn. Books, he says, have more 
permanence. He has two other books in the works, neither of which he wishes to 
discuss. 
</P>
<P>
Better to talk gallery shows. 
</P>
<P>
The 20 Ritts pieces in G. Ray Hawkins' 1985 group show (of Ritts and two other 
photographers) were portraits and nudes and were priced from $400 (for smaller 
work in an edition of 25) to $600 (for "murals" -- or anything over 16 by 20 -- 
in an edition of 12), says dealer Fahey, formerly director of the Hawkins 
gallery. Some of those pieces are selling today at $2,500 to $4,000, says 
Fahey, and "Fred With Tires," a popular piece in that show, now sells for 
$6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ritts' prices escalate during a show, which is not that unusual in this field. 
Says Fahey: "I make them reasonably priced until 20 of the 25 are sold, and the 
last five are way up there." 
</P>
<P>
The photographer's first one-person show was in November, 1988, and his second 
closed Jan. 13. That last show featured a cocktail buffet dinner for 50 before 
the official opening, and Fahey says guests included Tracy Chapman, Barry 
Diller, Elton John, Madonna, Matthew Modine, Nicholson, Pee-wee Herman, 
Stallone and David Hockney. Guests dined on chicken piccata, wild rice cakes 
with caviar and apple crisp, and Vanity Fair printed photographs of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the official opening. About 1,900 people showed up, Fahey says, 
adding that "at one point we couldn't get anyone in or out the door." 
</P>
<P>
Ritts' nudes also just showed in New York, where Etheleen Staley at Staley-Wise 
gallery says thousands showed up for that show as well. "Herb Ritts sells very 
well," says Staley. "He has a very big following, from students who get 
together their pennies to major collectors." 
</P>
<P>
Ritts went to London earlier this month for his Feb. 5 gallery opening at that 
city's Hamiltons Gallery, and Fahey says that as early as December, Hamiltons 
presold 25 pieces. In April, it's on to Tokyo's Parko Gallery, where Ritts 
reports that more than 15,000 people came to his last show. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 16 years I've been in the business, there is no other photographer who 
has sold as well or been received as well in this short a period," Fahey says. 
"He's a ferociously hard worker."

SIMON CALLOW, ACTOR WITHOUT WALLS; 
</P>
<P>
THE VERSATILE ENGLISHMAN RETURNS TO LATC TO DIRECT EDUARDO MACHADO'S JAZZ-BASED 
'STEVIE WANTS TO PLAY THE BLUES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The newspapers in England have called me a 'triple threat" Simon Callow said, 
pausing with amusement at what he thought was journalistic excess. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes. An American newspaper called the Englishman "the multi-active 
actor." Not exactly a phrase that rolls off the tongue, but fairly accurate 
when it comes to Simon Callow. 
</P>
<P>
For as lovingly as he holds the acting profession, Callow is not content to 
corral himself within any particular artistic role. The English stage is 
replete with people of many talents (the Oliviers of the past, the Kenneth 
Branaghs of the present), so Callow is following in a hallowed tradition. But 
he is held in unusually high regard by his peers: When playwright-director Alan 
Bennett was preparing his 1988 double-bill of one-acts, "Single Spies," he cast 
Callow as Guy Burgess in "An Englishman Abroad," and also had Callow direct its 
companion, "A Question of Attribution." 
</P>
<P>
It's not enough for Callow to convey his passion under the guise of a character 
(he has played everything from the title role in the original production of 
"Amadeus" to the title role in Goethe's seven-hour "Faust"). He also writes 
books about it. Two, so far: "Being An Actor," an eloquent, shamelessly 
personal tour through an actor's existence, and "Charles Laughton: A Difficult 
Actor," an equally personal biography, an actor writing about another actor. 
He'll focus on Orson Welles next. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive. But Callow likes to tackle plays, so he directs, and if a play he 
wants to stage happens not to be in English, he translates it. First, in 1986, 
was Jean Cocteau's "The Infernal Machine," at London's Lyric, Hammersmith 
Theatre, where he directed an idol of his, Maggie Smith. Then, in his first 
visit to the Los Angeles Theatre Center in 1987, Milan Kundera's wry comedy, 
"Jacques and His Master." 
</P>
<P>
Now he has returned to LATC to tackle something completely different, as 
director only: "Stevie Wants to Play the Blues," a jazz-based play-with-music 
by Eduardo Machado (who co-wrote the lyrics with composer Frederic Myrow). It 
opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In his New Yorker review of "A Difficult Actor," David Thomson remarked that 
this "headstrong outsider . . . is ready to go over the top, eager to be 
carried away . . . He is that rarity in the theater, a passionate enthusiast 
ready to challenge the institution -- no friend to the cult of directors, no 
meek member of the company." 
</P>
<P>
In person, whiffs of that passion come off him like a breeze cutting through a 
canyon. At the appointed time for an interview, he was still intensely in 
rehearsal for a few more minutes. It wasn't a matter of not letting the actors 
go for their evening break, but getting points across. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the LATC rehearsal room emptied and Callow, sitting erect at a table, 
almost shed adrenaline during an interview. Between his keen, quick responses, 
he puffed his way through several cigarettes. When he was done with them, he 
placed the butts on end and in a row, like miniature Roman columns. This seemed 
to be a man who wants to get somewhere fast, and on the mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I like being extended and stretched. I first became an actor in 
order to escape from myself and to explore as many sides of myself as 
possible." After 20 years of acting, the 40-year-old Callow recognizes that his 
lack of matinee-idol looks -- an expressive face that can range from a bullying 
cad to a tortured poet -- has placed him in the character-actor slot for 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
He's down the credit list, for instance, in Mike Nichols' upcoming summer 
release, "Postcards From the Edge," which stars Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine, 
Gene Hackman, Richard Dreyfuss and Dennis Quaid. Past films include "The Good 
Father," "Manifesto," and, most memorably, two Merchant/Ivory films, "A Room 
With a View" and "Maurice." 
</P>
<P>
"If I had been of a physical type or in the proverbial right place at the right 
time," Callow said, "I might have just acted. The desire to write was in me 
before the desire to act. I didn't realize that I needed to live a life before 
I could really write." 
</P>
<P>
The impulse to stretch out was also complicated by another experience some 
actors can't avoid -- playing a role that spoils you for any other role. "It 
happened to me five years ago, when I played the gay character in (Manuel 
Puig's) 'Kiss of the Spider Woman.' It depicted love in the most unlikely 
situation (a prison cell), and enabled me to draw upon my own homosexuality as 
I never had." 
</P>
<P>
It was about this time that Callow moved into directing. "It was very daunting, 
at first, facing Maggie Smith for 'Infernal Machine,' but she wanted to be 
directed." That's a far cry from the anecdote Callow relates in "Being an 
Actor," in which he quotes Ralph Richardson: "My idea of a director is a chap 
who puts me in the middle of a stage, and shines a bright light on me." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really a novice as a director," Callow insisted, "but I know a lot about 
how it works. The first thing one has to do is create a collaboration. It seems 
that because I've written about these things, American actors tend to treat me 
like an expert. They have a weakness for experts. They might hear me as one, 
but I try to break that kind of barrier down right away." 
</P>
<P>
He reported with a little astonishment how his "Stevie" cast "has approached 
the play as an entire piece, rather than looking for any personal advantage. 
They've even volunteered to cut lines if they don't think they serve the play." 
</P>
<P>
Callow came across sterner in his assessment of British actors. "It's not all 
their fault that there isn't the across-the-board quality in a cast that was 
once typical. It used to be that a young actor learned his craft slowly; now, 
the British repertory system is dying. We're full of young firebrands now." 
Including the most fiery of them all, Kenneth Branagh, who is now at the Mark 
Taper Forum -- just a few downtown blocks 
</P>
<P>
away from Callow -- with his Renaissance Theatre Company's productions of "King 
Lear" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream." 
</P>
<P>
Callow acknowledged Branagh's "confidence and managerial flair." He granted 
that, for a Thatcher-era actor-manager forced to turn to corporate support when 
the government well has dried, "Branagh's instincts are very good, better than 
the Royal Shakespeare Company's, mine, anyone's. He reaches young audiences 
with lively, young productions." But Branagh reminds Callow of John Gielgud's 
dictum that "it takes 25 years to make an actor. He's not there yet. (Because 
of that,) he presents a dangerous model for the future." 
</P>
<P>
When the obscure jazz pianist Billy Tipton died last year, playwright Machado 
took notice, for Tipton had posed professionally as a man while concealing his 
real identity as a woman for more than 30 years. It was a good idea for a play, 
which nevertheless wouldn't be "The Billy Tipton Story." In February of last 
year, Machado and Callow began collaborating. 
</P>
<P>
In Machado's music-driven drama, Stevie (played by Amy Madigan) wants to play 
in a big-time jazz band, led by a Billie Holiday-type singer named Ruth (Paula 
Kelly). "Stevie is becoming someone else in order to become an artist," Callow 
noted, "while Ruth is living in order to be an artist. Stevie is the 
classicist, adopting the proper persona, and Ruth is the romantic, whose art 
cannot be separated from life. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Ruth, the band is nothing -- a fact she knows but that the rest refuse 
to acknowledge. The play is about jazz, and at the same time, is jazz. It's 
structurally built-in," said the director, who has written of his propensity to 
think in musical terms. His LATC staging is taking the jazz performance concept 
to the hilt: The actors will play their instruments, live. 
</P>
<P>
"Jazz players take off so freely from the tune," Callow said admiringly, "that 
it becomes a very powerful attraction and metaphor for the actor." The creative 
team for "Stevie," Callow revealed, has drawn not only from jazz, but from the 
film noir style of the '40s and '50s and the work of a film noir devotee, the 
late German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder. 
</P>
<P>
"So we have this very curious mix going on: A Cuban-American playwright and a 
British director working with American actors, all of us influenced by a German 
tone and style." 
</P>
<P>
Callow couldn't explain how he navigates through such mixed waters, but the 
rush he exuded just talking about it said enough. 
</P>
