NEWSMAKERS: LETTERMAN SHOW WILL FEATURE ENTIRE CAST OF HAMLET

There won't be much going on in Bolan, Iowa, on March 1. That's because all 16 
people who live there will be in New York for an appearance on NBC-TV's "Late 
Night With David Letterman." None of the residents of the northern Iowa town, 
which is not even on some maps, have been to New York. But most are vaguely 
familiar with Letterman. "If he's looking for American Gothic, I think he's 
going to be disappointed," said resident Daryl McCready. "We don't exactly have 
hats and pitchforks. We know what's going on in the world." The town located 
about 130 miles north of Des Moines has been in the news before. It got some 
attention during its centennial celebration when spectators walked around the 
parade because the town is so small. Residents will fly Feb. 28 to New York. 
The show will be taped and broadcast March 1. NBC is paying expenses of the 
trip. "I just hope someone there will meet us at the airport. Could you imagine 
the headlines: 'Little Town Gets Lost at Airport,' " joked resident Linda 
Nydegger.

 -- Kitty Dukakis' father reports that she is doing well at an alcohol 
treatment center. "The mail has been tremendous," Harry Ellis Dickson told the 
Boston Herald after a visit to Edgehill Newport, a private treatment center in 
Rhode Island. "Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush both wrote warm, encouraging 
letters . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Blue Moon detective agency had a real case of the blues as ABC 
announced that "Moonlighting," its ratings down 14.2% from last season, will be 
going on hiatus for an unspecified time. The series will return with Cybill 
Shepherd and Bruce Willis in new episodes at some point, the network promised. 
But as of Feb. 28, ABC is moving its new hit "Roseanne" into the 9 p.m. Tuesday 
time slot to try to win back viewers. SHIRLEY MARLOW

AL MARTINEZ: BLAME IT ON THE GERMANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sexual reproduction was begun 900 million years ago in the steamy swamps of 
Africa when life evolved beyond the cheerless existence of the single-celled, 
self-fertilizing protozoa. Modern public nudity was begun about 100 years ago 
in Germany as a protest against the rigid moral attitudes of the 19th Century. 
We're still trying to figure out how they correlate. Which brings us to 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
I approach the subject of sex, nudity and Burbank with some trepidation due to 
an uneasy feeling they have never been mentioned together in the same story in 
the L.A. Times. However, I feel there is a need to bring them into the open 
today in order to explore the deeper meaning of Burbank's new ordinance making 
it illegal to appear unclothed in public for any reason. The law takes effect 
March 3. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, I am not one of those preoccupied with either sex or nudity, 
having progressed beyond basic function into an age bracket that includes 
something other than an endless quest for erotic gratification. Mama convinced 
me years ago that sex gives you pimples, and although I later discovered it was 
fried foods that was the problem, I'm still nervous about it. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, Burbank's law was inspired by a lone man who ran naked down an 
alley last year, which demonstrates with what efficiency municipal government 
responds to any form of public nudity. Had there been a hundred starving, fully 
clothed homeless families in the alley they'd still be there. But because a 
streaker exposed his genitalia, we've got a new law on the books. That's the 
way it goes in a town that once seriously considered adopting Mickey Mouse as 
its logo. 
</P>
<P>
The streaker was arrested and then released when it was determined by methods 
not mentioned that his run was meant to be, well, fun-loving and not sexual in 
nature. State law controls nudity with sexual intent but says nothing about 
running around sans clothing for the sheer jolly hell of it. Hence the Burbank 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
I discussed all of this with the town's No. 1 booster, a kinetic ex-rock 'n' 
roll disc jockey who calls himself Mr. Burbank. His name is Don Baroda, and he 
runs a shop that turns out Ollie North T-shirts and "I Love Burbank" bikini 
panties, among other cultural artifacts. The business keeps Baroda almost 
perpetually on the phone with people named Steve-o-reeno and Lenny-baby, but he 
somehow always manages to talk about what a swell city Burbank is. 
</P>
<P>
Baroda sells Burbank the way Jimmy Swaggart sells God, with a passion difficult 
to convey in nonvisual form. He'll tell anyone willing to listen that Debbie 
Reynolds once lived in Burbank and loved the town, and then sing a hymn to the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes," he said the other day, "I call a customer in Minneapolis in the 
middle of winter and talk about our balmy breezes and the sun kissing my face." 
He hasn't done that lately because of our own inclement weather, but you get 
the idea. The man is a walking travel brochure. 
</P>
<P>
When I finally edged him away from an oral dissertation on Burbank as a 
metaphor for America, we discussed nudity. Mr. Burbank is for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm outraged by the law," he said in between phone calls. "Does this mean I 
can't pop naked into my hot tub if the old lady next door can see me through 
the lovely birds of paradise in my yard? Exactly what is public nudity?" 
</P>
<P>
In the next instant Baroda was on the phone to Mayor Al Dossin ("Al-baby") 
demanding to know whether his naked dips were illegal. Mr. Burbank had even 
obtained a copy of the ordinance on which he had underlined words employed by 
the city to clarify what not to expose along Magnolia Avenue. Assured by 
Al-baby that his dips would not even be noticed much less halted, Baroda 
thanked the mayor but continued to insist he was going to test the law. 
</P>
<P>
I tried to engage him in a more profound discussion of nudity as it related to 
sex but that only reminded him of the elderly lady from Glendale who stole a 
prototype flasher doll he was planning to market. "Why would she do that?" he 
wondered. "That's Glendale for you." One can only guess how the flasher doll 
would have related to his "I Love Burbank" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
My conversation with Baroda didn't add much to the current dialogue on public 
morality, but it reveals there is at least one prominent citizen willing to 
engage in civil disobedience to test a law he doesn't agree with. Keep watching 
for a kinetic Burbank-booster streaking in puris naturalibus down a back alley 
when the weather warms and the sun once more kisses the face of the city Debbie 
Reynolds loved.

A FREE-WILL DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KNBC has done the public a service by broadcasting more of the videotaped 
altercation between two black activists and two white policemen in Long Beach. 
The broadcast should help the investigations being conducted by the Long Beach 
Police Department, the FBI and the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Jan. 14; two white policemen stopped two black men in an 
older car; at the end of the ensuing altercation one of the policemen appears 
to have smashed one of the men, Don Jackson, into a plate-glass window. By 
agreement with Jackson, who said he was tryingto expose police brutality, NBC 
videotaped the whole incident and broadcast parts of it on national television. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC broadcast those parts and more in its "News Conference" program Sunday 
morning in the context of a discussion of the incident that included Jackson 
and a representative of theLong Beach Police Officers Assn., which had asked to 
see the unbroadcast portions of the tapes.An attorney for the association, 
Michael Hannon, said he was satisfied that all relevant portions had been seen. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to note, by the way, that NBC broadcast the tapes of its own 
will and not under duress from any of the parties to the litigation that has 
arisen from the incident. NBC, like this newspaper and nearly all other 
newspapers and broadcasters, believes that the constitutions of the United 
States and of California generally forbid courts to require the release of 
unpublished notes, photographs or tapes. This prohibition, which at a casual 
glance may seem unduly restrictive, is necessary to an unfettered press, for 
otherwise courts, police, defendants and other parties to lawsuits would tend 
to use the press for their own ends, and its reputation for disinterested 
objectivity would be imperiled. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast tapes tend to reinforce our previous impressions of the incident: 
that after the two policemen stopped the car, one of them overreacted to 
Jackson's distinctly unmeek response, and did in fact push his head through the 
window. The investigation will establish the facts; the larger question to be 
answered is whether, as Jackson claims, the roust on Pacific Coast Highway was 
"consistent with a pattern of abuse and excessive force" by Long Beach police.

CONGRESS VOTES NO ON PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am more and more convinced our government could best be improved, not by pay 
increases, but with only one elected term of six to eight years, with one-third 
or one-fourth of the legislative body replaced every two years. A retiring 
representative could choose to run for a Senate seat, or vice versa, accept a 
government appointment or otherwise serve, but never run for reelection to the 
same office. 
</P>
<P>
We don't need lifetime politicians! We need people who want to serve our 
country without concern of "special interest groups" to be reelected. Rather 
than 94% of incumbents returning (who really has a chance), new faces with new 
ideas could invigorate our governing bodies. Perhaps "crisis" government would 
finally end. I would also carry this one-term policy to state, city and county 
governments.

CONGRESS VOTES NO ON PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was glad to see Congress vote against its pay raise. It restored my faith in 
the "by the people, for the people" theory of government. Congress does listen. 
</P>
<P>
I do believe, however, that our servants in government are underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
The solution? A 50% raise in pay by raising your hand and saying aye? Well, 
that seems a little unrealistic. But why not that same percentage spread over 
four or five years? 12.5% a year is much easier to swallow, for me anyway. 
</P>
<P>
It seems time is the real reason. Some members wouldn't see the full amount of 
increase. But what better way to show the voters their true motivations in 
seeking public office? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that is the real problem.

CONGRESS VOTES NO ON PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Congress has seen the errors of its ways and has rescinded the pay 
raise so generously offered up by the Cutler Commission, it is time to examine 
the phenomenon which has developed in Washington that is government by 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
Today, whenever Congress or the White House does not want to take the heat for 
proposing unpopular policy, they simply appoint an "independent, blue-ribbon" 
commission to "study" the matter and make a "recommendation." As we have seen 
in some cases, a recommendation can simply become law unless Congress votes 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, when Congress and President Reagan wanted to close military bases 
around the country, they ducked the responsibility and appointed a commission. 
When affected communities throughout the country voiced protests, our 
legislative and executive branches were able to wring their hands and adroitly 
point toward "the commission." 
</P>
<P>
For months now, we've been hearing about something called the National Economic 
Commission. This "bipartisan" body has been charged with coming up with ways to 
cure our deficit ills. The scenario will be something like this: Congress won't 
be able to discern anything meaningful from the lips of President Bush and the 
good old NEC will step in and speak for all of them. Guess what they're 
recommendation's gonna be? (See: raise taxes.) 
</P>
<P>
While we're talking reform regarding the legislative process, we should not 
pass on this opportunity to stop our "representatives" from abdicating the 
responsibility they were elected to discharge. Conferring such power of 
governance upon unelected, amorphous bodies such as these silly commissions 
makes the best case imaginable for denying these slackers the raises they've 
whined about.

'SIGNALS ON ARMS CONTROL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your Jan. 29 editorial "Signals on Arms Control" suggests that the Bush 
Administration's recent rhetorical "signals of restraint" on the strategic 
defense initiative marks a "bold departure from the traditional White House 
approach to arms control." In point of fact unilateral arms control has been a 
periodic component of U.S. policy. However, its ability to induce Moscow to 
respond in kind is mixed. 
</P>
<P>
On the down side the Soviets never reciprocated U.S. decisions not to deploy 
ABM, IRBM's in Europe, anti-satellite weapons and a 1969 moratorium on the 
production of chemical weapons. On the up side U.S. unilateral actions not to 
orbit nuclear weapons in space (1962), not to test nuclear weapons in the 
atmosphere (1963), to cut production of high enriched uranium (1964), to 
withdraw troops from Europe (1964) and to cease production of biological 
weapons (1969) served to spark Soviet reciprocation that in some cases was 
consummated in formal conventions. Often the motive behind these initiatives 
reflected more a military or other inutility of the phenomenon restrained than 
an effort to contain the arms competition generally. Thus Washington cut back 
the production of high enriched uranium because it had an overabundance; it 
ceased atmospheric nuclear test in response to environmental concerns knowing 
that it had an underground testing alternative; it stopped producing biological 
weapons because battlefield use was impractical. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has played a greater role in unilaterally restraining American arms 
than The Times suggests. During the Reagan years, in addition to slowing 
development of anti-satellite systems, Congress withheld funds for the MX and 
later limited its numbers, fought for a narrow interpretation of the ABM 
treaty, cut allocation requests for SDI and postponed testing of a 12-warhead 
Trident II. 
</P>
<P>
Whether, as The Times implies, unilateral initiatives will be materially more 
fruitful in controlling arms in the current Soviet-American detente than 
heretofore is a matter worth exploring. However, we must concede that along 
with apparent advantages -- namely, avoidance of prolonged negotiations -- 
unilateral restraint is no panacea. Because it is not subject to verification, 
cheating is easier than codified arms control. And because it is not embodied 
in a treaty, it is more easily reversible.

CENTRAL CITY WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any "big plans" for downtown's Central City West must include some 
acknowledgement of its historic importance to Los Angeles ("Downtown 
Neighborhood Awakening to Big Plans," Part I, Feb. 3). Oil from beneath this 
neighborhood fueled the city's first industrial boom in the 1890s, and provided 
hundreds of men and women with the opportunity to "strike it rich." Even though 
the area's distinctive wooden derricks are gone, the mix of Victorian houses 
and oil wells remains largely intact today, and the wells are still maintained 
by family-run operators. 
</P>
<P>
If Councilwoman Gloria Molina and her constituents proceed with foresight, 
Central City West will be not only a nice place to live, but also a poignant 
reminder of Los Angeles' modest beginnings.

STALEMATE IN THE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We should be clear on one point before getting into a discussion of 
negotiations involving the teachers' union: Teachers are entitled to more 
money. They perform a vital mission for society at wages that simply do not 
reflect the value of their time, energy and intellect. The Los Angeles Unified 
School District offers to pay them 8% more this year and a total of 20% more 
over the next three years -- generous by any standard except perhaps as a 
measure of a teacher's ultimate worth. Yet no agreement on a new contract is in 
sight. The reasons are diverse and complex. 
</P>
<P>
Under the school district's offer, beginning teachers, who now earn $23,440 a 
year, would see their pay go to $25,316 now, $26,326 next year and $28,427 the 
following year. The school administration points out that these salaries would 
make Los Angeles teachers among the best paid not only in this area but also 
among large districts in the state and in the nation. The United Teachers of 
Los Angeles union wants beginning teachers to receive an 11% raise now, taking 
them to $26,000 immediately, and adding 10% more next year. 
</P>
<P>
The union says that the school district is inflating the cost of its contract 
offer. The school district says that it will have to cut $100 million from 
existing programs and services if its latest offer is accepted. It may take an 
independent fact-finder to get to the bottom of that. The district has 
identified as areas for possible cuts items ranging from junior-high humanities 
programs to the cars that the district supplies for top staff and board 
members. It would be an important symbolic gesture if the district switched to 
paying mileage and had its officials use their own cars as teachers must do, 
but it would not go far in paying the bills. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have produced some progress.The school district is offering a 
larger increase than its original proposal of 5.6% in the first year; the union 
has come down from its opening request of 12% the first year, and is now 
talking about a two-year contract instead of a one-year pact. The union does 
not want to lock teachers into lower salaries for longer than that because the 
state's financial condition may change and allow larger raises. The district's 
request for a three-year contract would mean that schools could avoid for a 
while longer upheavals like the one that they now are going through, and that 
makes sense. It shouldbe easy to write a triggering mechanism into the contract 
so that the agreement could be reopened if state revenues were to go up sharply 
or the Gann limits on spending were changed. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Leonard Britton says that he will withhold paychecks from teachers 
who do notturn in student grades to the district by Friday. The union is going 
to court to try to stop him. This clearly isn't the main issue in the dispute, 
although it has gotten everyone's attention. It may well reflect teacher 
frustration at not being paid for performing duties that go beyond basic 
teaching, but neither side should have made it such a big issue. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is aggravated by the fact that three school board seats will be 
at stake in the city's April 11 election. While the current board will remain 
in office until summer no matter who wins, the election could produce a board 
more favorably inclined toward the union and toward more lucrative contracts in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
Parents are starting to voice some anger over continuing disruptions of 
schooling. Some of the hostility is directed at the school district for not 
paying teachers more money; some is directed at teachers because of their 
tactics. The schools need all the support from parents that they can get. 
Nobody benefits from such anger, no matter what its target. 
</P>
<P>
Many working parents will agree with the school district that a pay increase of 
8% is generous. They will consider equally generous the district's offer to go 
on paying all medical, dental and life-insurance benefits, regardless of 
increases in the price of those benefits, although the teachers point out that 
they won this full payment by the district in lieu of salary increases in the 
past. A good number of people, then, want teachers to be paid more but think 
that this offer sounds decent, given the circumstances. We agree. 
</P>
<P>
The next negotiating session is set for today. If there is no progress, the 
state mediator who is now guiding the process should call in that independent 
fact-finder. That report should lay out for the public just what money is 
available and what cuts can be made. This stalemate must end, and soon. Erosion 
of support among parents and legislators in Sacramento who pay most of the 
bills is one more problem that the public schools do not need.

Weyerhaeuser Co. is closing its milk carton plant in La Puente, resulting in 
the loss of 140 jobs during the next two to four months . . . A $23.3-million 
stock offering was launched to finance the purchase of the Mustang Ranch, east 
of Reno, America's largest and probably best-known legal brothel . . . 
Ashton-Tate Corp., Torrance, said its directors have adopted a shareholder

ART BUCHWALD: IT'S PUNCH-IN TIME ON CAPITOL HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has to be a solution to the congressional pay gridlock. Representatives 
and senators need more money and the taxpayer is adamant about not giving it to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
There are some people who are against the raise because they think it's too 
much. Then there are others who are against it because this is the first time 
in their lives that they have been in a position to turn down anyone for a pay 
increase. Consequently, they want to make the most of the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
My taxi driver is one of them. "I say no raise," he declared, as we started out 
for the office. "They get too much money anyway, and they don't do a thing for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"That's a harsh judgment, Rico. Many legislators work day and night, and then 
have to travel long distances on weekends in order to give the American people 
the best laws that money can buy. Would you prefer that they be paid the same 
wages as the workers at McDonald's?" 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to sneak the raise in behind our backs because they were too 
chicken to vote on it up and down. If Congress had come to me and said, 'Rico, 
we need this to educate our children and feed our families,' I might have given 
them the increase." 
</P>
<P>
"That's very good of you, Rico. How many raises have you handed out in your 
life?" 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't matter. I'm a good judge of character, and I know when someone 
should have a pay increase and when they shouldn't. I read the papers like 
everybody else. Besides, I never thought an across-the-board raise was a good 
idea. I'd like to see the lawmakers paid on a piecework basis. Members of 
Congress would be rewarded according to their level of production. If a 
legislator shows up every day on the Hill, he is given a standard fee. If he 
introduces a bill in Congress, he gets an extra amount for it, and if the bill 
is passed, he receives a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
"Would you give them anything for attending a PAC breakfast to raise money for 
their election campaigns?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, they would be on their own for all fund-raisers. At the same time I might 
offer them a fee for going to a prayer breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
"How much should they get for waging a filibuster?" 
</P>
<P>
"In that situation we would be very generous because it puts a lot of wear and 
tear on the body. I'd also pay piecemeal for those who give speeches on the 
floor of the Senate, but I would like to see a system whereby the person making 
the shortest speech gets the most money." 
</P>
<P>
"Would I be correct if I presumed that each time a representative voted, he'd 
get a stipend?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. I'd have the sergeant at arms sit at a table and pay everyone in cash as 
they came down the aisle." 
</P>
<P>
"Rico, I think you're onto something. No one has ever thought of compensating 
lawmakers for what they actually did -- not even Trotsky." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only way Congress is going to get a raise from me." 
</P>
<P>
"You're a good man and a fair man, but suppose they don't accept your plan?" 
</P>
<P>
"They have no choice. I don't think anyone has been fairer than I have to the 
people on Capitol Hill. But I can't justify throwing money away on large pay 
raises when there are so many potholes in this country still waiting to be 
filled."

ERMA BOMBECK: THAT VERY FIRST IMPORTANT VALENTINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am always saddened when adults take a simple holiday for children and screw 
it up. 
</P>
<P>
What began as a presentation of simple gifts to delight and surprise children 
around the Christmas tree has culminated in a woman opening up six shrimp forks 
from her dog, who drew her name. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition of little children wandering through the darkness in makeshift 
fright costumes on Halloween has given way to adult parties of such magnitude 
an entire industry has evolved to clothe them. 
</P>
<P>
It is small wonder that Valentine's Day struggles to remain a day for young 
lovers, a day when the human heart is made out of chocolate and naked cherubs 
defy the February chill to send out their arrows. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever adults speak of Valentine's Day, they go back as I do, to a small 
classroom in the second grade. They go back to Miss Dawkins, who put a box on 
her desk a week before. It is covered with red hearts made out of construction 
paper and ribbon of crepe paper. All week my classmates drop in their fistful 
of secrets. Everyone but Ray Deger. 
</P>
<P>
On Valentine's Day, just minutes before Miss Dawkins is to distribute the 
cards, Ray drops his in. My heart stops beating. Would the love I felt for him 
be returned, or would I be left to trudge through life alone, rejected, 
unloved? 
</P>
<P>
Miss Dawkins takes an eternity to pass out the valentines. The ones stacked 
before me hold no interest. There can't be more than two or three left in the 
box when she calls out my name. It is signed "Ray." My eyes dissect the card 
for hidden messages. There are two bears kissing one another, with three hearts 
poised above their heads. It says, "I Care for You." 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt in my mind -- I was one of the bears and Ray was the other 
one. Professionally, my eyes take in that there are no erasures or smudges, so 
the card is new, bought just for me. Sylvia Prishold points out later that his 
mother signed it. That's all she knows. It's his signature, all right. 
</P>
<P>
There have been other Valentine's Days, days of candy hearts and even roses at 
$80 a dozen. My children brought me homemade valentines that held awkward 
messages of love. My husband has showered me with all kinds of remembrances 
throughout the years celebrating his devotion. 
</P>
<P>
But the day will never again recapture that breathless moment when Miss Dawkins 
handed me the small valentine from Ray Deger declaring, "I Care for You." He 
had never spoken to me before that day, and he was never to speak to me during 
the four years we went to grade school together. 
</P>
<P>
The moment belonged only to a phenomenon called Valentine's Day.

THE DRUG CLINIC: CRACKING THE USER'S FACADE OF DENIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOSEPH A. PURSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Find a need and fill it" is a wise business maxim. "Figure out what people 
need -- and they'll buy it." That sounds logical, but the nation's need for 
alcoholism treatment went unfilled -- until relatively recently. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s I was sitting in a think tank with alcoholism treatment 
marketers and TV advertising consultants. Research had shown there was 
definitely a need for treatment out there. The question was: How do we fill it? 
In spite of regular ads in medical journals only 5% of the patients in 
alcoholism clinics were sent by doctors. The other 95% were being brought in by 
the police, the courts or angry spouses. 
</P>
<P>
"To educate doctors doesn't pay," the admen deduced. You can always tell a 
doctor -- but not much. Did we clinicians have any better ideas? 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes. Why not take alcoholism education to the people who live with the 
problem? 
</P>
<P>
Right! The ad men positively jingled. Sutton robbed banks because that's where 
the money was, right? The disease is all over so let's take our TV ads directly 
to the living rooms of America. 
</P>
<P>
We know that the average family consists of 1.8 alcoholics/addicts and four 
co-dependents (non-alcoholics who suffer along with them). So how's this for a 
30-second ad: An introduction showing signs and symptoms, such as personality 
changes and drunk-driving arrests. These things co-dependents already know. 
Then add some things they only suspect, like memory loss and decreased life 
span. Close the piece with hope ("treatment works") and flash the clinic logo 
on the 800 number. 
</P>
<P>
Now the admen were really getting into it -- scribbling, sketching, even 
ad-libbing new terms. To rattle "heartland puritanism" and shape up "bicoastal 
sophistication," let's dramatize the ads with high-pressure soap scenes. That 
will crack what clinicians call "denial," the thing that doctors, co-dependents 
and alcoholics/addicts hide behind. 
</P>
<P>
It worked with almost Pavlovian charm. After running ads for one month, 
America's alcoholics were hauled out of closets and dragged into clinics by 
guilty co-dependents. Why? Because the ads portrayed the co-dependents as 
contributing to the demise of somebody they loved -- or hated. The clinics 
filled up and multiplied. The nation went on a treatment binge. There 
definitely was a need and the treatment "industry" had found a way to fill it. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, there were angry objections to this invasion of America's 
privacy. These ads, it was charged, were not just titillating -- they were 
actually traumatizing people's emotions; the ads were exaggerating "minor" 
family problems. 
</P>
<P>
True, the ads that got the greatest response were the ones that evoked anger, 
fear and guilt. But, the ad guys countered, do you really think that these ads 
can scare an unhappy wife so much that she will label her errant husband an 
alcoholic, drag him to a hospital, spend their hard-earned money on expensive 
treatment -- and label herself a co-dependent, to boot? No, not unless there is 
a real problem. 
</P>
<P>
Why do hospitals advertise? To fill beds. Why are the ads successful? Because 
there is a need. How do the ads achieve their goal? By breaking through the 
viewers' denial and making them aware of their need. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it. Alcoholism and drug addiction are different from other diseases. 
If you have a headache, rash or hearing loss, you'll feel it, or you'll see it, 
or somebody will make you aware of it -- and 500,000 doctors are willing to 
treat it. 
</P>
<P>
Not so with alcoholism/addiction. That's a disease of denial: The addicts deny 
it, their families hide it, the neighbors suspect it, the bosses ignore it and 
the doctors mistreat it. 
</P>
<P>
We may not like it, but we might as well accept it. The real reason the ads 
work is because they tell troubled viewers what others (family, friends, 
bosses, doctors) should tell them, but won't. They play on anger, fear and 
guilt because that's where our soft spots are. And they invade our living rooms 
because, to paraphrase bank robber Willie Sutton, that's where the alcoholics 
are.

POLYUNSATURATED: A WELCOME WORD ON LABELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I would appreciate it if you would clear up something that has been 
confusing me. If I read a label on a food package and it says that it contains 
no cholesterol, is that the same as saying that it's low in saturated fat? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A food item may not contain any cholesterol and still be high in 
saturated fat. For example, baked goods that list either coconut or palm oil, 
or a hydrogenated vegetable oil, may be high in saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
When you check food labels, try to select items that contain more 
polyunsaturated than saturated fat, because polyunsaturated fat lowers blood 
cholesterol. Vegetable oils high in polyunsaturated fat include corn, soybean, 
safflower and sunflower oil. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have seen situations where a person is awakened at night to take some 
medicine, and I could never understand this. I know that when I'm not feeling 
well, the most important thing I want to do is to sleep, which I think does a 
person more good than any medicine. Can you explain why someone should be waked 
to take medicine or is it just foolishness? 
</P>
<P>
A: The reason medicine is taken at specific intervals is so that the proper 
amount can be kept in the bloodstream at all times. If there is too much, it 
may have an adverse effect on the patient; if there is too little, the 
medication may not do the job for which it was intended. Sometimes the exact 
intervals are not very important; when they are, however, the patient may have 
to be awakened. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, a little common sense never hurt anyone. I would not wake a patient 
to give him a sleeping pill so that he will be able to go back to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like some information about the drugs used to treat depression, 
especially their side effects. If these drugs work the way they're supposed to, 
won't the person want to take them all the time? To me, this means addiction. 
</P>
<P>
A: There are a number of medications that may be prescribed for depression and, 
compared with other drugs, they are rather safe. Moreover, these drugs are not 
addictive even if taken for prolonged periods of time, which may be necessary 
in some patients. 
</P>
<P>
Antidepressants, like other drugs, do have side effects but these are rarely 
serious. For example, the medication may result in drowsiness or cause the 
patient's mouth to be dry. One way to avoid these effects is to take the 
medication close to bedtime. This way, most of the side effects, if any, will 
occur while the patient is in bed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know that people can be allergic to drugs, but the only drug I ever hear 
mentioned as causing an allergy is penicillin. Why is penicillin singled out so 
much for causing allergies? 
</P>
<P>
A: The reason you so often hear of penicillin being implicated in drug allergy 
reactions is that it accounts for 90% of all such reactions.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RANCHITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mid-air explosion apparently caused the crash of a single-engine plane Sunday 
afternoon in the mountains near Ranchita, killing all three people aboard, the 
Federal Aviation Administration said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the victims were being withheld until relatives could be notified, 
said Lt. Bob Trevino, a spokesman for the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The plane left Palm Springs Regional Airport at 3:15 p.m. and crashed about 30 
minutes later, a Federal Aviation Administration employee in Los Angeles said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary investigation by the FAA, the four-seat Piper 
Comanche was missing its wings and tail section when it crashed a 1 1/2 miles 
west of San Felipe Road, which is 2 3/4 miles north of Julian. 
</P>
<P>
Area residents reported hearing an explosion at 3:45 p.m. Sunday before the 
plane went down. The wreckage was spotted by sheriff's deputies at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA said the plane lost its wings and tail and then went into a spin, 
crashing nose first into the rugged mountain area. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's and coroner's deputies removed some body parts Monday that were 
scattered up to 400 yards from the crash site. They were forced to call off 
their investigation because of snowfall and are scheduled to continue it today.

WITT CLAIMS A CITY BAN ON ASSAULT RIFLES MIGHT BE RULED UNLAWFUL, LEAD TO SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego City Atty. John W. Witt warned Monday that enactment of a local 
ordinance banning the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons "very 
likely" would be invalidated by a court challenge, leaving the city vulnerable 
to claims for damages and attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, differing with the legal opinion that supported passage of a similar 
ordinance in Los Angeles last week, reported that regulation of semiautomatic 
weapons is an area of law left to the state Legislature -- despite the fact 
that no specific state laws exist. Witt said that legal doctrine is known as 
"preemption by legislative implication." 
</P>
<P>
"Firearms control is solely within the province of the state Legislature, and a 
city ordinance would not be effective, and would, in fact, be ruled unlawful 
under the state of California Constitution," Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call for Official Ban 
</P>
<P>
Three San Diego City Council members last week called for passage of a local 
ordinance banning the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons such as the 
AK-47 rifle used last month in the slaying of five elementary schoolchildren in 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Wes Pratt, Judy McCarty and Gloria McColl cited the city's 
rapidly escalating homicide rate and gang violence, as well as their desire to 
send a strong message to state legislators about the need for regulating the 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Their proposal will be considered by two council committees Wednesday, but 
telephone calls to council offices are running heavily against the idea. 
National Rifle Assn. representatives expressed their opposition in a meeting 
Monday with McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly began hearings on the issue Monday. Three cities -- Los Angeles, 
Compton and Stockton -- have approved ordinances regulating the weapons in the 
wake of the Stockton slayings. 
</P>
<P>
In his memo, Witt said the Legislature, by enacting detailed law on which 
weapons may be possessed, has covered the field of law completely enough that 
"it is very likely" that a challenge would be successful. 
</P>
<P>
Should the San Diego City Council pass a law specifically banning the weapons, 
a legal challenge would "very likely" succeed on the grounds that the state had 
"expressly" reserved that area of law to itself, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
Witt also said in an interview that California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp has 
publicly stated that regulation of the weapons is a matter properly left to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City May Pay Court Costs 
</P>
<P>
Stressing his personal desire to control the weapons and send a strong message 
to state legislators, Witt nevertheless noted that, if the city lost a court 
case it could be forced to pay punitive damages and attorneys' fees. He noted 
that the council has officially gone on record in support of two pieces of 
state legislation that would regulate sales of the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Witt's memo appeared to directly contradict an opinion issued by Los Angeles 
Deputy City Atty. Henry G. Morris before passage of a Los Angeles ordinance 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
"While the matter is not free from doubt, since no provision of state law 
expressly prohibits localities from so regulating, we believe that a reasonable 
argument can be made in support of local authority to regulate possession of 
assault weapons," Morris wrote in a letter to the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"In our view, the sale of a firearm would be an aspect of control of 
possession, since the prevention of the sale of a weapon would preclude access 
to possession thereof." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the differing opinions, Witt said the Los Angeles council had 
"bowed to political pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gardiner, assistant general counsel for the National Rifle Assn., 
agreed with Witt's interpretation of the law. "It sounds like the city attorney 
has done a good job," he said. "We don't have to tell (the council members) 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Gardiner said the NRA will be supporting litigation testing the Los Angeles ban 
on possession of semi-automatic weapons. A lawsuit was filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, McCarty said the city should enact a law despite Witt's 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we have an emergency in this town," she said. "We have Elliott 
Nesses and Al Capones running around this town having a good time, and a lot of 
little kids are getting hurt." 
</P>
<P>
However, two council members, Bruce Henderson and Ed Struiksma, said Monday 
that they would oppose enactment of a local ordinance in the belief that state 
or federal laws are the only way to provide uniform control of the weapons.

EDITOR AT CHANNEL 39 RESIGNS OVER NEWS-POLICY DIFFERENCES

<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest in a long line of shake-ups at KNSD-TV (Channel 39), chief 
assignment editor Eric Hulnick resigned Monday, blaming differences in news 
philosophy with management at the NBC affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at the station portrayed Hulnick, chief assignment editor for four 
years, as a believer in "traditional" news who has been upset with the 
station's news direction for several weeks. He reportedly objected to the 
decisions not to actively cover certain stories, such as the David Lucas murder 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
The station was criticized last week for allowing reporter Paul Bloom to 
arrange for the arrest of a parole violator he had contacted on the pretense of 
conducting an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at home Monday night, Hulnick refused to comment on specifics of his 
decision, as part of an agreement he made with the station. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't agree with some of the things going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to one reporter at the station who asked not to be identified, 
Hulnick "had a different view of what is news. He's a traditional kind of news 
guy, and we're looking at a change of philosophy here." 
</P>
<P>
The station has laid off several reporters in recent weeks. Within the last six 
months, it has gone through a major identity change under new owner Gillett 
Communications, including changing the station's call letters and starting a 
variety of new programs. KEVIN BRASS

CULTURE COMMISSION CHOSEN TO APPROVE, DISTRIBUTE $5 MILLION IN CITY ARTS GRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLIARD HARPER, San Diego County Arts Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A once-fragmented arts allocation process was centralized Monday when the City 
Council approved a plan under which the 15-member San Diego Commission for Arts 
and Culture will evaluate all applications for city arts grants. 
</P>
<P>
The vote pertained to all but one element of a comprehensive evaluation 
procedure. That element -- whether the arts commission's funding 
recommendations go directly to the full council or are first considered by the 
Public Services and Safety Committee -- will be voted on in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the city doled out about $4.8 million in hotel-motel tax revenues to 
about 70 cultural institutions. With about $5 million in city grants at stake, 
the commission has already received 115 letters of intent from arts groups 
planning to file applications requesting a total of $11.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Manager Jack McGrory told the council members he is "confident of 
the quality of the funding recommendations" they will receive from the plan the 
commission hammered out over the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Multiple Dips Into City Funds 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, arts groups could apply for city funds either through the city 
manager, the City Council or the Combined Arts and Education Council of San 
Diego County (COMBO). Under the old procedures, arts groups sometimes double- 
and triple-dipped from city funds, council member Abbe Wolfsheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan provides for a four-point ranking system that will be applied to 
applications. The plan divides applicants into three main categories chiefly on 
the basis of budget size. A fourth category was established for one-time-only 
projects, such as a special event. 
</P>
<P>
Institutions with budgets larger than $2 million will be in Category I. 
Category II applies to groups with budgets between $100,000 and $2 million, and 
Category III includes cultural bodies with budgets of less than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Panels made up of commissioners and appointees will evaluate applications and 
send the scores, based on objective criteria, to a funding committee. The 
funding committee, made of commission members only, will recommend an amount to 
be funded, which will be voted on by the entire commission. 
</P>
<P>
All applicants must be nonprofit corporations that have been in business for 
more than one year. 
</P>
<P>
Before voting unanimously in favor of the new process, City Council members 
expressed various concerns to arts commission chairman Milton (Mickey) Fredman. 
Councilwoman Gloria McColl cautioned him to "guard" the process closely and not 
delegate it outside of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Overlook Neighborhoods 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor wanted to be assured that the commission will send 
music, dance and theater into the neighborhoods, institutionalize the city's 
triennial arts festival and provide special programs with the increased funding 
available in non-festival years to draw tourists. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the commission's public-art program, Fredman told the council 
that the city funding of that budget is declining and needs to be looked at. 
"We have very little funds in the public-arts budget," Fredman said. "Artists 
of national repute wouldn't be interested in coming into San Diego for this 
type of money." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts said that, while he too is concerned about creating 
programs that attract tourists, "even more important criteria in your 
evaluation are what this will do for the quality of life of the people who live 
here." He said he hopes San Diego will commission art in public places that "we 
will not be embarrassed by but be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
Fredman responded with a pointed reference to the council: "With public art, 
the main thing is the maturity of the people who are going to make the final 
vote."

1 HELD IN DEATH, 3 IN ROBBERIES OF OTHER ASIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old Hoover High School student who is believed to be part of a 
loosely knit Asian group of bandits is being held on suspicion of murder in the 
Feb. 2 death of a North Park man during a robbery at his home, San Diego police 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said they have also arrested three other people suspected of being 
part of the Indochinese group they claim is responsible for at least four 
vicious residential robberies. More arrests may follow, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the cases are linked," Detective Bob Lopez said. "There may be more 
suspects out there. My detectives are questioning suspects right now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shot Several Times 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tho Van Tran is being held in County Jail without bail on suspicion 
of killing Huy Tinh Le, 42, who was shot several times during the robbery at 
his home in the 4100 block of Polk Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Tran also is suspected in a series of brutal home robberies of Asian families 
in Southeast San Diego and Linda Vista, police said. The four robberies were 
committed over a three-month period beginning in December. In each instance, 
the robbers threatened the occupants and ransacked their homes in search of 
money and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
The three other suspects, who are being held in County Jail, are Tuan Van Tran, 
18, of the 4500 block of Orange Avenue, held on suspicion of three counts of 
robbery; Nghia Himh, 30, of the 3800 block of 43rd Street, and Hung Van Nguyen, 
22, also of the 3800 block of 43rd Street, both held on suspicion of robbery 
and possession of illegal weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, who is free on parole from the California Youth Authority after being 
convicted of robbery, was being held in lieu of $40,000 bail. Himh's bail was 
$35,000 and Tuan Van Tran's was $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
The three could face additional charges of murder and robbery, police said, 
adding that witnesses to Le's slaying will view the suspects in a lineup. 
</P>
<P>
All four suspects are believed to part of a loosely organized group, but are 
not connected to any known Indochinese gang, Detective Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Street Gang' 
</P>
<P>
"They are not a street gang," he said. "It appears to be a group of individuals 
who band together to commit crime." 
</P>
<P>
Tho Van Tran was arrested Saturday night by homicide and gang-detail detectives 
when he arrived home while officers were searching his apartment in the 4100 
block of Menlo Avenue, Lopez said. Detectives had secured a search warrant 
based on information from witnesses to the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested the other three men earlier that day after serving a search 
warrant at an apartment in the 3800 block of 43rd Street. During that search, 
detectives said, they found a .32-caliber handgun, a sawed-off .22-caliber 
carbine rifle, a stock .22-caliber rifle, a .44-caliber rifle, knives, a 
machete and a disarmed hand grenade. 
</P>
<P>
The four men are believed to have participated in all or part of the four 
residential robberies: on Dec. 16 in the 6800 block of Osler Street, Jan. 18 in 
the 4200 block of Thorn Street, Jan. 26 in the 2600 block of Gerald Court and 
the Feb. 2 robbery and killing. 
</P>
<P>
During the Jan. 18 robbery, a Laotian woman was approached by three Vietnamese 
men, who forced her at gunpoint to join her family inside the home, which was 
then ransacked. 
</P>
<P>
In the Jan. 26 robbery, police answered a call and found a Vietnamese couple 
who said they had been robbed by four Vietnamese gunmen who tied them up and 
blindfolded them. The thieves demanded gold and ransacked their house, 
destroying furniture and taking $400 to $500 in cash.

2 ARRESTED IN BEVERLY HILLS 'FOLLOW-HOME' ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police arrested two suspects early Monday in a Beverly Hills "follow-home" 
theft, the first arrests in connection with 32 robberies of luxury-car drivers 
that have occurred in affluent hillside neighborhoods of the Santa Monica 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills robbery was similar to those in the San Fernando Valley "but 
whether it is connected to any of the rest I can't say at this time," said Los 
Angeles Police Detective Patrick Conmay, head of a task force investigating the 
"follow-home" robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Conmay identified the suspects as Carluus Daily, 23, and Gina Morena, 20, both 
of south Los Angeles. They were arrested by Beverly Hills police soon after 
midnight near Doheny Drive and Dayton Way. 
</P>
<P>
They were booked on robbery charges and jailed at the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department substation in West Hollywood. Conmay said police will 
attempt to link them to the string of robberies in which bandits have made off 
with at least $312,000 in cash and jewelry since mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
About half an hour before the arrests, a 65-year-old man and his 63-year-old 
wife in a Rolls-Royce were accosted by a man with a gun in front of their home 
in the 700 block of Camden Drive. The robber took about $2,000 in jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Conmay said police recovered a handgun when the suspects, who were riding in a 
yellow Cadillac, were arrested about 15 blocks away. Conmay said he had not 
been able to link the car or the gun to the other robberies. No shots were 
fired, and no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery was the second "follow-home" incident of the weekend and the fifth 
in the last nine days. Friday evening, a 60-year-old man and a 53-year-old 
woman riding in a Cadillac were confronted in the carport of a condominium in 
the 18700 block of Hatteras Street in Tarzana. Conmay identified the robbers in 
that case as two black males in their 20s, at least one of whom had a gun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cash, Jewels Taken 
</P>
<P>
He said they took $10,000 in cash and jewels. The victims saw a black car drive 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two of the robberies have occurred in the Valley -- 12 in Encino and 
most of the others in the Santa Monica Mountains from Sherman Oaks to Woodland 
Hills. Ten have occurred in West Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers usually follow the drivers of luxury cars, most frequently 
late-model Mercedes-Benzes, to their homes. They then confront the drivers in 
their garages or driveways, frequently with pistols, and demand cash and 
jewels. 
</P>
<P>
Police last month issued descriptions and released drawings of two black men in 
their 20s thought to be involved in robberies. Additional robberies did not 
occur for several weeks, but resumed Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
As the list of "follow-home" robberies has grown, anxiety among residents of 
affluent hillside areas has increased. Some people said last week that they had 
begun driving circuitous routes and become quicker with electric garage door 
openers. Several women said they were driving less flashy cars so that they 
would not attract attention.

BURBANK STAFFING; 
</P>
<P>
AIRPORT BOOSTS SECURITY AFTER NEWS REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.W. McGARRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Airlines using Burbank Airport will increase security staffing for about 30 
minutes a night in response to a television news report that charged a loophole 
in security procedures could be used by a plane hijacker. 
</P>
<P>
In a report Monday night, KNBC-TV maintained that there was a dangerous 
security lapse because the screening stations, where metal detectors scan 
passengers for weapons, have not been staffed after the last outgoing flight 
departed about 9:40 each night. 
</P>
<P>
People entering the terminal could go to the boarding area without being 
screened to meet any of several flights that arrive before the airport ceases 
operations about 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
An airline security committee voted Monday afternoon to increase security after 
the station gave airport officials an advance look at its videotape. Metal 
detectors will be staffed until the last passenger has left the building, said 
Michael Kean, customer service manager for Alaska Airlines and chairman of the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lock Access to Runway 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, metal detector personnel will lock the access to the runway in 
the USAir terminal and the corridor leading to the boarding areas in the main 
terminal, Kean said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Federal Aviation Administration rules, the airport is responsible for 
providing police officers, but the eight airlines that use it are responsible 
for operation of the metal-screening checkpoint, airport spokesman Victor Gill 
said. Airport police remain on duty all night, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
The KNBC-TV report showed one of the station's cameramen setting off the metal 
detector's alarm with a hidden camera in a large shoulder bag and walking on 
unchallenged because the metal-detector workers had gone. 
</P>
<P>
The station suggested that the bag was large enough for weapons and that a 
hijacker could enter the boarding area, force his way onto the airfield and 
board a jetliner after it landed. It might also be possible, the report 
suggested, to hide a weapon in the boarding area to be retrieved before getting 
onto a plane the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The airport and the airlines were in compliance with FAA requirements, "which 
focus on screening boarding passengers," Gill said. Kean said the airport's 
security system "went through a two-week FAA inspection in December and we 
passed with flying colors." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't agree that the security of the system was compromised," Gill said. He 
and Kean charged that the TV station did not report that its crews had been 
stopped twice -- once by airport police and once by an airline employee -- 
while making the videotape, which purported to show that they entered the 
secure area unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC-TV news director Tom Capra disagreed. He said the airline employee merely 
"waved at" the crew, "like waving hello," and that the crew members were not 
questioned by airport police until after they had completed two nights of 
filming and had left the terminal.

REFLECTIONS: 'WE'RE CLEARLY NOT THE ZENITH OF EVOLUTION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Eugene Fields and his wife, Marsha, run a business in Thousand Oaks that 
changed its name and its clientele when Fields changed his philosophy. In 
addition to hair styling, Eugene Champs Transformational Gallery now offers 
books, crystals and New Age music. Fields and his wife live in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
When I was a kid, I was very aware of some kind of an energy that I felt came 
from the sky. I thought I was an atheist even though I believed in some kind of 
a power. I didn't want to call it God, because that's what organized religion 
called it, and that wasn't what I felt. 
</P>
<P>
I was a hippie when I was 16. I was anti-Establishment because I was upset with 
the racism, the corruption, the whole emphasis on making money at any cost. 
</P>
<P>
When we came out here from New York, we wanted to go into business for 
ourselves. We thought we'd better fit in, so I joined the Rotary and the 
Chamber of Commerce, and I was a diplomat. I had powerful friends talking about 
me running for mayor. I was very much a system player where I never was before. 
</P>
<P>
Then my mother sent me "Emmanuel's Book" because my middle name is Emmanuel. I 
sat down and I read it, and it altered my life. 
</P>
<P>
At first I was frightened of it because it was channeled. Channeling is getting 
in touch with your higher wisdom or disembodied spirits if they exist. It's 
like kind of weird, you know, and I didn't know if I could trust it because of 
what it proclaimed to be. But I wanted to believe it was true because it was so 
much of what I felt already. So I read it, and it really made things happen to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
For three days I had phenomena happening to me which were very strong. I tried 
to take a drag of a cigarette, and I had a gag response. I loved Camel 
cigarettes and I couldn't smoke the cigarette. I used to smoke quite a bit of 
pot. That left. I used to eat quite a bit of meat. That left. For me not to be 
able to do these things when I wanted to do them was a little disconcerting. I 
didn't want to tell anyone about what was going on because I thought maybe 
something terrible was happening to me. I was having visions. I was speaking to 
spirits. I was quite frightened. 
</P>
<P>
After a week I realized that these were all bad things that left and what came 
forward was a person that was in touch with his God. 
</P>
<P>
I was afraid to tell anyone about it because I was frightened at what this 
could do to my business. I found myself not able to keep it in because I had a 
vibration and a heat going up my back. It was like an electronic sound I could 
hear. 
</P>
<P>
The chair here was a place where I had people for an hour or two, and I could 
tell them, and they couldn't leave. It was like forced indoctrination. I got to 
feel like a broken record. 
</P>
<P>
We lost most of our clients. There was an almost 80% turnover. I didn't even 
realize it was happening. When I look at it, almost two years later, I can't 
believe I told the collective to buzz off, we want to attract spiritual people 
now. 
</P>
<P>
We have nicer people here now. We don't have people that are complaining and 
looking for something they can't have. We are very pleased. 
</P>
<P>
If man could see he is part of a universe of life, he would lose this 
egocentricity he has. When you've got thousands of crafts being spotted every 
year by people all around the globe, coming from someplace else, we're clearly 
not the zenith of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
It would be wonderful if they would expose themselves now, but space people 
don't want us afraid of them. When we can accept another reality, they will 
appear. It may happen in our lifetime. I'm looking forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
If UFOs are a phony thing, how do all these pictures get taken all over the 
world? Why is there secrecy about it? Why is it that every President has to get 
briefed two weeks before they take office and when they leave their hair is 
white? What do they find out? I'm sure there are extraterrestrials present, and 
that they're aware of it.

CSUN OPENS DISPLAY OF FORMER REP. CORMAN'S DOCUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A portion of the voluminous files of former Rep. James C. Corman, who 
represented the San Fernando Valley for 20 years, is open to the public at Cal 
State Northridge -- providing a window into the workings of Congress and 
residents' concerns during two often-turbulent decades. 
</P>
<P>
At ceremonies Monday announcing the documents' availability, CSUN officials 
hailed Corman's papers as a valuable source of first-hand material on the 
nitty-gritty of government, as well as watershed events between 1960 and 1980. 
They said the once-influential liberal Democrat's files are one of the 
university's largest collections of original research documents. 
</P>
<P>
"The most interesting part is the constituent files," said Tom Reilly, director 
of CSUN's Urban Archives Center, which is processing Corman's files. "It 
expresses the views of the people in the Valley over a 20-year period," 
including their feelings about former President Richard M. Nixon, taxes and the 
gasoline shortages of the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Corman, 68, has been a Washington lobbyist since he was narrowly defeated by 
former Rep. Bobbi Fiedler in 1980. During Monday's events, he and university 
officials familiar with the collection said the thousands of documents contain 
no personal or political bombshells. 
</P>
<P>
Corman donated more than 300 large packing cartons -- the equivalent of 500 
linear feet -- containing hundreds of thousands of memoranda, legislative 
notes, documents, speeches, newsletters, constituent letters, photographs and 
videotapes to CSUN in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In the years since, CSUN officials have raised $25,000 in donations for the 
laborious project of cataloguing one-fourth of the files, which took two years 
to complete, Reilly said. He estimated that it would take another $50,000 to 
$55,000 and three to five years before the rest of the collection would be 
available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Corman's papers span two decades that saw the first manned flight to the moon, 
the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, the landmark national study that 
followed the 1967 urban race riots, the Watergate impeachment hearings of 
Nixon, and battles over major welfare and tax legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"While in office, he was affected by some of the most significant events and 
changes in recent American history," said the printed program for Monday's 
ceremonies. "Exceptionally interesting are the records of the National Advisory 
Commission on Civil Disorders." 
</P>
<P>
The commission was created by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson in the aftermath 
of rioting that erupted nationwide in the summer of 1967. Corman was one of 10 
members of the panel headed by Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner. Corman's 11 boxes of 
Kerner Commission files include hearing testimony, news stories, correspondence 
and the commission's reports. 
</P>
<P>
The silver-haired Corman said Monday that his major accomplishment was his role 
in passing the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlawed racial, religious and 
other forms of discrimination, and set in motion school desegregation 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
It was a combination of the desegregation issue and President Jimmy Carter's 
landslide defeat to Ronald Reagan that led to Fiedler's upset of Corman in 
1980. She was a leader of the forces opposing mandatory school busing for 
desegregation in the Valley.

After one week, three days and 40 hours on the phone, we still do not know what 
chemicals could have been released from Coastcast in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
We still have at least 25 residents living in close proximity to the plant who 
are suffering similar symptoms initiated during the same time period. 
</P>
<P>
Medical care? Be aware, fellow Valley residents, that after any exposure, you 
are responsible for tests (not counting any ongoing treatment) that could begin 
at the very least $1,000 per person. No insurance? Pay up front for a family of 
four: $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
Do we need changes? You bet. How many other similar situations are out there 
that have never been answered because these agencies and public services could 
not respond to a citizen's critical health complaints? 
</P>
<P>
As we are forced to live closer and closer to industry, the public should be 
made aware that bloated bureaucracy, inadequate education, lax follow-up and 
wrist-slapping penalties are dangerously affecting our health and well-being. 
</P>
<P>
So, here we are. No agency, no governing body, no company will take 
responsibility to provide any answers for these trailer park residents. Aren't 
you glad it hasn't happened to you? Yet.

The article "Parts Plant Accused of Pollution" by Amy Pyle (Jan. 26) was not 
especially clear, concise or fair about the facts surrounding this story. This 
situation has existed for more than a year and has just kept getting 
progressively worse. 
</P>
<P>
Our mobile-home park has been at this location for more than 40 years, long 
before any other businesses moved into this neighborhood. Being a resident of 
the mobile-home park she spoke of, I believe that I am in a position to know 
that she left out some very important details about this story. I don't feel 
that a "good neighbor," which the Coastcast company is reporting itself to be, 
would threaten to have someone arrested for trespassing after my complaint 
about the toxic odors, and further saying that there was nothing residents 
could do to change their manufacturing practices. 
</P>
<P>
The story quoted from an AQMD list of materials that could have contributed to 
the pollution the residents complained about. Unfortunately, it was superficial 
and incomplete, so medical problems directly resulting from the pollution 
cannot be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
I get the impression from the story that there should be a happy ending, but it 
appears that this won't happen.

INGLEWOOD TO ADD 20 NEW OFFICERS; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG BUSTS TO HELP PAY FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood, a city that has fought crime with some success in the past, will 
have 20 additional police officers on the streets by summer. 
</P>
<P>
And until revenue from a new tax assessment district becomes available at 
year's end, drug dealers will help foot the bill for the new officers under a 
funding scheme worked out last week by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The additional officers will come aboard during a period when statistics 
indicate that the city has experienced a decrease in violent crimes and an 
increase in property crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Inglewood voters overwhelmingly approved the property tax assessment 
to fund a $1.4-million, 20-officer task force against gangs and drugs in 
November, the assessment will not go into effect until the new fiscal year 
begins July 1. Revenue will not be collected until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$45 a Year 
</P>
<P>
The assessment will cost the owner of a single-family home about $45 a year. 
Apartment buildings will be assessed on a sliding scale beginning at $53 a 
unit. Commercial properties will be assessed on the basis of frontage. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Feb. 7 approved the financing scheme for the immediate 
hiring of new patrol officers, who will replace veteran officers being assigned 
to the task force. The city will soon borrow about $649,000 from its water fund 
to pay for salaries, hiring and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
That loan will be repaid with funds that the city is owed by the federal 
government for property and assets seized by Inglewood police during drug 
busts, officials said. As a result of a new federal law that allows money and 
assets seized from drug dealers to be turned over to police departments for 
anti-drug operations, the city expects more than $683,000 in such 
reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great idea, making the drug dealers pay for it," said Councilman 
Anthony Scardenzan, a longtime proponent of more police officers. "I love it." 
</P>
<P>
The new officers will increase the 187-officer department by more than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trained Officers 
</P>
<P>
The new police will include trained officers transferring from other 
departments and Inglewood residents being sought in a recruitment drive, 
officials said. Ten will be hired in March, three each in April and May, and 
four in June. 
</P>
<P>
Because some of the newly hired officers will have to be trained at police 
academies and in the field, the anti-drug task force of veteran officers 
probably will not reach full strength until August, Deputy Chief Robert Gavney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The plainclothes "crime suppression" task force, as it has been named, will 
consist of 17 officers, two sergeants and a lieutenant. It will fight 
street-level drug and gang activity throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
City and police officials are enthusiastic about the beefed-up police presence. 
Capt. James Butts said the unit will provide a new show of force in areas where 
gang members congregate and intimidate residents. The task force will work with 
the department's gang intelligence unit in targeting gang members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to do all it takes to fight the perception of crime levels, as 
well as crime itself," Butts said. "When we have all the officers hired and in 
place, there should be a greater perception of safety." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decrease in Crime 
</P>
<P>
Although gangs and drugs are still a problem, crime has declined since the 
beginning of the decade, when Inglewood had a bad reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"The key thing is that we have this downward trend through the decade," said 
Michael Easley, a police crime analyst. "The overall trend is down." 
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Police Department recently show slight decreases in 
violent crimes against people -- murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault 
-- in 1988. Burglary declined as well, but property crimes -- grand larceny, 
auto theft, arson and petty larceny -- increased.

HENNING GAINS TWO ASSISTANTS; 
</P>
<P>
CHARGERS ADD TOLLNER, JOE MADDEN, BUT LOSE RHOME TO COWBOYS

<P>
Charger head coach Dan Henning gained two assistant coaches and lost one 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers announced the additions of Ted Tollner, who will work with 
quarterbacks, and Joe Madden, who replaces Wayne Sevier as special-teams coach. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Rhome, the Chargers' offensive coordinator in 1988, is leaving to be 
quarterbacks coach for the Dallas Cowboys next season. 
</P>
<P>
Tollner, 48, was the quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator at San Diego 
State from 1973-1980, head coach at USC from 1983-1986 and receivers coach at 
Buffalo the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Ted developed some of the top quarterbacks to come out of college over a long 
period," Henning said in a statement. "He also has administrative ability from 
having been a head coach at one of the top college programs in the country. 
Now, with two years' background in the NFL on a team that went from mediocrity 
to the playoffs, it's natural for him to move up." 
</P>
<P>
Madden, 53, has been in private business for the past two years. He worked for 
Henning in an administrative capacity in 1985 and 1986 and was special-teams 
coach for the Detroit Lions from 1980-1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I am familiar with Joe," Henning said. "He worked for me in charge of advance 
research on opponents, with special teams and offensive line, and in pro 
personnel evaluation. Prior to that, Joe coached five years with the Lions and 
was well thought of by his peers. I was determined to get a guy in that 
position who had coached special teams in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Rhome, 46, leaves after a year in which the Chargers finished 26th in the NFL 
in total offense. He returns to Dallas, his hometown and the town in which his 
NFL career began. 
</P>
<P>
"They offered me the position, and I talked with the Chargers," Rhome said. 
"After talking with the Chargers, I felt this would be the direction to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I started my career as a player under Coach (Tom) Landry, and to coach with 
him is too good an opportunity to pass up. I'm from Dallas and my father, who's 
83 years old, is still there. There are just so many things." 
</P>
<P>
Rhome and Henning worked together in Washington in 1987, a season that resulted 
in a Super Bowl title for the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan and I have no problems working together," Rhome said. "It's simply me 
having a chance to go to Dallas and Dan having a chance to run his own offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no regrets about being in San Diego for a year. I have no hard feelings 
in leaving." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive coordinator Ron Lynn agreed last Thursday to Henning's request that 
he stay. Henning also has decided to retain assistants Gunther Cunningham 
(defensive line coach), Mike Haluchak (linebackers), Charlie Joiner (receivers) 
and Bobby Jackson (running backs).

THE NBA / SAM MCMANIS; 
</P>
<P>
THIS TIME AROUND, THINGS AREN'T SAME FOR LAKERS AND PISTONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
No friendly Valentine's Day pecks on the cheek will be exchanged between Magic 
Johnson and Isiah Thomas at half court before the tipoff of tonight's 
Laker-Detroit Piston game at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, Johnson hobbles out there in street clothes to greet his 
close friend. 
</P>
<P>
But that will not be the only change when last season's National Basketball 
Assn. playoff finalists meet for the second, and last, time in the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In a mild surprise, neither the Pistons nor Lakers have the league's best 
record. The Cleveland Cavaliers resume play after the All-Star break three 
games ahead of Detroit. The Lakers rank third overall and first in the Western 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Lakers and Pistons have had their share of problems this season, but 
so far have endured. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers suffered through an eight-game road losing streak in December and 
January, and are facing the prospect of being without Johnson, who has a torn 
left hamstring, for an indefinite period. The Pistons, meanwhile, lost six 
straight road games at one point, have only a 1-8 record against their top 
three Eastern Conference rivals and have been rumored for weeks to be seeking a 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Pistons' 31-13 record is three games ahead of last season's pace, 
Thomas said they still have not proven themselves to be a "great" team, such as 
the Boston Celtic and Laker championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't a championship level team right now," Thomas said. "We still need to 
improve as a basketball team. We can't become stagnant. We have very good 
individuals, but we need to play together and become a team. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we do that, we won't get to the level of Boston and L.A. They've proven 
that they have done it. We haven't proven anything yet. Part of it is 
expectations. We want to win an NBA championship and we're pressing the issue. 
We feel the pressure to have the home-court advantage." 
</P>
<P>
For the Pistons to finish the regular season with not only the league's best 
record but also make a return trip to the championship series, Thomas said 
changes must be made. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to have some inside scoring," Thomas said. "We're a great basketball 
team now when we're hitting the 'J' (jump shots). But our transition game is 
not what it seems. When we force teams to shoot only (44.8%), we should be fast 
breaking more. 
</P>
<P>
"And, in the half-court game, we're relying strictly on jump shots. When we 
make it, it's great. But, when we get in trouble, is when we don't." 
</P>
<P>
After last season, the Pistons' expectations have been heightened, which may be 
why Thomas and other Pistons are not satisfied despite a five-game winning 
streak and the NBA's second-best record. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Chuck Daly has been quoted as saying the Pistons desperately need a 
post-up player who can score inside to seriously contend for the title. 
</P>
<P>
There has been considerable speculation that the Pistons will trade forward 
Adrian Dantley for Dallas Mavericks forward Mark Aguirre. A Dallas newspaper 
recently reported that Daly and Dantley had an argument, though Daly denied it. 
Aguirre has been quoted as saying that Thomas is pushing for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Because he is Aguirre's close friend, Thomas has been caught in the middle of 
the trade rumors. Speaking to reporters during All-Star weekend at Houston, 
Thomas said he has had no involvement in the Dantley-Aguirre affair. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I expect anything to happen?" said Thomas, repeating a question. "No. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I want anything to happen?" he repeated again. "No. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we have everything it takes to win the NBA championship?" he repeated. "I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Choosing his words carefully, Thomas said he is not sure such a trade would 
ensure that the Pistons would win the championship. He also said reports that 
he and Dantley do not get along are false. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark Aguirre is a friend of mine, so that (speculation) naturally happens," 
Thomas said. "Sometimes rumors are true and sometimes not. Even before Adrian 
Dantley came to the Pistons, people said we didn't get along -- and that was 
before I even knew him. We've seemed to get along pretty good so far." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he would welcome a rematch against the Lakers in the championship 
series, simply because it would mean the Pistons had once again made it that 
far. 
</P>
<P>
But he does not place special emphasis on tonight's game. Nor does he think the 
Pistons' 102-99 victory over the Lakers in Detroit Nov. 26 will mean much in 
the whole scheme of things. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go to L.A. and beat them without Magic, I don't know what that tells 
us," Thomas said. "Because you can beat a team one or two or even three and 
four times in the regular season, but it doesn't matter in the playoffs. Timing 
is everything. When you get in a seven-game series with a team, that's when you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper guard Quintin Dailey's recent suspension for being overweight brings to 
mind the near-legendary Dailey story from a few years ago when he played for 
the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey was sitting on the far end of the Bulls' bench during a game when he 
motioned for a ballboy. Dailey then instructed the ballboy to ask reporter Mark 
Vancil, then of the Chicago Sun-Times, if he could borrow $10. Dailey then had 
the ballboy go to the concession stand and purchase a hot dog, popcorn and a 
soda, which Dailey ate during the game. 
</P>
<P>
Add weighty matters: Dailey isn't the only player not active because of excess 
weight. Miami Heat guard Pearl Washington has aggravated a groin strain twice 
this season, and team officials believe it is because Washington is overweight. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's injury has healed, but Coach Ron Rothstein said Washington will 
not be activated until he loses 10 pounds. Washington weighs 213. He is listed 
at 200 in the media guide. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very tender situation for him," Rothstein said. "Weight has always been 
a problem, and if he's going to do anything, he has to learn. What's the sense 
of putting him out on the floor with the extra weight so he can pull his groin 
again?" 
</P>
<P>
Statistic of the week: The Houston Rockets have a 10-0 record against the 
Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs. Against the rest of the 
league, however, the Rockets are 18-18. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley was involved in another controversy on a Philadelphia radio 
talk show last week, but this time Barkley wasn't even a guest. 
</P>
<P>
A caller named Mary, a 76-year-old grandmother from Trenton, N.J., told the 
host that she does not like Barkley because he is "mean and arrogant," and she 
would not listen when the host tried to defend Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that Barkley was listening to the show, called the station and 
went on the air to ask Mary to call back. She did not. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley has since contacted the woman and invited her to a 76ers' game. He said 
he is paying for her limousine service to and from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Most NBA players stay at home during the four-day All-Star break. But Charlotte 
Hornets forward Robert Reid planned a trip to Morocco to meet with King Hassan 
II. 
</P>
<P>
Reid, an ordained minister, traveled there in his capacity as president of the 
Global Youth Foundation. He was scheduled to meet with King Hassan to discuss 
plans for the Junior Olympic Games in Casablanca in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Post recently polled NBA players (142 of 300 responded) on various 
best-and-worst items, and both the Lakers and the city of Los Angeles are well 
represented. A few of the categories: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Cooper was chosen by the players as the second-best defensive 
player, behind Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Magic Johnson was voted as the "opposing player you'd least like to see 
take the last shot," beating out Larry Bird and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pat Riley won in two categories, "best dressed coach," and "opposing coach 
you'd least like to see diagram the last play." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Los Angeles is clearly a player favorite. It won for "best city to visit in 
January," "best city to visit in April," "best night-life," "best restaurants" 
and "best dressed fans." 
</P>
<P>
However, the players polled selected Boston as the city with the most 
knowledgeable basketball fans. Los Angeles finished third.

Demetrius Laffitte scored 10 points and Gary Williams added seven in overtime 
as U.S. International University defeated the University of Missouri-Kansas 
City, 102-96, Monday night at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 90-89, with 3:19 left in overtime, USIU outscored the Kangaroos, 
12-2, with Laffitte scoring 10 of those points to give the Gulls a 101-92 lead 
with 50 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Laffitte was 14 of 16 from the floor and six of six from the line and scored a 
team-high 34 points. Williams, who missed the front end of a one-and-one with 
four seconds remaining in regulation and the score tied, 84-84, added 31 
points, including 13 of 16 from the line. 
</P>
<P>
USIU (10-14) led, 39-38, at halftime, but the Kangaroos (7-14) took the biggest 
lead of the game, 62-52, with 13:23 remaining. The Gulls rallied with a 14-1 
run that gave them a 66-63 lead midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Napolean Petteway scored a career-high 35 points to lead Missouri-Kansas City.

Lowery was suspended from San Diego State in 1987 after an altercation during a 
pickup game on campus. He then went to Laney Community College in Oakland 
before transferring to Portland State. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, who is averaging 16 points per games, faces a charge of fourth degree

PRICE TO CHALLENGE SUSPENSION TODAY 
</P>

<P>
Jerome Price, a standout basketball player for University City High who was 
declared ineligible for the remainder of the season, plans to challenge his 
suspension in a hearing today at the San Diego Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Price was declared ineligible Feb. 3 by San Diego Section Commissioner Kendall 
Webb following Price's participation in the Gus Macker three-on-three 
basketball tournament in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
According to Webb, Price, one of six players to lose eligibility for playing in 
the tournament, violated California Interscholastic Federation Rule 600, which 
states: "A student on a high school team becomes ineligible if the student 
competes in a contest on an 'outside' team, in the same sport, during the 
student's high school season of sport." 
</P>
<P>
"From the CIF viewpoint, it's very clear that a violation has taken place," 
said Webb Monday, adding that this is the first time he has been challenged on 
a decision involving "Rule 600" during his 13 years as the San Diego Section 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Price's attorney, Tim MacNeil, said the rule needs to be more clearly defined, 
and the three-on-three style of basketball played in the Gus Macker Tournament 
is "entirely different" from full-court high school basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's much ado about nothing," MacNeil said. "Even if (Price) did play 
in this tournament, what's the harm? I think the CIF has always drawn a hard 
line. (The decision) seems unduly harsh to me." 
</P>
<P>
John E. Mortimer, who will represent the CIF, said Monday that he had no 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Price, a 6-foot junior guard/forward averaging nearly 16 points a game, was the 
dominant offensive player on the team. University City (15-8, 5-3) is currently 
a game out of first place in the City Western League but has lost two of three 
games since Price's suspension. Tom Medigovich, University City's coach, said 
he encouraged Price to take action because he felt it was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a ridiculous ruling," Medigovich said. "It's like giving the 
death penalty to someone who steals gum out of a store. I think (Webb) is not 
in it for the kids, making a decision like that."

LOANS PLAYED NO SMALL PART IN FIRM'S RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Simpson credits a Small Business Administration loan with giving his San 
Diego-based building supply company "the capital that allowed us to compete 
with the big boys -- and now we're one of the big boys ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Simpson was Western Wall Systems' sole employee, and the company was 
operating out of his garage. Today, Western Wall has 24 employees and has won 
several large contracts to handle improvements at some of the city's largest 
office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to make a small company grow if you don't have the capital," said 
Simpson, whose firm was unable to buy a key piece of equipment in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that most banks are willing to deal with you when all you need 
is a $20,000 line of credit," Simpson said. "But, when you grow, and your 
(capital) needs grow, they aren't willing to take a chance on you anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Western Wall has used SBA loans arranged by Bank of Commerce to purchase a 
laminating machine, a computer system and various pieces of equipment. 
Together, those acquisitions "gave us the ability to take on bigger jobs," 
Simpson said. "Five years ago, we couldn't have handled the size of jobs we're 
doing now." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson bristles at the suggestion that government-backed loans are unlikely to 
be paid back. When Western Wall recently took out a $300,000 SBA loan, the 
agency required that he back up the loan with a $300,000 life-insurance policy 
and a second trust deed on his house. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also extracted a personal guarantee from Simpson and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"They had me coming and going," Simpson said. "This is a government program, 
but the loans get paid back. They make sure of that." 
</P>
<P>
SBA loans also helped San Marcos-based Signs &amp; Glassworks expand from a 
garage operation to a booming business with 55 employees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Allowed Us to Grow' 
</P>
<P>
Signs &amp; Glassworks founder and Vice President bLarry Longobardi credits an 
initial SBA loan handled by Bank of Commerce during the early 1980s with 
"getting us out of a garage and into a building. It allowed us to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Growth seemed unlikely during the early 1980s, however, when Longobardi and 
co-founder and President Doug Lovison approached large lending institutions for 
a loan. 
</P>
<P>
"It got pretty ridiculous," Longobardi said. "My father had been guaranteeing 
loans for us, but when we needed a bigger loan to get equipment and working 
capital, it became obvious that it wouldn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Signs &amp; Glassworks had a $600,000 order from Miller Brewing 
Co. for decorative items used by retailers to advertise Miller's products. 
Despite the order, bankers were unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us to stick to the swap meets," Longobardi said. "They really had a 
bad attitude about dealing with a small company." 
</P>
<P>
Longobardi, who feared that an SBA loan would entangle his company in paper 
work, was pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"They handled it all and it was relatively painless," Longobardi said. "Growth 
would never had happened if we had tried for a straight loan."

VALLEY ROUNDUP: PRODUCTS RESEARCH BUYS 22.9% STAKE IN FLAMEMASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Products Research &amp; Chemical in Glendale bought a 22.9% stake in 
Flamemaster Corp. as part of a previously announced licensing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Both PRC and Sun Valley-based Flamemaster make coatings, sealants and other 
specialty chemicals. Last month, PRC granted a 15-year license to Flamemaster's 
Chem Seal division in exchange for Flamemaster stock, future royalties and 
certain marketing rights to Flamemaster products. 
</P>
<P>
Flamemaster issued 349,321 of its common shares to PRC, and the Glendale 
company bought an additional 80,000 shares from Flamemaster for $480,000, 
giving it 429,321 of Flamemaster's total 1.87 million common shares 
outstanding, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
PRC has said it views its Flamemaster stake as an investment and has no plans 
to seek control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
The companies' agreement also calls for Flamemaster to produce and sell various 
PRC aerospace sealants in North America. PRC, in turn, will be the exclusive 
distributor of Chem Seal products outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Flamemaster declared its first cash dividend, two cents, payable 
April 1 to stockholders of record March 10.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: AMERICAN ECOLOGY STARTS $23.5-MILLION SITE FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Ecology Corp., an Agoura Hills waste-management concern, plans to set 
aside $23.5 million in reserves in the fourth quarter for future costs of 
cleaning up and closing waste-disposal sites. 
</P>
<P>
The reserves, which amount to a third of American Ecology's annual sales, will 
result in the company posting a loss for all of 1988, said spokeswoman Nicki 
Hobson. American Ecology earned $4.7 million on sales of $68 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A significant part of the reserves will be earmarked for cleaning up a leaking 
chemical-waste disposal plant that American Ecology operated in Sheffield, 
Ill., the company said. American Ecology based the amount of reserves in part 
on a recent independent report, prepared for the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, that outlined the site's problems, Hobson said. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Browning-Ferris Industries, a waste-management conglomerate in 
Houston, signed a definitive agreement to invest $28.5 million in American 
Ecology. In exchange, Browning-Ferris would get preferred stock, convertible 
bonds and warrants which, if converted to common stock, would give 
Browning-Ferris 51% of American Ecology. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, originally proposed last October, is expected to be completed in 
mid-April.

VALLEY EARNINGS: TEKELEC REPORTS PROFITS TRIPLE IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tekelec said its fourth-quarter profit nearly tripled from a year earlier, when 
the Calabasas company's earnings were hurt by its decision to drop two product 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Tekelec, which makes testing equipment for the telecommunications industry, 
said its net income for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 rose to $1.47 million, 
or 36 cents a share, from $500,000, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales 
soared to $9.34 million from $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
When Tekelec discontinued the two product lines a year ago, it took a $381,000 
after-tax charge that depressed its earnings. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1988, Tekelec's profit jumped to $5.35 million, or $1.31 a share, 
from $749,000, or 20 cents a share, in 1987. Annual sales nearly doubled to 
$32.8 million from $17 million.

After a three-day halt in production, Disney/Touchstone's "Turner and Hootch" 
resumed filming Monday with a new director, Richard Spottiswoode. He replaces 
Henry Winkler, who left because of creative differences with Disney over the 
film, which stars Tom Hanks and a dog. Spottiswoode's credits include "Shoot to 
Kill," "Under Fire" and "The Best of Times." ALEENE MacMINN

When Ellen Simon's play "Moonlight and Valentino" opened at Duke University in 
Durham, N.C., over the weekend, there was another Simon in the audience who 
knows a bit about playwriting, her father Neil. Like many of her father's 
works, "Moonlight" has some autobiographical roots -- humor and tragedy in a 
woman's life after her husband is killed in a car accident (recalling the death 
of Ellen's husband in 1987). One character is based loosely on Ellen's 
ex-stepmother, actress Marsha Mason, who was also in the audience. ALEENE

Actor James Caan, 48, was reported to be in pain but recuperating Monday at St. 
John's Medical Center, after a motorcycle accident Sunday in which he fractured 
four ribs, suffered facial abrasions and several lacerations. "They've kept him 
in (the hospital) for observation," said his representative, Paul Block. "But 
we expect him out early this week. . . . Jimmy's going to be fine, just fine." 
The actor lost control when he swerved to miss a car. He was not wearing a 
helmet, police said. ALEENE MacMINN

The largest exhibition of avant-garde art in China's history has reopened in 
Beijing, after being shut down by police when artists defied a ban on 
performance art and a sculptor shot her own work with a BB gun. The sculptor 
said she didn't regret shooting her work and that finally the piece had been 
completed. "It was something I had to do, but I didn't realize it would cause 
such a stir," said Xiao Lu, the 26-year-old artist. "The piece needed to be 
destroyed slightly to be perfected." Xiao and her boyfriend were arrested and 
spent three days in jail after the incident. ALEENE MacMINN

For 24 years the Directors Guild training program has provided a route for 
outsiders -- from geologists and school teachers to carpenters and computer 
programmers -- to break into Hollywood. Now the guild is giving producers new 
financial incentives to hire its assistant director trainees by offering a 20% 
discount on many of their salaries. "It's a way to increase training 
opportunities," says the program's administrator, Elizabeth Stanley. Graduates 
of the program include such directors as Walter Hill ("48 Hours"), Alan Rudolph 
("The Moderns") and producer Art Levinson ("The Money Pit").

ROSTROPOVICH AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mstislav Rostropovich has been much with us of late, in person and in the news. 
The determinedly protean musician and humanitarian has just been restored to 
membership in the Soviet Composers Union -- which cast him out 11 years ago for 
his defense of Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn -- and two weeks ago he conducted his 
National Symphony in concerts throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday evening at Ambassador Auditorium, it was the turn of Rostropovich the 
cellist. His only U.S. recital this season even produced the relatively rare 
appearance of Rostropovich the composer. 
</P>
<P>
Sound of almost infinite variety supports Rostropovich's vigorous interpretive 
imagination. Though quite capable of burly, booming efforts, the dramatic use 
of a still, chill, vibratoless pianissimo is one of his most striking 
characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
That cold, enervated effect found appropriate application in the Adagio of 
Beethoven's D-major Sonata, Opus 102, No. 2. Its extensions into the 
surrounding movements, however, seemed artificial. Patches of coarse 
articulation and intonation also contributed distance to a surprisingly 
detached account. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Rostropovich was just warming up. At any rate, he turned from subdued 
Beethoven to robust, firmly rooted Bach -- the unaccompanied Suite in D minor, 
BWV 1008. The cellist is no period practice partisan, but he integrated the 
suite with sensitive authority, placing his emphasis on the central Sarabande. 
The Prelude and Allemande were practically one sustained line, while the other 
movements danced with strongly accented dignity. 
</P>
<P>
Tchaikovsky's melancholic Nocturne, and his own piece of bravura eccentricity, 
the Humoresque in C, Opus 5, gave Rostropovich ample opportunities to display 
wide-ranging character. He burned through his Humoresque like a manic 
barnstormer, after wringing the last elegant ounce of unexaggerated sentiment 
from the Nocturne. 
</P>
<P>
In its outer movements, Miaskovsky's reactionary Sonata in A minor, Opus 81, 
touches the same bases as the Nocturne and Humoresque, without particular 
distinction. The central Andante cantabile also provokes little interest beyond 
the moment, though Rostropovich gave it the benefit of his most silken, supple 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
Technical assurance, interpretive eloquence and accommodating dynamics -- even 
for Rostropovich's most feathery playing -- characterized the accompaniments of 
pianist Dmitry Paperno. The capacity audience, filling the pit and overflowing 
into on-stage boxes, cheered it all, and got the Bouree from Bach's Suite in C, 
briskly played as a peasant dance, in encore.JOHN HENKEN

A SOBERING LOOK AT THE ROUGH LIFE OF ONE CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one will mistake "Children of the Night," a "Frontline" report airing 
tonight (9 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15, 10 p.m. on Channel 50) for Valentine's 
Day fluff. This documentary on teen-age runaways is sobering, hard material -- 
life in the raw, brutal to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"Children" focuses on the rough life of Iain Brown, a suicide at 19, a 
child/man fleeing the comfortable world of his middle-class family in Walnut 
Creek, a suburb of San Francisco. For five years, Brown lived as a street 
hustler in San Francisco and Los Angeles, returning to his family every so 
often and then disappearing again for months at a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
At 13, Iain, while working as a camp counselor, was caught experimenting with 
drugs. Unable to face his parents, he and a friend ran away to Los Angeles, 
where they were initiated into homosexual prostitution. Once he was in the 
life, Iain seemed drawn to it, eventually becoming the leader of his own 
"family" of street kids. 
</P>
<P>
Iain left quite a record of his short, troubled life. Producer-reporter Ray 
Telles interviewed and filmed him on the streets while doing an earlier show 
about runaways; a neighbor, Bill McIntosh, had taped hours of interviews with 
Iain, Iain's story in his own words. Telles skillfully uses the film and 
audiotape, mixing it with interviews of Iain's mother, friends, social workers 
and street kids to provide a glimpse of the runaways' world of prostitution and 
drugs through the focus of Iain's life. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Iain remains a puzzle. Nobody knows exactly why this intelligent 
youth could not surmount the trauma of his life, what it was that made him 
repeatedly return to the cruel life of the street over the comfort of home and 
family. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

'BABYCAKES' A QUIRKY LITTLE PAEAN TO LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To celebrate the most romantic day of the year, CBS offers viewers a quirky 
little Valentine called "Babycakes," based on the critically acclaimed German 
film "Sugarbaby." 
</P>
<P>
Airing tonight at 9 on Channels 2 and 8, it features Ricki Lake, the bubbly, 
round star of John Waters' comedy "Hairspray," as Grace, an overweight mortuary 
cosmetician who spots the man of her dreams at a skating rink and sets out to 
seduce him. 
</P>
<P>
Rob (Craig Sheffer), the object of her desire, is young, svelte and handsome. 
As fellow cosmetician Keri (Nada Despotovich) points out, why would a guy like 
him fall for a, uh, "person" like Grace? Besides, he's living with someone, and 
she's gorgeous. 
</P>
<P>
After ascertaining that Rob's relationship is an unhappy one, Grace goes about 
her courtship campaign, not conceding a single calorie to do it. With ice cream 
sundaes, hot meals, surprising miniskirts and an all-enveloping, bountiful 
femininity, Grace makes the improbable more than possible. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a thoughtful film; director Paul Schneider and writer Joyce Eliason 
offer comic diversions and a few dark moments but don't require Lake to explore 
her character too deeply. 
</P>
<P>
Her unsympathetic stepmother (Betty Buckley), weak father (John Karlen), 
eccentric boss (Paul Benedict) and oddball friend (Despotovich) are fairly 
cartoonish. Lake's infectious grin and buoyant appeal and Sheffer's warmth, 
however, make this unlikely romance a sweet treat. LYNNE HEFFLEY

Protestant vigilantes took responsibility for killing a Roman Catholic lawyer 
in his home in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Patrick Finucane was slain Sunday by 
three men, and his wife, Geraldine, was wounded. Finucane had acted for clients 
involved in the outlawed Irish Republican Army's campaign against British rule. 
The banned Ulster Freedom Fighters claimed responsibility in a coded message 
telephoned to the British Broadcasting Corp. in Belfast. Irish nationalists 
accused a British official of making Finucane a target by saying some Northern 
Ireland lawyers were "unduly sympathetic" to guerrilla groups.

One person is murdered every three hours in Medellin, Colombia's second-largest 
city, and homicide is the main cause of death among adult males in the country 
as a whole, according to a U.N. report prepared for the current session of the 
U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. The 39-page document calls Colombia's 
record of violence "astounding." There were 3,413 violent deaths with political 
motives between January and October last year, according to a two-member U.N. 
team that visited Colombia in October. Medellin is the base of a cartel 
believed to control much of the world's illegal cocaine trade.

A coalition of Hispanic groups meeting in Santa Ana urged President Bush to 
replace Harold Ezell, western regional commissioner of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, and disavowed efforts by a local Hispanic group to 
honor the controversial INS official. State and regional members of the League 
of United Latin American Citizens, a national Hispanic rights group, announced 
they would demonstrate outside a reception honoring Ezell planned in Costa Mesa 
by LULAC's Bellflower chapter. Angry LULAC officials urged the group's 
executive committee to expel the Bellflower chapter and its head, Jose Pacheco, 
from the national organization for sponsoring the reception, claiming the 
ceremony could give Bush a misleading impression that local Hispanic groups 
support Ezell.

South Korean riot police battled thousands of club-wielding anti-American 
demonstrators trying to storm the Parliament building in Seoul, witnesses said. 
The rioters were among more than 15,000 farmers and dissidents who gathered 
outside the National Assembly to protest U.S. trade pressures, the presence of 
American troops on the peninsula and President Bush's planned visit to Seoul on 
Feb. 27. There were no reports of serious injuries or arrests. Meanwhile, North 
Korea accused South Korean soldiers of opening fire at a civilian police post 
on the northern side of the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.

LIGHTS FAIL AT WAYNE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Hundreds of passengers were stranded after Orange County's John Wayne Airport 
shut down when rainfall knocked out new runway lights, officials said. All 
incoming flights were diverted to Ontario and Los Angeles International 
airports, and outgoing flights were canceled. A spokesman for American Airlines 
said the airport closure forced the carrier to re-route seven flights carrying 
a total of 300 to 400 passengers. Delta Airlines re-routed two flights. At 
least three American Airlines flights were diverted to Ontario. The blackout, 
which affected only the runway lights, was blamed on the weather, as a new 
system of fixtures and cables encountered its first storm and apparently 
suffered water damage, airport spokeswoman Kathie Rutherford said. The airport 
was closed for almost an hour Sunday evening after a faulty Southern California 
Edison cable cut power to the runway and about 1,800 airport area residents.

About 80,000 condoms will be distributed free at five San Francisco Bay Area 
colleges and universities this week as part of an annual rating contest 
scheduled to start today on Valentine's Day. The contest, now in its third 
year, began on the Stanford University campus and has since grown to include 
the UC campuses at Berkeley and Santa Cruz, as well as San Jose State 
University and Santa Rosa Community College. Students who agree to take part in 
the survey are given a packet containing eight brands of condoms, an 
information sheet and a ballot, said Daniel Bao, director of the Stanford AIDS 
Education Project. The packets will be handed out from today through Thursday, 
and the ratings are due back on Feb. 28, Bao said. The results should be 
available in early April. The contest is designed to increase awareness about 
AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, Bao said.

The Army for the first time in eight years has not been able to sign up as many 
men and women as it needs, signaling harder times ahead in filling the billets 
of the nation's all-volunteer military, the Washington Post reported. Lt. Col. 
John Cullen, spokesman for the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, said that 
recruiters fell 471 people short of reaching the Army's goal of signing up 
24,143 volunteers for the last quarter of calendar 1988. He attributed this 
first shortfall since 1980 to a declining population of young people and to a 
smaller recruiting budget.

A retired Argentine police commissioner and his wife were held in Miami on 
charges of conspiring to sell stolen paintings worth as much as $100 million by 
such masters as El Greco and Goya, FBI officials said. Juan Carlos Longo, 53, 
and his wife, Hilda, 40, who have homes in Buenos Aires and Miami, were held 
without bond in pretrial detention after being arrested last week, the FBI 
said. During the investigation, Longo told an informant, posing as a dealer of 
stolen artworks, that 11 paintings stolen from Argentine museums were split 
between two groups in Argentina, according to an FBI affidavit. The Longos were 
arrested Feb. 6 after the informant set up the purchase of "Doves and Hens," a 
masterpiece by Goya, allegedly stolen from the Castagnino Museum of Rosario, 
Argentina, on March 24, 1987, the FBI said.

AIRPORT SECURITY STAFF TO BE INCREASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Airlines using Burbank Airport will increase security staffing for about 30 
minutes a night in response to a television news report that alleged that a 
loophole in security procedures could be used by a plane hijacker. 
</P>
<P>
In a report Monday night, KNBC-TV maintained that there was a dangerous 
security lapse because the screening stations, where metal detectors scan 
passengers for weapons, have been unstaffed after the last outgoing flight 
departed about 9:40 each night. 
</P>
<P>
People entering the terminal could then go to the boarding area without being 
screened to meet any of several flights that arrive before the airport ceases 
operations about 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
An airline security committee voted Monday afternoon to increase security after 
the station gave airport officials an advance look at its videotape. Metal 
detectors will be staffed until the last passenger has left the building, said 
Michael Kean, customer service manager for Alaska Airlines and chairman of the 
committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
For the last two years, City Atty. James K. Hahn has asked that sentences for 
Los Angeles landlords convicted of maintaining slum conditions include 
requirements that they make contributions to organizations assisting the 
homeless and underprivileged. In all, slumlords have given more than $150,000 
to such organizations, with the leading beneficiary being Las Familias del 
Pueblo, a Skid Row social service agency.

911 CALL ALERTS DEPUTIES TO ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hushed phone call from a woman held captive during an armed robbery at her 
San Dimas home led to the arrest of two suspects as they fled the residence 
with about $100,000 in cash, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest occurred Sunday about 9 p.m. after a 28-year-old woman being held 
with her infant son called the 911 emergency line, sheriff's spokesman Van 
Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman phoned when one of the suspects, who had been left to watch her, 
stepped away to confer with two other men who had taken her husband to a room 
containing a safe. Two men, armed with a sawed-off rifle and a knife, ran out 
of the house not knowing the Sheriff's Department had been notified, Sgt. Phil 
Little said. The third suspect saw the arrests taking place and escaped through 
the back door, he said.

 3 CHARGED WITH KIDNAPING WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Cal State Northridge student and two of her friends have been charged with 
kidnaping and conspiracy to murder a woman she suspected of burglarizing her 
campus apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Christi Daniels, 19; Kenneth Ceasar, 23, and an 18-year-old suspect who was a 
juvenile at the time were arrested after the Jan. 5 abduction of Czarian 
Ramsey, 18. 
</P>
<P>
The three allegedly drove Ramsey to a deserted park-and-ride lot in Newhall, 
put her on the ground in the rain and questioned her at gunpoint about the 
burglary. But sheriff's deputies on routine patrol happened upon the scene and 
arrested the three, all from South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Daniels, a freshman, reported that $18,000 worth of clothing, 
jewelry and other items were taken from her apartment Jan. 3. CSUN Police Lt. 
Mark Hissong said a witness told of seeing Ramsey of San Pedro, a long-time 
friend of Daniels, leave the apartment with a pile of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the investigation was proceeding when Daniels apparently tired 
of waiting and went to Ramsey's Sherman Oaks apartment, persuading her to go 
outside to a car.

RUNAWAY SHOT AFTER SHE AND FRIEND ARE KIDNAPED, THEN RAPED IN GRIFFITH PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS and GINGER THOMPSON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-year-old runaway from a Pasadena home for troubled girls survived an 
execution-style shooting early Monday after she and another runaway were raped 
in Griffith Park by two young men who picked them up in South-Central Los 
Angeles and promised to take them home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the men took the girl to a secluded part of the park, where 
they forced her to kneel with her hands clasped behind her head and then shot 
her twice. 
</P>
<P>
But she escaped death when the bullets fired at her head deflected off her 
hands and went through her scalp. The unidentified girl was in fair but stable 
condition late Monday at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"She was real lucky," police spokesman Bill Frio said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the other unidentified runaway, age 14, was also going to be 
shot, but she managed to escape, eventually making her way to the park's ranger 
headquarters near the Crystal Springs picnic area shortly before 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The girls ran away Sunday afternoon from Rosemary's Cottage, a private facility 
in Pasadena where Los Angeles County places abused, emotionally troubled and 
other problem girls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Not Called 
</P>
<P>
Officials there noticed that the two runaways were missing but did not call 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had AWOLs before," said assistant director Keith Hayashi, "and the 
reality is, What could the police do? They're too busy." 
</P>
<P>
The girls rode RTD buses through parts of greater Los Angeles, eventually 
ending up Sunday night in a neighborhood near Main and 66th streets. 
</P>
<P>
There, Frio said, they met a man about 20 years old whom one of them apparently 
knows. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls wanted to go back to Pasadena and this 'friend' said he knew someone 
with a car who could help them out," Frio explained. 
</P>
<P>
On the way to Pasadena, one of the men pulled out a small-caliber handgun and 
announced that they were going to "shoot us some Bloods (gang members)," 
investigators quoted the girls as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, the men drove their 1980 dark-brown Cadillac to an unlighted 
section of Griffith Park, where they raped the two girls. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old girl then escaped, finding her way to the ranger headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
But the other girl was pulled into a brushy area about 150 yards from the 
Golden State Freeway and shot. The gunmen then jumped into the Cadillac and 
drove away. 
</P>
<P>
A park ranger heard two shots and sped to the area, finding the wounded girl 
staggering along a park road. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities did not have complete descriptions of the two attackers but said 
one was about 20 years old and the other appeared to be 16. 
</P>
<P>
Hayashi declined to talk about the two girls but said that most of the 34 girls 
there were placed at the facility by the county Department of Children 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
Most girls at Rosemary's Cottage have been removed from their homes because of 
physical and sexual abuse by their parents or because they ran away from home. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our girls are angry, confused and upset," Hayashi said. "They usually 
have a problem adjusting to the structure and the rules that have to be 
followed here." 
</P>
<P>
The two-story dormitory where the girls lived is located in an unfenced area 
surrounded by Japanese pine trees, which nearly hide the building from 
passers-by. Officials there said the girls are not locked inside their rooms 
but are only supposed to leave the grounds with their counselors' permission. 
</P>
<P>
The attack, coincidentally, occurred only hours before Mayor Tom Bradley held a 
press conference at the Griffith Park Ranger Station to sign an ordinance 
extending limited police powers to rangers patrolling city parks. 
</P>
<P>
The new law permits rangers to make arrests and cite violators, but it does not 
allow them to carry firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and others at the signing ceremony praised the new law but pointed out 
that it would not have helped rangers prevent that morning's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an isolated incident that could have happened anywhere," said Capt. 
Noel Cunningham, commander of the Police Department's Northeast Division.

2 ARRESTED IN BEVERLY HILLS 'FOLLOW-HOME' ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police arrested two suspects early Monday in a Beverly Hills "follow-home" 
theft, the first arrests in connection with 32 robberies of luxury-car drivers 
that have occurred in affluent hillside neighborhoods of the Santa Monica 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills robbery was similar to others reported since mid-October, 
"but whether it is connected to any of the rest of these robberies, I can't say 
at this time ", said Los Angeles Police Detective Patrick Conmay, the head of a 
task force investigating the follow-home robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Carluus Daily, 23, and Gina Morena, 20, both of south Los Angeles, were 
arrested by Beverly Hills police about midnight near the intersection of Doheny 
Drive and Dayton Way. 
</P>
<P>
They were booked on suspicion of robbery and were held at the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department substation in West Hollywood. Conmay said police 
will attempt to link them to the string of recent robberies in which bandits 
have made off with at least $312,000 in cash and jewels. 
</P>
<P>
About half an hour before the arrests Sunday, a 65-year-old man and his 
63-year-old wife returning home in a Rolls-Royce were accosted by a man with a 
gun in front of their home in the 700 block of Camden Drive. The robber took 
about $2,000 in jewelry, police said. No shots were fired and no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Police recovered a handgun when the suspects, who were riding in a yellow 
Cadillac, were arrested about 15 blocks away, Conmay said. Investigators not 
been able to link the car or the gun to the other robberies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery was the second follow-home incident of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two of the robberies have occurred in the San Fernando Valley and 10 in 
West Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers usually follow the drivers of luxury cars, most frequently 
late-model Mercedes-Benzes, to their homes.

L.A.'S TRAFFIC TRAINEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The winter class of '89 is learning how to write parking citations, get 
abandoned vehicles off the streets of Los Angeles and direct traffic. Above 
all, says city parking administrator Robert Yates, traffic officer trainees are 
being impressed "with the image they present to the public and the importance 
of their roles in making sure we have traffic mobility." 
</P>
<P>
The trainees -- who will work for the city's Department of Transportation, not 
as sworn police officers -- spend two weeks studying city parking law, radio 
communication, driving techniques and how to deal with motorists. They spend 
another week in the streets learning traffic control. Each new traffic officer 
is on six months' probation under the tutelage of a veteran.

POSTSCRIPT: 'THE LOW POINT WAS 1985, WHEN THE CLINIC BURNED DOWN. WE DIDN'T

It was almost 20 years ago when Carol Downer's battle began, and since then it 
has come full circle. A "vicious circle," as Downer, head of the national 
Federation of Feminist Women's Health Centers, calls it. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we go again," she said, referring to the U.S. Supreme Court's plan to 
consider to what extent states may restrict access to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1969 when Downer and others organized as the Los Angeles Abortion Task 
Force, part of the National Organization for Women. Abortions were legal only 
in California, New York, Hawaii and Washington and only in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Downer, now 55, recalled: "We needed to do something dramatic. We were going to 
start an abortion clinic and get arrested to show the need for less-costly 
procedures." They learned how to perform abortions from nurse practitioners, 
but in the meantime, several private clinics opened. So Downer's federation 
formed the Women's Abortion Referral Service, the first of its kind to offer 
pregnancy screening. Women came from all over for help, Downer said. 
</P>
<P>
While Downer claimed that the clinic never did abortions, she was arrested in 
1972 and charged with practicing medicine without a license. A jury found her 
not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Supreme Court, in the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, declared that 
women have a right to end pregnancy. Within 50 days, Downer's group opened the 
Women's Choice Clinic, which performed 2,000 abortions yearly. Others sprang up 
in Oakland, San Diego, Santa Ana and Chico. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the clinics ran smoothly. But during the Reagan Administration, the 
anti-abortion, or "pro-life," movement began picking up steam. Clinics were hit 
with protests, some of them far from peaceful. The Los Angeles clinic was 
ailing financially, trying to keep costs low while paying high malpractice and 
fire insurance premiums and competing with private clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"The low point was 1985, when the clinic burned down," Downer said. Fire 
officials suspected arson, but no perpetrator was found. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't give up," Downer recalled. "We did screenings from a van parked 
outside." The new Feminist Women's Health Center was set up at 6221 Wilshire 
Blvd. in a secure high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the now more-conservative Supreme Court said it will review a 
federal ruling that struck down a 1986 Missouri law that forbade public 
facilities to perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, groups that oppose abortion -- banded together as Operation Rescue 
-- have begun campaigns to disrupt clinics, including a protest last weekend in 
Los Angeles. Clinics responded with a counterdemonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Downer said her own long crusade stemmed from "a scary, painful, illegal 
abortion with complications. In those days it wasn't the family doctor. I don't 
want women to go through that again." CAROL McGRAW

MAGIC GETS COMPANY IN MISERY; 
</P>
<P>
ABDUL-JABBAR HURTS ELBOW; JOHNSON OUT AT LEAST UNTIL SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of practice Monday, the Lakers looked as if they had emerged from 
combat rather than a four-day break for the National Basketball Assn. All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
On one side of a courtside table sat Magic Johnson, who was being treated for a 
partially torn left hamstring that Dr. Robert Kerlan said will sideline him for 
a minimum of two games. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side sat Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, his right elbow encased in ice packs 
after he hyper-extended it during the workout. A similar injury caused 
Abdul-Jabbar to miss a game earlier this season, but the Lakers said he is 
expected to play tonight against the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was forward A.C. Green, who practiced with plastic bandages affixed 
to his forehead, left arm, left leg and neck. Green, who was unhurt, apparently 
was just playing a macabre joke on Coach Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
"Pain is the touchstone of all inspiration," quipped Riley, searching for 
anything positive in the injury situation. 
</P>
<P>
But without Johnson and with Abdul-Jabbar hurting, there is little to inspire 
confidence in the Lakers' chances heading into tonight's game against the 
Pistons, who are making their first Forum appearance since losing Game 7 of the 
NBA championship series last June. 
</P>
<P>
Even before being examined Monday, Johnson knew he would miss tonight's game 
and Thursday's game at Portland. Later, Kerlan said that Johnson's progress has 
been "excellent" but that he is not ready to resume working out. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson will be evaluated again Friday to determine whether he can play in 
Sunday's game against the Boston Celtics at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar's injury is not believed to be nearly as debilitating. He has 
hyper-extended the elbow several times in the last few seasons. It happened 
again Monday when his elbow hit teammate Mark McNamara's head under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, meanwhile, said his left hamstring, which he injured after making a 
layup Wednesday night against the Golden State Warriors, feels only minimally 
better. 
</P>
<P>
He received twice-daily treatments over the weekend and briefly rode a 
stationary bicycle Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still sore, but not as bad as it was (Wednesday) night," Johnson said. "I 
felt it a lot (Thursday), but it's always worse the next day. But (trainer Gary 
Vitti has) done a great job. I feel better than I did when I hurt it." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's injury occurred at an inopportune time for the Lakers. After 
tonight's rematch against the Pistons, which Riley termed as the club's biggest 
game to date, the Lakers will play at Portland Thursday and then will play the 
Celtics Sunday in a nationally televised game. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that Johnson will also miss Sunday's game, and perhaps more. 
</P>
<P>
"You always want to play in the big games like this," Johnson said. "(Today) is 
our biggest game of the season, and you know what the Boston game always means. 
And playing up in Portland is always tough. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally have everybody back and playing well, and then I go out. It's 
tough. But the guys just have to weather the storm. They can still (win)." 
</P>
<P>
Late last season, however, during a 19-game stretch in which Johnson either 
missed games or did not play at full strength because of a groin injury, the 
Lakers were 9-10. 
</P>
<P>
"When we went .500 during that stretch, people don't remember that Coop 
(Michael Cooper) also was out," Riley said. "So we were missing two point 
guards, and I was playing Wes Matthews a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper probably will start in Johnson's place. Riley said that rookie David 
Rivers probably will play 20 to 25 minutes per game and that Orlando 
Woolridge's role off the bench will be emphasized more. Riley also said he is 
considering other changes in player combinations, but he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
"The instinct of this team is to always look for (Johnson)," Riley said. 
"They've got to change that thinking now. Where I think we're going to get the 
most help in from Orlando's spot. He makes things happen on offense, like 
Earvin. He creates. He gets us to the free-throw line. He can drive the ball to 
the basket." 
</P>
<P>
Despending on the length of Johnson's absence, the Lakers could be in danger of 
losing their lead in the Pacific Division. They resume play after the All-Star 
break only 2 1/2 games ahead of the Phoenix Suns and 3 1/2 in front of the 
Seattle SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
And, in two weeks, the Lakers will make their last trip East this season. But 
Riley said that he does not believe the Lakers need to make a trade before the 
Feb. 23 deadline and that Johnson's loss will be neither long nor harmful to 
their record. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time when there's no escape, no retreat," Riley said. "The only 
thing we, as a team, can do is look at the big picture. It's a long season. 
Teams want to kick our (butts). They are probably drooling at the mouth over 
our injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a challenge. You can't dodge the schedule. You can't fret about it. We've 
got 10 great players (not counting Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson) left. They can't 
replace Earvin. They know that. They know what they have to do."

OKLAHOMA QUARTERBACK ARRESTED BY FBI; 
</P>
<P>
THOMPSON ACCUSED OF SELLING COCAINE TO UNDERCOVER AGENT 
</P>

FBI agents arrested Oklahoma quarterback Charles Thompson Monday night on a 
complaint of allegedly selling cocaine to an undercover agent, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Dan Vogel said Thompson was arrested in Norman, Okla., on a 
federal complaint that he allegedly sold 17 grams of cocaine for $1,400 to an 
undercover agent Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson will appear before a U.S. magistrate today, Vogel said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was escorted from the Oklahoma County Courthouse to the jail elevator. 
He had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer suspended Thompson from the 
football team, making him the fifth player to be suspended since the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. placed the Sooners on three years' probation in 
December for recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer said he had suspended Thompson and was moving him out of the athletic 
dormitory pending an investigation and would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked, just like everyone else," said John Underwood, assistant athletic 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Underwood said he learned of the arrest about 10 p.m. CST from the television 
news. 
</P>
<P>
"Barry had made a statement this afternoon (about the suspension), but I'm not 
always privy to a lot of that information. I'm just shocked and saddened," 
Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer, Athletic Director Donnie Duncan and interim President David Swank 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Bill Price said Thompson's arrest culminated a six-month 
investigation. Thompson faces up to 20 years in prison and $1 million in fines 
if he is convicted, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the NCAA placed Oklahoma on probation, the football program has been 
plagued by unrelated incidents that have resulted in five suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
Starting cornerback Jerry Parks was suspended when he was charged with shooting 
with intent to injure teammate Zarak Peters Jan. 13 in an athletic dorm. Parks 
is home in Texas awaiting his preliminary hearing, and is not enrolled in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Nigel Clay, Bernard Hall and Glenn Bell were suspended from the 
university for two years when they were charged with first-degree rape stemming 
from a Jan. 21 complaint at the athletic dorm. 
</P>
<P>
When Switzer was asked if it was a difficult decision to suspend Thompson, who 
took over for Jamelle Holieway midway through last season, he said: "No, not at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, a sophomore, took over at Oklahoma as a redshirt freshman when 
Holieway suffered a season-ending knee injury in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson guided Oklahoma to a 17-13 victory over Missouri, then rushed for 126 
yards against Nebraska to give Oklahoma the No. 1 ranking heading into the 
Orange Bowl against No. 2 Miami. The Hurricanes won, 20-14. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway returned as the starter in 1988, but had lost a step from his injury, 
and he and Thompson shared the position through the first four games. 
</P>
<P>
Against Texas, Holieway slightly injured his ankle in the first quarter, and 
Thompson replaced him for good, leading Oklahoma to a Big Eight Conference 
title showdown against Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
The Cornhuskers won, 7-3, and Thompson broke his leg on the last play of the 
game, forcing him to miss the Citrus Bowl.

NEWSWIRE: NLRB TELLS SEAHAWKS TO COMPENSATE EX-PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Sam McCullum was illegally discharged by 
the Seahawks before the strike-marred 1982 season, the National Labor Relations 
Board ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
McCullum, then the Seahawks' player representative, must be given back pay, 
with interest, from the time of his release and a job "substantially 
equivalent" to the job he lost, the NLRB ruled in a 2-1 decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks, who did not have immediate comment, can appeal the ruling to the 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
McCullum was a starting wide receiver when he was cut by Jack Patera, then the 
team's coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ecstatic," McCullum told the Seattle Times. "It's been a long time." 
</P>
<P>
McCullum said he had no idea how much back pay he is owed by the Seahawks, and 
the board did not estimate it. McCullum, 36, is now director of sports 
marketing for Ace Novelty Co. of Seattle. He formerly served as director of the 
Washington State Traffic Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Blatt, speaking for the Seahawks, said he doubted the team would be 
required to rehire McCullum. 
</P>
<P>
"I interpret that as referring to pension benefits, severance pay and insurance 
benefits," Blatt said.

FRED BILETNIKOFF RETURNS TO RAIDERS, WILL COACH TEAM'S WIDE RECEIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hall of Fame receiver Fred Biletnikoff rejoined the Raiders Monday when he was 
hired as wide receiver coach. 
</P>
<P>
Biletnikoff, 46, has been an assistant coach with the Calgary Stampeders of the 
Canadian Football League and with the Oakland Invaders of the United States 
Football League for the past five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The most valuable player in Super Bowl XI, when the Raiders beat the Minnesota 
Vikings, 32-14, at Pasadena in 1977, Biletnikoff holds franchise records with 
589 receptions, 8,974 receiving yards and 76 touchdown receptions in 14 
seasons. He is tied with Marcus Allen with 77 total touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Biletnikoff, who had three receptions to the Minnesota one-yard-line in Super 
Bowl XI, caught 70 passes for 1,167 yards and 10 touchdowns in 18 postseason 
games. All three totals are second on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1, 190-pounder from Erie, Pa., a second-round draft choice of the 
Raiders out of Florida State in 1965, played in three American Football League 
championship games, five American Conference title games and Super Bowls II and 
XI. 
</P>
<P>
He also played in two AFL all-star games and four Pro Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Biletnikoff became a member of the pro football Hall of Fame last year, joining 
former teammates Jim Otto, George Blanda, Willie Brown and Gene Upshaw. Art 
Shell, also a Raider assistant coach, will be inducted into the Hall of Fame 
this summer.

Coach Tom Landry, whose Dallas Cowboys went 3-13 last season, announced several 
changes on his staff and hinted that he might stay with the team into the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Landry replaced defensive coordinator Ernie Stautner and pass coordinator Paul 
Hackett, hiring George Hill as defensive coordinator and Jerry Rhome as 
quarterback coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no intention of retiring unless it is forced upon me. I feel good. I 
survived the onslaught of last season," Landry said. 
</P>
<P>
Stautner, the Cowboys' defensive coordinator for 20 years, was reassigned to 
work on special projects and will retire after the 1989 season, Landry said. 
Hackett, who joined Dallas in 1986, is currently working on special projects.

The father of Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders said he has met with NFL 
officials to discuss the player's rights if he skips his final season at 
Oklahoma State and turns professional. 
</P>
<P>
Williams Sanders of Wichita, Kan., told The Associated Press in a telephone 
interview that he believed his son knew he made the trip, but "we haven't 
talked about it." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders said he planned to go to Stillwater, Okla., to talk with his son and 
tell him what he learned from the visit with NFL officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they've never had a case like Barry's before, and that they would 
like him to submit a letter explaining his circumstances," Sanders told the 
Atlanta Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL people didn't give me any indication whether Barry would be allowed 
into the league. They wanted to raise the possibility that Barry may not get 
in." 
</P>
<P>
NFL spokesman Joe Browne confirmed that William Sanders met last Wednesday with 
Jay Moyer, the league's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"It was strictly an informational meeting about our eligibility rules," Browne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Should Sanders, a running back, go to the NFL next fall, he would be the first 
routine college junior to make such a jump. Sanders has until April 10 to apply 
in writing for eligibility for the draft later that month.

Diane Carlson Evans got the idea in 1983 when she visited a Minneapolis art

She had been an Army nurse in Vietnam, and it was clear to her that the role of 
women in that war -- their valor under fire and constant exposure to death and 
the horrors of combat -- was being ignored. 
</P>
<P>
So, hauling her old footlocker from her parents' farmhouse in Minnesota, Evans 
pulled out her fatigues for the first time since she had left Vietnam in 
August, 1969. Dried blood still stained her boots. 
</P>
<P>
The tattered uniform no longer fit, but she persuaded a young friend to dress 
in it and pose as a nurse. Rodger Brodin, the sculptor and Vietnam veteran 
whose work had caught her eye in Minneapolis, agreed to work on a statue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3,000 Volunteers 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before Evans and 3,000 volunteers nationwide, using miniature 
models of Brodin's work, had raised close to $1 million to have their statue 
placed at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington. Veterans' groups were 
enthusiastic and Congress liked the idea, too. Even actress Loretta Swit, who 
played the Army nurse "Hot Lips" Houlihan in the TV series "MASH," voiced her 
support. 
</P>
<P>
All along, Evans and the others assumed that their statue would be placed near 
the V-shaped Vietnam Memorial, a powerful wedge of black granite that has been 
credited with helping heal the psychological wounds of forgotten veterans. And 
as the money added up, they began to envision a dedication ceremony for 
Veterans Day, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But while Evans had lived through bloody battles half a world away from her 
home in Wisconsin, she and the other nurses who set out to honor the 10,000 
American women who served in Vietnam weren't prepared for the bureaucratic 
jungles of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Power Within Her' 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Evans, sculptor Brodin had once waxed poetic about his creation, 
a war-weary nurse cradling an upturned helmet. "There's a power within her," he 
wrote, "that even I cannot describe." 
</P>
<P>
J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery of Art and a key figure in 
deciding which designs get chosen for memorials in the capital, had less 
trouble with an assessment. "The poor nurse," he said recently, "looks like 
she's about to upchuck." 
</P>
<P>
Which just about describes the feeling of the nurses after four years of 
legislative and bureaucratic battles that have left their design rejected on 
aesthetic grounds. Along the way, the grass-roots campaign was split by a power 
struggle. Lawsuits and charges of internal mismanagement abounded, and the 
future of the entire project is still in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we did it backwards," concedes retired Air Force nurse Linda Spoonster 
Schwartz, legislative affairs director of the group, The Vietnam Women's 
Memorial Project. "We're very good nurses, but trafficking in politics is not 
our second nature. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to commit suicide or have a coronary," she adds ruefully, "I can 
handle that quite well." 
</P>
<P>
From the start, the Vietnam Memorial has been a project cloaked in emotion and 
controversy. Its original design by Maya Lin, the daughter of Chinese 
immigrants, was a wall inscribed with the names of more than 58,000 Americans, 
including eight women, who died in the war. At first it was bitterly attacked 
as a mournful "gash" that inspired feelings of shame. 
</P>
<P>
Emotions rose shortly after the memorial's dedication in 1982, when 
then-Interior Secretary James G. Watt, bowing to demands from many disgruntled 
veterans, decided almost single-handedly to place near the wall a bronze statue 
of three fighting men designed by sculptor Frederick Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Watt's move was later criticized by women veterans, who felt that Hart's 
depiction of three males, symbolizing the 3 million men who served in 
Indochina, ignored the contribution of the 10,000 American women who also 
served. Watt's action also prompted Congress to pass new laws governing the 
selection of monuments -- laws that, ironically, now effectively pit the 
Vietnam nurses against the influential Brown, head of the five-member federal 
Commission of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Site Selection 
</P>
<P>
Under Congress' selection process, there first must be legislation establishing 
that a particular person or group should be honored. Next a site is selected. 
And only then is a design chosen by the Commission of Fine Arts and the 
National Capital Planning Commission, which also dislikes the Brodin statue. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the nurses, Brown seems to imply, two people in Minnesota simply 
made a statue and decided they were going to cram it down the throats of 
official Washington and visiting tourists for hundreds of years to come, 
regardless of whether others found it appropriate or aesthetically pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
"The poor sculptor got assured (by the women) that whatever he did would 
automatically be plunked down there," Brown says of Brodin. "He came and 
testified and seemed a reasonable type. I don't know that they are stuck always 
having the same artist. We try to focus attention on these memorials on a 
national level, not just a group in Minnesota." 
</P>
<P>
Brown would rather see the Vietnam women's salute become part of the 
All-Women's Memorial, a $25-million monument and museum planned for the 
entrance to Arlington National Cemetery to honor all women who have served in 
the U.S. armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Among Great Monuments' 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be very large scale, very prominent and take its place among the 
great monuments of Washington," Brown says, adding pointedly: 
</P>
<P>
"One would hope that any subgroup of those gallant women who served in all wars 
could see their way clear to submerging their own particular anxieties and have 
that memorial symbolize everyone. But this (Vietnam group) is the era of the 
'me generation,' so we'll have to see how it goes." 
</P>
<P>
How it has gone so far is not what might have been expected, given the 
project's aim to promote sisterhood and healing among Vietnam nurses. A power 
struggle over alleged misuse of more than $300,000 in donations resulted in the 
ouster last summer of co-founder Donna-Marie Boulay, who says she is 
"overwhelmed" by the injustice of her removal. 
</P>
<P>
During the skirmish two lawsuits were filed -- one against the board by two of 
its members, and a copyright suit against Stuart Pharmaceuticals, the project's 
primary donor, by Brodin. Although both suits have since been dropped, 
friendships have been severed and feelings have been bruised. Some women have 
become so distraught over the project's difficulties, according to legislative 
director Schwartz, that they had to seek counseling, take medication or be 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
"What people don't understand is that women see this statue as finally, after 
20 years, a sign that our government cared about what they did," Schwartz says. 
"Women vets have had more difficulty readjusting to civilian life than even 
some of the men because of the kind of work they did. Nurses experienced death 
and dying on a daily basis and were exposed to hostile fire constantly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother's Letter 
</P>
<P>
She cites a letter to the group by the mother of a nurse who served in Vietnam. 
"(The) daughter committed suicide while she was waiting for the statue's 
dedication," Schwartz said. "She said if the statue had already been up, her 
daughter would not have committed suicide." 
</P>
<P>
(Brown agrees that this has been the most emotionally charged drive for a 
memorial that he can recall. When told that some women were hospitalized after 
the commission rejected the statue design, he said: "I'm sorry if it seemed to 
have that effect. There are a lot of women who were pretty upset at the whole 
idea that it should grow into these kinds of proportions.") 
</P>
<P>
Details of the internal strife began to trickle out when the group, after 
raising money to fund and erect the $135,000 statue, asked Congress for 
legislation authorizing it. Sensing concern about the group's financial 
dealings, Congress ordered an audit which revealed -- to the surprise of some 
project members -- that more than $385,000 had been spent on public relations 
and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some project members were dismayed about the spending habits of 
Boulay, who they say ran up large, poorly documented travel charges. When she 
traveled to Washington on project business, for instance, Boulay had stayed at 
the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, one of the city's most luxurious. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly did, several times," Boulay acknowledged by telephone from her 
Minneapolis law office. "The reason I did was I got a very big discount as a 
lawyer." A Ritz-Carlton reservations clerk said the hotel does have special 
rates for lawyers, the least expensive room rate in the last few years having 
been $105 a night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suit Filed 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Evans and another board member, Karen Johnson, filed a suit against 
other board members, charging them with failure to supervise Boulay and 
maintain proper corporate and financial records. 
</P>
<P>
Boulay, they charged, had endorsed the television series "China Beach" without 
approval, spent corporate funds beyond board guidelines and caused, by her 
failure to work with sculptor Brodin, a copyright suit to be filed by Brodin 
against Stuart Pharmaceuticals, the project's major corporate backer with a 
pledge of $500,000. (In his suit, Brodin accused the firm of using the image of 
his statue improperly in a promotional manner.) 
</P>
<P>
The women's suit was dropped within five days, but it was the start of a major 
shakeup. In June, the project moved its headquarters from Minneapolis to 
Washington. A month later, the board voted to remove Boulay "for cause" and 
adopted a revised budget "to reflect a more respectful attitude toward the 
supporters and contributors." It also discontinued some of the expensive public 
relations contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said that Boulay's mistakes were "not intentional, just bad judgment, 
nothing malicious. Some of the costs got carried away for public relations." 
The fact that their friendship as co-founders was severed "hurts," she said. 
"It can't help but hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The board's actions "boggled my mind," says Boulay, who insists that the money 
spent on public relations was necessary to persuade Congress to pass a law 
authorizing the statue. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite the expensive lobbying campaign, the project settled last October 
for legislation that is not statue-specific. A Senate provision specifying that 
the memorial consist of a statue at the Vietnam Memorial was amended by the 
House after critics complained that such language would circumvent the very law 
Congress had passed to stem the tide of monuments in Washington. The women's 
group decided to support the House version and asked the Senate to pass it, 
which it eventually did. 
</P>
<P>
Boulay now predicts that the legislative change could doom the statue. "I would 
dearly, dearly love to be 100% wrong," she said, adding: "I'm morose on the 
subject." 
</P>
<P>
The newly organized group has paid off enormous debts, retooled its budget 
process and resolved to move forward. "We've really turned it around," Schwartz 
gamely maintains. "This project has never been in a better position than it is 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
But that's if you consider a holding pattern good position. Before the Brodin 
statue can be placed as part of the memorial, the group must clear several 
time-consuming hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
First, it must persuade the new secretary of the Interior, Manuel Lujan Jr., to 
advise Congress that a women's Vietnam memorial be placed in what is known as 
Site 1, which includes the 2.2-acre site of the Vietnam Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming Lujan does recommend Site 1, which is anticipated, Congress then must 
vote to place the women's memorial near Lin's wall and Hart's statue. The 
legislation passed last October contains such a recommendation, but it is 
non-binding. 
</P>
<P>
And unless Congress also specifies that Brodin's design is the one to be 
selected, Evans and her group will then find themselves right back where they 
started: before J. Carter Brown and the Commission of Fine Arts, seeking 
approval of the statue. 
</P>
<P>
Brown shows no signs of a change of artistic heart. He is more enthusiastic 
about the idea of a bas-relief, perhaps depicting a large-scale war nursing 
scene. A statue of one white Army nurse, he says, might only compound the 
problem: Veterans not literally symbolized by the figure -- black and Asian 
women, or service women who weren't nurses -- would feel excluded in the same 
way the women felt excluded by the statue of the men. 
</P>
<P>
And he is concerned that adding more and more elements to the Vietnam Memorial 
may set off an endless parade of interest groups seeking their own monuments. 
</P>
<P>
Although having an open competition to design the memorial "would certainly be 
one way of getting out of a preconceived idea," Brown says, "I would hate to 
see a competition that would exacerbate the situation of hitching to a 
particular star." 
</P>
<P>
Even though one of their own paid consultants recommended that they consider 
placing Brodin's statue at or near the all-women's site, the nurses are adamant 
that the memorial be placed at the Vietnam Memorial or nowhere, and that it be 
the Brodin statue or nothing. They used models of the statue to raise money, 
they note, and they claim it is already famous and promoting healing. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't accept anything other than a statue. That's not equal," said Evans. 
"For five months, Rodger and I worked on that statue, and we didn't tell 
anybody. Then we heard there would be a statue of three men at the wall. I 
wasn't bitter. I just felt empty. We decided we would work on the statue and if 
we liked it, we would try to put it on the Wall." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a bas-relief is greeted no more enthusiastically. "If the men's 
statue doesn't detract from the memorial, why would a woman?" asks Evans. "A 
bas-relief or a plaque would seem second-rate and make the women feel 
second-rate." 
</P>
<P>
(To that, Brown responds, "If they could get the bronze doors of Ghiberti I 
wonder if they would think that's second-rate. I'd hate to see people make up 
their minds on purely extraneous political grounds without considering it as a 
design question.") 
</P>
<P>
Placing the memorial at the all-women's site, across a bridge over the Potomac 
River, "sends a message similar to the back of the bus," said Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Evans concedes that starting with a specific statue meant they 
went about this effort "backwards. We made mistakes. Perhaps we really didn't 
know the process." Adds Schwartz: "I think the project now has learned a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The group's target date of Veterans Day for the dedication "may not be 
possible," Schwartz concedes. "It's a cherished notion that's dying hard, but 
there's still a glimmer of hope. It's not easy to do this."

ORTEGA OFFERS TO HOLD EARLY VOTE IN 1990 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nicaragua's Sandinista leadership, under pressure from Central American 
neighbors to ease its tight control of the country, offered Monday to hold next 
year's general elections at least nine months ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega made the announcement in a closed meeting 
with the presidents of four other Central American countries here. He told them 
that the voting scheduled for November, 1990, will instead take place within 
the first months of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Espinoza, the Nicaraguan minister of information, who briefed reporters, 
said the offer was a "gesture of our intentions to comply in full" with a 1987 
Central American peace accord that helped disarm the U.S.-backed rebellion by 
Contras against Sandinista rule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details Still Unclear 
</P>
<P>
Espinoza said that Ortega first raised the possibility of early elections in 
private meetings with opposition political parties in Managua last week and 
that details are still to be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that could upset this plan is if the opposition parties do not 
go along," Espinoza said. 
</P>
<P>
The voting will be for president, vice president, a 96-member National Assembly 
and, for the first time in Nicaragua, municipal councils. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, the principal Nicaraguan opposition 
group, criticized the offer as insufficient but did not reject it outright. 
More important, they said, is that the government first meet their demands for 
reforms that would ease Sandinista control of the army, the press and the 
electoral process. 
</P>
<P>
"If elections are held only to legitimize the party in power, then it does not 
matter when they take place," said Carlos Huembes, president of the dissident 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas came to power in a guerrilla insurrection in 1979 and first 
held elections in November, 1984. Ortega won a six-year presidential term, 
defeating six other candidates. The Democratic Coordinate boycotted the vote, 
saying that the rules favored the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord signed 18 months ago, Central American leaders agreed to 
try to halt guerrilla wars through democratic reforms that would guarantee free 
elections. The two-day summit that opened Monday is considered a last-ditch 
attempt to save the pact from failure. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, author of the agreement, is trying 
to use the summit to oblige the Sandinista government to ease its political 
control of Nicaragua and the Salvadoran authorities to reconsider a guerrilla 
proposal that presidential elections be postponed so that the rebels can take 
part. 
</P>
<P>
But Arias received a setback when El Salvador refused to discuss the guerrilla 
proposal here. "The battle is going to be hard," one Costa Rican official 
commented during a break in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte, thinned by his fight against liver 
cancer, opened the summit in a palm-shaded beachfront hotel in this Pacific 
coastal village. It was his fourth meeting since May, 1986, with Arias, Ortega 
and Presidents Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo of Guatemala and Jose Azcona Hoyo of 
Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
With Duarte's term due to expire in June, and Azcona and Arias to leave office 
within a year after that, this is expected to be the final gathering of the 
agreement's five signers. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever succeeds us will be less committed to the peace plan than we are," 
Arias said before traveling to El Zapote. "That is why we must make a great 
effort to reach important agreements that will restore the Central American 
people's faith that we can soon achieve peace." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Truce Talks in 3 Conflicts 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 accord led to cease-fire negotiations in the region's three guerrilla 
conflicts. Those talks broke down quickly in El Salvador and Guatemala. But in 
the case of Nicaragua, the talks prompted the U.S. Congress to cut off military 
aid to the Contras a year ago and led to a truce last March. 
</P>
<P>
Further talks aimed at a final Nicaraguan peace treaty collapsed last June, 
however, when the Contras accused the Sandinistas of evading their obligations 
under the regional pact to allow amnesty for political prisoners, press freedom 
and "total political pluralism." 
</P>
<P>
Most Contras have since withdrawn to border camps in Honduras, keeping that 
U.S. ally in violation of a clause in the accord that bars any government from 
harboring guerrillas trying to oust another government. 
</P>
<P>
Differences over how to untangle the peace process have delayed the summit 
three times since August. Apparently to minimize public friction, the 
presidents canceled a series of pre-summit press conferences. At at a brief 
photo session, only Duarte spoke, expressing vague "optimism" about "favorable 
conditions for peace." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rebels Pledge Restraint 
</P>
<P>
Leftist Salvadoran guerrillas promised to observe a truce during the summit, 
but the U.S.-backed army did not follow suit and posted a large contingent of 
soldiers around the meeting site 40 miles southeast of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Arias is seeking to focus the summit on two issues, one involving El Salvador 
and the other involving Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
In El Salvador, the issue is a rebel proposal to delay scheduled March 19 
elections by six months so that electoral guarantees can be worked out for the 
rebels and their supporters. The rebels have yet to take part in any voting 
during their nine-year-old war. 
</P>
<P>
Arias met with two Salvadoran rebel leaders before coming to El Zapote and held 
talks Sunday night with Duarte. A Costa Rican official said that Arias urged 
Duarte to consider the rebel proposal "as a basis for new peace negotiations" 
but that Duarte maintained his opposition. Salvadoran Foreign Minister Ricardo 
Acevedo Peralta told reporters that the issue is "an internal matter" with no 
place on the summit agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Associated Press reported that El Salvador's defense minister, Gen. 
Carlos Vides Casanova, warned of a coup if Duarte agrees to postpone the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"If the president retains power beyond the end of his term, the armed forces 
would be obliged to depose him -- either the armed forces or the legislative 
assembly," Vides was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Push for Concessions 
</P>
<P>
The other issue involves efforts by Arias, Duarte and Azcona to push Nicaragua 
into what they call "democratic concessions" that would satisfy the Bush 
Administration, bring the seven-year-old Contra war to a formal end and ease 
regional tensions. 
</P>
<P>
As in previous summits, Ortega came ready to negotiate. Besides announcing 
early elections, he offered to free about 3,150 political prisoners if Honduras 
accepts his proposal that it disarm the Contras and dismantle their border 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
Arias recently said he expects more of the Sandinistas. He has called for 
abolishing their press censorship powers, giving anti-Sandinista groups a 
television station and rewriting the 1988 election law to dilute the ruling 
party's advantages. Contra leaders have urged Arias to go even further and 
demand an elected assembly to rewrite Nicaragua's constitution. 
</P>
<P>
More important to Ortega, who is seeking to normalize relations with the United 
States, is how each country's steps toward democracy under the peace accord 
will be judged for outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, he asked the other presidents to allow the Inter-American Human 
Rights Commission, an arm of the Organization of American States, to report 
every three months on each country's record. He also asked that the OAS and the 
United Nations send observers to monitor elections in each country.

BAKER FAILS TO BUDGE KOHL ON NATO MISSILES 
</P>

<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
attempted Monday to paper over their differences on the issue of NATO's 
short-range nuclear missiles, but they succeeded mainly in keeping the 
disagreement open -- and in raising the stakes for a planned alliance summit 
meeting this spring. 
</P>
<P>
The United States had hoped that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would 
agree this year to the development of modern battlefield missiles as a key part 
of alliance defenses. But Kohl has thrown that plan into serious doubt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kohl Under Pressure 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who has been under increased political pressure because of German 
dissatisfaction with the slow pace of arms control efforts, said more clearly 
than before that he wants negotiations to reduce the number of battlefield 
nuclear weapons in Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I want that, as a German, because these are weapons that affect us very 
directly," Kohl told reporters. "I don't know whether everyone in NATO . . . 
also wants a negotiating mandate in this area." 
</P>
<P>
Baker has said the United States believes that negotiations to reduce the 
battlefield missiles are inadvisable because U.S. strategists consider them a 
key part of NATO's defense against larger Soviet conventional armies. 
</P>
<P>
But polls in West Germany, where Kohl faces a general election next year, show 
a large majority in favor of reducing or abolishing the nuclear weapons, most 
of which, if used, would explode on German soil. 
</P>
<P>
Both Baker and Kohl attempted to minimize their differences over a closely 
related question -- the U.S. desire for an early NATO decision to build 
modernized short-range missiles -- but they acknowledged that the issue has not 
been solved. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that our discussions on this matter will continue," Baker told 
reporters after meeting with Kohl for almost two hours. "There is a commitment 
to resolve this through further discussions and negotiations. It would be in 
our view preferable if the decision could be made at the next summit." 
</P>
<P>
"This was not a decision meeting," Baker added. 
</P>
<P>
NATO's short-range nuclear missile, the Lance, has a range of 70 miles. The 
United States has been seeking a decision to build a new version, with a range 
of about 150 miles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision After Election 
</P>
<P>
But Kohl opened the question of modernizing the short-range force last week by 
telling a British newspaper that there is no need to make a decision until 1991 
or 1992, after his 1990 election date. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Kohl retreated slightly from that position. Aides said his mention 
of 1991 or 1992 referred to a decision to deploy new missiles. They suggested 
that a decision to modernize "in principle" could be made at the spring NATO 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
The timing is important to the Bush Administration in part because Congress may 
balk at spending the money to build a new missile without clear approval from 
the allies. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of Kohl's position on both nuclear missile issues -- negotiations 
with the Soviets and modernization -- may be to throw the problem into the laps 
of President Bush and other alliance leaders when they meet at the NATO summit, 
tentatively set for the last week in May. 
</P>
<P>
The summit will be charged with producing a new statement of NATO's objectives 
in both military defense and arms control, an exercise officials call "the 
comprehensive concept." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and European diplomats will meet during the next three months to seek a 
face-saving compromise for all sides, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Kohl's statements over the last week appear to put him squarely on both 
sides of the issues -- both skeptical of the need for modernization and then, 
when meeting with Baker, devoted to preserving NATO's defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Kohl expressly authorized him to announce that West Germany still 
endorses a 1988 NATO statement that called for modernization of both nuclear 
and conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
"I have found out that he was not backing off prior positions," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's signals on negotiations, however, seemed to embolden other U.S. allies 
to express their own interest in reducing short-range nuclear arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations could lead to a result which does not make modernization 
necessary," Norway's Foreign Minister, Thorvald Stoltenberg, told reporters 
after meeting with Baker in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the apparent disarray in the alliance, U.S. and West German officials 
said, is increasing European optimism about negotiations with Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- a sentiment fueled by Gorbachev's decision to withdraw 
six tank divisions from Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and other U.S. officials maintain that in East-West relations, Gorbachev 
is largely reacting to a Western agenda -- but they acknowledge that the Soviet 
leader has made it appear, at least, that he holds the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"There is just an attraction, an intriguing quality to Gorbachev," said a 
senior State Department official traveling with Baker. "You have to answer 
somehow -- but we have no answers." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who is at the midpoint of a weeklong, 15-country blitz of the NATO 
countries, visited Denmark and Norway on Monday before returning to West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to touch down in Turkey, Greece and Italy today, then to fly on 
to Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France before 
returning to Washington on Friday.

NORTH DEFENSE ASSAILS DEAL ON SECRET DATA; 
</P>
<P>
SAYS IT WOULD HIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION ON THIRD-COUNTRY AID 
</P>

<P>
Lt. Col. Oliver L. North's lawyers Monday objected to a proposed compromise on 
releasing classified information at his Iran-Contra trial, saying that the plan 
worked out by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and the Justice Department 
"would gut the defense and guarantee a 'cuckoo-clock' trial." 
</P>
<P>
North attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. said that the deal worked out over the 
weekend would hide "critical information about the Reagan Administration's 
third-country arrangements for military support of the (Nicaraguan) resistance 
and the official non-disclosure of those arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
With the trial of the former White House aide apparently delayed for at least 
several more days, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell temporarily dismissed 
jurors and planned to hear legal arguments by all sides today before deciding 
whether to adopt the proposed compromise and resume North's trial on 12 felony 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opening Statement 
</P>
<P>
North's lawyers said that they want the court's approval to tell jurors in 
their opening statement that former President Ronald Reagan and top officials 
of his Administration obtained aid from third countries to help rearm the 
Contras but planned to conceal the operation from Congress and the public. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise worked out between Justice Department lawyers and Walsh would 
ask Gesell to impose more stringent restrictions on what North's lawyers may 
disclose in court. Details of the compromise, however, remain under seal. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend agreement diffused a bitter confrontation between Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh, who wanted Gesell to prohibit a specific list of disclosures, and 
the independent prosecutors, who expressed satisfaction with Gesell's existing 
orders, which define broad categories of what may and may not be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporary Stay 
</P>
<P>
If Gesell accepts the compromise, the Justice Department said that it would ask 
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to dissolve a temporary stay of North's 
trial, which he imposed Sunday until the Supreme Court could consider the issue 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
However, in court papers that Gesell unsealed Monday, North's lawyers objected 
to any additional restrictions and called on the judge to hold fast to his 
earlier orders. They said, for example, that disclosure to jurors of U.S. 
efforts to obtain third-country military aid for the Contras -- to which 
government security analysts apparently have objected -- is "critical" to 
North's defense. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Sullivan and Barry S. Simon complained that the government 
has offered an inadequate stipulation of facts on this issue in an effort to 
have specific details squelched under terms of the Classified Information 
Procedures Act. 
</P>
<P>
"The stipulation omits critical details of those third-country arrangements, 
and it fails to acknowledge that President Reagan and other top Administration 
officials established a policy that the arrangements would not be disclosed 
outside the executive branch," the defense motion said. 
</P>
<P>
Such stipulations, Sullivan said, "would guarantee a 'cuckoo-clock' trial that 
would make a mockery of the adversarial process." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell has said that he is opposed to a "cuckoo-clock trial," a phrase he has 
used to describe constant objections by government intelligence experts to 
disclosure of state secrets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closed Session 
</P>
<P>
North's lawyers quoted Gesell as having said in a transcript of a closed 
session earlier this month that the third-country plan exemplified "the area of 
concealment, as I understand it, that is an issue in this case." They quoted 
the judge as saying further that North "should be entitled to have the jury see 
the circumstances under which he acted." 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers said that third-country military aid for the Contras was 
arranged at a time when Congress had forbidden the executive branch from 
providing military assistance to the rebels. The plan operated on a quid pro 
quo basis, meaning that the United States pledged to help the third countries 
in return, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Reagan, others who "participated personally and directly" in this 
policy included former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, former Defense 
Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, former National Security Adviser Robert C. 
McFarlane and the late William J. Casey, director of the CIA, the defense 
papers said. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional hearings into the Iran-Contra scandal two years ago disclosed 
that Brunei, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and at least 10 other unnamed countries 
provided Contra aid under this policy. But $10 million from the Sultan of 
Brunei mistakenly wound up in the wrong Swiss bank account. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell, in temporarily excusing jurors Monday morning, instructed them to phone 
him each afternoon to see if they might be needed the following morning. But he 
said that "it's not in the court's hands," a reference to the temporary stay 
that has been imposed by Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, ranking members of the Senate Intelligence Committee 
said that they have asked Thornburgh and CIA Director William H. Webster to 
testify about the classified documents issue in a closed session on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said that it expects to focus on Thornburgh's certification last 
month that sensitive material could not be provided to try North on the central 
charges of conspiracy and theft. As a result of Thornburgh's determination, 
those charges subsequently were dropped, leaving North to be tried on 12 lesser 
felony charges, including obstruction of congressional and presidential 
inquiries and making false statements to Congress.

CRITIC SURRENDERS IN BLYTHE BATTLE OVER MOVIE REVIEWS 
</P>

<P>
Blythe's lone film critic has resigned because the community's only movie 
theater has made it impossible for her to meet her newspaper's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Palo Verde Valley Times critic Cathy Monnett, who was banned from the Blythe 
Community Cinema in December because the owners said her reviews were too 
negative, had been fighting for permission to enter the theater and resume her 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Before she was banned, Monnett watched movies on Wednesday nights and wrote 
reviews, which were published in the community's only newspaper -- the weekly 
Palo Verde Valley Times -- on the following Friday. The newspaper is printed on 
Thursdays in Kingman, Ariz., about 180 miles north of Blythe. 
</P>
<P>
The theater, which is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, has decided to shut down 
on Wednesdays as well. The result: Monnett's reviews would not appear until the 
next week, by which time the theater would have changed films. 
</P>
<P>
"It made no sense to continue the fight," Monnett said. "Even if they let me in 
on Thursday, my reviews would not appear until the following week, and by that 
time they would be showing a different movie." 
</P>
<P>
When told that Monnett had quit her job, theater co-owner Paul Davis said, 
"Good," then referred all questions to his attorney and brother, Don Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Don Davis insisted that the decision to close the struggling 600-seat theater 
on Wednesdays was an economic one and not intended to prevent Monnett from 
doing her job. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not that important," Davis said. "The theater business is seasonal, and 
when business slows down . . . we close on Wednesdays." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the theater may reopen on Wednesdays around Easter and during the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"That's bunk; the connection is obvious," said Harold Stanford, editor of the 
paper, which has an average circulation of about 4,200. "They snookered us." 
</P>
<P>
As a temporary measure, Monnett had been driving to a movie theater in Yuma, 90 
miles away, to review the same films showing at the Blythe theater. Meanwhile, 
Monnett, who contends that her right to freedom of expression has been 
violated, considered taking legal action against the theater owners. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel cheated now because they basically got around a confrontation," Monnett 
said. "The way it worked out, it won't do us any good even if we take them to 
court." 
</P>
<P>
Monnett believes she won a partial victory on Feb. 3, however, when she was 
visited in Blythe by a crew from the syndicated television tabloid series 
"Inside Edition." With the television crew close behind, Monnett purchased a 
ticket and entered the theater. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis said, "We just ignored the issue that night because the press was 
trying to engineer a confrontation. . . . She is still welcome as a person, but 
not as a reviewer." 
</P>
<P>
Glen Sparlin, publisher of the Palo Verde Valley Times, said there are no 
immediate plans to hire a new movie critic. Instead, Sparlin said, the 
newspaper is considering an option to contract with a syndicated movie 
reviewer. 
</P>
<P>
"We all wish this would have ended in a solid victory," Monnett said. "I guess 
this small-minded attitude is going to continue in this town."

COURT SAYS PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES MUST EQUIP NEW BUSES WITH WHEELCHAIR LIFTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court on Monday ordered the U.S. Department of Transportation 
to require transit authorities across the country to equip new buses with 
wheelchair lifts. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys who brought the lawsuit that led to the ruling called it the most 
important decision ever handed down for handicapped people needing public 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-1 decision by the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals was made on an appeal 
by both the Transportation Department and a coalition of a number of 
associations for the handicapped from across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department had appealed an earlier decision made by U.S. 
District Judge Marvin Katz in Philadelphia that canceled a 1986 department 
regulation calling for mass-transit authorities to spend up to 3% of their 
operating budgets on providing services for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Unreasonable 
</P>
<P>
In his decision, Katz called the 3% requirement unreasonable, but ruled that 
the Transportation Department must formulate regulations to resolve differences 
between equality for the handicapped and cost efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said the 3% spending limit allowed transit agencies "to eviscerate the 
civil right" to transit service that Congress mandated for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transportation, a coalition of about a 
dozen associations for the handicapped, appealed Katz's simultaneous ruling 
that upheld the right of transit authorities to decide whether to fit vehicles 
for the handicapped or provide other services. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruling affirmed Katz's decision in favor of dropping the 3% 
provision, but it reversed Katz's other decision by ordering the authorities to 
equip all new buses with chair lifts or other accommodations for the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Burden Seen 
</P>
<P>
"We . . . conclude that ordering that newly purchased buses be accessible to 
the mobility disabled does not exact a fundamental alteration to the nature of 
mass transportation," Judge Carol Mansmann wrote in the majority opinion. 
"Also, by requiring that newly purchased buses be accessible, we are not 
imposing undue financial or administrative burdens on the local transit 
authorities." 
</P>
<P>
The court said a rule requiring reservations 24 hours in advance for use of 
alternative transportation hinders the spontaneous use of mass transit by the 
handicapped. As a result, the court ordered transit authorities to make 
"reasonable accommodations to their programs, i.e. purchase 
wheelchair-accessible buses." 
</P>
<P>
"Congress wanted to provide the disabled with the capability to utilize mass 
transit to the 'maximum extent feasible.' The DOT has failed to show that 
requiring the future purchase of accessible buses oversteps this legislative 
intent," Mansmann wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In the dissenting opinion, Judge Morton I. Greenberg said the section requiring 
new buses to be accessible was not meant to apply to transit systems choosing a 
paratransit system, such as special vans. 
</P>
<P>
He also contended the 3% spending cap was not arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the majority's decision will be very substantial throughout the 
country and will interfere with the local decision-making authority," Greenberg 
wrote. "I feel the court is overreaching." 
</P>
<P>
Timothy M. Cook, who argued the case before the court, said the ruling was "a 
major, major victory for the handicapped community. . . . We can't say enough 
positive things about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes for No Appeal 
</P>
<P>
Cook, who is director of the Washington-based National Disability Action 
Center, said he hoped the ruling would not be appealed in light of President 
Bush's recent comments about wanting to bring the handicapped into the 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Department officials in Washington could not be reached for 
comment after the court ruling was made public late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Joaquin Bowman, a spokesman for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation 
Authority, said he could not comment on the court's decision because SEPTA has 
not had a chance to review the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
SEPTA's handicapped accessibility program includes paratransit and accessible 
buses, he said. However, he said, he did not know whether all new buses were 
handicapped accessible.

BUSH FACING FIRST TROUBLE IN HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRATS SET VOTE ON FOREIGN INVESTOR BILL HE OPPOSES

<P>
The House Democratic leadership is loading up for its first major political 
salvo at President Bush -- scheduling a certain-to-be-partisan vote next week 
on a controversial provision to require the registration of most foreign 
investment in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The move was ordered by House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) despite assurances by 
Wright and other House leaders that Democrats will cooperate with Bush in 
hammering out bipartisan solutions to such problems as reducing the federal 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
News of the move took the Bush Administration by surprise, angering White House 
officials, who had expected the Democrats to hold back on overtly partisan 
gestures until the negotiations over the federal budget were well under way. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic strategists said that the Speaker hopes to use the vote to "draw a 
battle line" early on between the Democrats and the Administration. They said 
that Wright wants to portray the Democrats as populists who care about such 
issues as foreign investment, while Republicans ostensibly do not. 
</P>
<P>
Next week's ballot, after the House returns from its Presidents' Day recess, 
will be Congress' first formal vote of the year -- apart from last week's 
rejection of the congressional pay raise legislation, which had not been on the 
original agenda. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reagan Also Opposed Measure 
</P>
<P>
Strategists say that the Administration is in a quandary. Like former President 
Ronald Reagan before him, Bush opposes the provision vehemently, but officials 
say that he does not want to take a high-profile stand on it for fear of 
playing into congressional Democrats' hands. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has not yet decided how to meet the Democratic threat. 
Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee are considering proposing a 
less-sweeping substitute that they hope will defuse the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal Wright wants to resurrect -- known as the Bryant amendment, after 
its key sponsor, Rep. John Bryant (D-Tex.) -- was a major point of friction 
between Democrats and Republicans in last year's debate over the broad package 
of legislation that overhauled the nation's trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would require the registration -- and public disclosure -- of all 
foreign investments that exceed 10% ownership of an American company, piece of 
real estate or other asset. Although the legislation failed in the Senate, it 
has been passed twice by the House. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration vigorously opposed the provision when Wright tried to 
tack it on to the trade bill last year, contending that it would only 
discourage foreign investment, which the United States needs to help finance 
American borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders argue that registration is needed to help keep track of the 
growth of foreign investment. They fear that the nation's security will be 
endangered if too much of the U.S. economy is under foreign control. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of possible enactment sent tremors through the financial markets 
last year. Many investors regard registration requirements as a prelude to 
stricter controls. Reagan listed the Bryant proposal as one of four provisions 
that would have made him veto the trade bill. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional staff members say that the revival of the measure next week was 
ordered personally by Wright. The House Rules Committee has called a meeting 
for next Tuesday to release the legislation from a House committee and send it 
immediately to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
House sources say that Wright plans to bring the Bryant legislation before the 
full House the next day. It is expected to be passed by a large -- and 
overwhelmingly Democratic -- majority. Most Republicans oppose the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee are considering proposing a 
more limited measure that would expand current statistics on investment trends 
without requiring registration. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative, being drafted by Rep. Edward F. Feighan (D-Ohio), would 
require registration of foreign investment, possibly with the congressional 
General Accounting Office, but would not force investors to make their 
transactions public. 
</P>
<P>
Most trade analysts agree that the issue is mainly a political one. Although 
foreign investment has increased in recent years, much of it is needed to 
finance government and corporate borrowing in the United States without pushing 
domestic interest rates up. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO reported recently that, although foreign investors spent a record $15.5 
billion in hostile takeovers of American companies during the first six months 
of 1988, the figure included only six actual transactions -- and accounted for 
75% of all foreign acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the foreign investment in U.S. factories and real estate is by 
investors in Britain and the Netherlands, according to the GAO and Treasury 
Department. Japan has also been increasing its investment in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
American corporations have invested heavily overseas since the end of World War 
II.

For decades, Spain's Socialist Party and Socialist labor unions have run like 
twin trains on parallel tracks. Now they are hurtling toward a collision that 
could rattle Spain's prospering young democracy. 
</P>
<P>
After six years of Socialist government, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez looks 
at Spain's buoyant economy with satisfaction. Gonzalez, aloof and elegant, sees 
a bright future for a brawny Spain in a united Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the unions, historically Spanish socialism's staunchest ally, see 
broken promises. They feel abandoned by their old friend, Felipe. Where has all 
the socialism gone? they wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"When Gonzalez talks, the entrepreneurs applaud. His policies are typically of 
the right. If he were (British Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher, it would be 
easy to understand, but this is supposed to be a Socialist government," 
complained Jose A. Saracibar, chief negotiator for the Union General de 
Trabajadores, Spain's largest union and a wellspring of political strength for 
Gonzalez' Socialist Workers' Party.

Last month, Socialist and Communist unions stunned Gonzalez with a 24-hour 
nationwide general strike -- the first in 54 years -- that shut down the 
country down. As many as 8 million of Spain's 12 million workers stayed home to 
protest government economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Protests Vowed 
</P>
<P>
Repeated rounds of talks between the government and the unions failed to narrow 
money and policy differences, and on Feb. 8 talks were broken off and the 
unions vowed new protests while awaiting Gonzalez's state of the union address 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Storming from one late-night negotiating session that he described as a "total 
failure," Gonzalez said surrender to union demands would undermine government 
social and economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer a thousand times to go home than to lead a puppet government," 
the prime minister thundered. 
</P>
<P>
The unions are demanding wage increases to keep pace with last year's inflation 
rate of 5.8%, a higher minimum wage, improved pensions and expanded benefits 
for Spain's nearly 3 million unemployed. The government insists that meeting 
the demands would revive an inflation that has been steadily reduced from 14% 
when Gonzalez took office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speculation on Election 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was reelected to a new four-year term in 1986, but the present impasse 
has encouraged speculation that he may feel obliged to call mid-year elections 
in quest of a renewed mandate. Political handicappers think Gonzalez would win 
-- but probably at the cost of his current absolute majority in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
What is irking to their traditionalist brethren is that some Gonzalez 
Socialists appear to have abandoned ideology for opportunism. Some of those who 
came to power with Gonzalez have gotten rich, and by now nearly all of them are 
stylish. In many ways, their critics on the left charge, Spain's "capitalist 
socialists" have become social democrats: the same sort of well-dressed 
establishment pillars as Italy's Gucci Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez this month fired the modish head of Spanish national television 
because she had stocked her wardrobe on government funds. There are questions 
about some officials' expensive new homes and the provenance of a Cabinet 
minister's piano. Gonzalez himself likes to relax on a yacht the government 
bought for Generalissimo Francisco Franco, the late Spanish leader. Doughty 
Spanish workers who clung to egalitarian beliefs when fascist police made them 
dangerous are not amused now. 
</P>
<P>
When union leaders wonder if success has spoiled Felipe Gonzalez, they think 
back a decade to the national political and economic consensus devised to speed 
Spain toward modernization after four decades of isolation that ended with 
Franco's death in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Fruits of the consensus have not only stoked dramatic economic growth, twice 
the European average in recent years, but also have helped consolidate the 
blossoming democracy that Gonzalez, 46, dreams of leading into the 21st 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1980 we agreed to a sacrifice, to accept salary increases lower than the 
rate of inflation," said Saracibar. "The sacrifices got results, and since 1986 
the economy has been good -- except that now there is no agreement from the 
government or employers about sharing the benefits. They don't want agreements, 
but our surrender." 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish economy has recorded powerful, business-led growth of 5% in each of 
the last three years. But last year's wage increases were based on the 
government's projected rate of 3% inflation, only about half the final figure. 
</P>
<P>
Government policies kind to Spanish capitalists have encouraged both new 
investment and restructuring of existing industries to make them more 
competitive with Spain's partners in the European Community. Along the way, 
unemployment has grown to become Spain's biggest economic headache. At 18.8%, 
it is currently the highest in Europe. Unions seek expanded coverage that would 
protect about half the unemployed instead of the current one-third. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the specific issues is a personal showdown between Gonzalez and 
Nicolas Redondo, head of the Socialist union. It is both a question of who is 
in charge and where the country is headed. 
</P>
<P>
Socialism in Spain has traditionally meant a left-of-center political vision 
favoring the working class. It matured as a clear alternative to communism on 
the one hand and conservative capitalism on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez is as Socialist as ever, his supporters aver, but they say he has 
adapted socialism to the demands of governing a modern state. 
</P>
<P>
"Felipe said very early that he wanted to preside over a 'socialism of wealthy' 
and not a 'socialism of poverty,' " said Elena Flores, a foreign relations 
specialist for Gonzalez' party. Gonzalez supporters realize that the same old 
recipes will not work any more, she said; they have become more modern, but the 
unions have not. 
</P>
<P>
"They remain in an era of confrontation and demands," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
From where union leaders like Redondo and Saracibar sit, the issue is one of 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
"The policies of the Gonzalez government are not the historic policies of the 
party," Saracibar complained. "The party itself has become only a sounding 
board for the government, and the Parliament is also firmly in government 
hands. Therefore we, de facto, have become the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
The government is strong and the unions are relatively weak, but if a showdown 
comes, some bumps are in prospect as Spain gears up for the scheduled 1992 
economic unification of the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
"Gonzalez can win a new election, but he cannot govern effectively against the 
opposition of Spanish workers," Saracibar warned.

A supersonic Concorde jet en route to New York with 69 passengers returned to 
Paris after cracks appeared in a porthole as the plane was nearly halfway 
across the Atlantic, Air France said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Air France Flight 001 was at 59,000 feet and had just reached supersonic speed 
Sunday when the cracks were noticed at the top of the outermost of four glass 
plates in one porthole, said Air France spokesman Laurent Kressman. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not know who first noticed the cracks about 90 minutes into the 
3 hour and 45 minute flight. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot slowed the jet, dropped to 32,000 feet and returned to Charles de 
Gaulle airport, Kressman said. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers were put aboard another Concorde, but departure was delayed, and 
travelers on the high-tech jet arrived about nine hours after the normal 
arrival time for the trans-Atlantic Air France flight to New York. 
</P>
<P>
"They were not very, very happy," said Kressman.

BAKER URGES W. EUROPE TO PRESSURE NICARAGUA

Secretary of State James A. Baker III is urging West European countries to put 
pressure on Nicaragua by tying their economic aid to the Central American 
country's internal political situation, a senior State Department official said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Baker told the foreign ministers of Denmark and Norway -- North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization allies that send aid to Nicaragua -- that the Bush Administration 
wants to "give diplomacy a chance" to end the seven-year Nicaraguan civil war, 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual twist, he asked the two governments, which have been largely 
sympathetic to the leftist Managua regime, to support U.S. policy by using 
their aid as a tool to push the Sandinistas toward more internal democracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Give Diplomacy a Chance' 
</P>
<P>
Baker told the Scandinavians "that we would hope that (they) would help us give 
diplomacy a chance . . . by at least having that aid addressed to . . . 
democratization and freedom of religion and freedom of the press," the aide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Norway gives Nicaragua about $16 million a year in aid. Among the NATO allies, 
Denmark, Italy, France and Spain also have significant aid programs, consisting 
almost entirely of food and other humanitarian aid. A total of $94.5 million in 
West European aid reached Nicaragua last year, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cool Response 
</P>
<P>
The immediate response from the Danish and Norwegian governments to Baker's 
proposal was cool, a U.S. official acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"For most of them," he said, "it is not a comfortable concept." 
</P>
<P>
Aid to the Sandinistas is a publicly popular program in most European 
countries, where governments have not campaigned against the Managua regime as 
did the Reagan Administration. Washington supports the Contras, the Nicaraguan 
rebels who are fighting the regime. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's predecessor as secretary of state, George P. Shultz, frequently advised 
European governments that he considered aid to Managua a mistake. But Baker's 
proposal is believed to be the first that the U.S. government has made 
suggesting the linking of European aid policy so closely to American pressure 
on Managua. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was in Denmark and Norway as part of a weeklong, 15-country dash through 
the NATO countries, his first trip abroad as secretary of state.

CRANSTON ASKS ANNUAL PACIFIC RIM SUMMITS

<P>
Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston on Monday proposed annual summits at which 
President Bush would discuss economics and regional security with leaders of 
Japan, China and other nations on the Pacific Rim, including the Soviet Union 
when it would be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's plan for a yearly "Pacific Basin Forum" was contained in a letter to 
the President released on the eve of Senate hearings on East Asian and Pacific 
affairs that California's senior senator has scheduled in Los Angeles on 
Wednesday and San Francisco on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Imaginative, energetic diplomacy can help us build new relationships with 
former adversaries while reducing inevitable irritants in our relationships 
with allies," Cranston wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"I recommend that the United States lead in the establishment of a Pacific 
Basin Forum to pursue discussions of regional economic and security concerns," 
Cranston added. "These summits should include China, Japan, South Korea, 
Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and 
other key nations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"The new forum should also make a deliberate effort to involve the Soviets, as 
appropriate, as well as their allies, North Korea and Vietnam, in a dialogue 
about such common concerns as free trade, economic development and 
environmental protection." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said he will be working with others to introduce legislation 
encouraging such an approach and authorizing U.S. participation. On a related 
issue, the California lawmaker said that the United States should negotiate 
with the Philippines for at least a 10-year lease on U.S. military 
installations -- Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base. Both leases expire in 
1991. Relocation of the facilities, he said, would cost $10 billion and sharply 
reduce traditional ties between Washington and Manila. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cranston said that the United States should ask Japan to shoulder 
more of the costs now paid by the United States to keep its military forces in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's hearings begin at 10 a.m. at the James West Center at UCLA. 
Thursday's hearings begin at 9:30 a.m. at the World Affairs Council, 312 Sutter 
St., in San Francisco.

EAST BLOC DATA ON CONVENTIONAL FORCES MAY EASE TALKS 
</P>

<P>
The Warsaw Pact's recently released estimates of the balance of East Bloc and 
Western forces in Europe offer the potential for early resolution of some of 
the thorny issues that have impeded an agreement to reduce non-nuclear forces, 
U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Warsaw Pact numbers differ significantly from North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization figures, particularly in their estimate of NATO's strength, 
they are, in the words of one U.S. official, "in the right ballpark." They hold 
the potential for early agreement at the East-West Conventional Forces in 
Europe (CFE) talks, which will open in Vienna on March 9, officials said this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, a senior State Department official said, publication Jan. 
30 of the Warsaw Pact's data on military forces could open the way to an accord 
on overflights by aircraft of each side of the other's territory and the 
stationing of monitors at key rail and road intersections. Such accords are 
necessary to assure that each side can verify that the other is abiding by any 
arms reduction formula. 
</P>
<P>
Implementation of such small steps as they are settled, rather than waiting for 
all matters to be resolved and promulgated in one large package, would maintain 
a momentum toward a full-blown agreement, which the Soviet Union appears to 
want within the next three to four years, the State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
In broad outline, the NATO proposal to be laid before the Vienna meeting calls 
for reductions in tanks, artillery and armored troop carriers to 95% of current 
NATO levels. The Warsaw Pact has numerical superiority in these areas, 
according to its own statements as well as those of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approach Not Disclosed 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact has yet to disclose its approach to the Vienna talks, but U.S. 
officials believe that Moscow will seek cuts in tactical aircraft and naval 
forces as well as in land equipment. The Soviets believe that NATO has the 
advantage in these areas, particularly in ground-support aircraft that have 
superior range, electronics and payload capacities. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets have accepted the West's conceptual approach to the CFE talks -- 
that there are asymmetries between the two sides that should be eliminated," a 
senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is that we approach equipment as the basic guide. It is easier 
to verify, and it is the weaponry that captures and holds ground," he added. 
"The Soviets may want to throw . . . personnel as well as aircraft and naval 
vessels into the pot." 
</P>
<P>
While a negotiated outcome in Vienna is far from certain, U.S. officials do not 
expect the talks to dribble on endlessly, like the Mutual and Balanced Force 
Reduction Talks that lasted 15 years before expiring last year without any 
result. 
</P>
<P>
Two general pathways are seen: a comprehensive agreement in three to four 
years, or piecemeal steps that are implemented along the way to the 
comprehensive settlement. Several key senators, including Georgia Democrat Sam 
Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, have told State 
Department officials that they favor the piecemeal approach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Details Ever 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials welcomed the Warsaw Pact figures -- the first detailed data on 
military strength ever published by that alliance -- because with them the East 
Bloc admitted to a huge numerical advantage in all three categories of land 
equipment. The result is that the ratio of Warsaw to NATO forces to be reduced, 
under the NATO proposal, is not as disparate as the numbers suggest and 
therefore seems less irreconcilable. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of tanks, for example, NATO contends that it is outnumbered 
51,500 to 16,424. The Warsaw Pact claims an advantage of 59,470 to 30,690. 
Based on NATO figures, the Warsaw Pact would have to withdraw 44 tanks for 
every one taken out by NATO to reach the proposed 95% of NATO levels. Based on 
the Warsaw Pact figures, the reduction would be 20 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Different "counting rules" in all categories explain some of the numerical 
discrepancies and indicate why these negotiations will be more complex and 
difficult than the nuclear arms talks. 
</P>
<P>
NATO counts artillery pieces (and mortars and rocket launchers) down to 100 
millimeters, but the Warsaw Pact figures include such pieces down to the 
75-millimeter size. Warsaw Pact figures for armored personnel carriers include 
smaller vehicles, which NATO ignores, and light as well as heavy tanks. NATO 
counts only the heavy tanks. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first orders of business at the new conventional forces talks -- 
they were initially named Conventional Armed Forces in Europe talks before 
officials became concerned that the acronym, CAFE, suggested frivolity -- will 
be to establish common counting rules in these categories. 
</P>
<P>
While land, sea and air forces will be discussed in the talks, the basic 
"trade" that the Soviets appear to seek is Warsaw Pact tanks in exchange for 
NATO tactical aircraft. The East argues that NATO has a slight advantage in 
both fixed-wing combat aircraft and helicopters, 16,475 to 13,444, while NATO 
insists that the Warsaw Pact has a major advantage, 11,950 to 6,396. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NATO Objection 
</P>
<P>
NATO objects in principle to negotiating reductions in aircraft, arguing that 
air support is not vital in an invasion (although obviously preferable). Many 
invasions have succeeded without air cover, the official said, and ground 
cannot be captured with aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
If NATO fails to bar consideration of aircraft, it will insist that the Warsaw 
Pact adopt more realistic counting rules. Now, the Warsaw Pact figures count 
only those aircraft whose primary mission is support for ground forces, 
excluding fighter-interceptors whose mission is air defense. 
</P>
<P>
NATO contends that most interceptor aircraft can be used for ground-support 
missions, that Soviet fighters are equipped to carry bombs if necessary and 
that Soviet pilots train 5% to 10% of the time for ground attack.

SHEVARDNADZE TO TOUR MIDDLE EAST IN QUEST FOR PEACE

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will begin a five-nation tour of 
the Middle East this week aimed at achieving a "tangible breakthrough" in 
settling the Arab-Israeli conflict, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
Vadim Perfiliev, a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Shevardnadze will 
visit Syria Feb. 17-19, Jordan on Feb. 19, Egypt, Feb. 20-22; Iraq, Feb. 23-25, 
and Iran, Feb. 25-27. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze's visit is evidence of an increasing Soviet role in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
According to Perfiliev, Shevardnadze's trip "will take place in the framework 
of the Soviet Union's consistent efforts to achieve a comprehensive and just 
settlement in the Middle East, taking into account the interests of all people 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
"We seek to attain a tangible breakthrough in settling this old conflict," he 
said, without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin supports the idea of an international Middle East peace conference 
to be attended by the parties to the conflict, plus the United States, Soviet 
Union and other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has made restoration of Soviet-Israeli relations, severed by the Soviet 
Union in 1967, a precondition for a Soviet role in Mideast talks. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein said Sunday he was "quite optimistic" an international 
conference on Arab-Israeli peace could take place soon. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a reporter's question, Perfiliev said he does not know whether 
Shevardnadze will meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens or with Yasser 
Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Israel has refused to 
take part in any negotiations involving the PLO.

Bill Schumacher knew his wife was dying. 
</P>
<P>
Genevieve, the first woman he ever kissed, the mother of his six children, his 
wife of 52 years, was in a coma. Only a respirator sustained what life remained 
in her frail body. 
</P>
<P>
So Schumacher made his pact with God. He prayed that Genevieve would go 
quickly. And, in return, Schumacher made a promise -- he would become a priest. 
</P>
<P>
On that day in 1984, Bill Schumacher was 75 years old. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Am Ready Now' 
</P>
<P>
God kept his end of the bargain. Genevieve died four days later in a Chicago 
hospital. And Schumacher recalls thinking then: "Lord, I am ready now." 
</P>
<P>
Thus began an odyssey of religious commitment that would eventually lead to 
Schumacher's ordination into the priesthood last year, only a few days shy of 
his 80th birthday. It would lead him to St. Patrick's Church in Dallas, where a 
bishop believed Schumacher could make a contribution despite advancing years. 
It would, in fact, bring him a certain amount of fame, for only one man has 
been ordained in the United States at a more advanced age. 
</P>
<P>
At the start, though, his quest had the look of failure. Not many seminaries 
are eager to take a man who is at the outer edge of the actuarial charts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Told He Was Too Old 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher sent out dozens of letters to seminaries asking for admission. Some 
didn't bother to reply. Others wrote but said he was far too old. Some wrote 
back asking for donations. Finally, Schumacher found Holy Apostle Seminary near 
Hartford, Conn., one of the few places that admit older men. 
</P>
<P>
Being older was one thing and being Schumacher's age was quite another. The 
seminary said that it would accept Schumacher, but only if he found a bishop to 
sponsor him, to guarantee, in effect, that there was a job waiting for the 
aging aspirant. 
</P>
<P>
The search began anew. Schumacher wrote letters to 39 dioceses and got back 32 
replies, most of them negative. But one man called him. It was Bishop Thomas 
Tschoepe of Dallas, who agreed to sponsor him. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked like a good prospect, so we took him," the bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was done. Schumacher called a meeting of all his children to tell them 
he planned to enter the seminary. They only smiled, having long since figured 
out what their father was up to. 
</P>
<P>
The study for the priesthood began in earnest. Schumacher's dorm room was the 
worst in the seminary, one directly under the stairwell, and he was often 
awakened by footsteps in the late night. 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher tacked a portrait of Jesus to his door, as well as a sign that said: 
"Old age ain't for sissies." Each day, he walked 102 steps up a hill from 
classroom to dorm room. 
</P>
<P>
Three years of this, and his studies were complete. Schumacher chose his home 
parish in Chicago for the ordination. Bishop Tschoepe performed the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Television Cameras Roll 
</P>
<P>
The television cameras rolled on that day, for word had gotten around that 
Schumacher was the oldest man ever to be ordained in the United States. 
(Subsequently, a priest was found in rural North Carolina who had been ordained 
shortly after his 80th birthday.) 
</P>
<P>
Friends on vacation in the Soviet Union saw the ordination on the evening news 
in Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
"I have reached my goal," a tearful Schumacher said that day. 
</P>
<P>
Father Schumacher's new chalice was adorned with the ring he gave Genevieve on 
their 50th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Son Presents Plaque 
</P>
<P>
His son, Richard, presented him with a plaque that said: "You're never too old 
to start something," words of advice the father had given the son years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Now Schumacher says Mass daily at St. Patrick's. He visits the sick and the 
aged and hears the confessions of parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
"He has added a new dimension to the parish," said Msgr. Richard Johnson, St. 
Patrick's pastor. 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher has baptized his great-grandson and performed the wedding ceremony 
for one of his 12 grandchildren. He has adjusted well to the priestly life. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great that the opportunity has been given to me to serve other people," 
Schumacher said in his office the other day. "I've got a useful life ahead of 
me."

New pressures for funding, fame and profit have created an atmosphere that is 
sometimes conducive to scientific misconduct, the chairman of an Institute of 
Medicine study committee reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arthur H. Rubenstein of the University of Chicago said the field of 
biomedical research has seen "increased stresses" from competition for 
decreased funding. And he said the race to develop new drugs makes research 
irregularities more likely than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Medicine report also said research institutions need tighter 
standards and systematic ways of investigating laboratory irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the committee believes that serious misconduct in science is rare . . 
. it concludes that institutions fail to detect and correct early deviant 
behavior primarily because of an excessively permissive research environment 
that tolerates careless practices," the committee report said. 
</P>
<P>
Funding pressures and an overemphasis on publication of research in scientific 
journals also encourage what the committee called "substandard practices." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Guidelines Noted 
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Medicine, chartered by the National Academy of Sciences, 
organized the 17-member committee in 1987 after a series of fraudulent and 
careless laboratory reports had come to light. 
</P>
<P>
Few institutions, the report said, have explicit research guidelines and this 
allows the system "to tolerate substandard activities by a small number of 
individual investigators who fail to observe generally accepted practices." 
</P>
<P>
To correct the problems, the committee made 16 recommendations. These included: 
</P>
<P>
* That by 1992 all institutions conducting medical research for the National 
Institutes of Health be required to adopt specific policies to promote ethical 
research practices and to investigate misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
* That the NIH limit the number of publications considered in a grant 
application so that evaluations of a researcher's past work are based on 
quality, not quantity. 
</P>
<P>
* Academic departments should adopt new authorship policies that will not 
emphasize quantity. 
</P>
<P>
* That scientific journals develop policies "to promote responsible authorship 
practices," including a system to respond to charges of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
* That researchers receive training by institutions and professional 
organizations in proper standards of scientific research.

HEAD OF RELIGIOUS NETWORK ANSWERS ALLEGATIONS;

<P>
TRINITY BROADCASTING FOUNDER, ACCUSED OF UNETHICAL CONDUCT, CALLS FOR HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The founder and president of the Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting Network has 
responded for the first time to allegations of unethical conduct and business 
practices and is demanding a hearing before the Ethics Committee of the 
National Religious Broadcasters, which is investigating the network. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Paul F. Crouch also acknowledged, in a letter to the NRB, that in 1981 
"I probably did pray that God would kill anyone or anything that was attempting 
to destroy the ministry. My prayer has not changed today." 
</P>
<P>
Trinity, now a 24-hour-a-day Christian programming service, was founded by 
Crouch and several other backers in 1973. Since then, Crouch has assumed total 
control of the network, which has experienced spectacular growth and now 
encompasses more than 100 television stations in the United States and more 
than 20 overseas stations. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Feb. 2 that Crouch and Trinity were the subjects of an 
investigation by the NRB's Ethics Committee, in part because of complaints that 
Crouch used unethical practices in building and acquiring Christian television 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch gave The Times two letters of response to Richard Bott Sr., the chairman 
of the ethics panel. Crouch told Bott he was "deeply grieved and offended by 
your actions as head of the NRB Ethics Committee," adding that "I now demand a 
hearing before your committee." 
</P>
<P>
Bott has said that Crouch would have 30 days to respond to the complaints 
before the NRB decided whether Trinity could retain membership in the voluntary 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics committee is looking into two formal complaints against the network. 
</P>
<P>
The first, made in a sworn affidavit by the Rev. Keith A. Houser of Irving, 
Tex., grew out of a dispute over control of an upstate New York television 
station that is now owned by Trinity. The Federal Communications Commission has 
ruled in favor of Trinity, but the matter is scheduled to be decided soon in 
civil court in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Houser alleged in court documents that Crouch unethically took over the New 
York station, which Houser said he founded. Crouch joined with other station 
board members, Houser alleged, and "cut deals with these parties without my 
prior knowledge and virtually started a hostile takeover of the television 
station." 
</P>
<P>
The second complaint was made in a letter to Bott from Marvin L. Martin, an 
Orange County resident who said he worked for Crouch for 10 years, until 1981. 
His duties, he said in the letter, included producing Paul and Jan Crouch's 
nightly talk show, "Praise the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
A copy of Martin's letter was obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Martin wrote Bott that before Trinity's spring fund-raising effort in 1981, "I 
gave Paul Crouch a letter demanding his and Jan's resignation because of their 
moral and financial improprieties. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Martin declined Monday to elaborate on his letter, and the substance of his 
allegations could not immediately be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
In his response, Crouch said he denied "categorically" Martin's allegations, 
characterizing them as "mostly fabrications and outright lies from a bitter and 
sick mind." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch referred to Martin's "infamous letter of demand for my resignation . . . 
he did produce such a letter and I fired him on the spot. His allegations about 
'moral and financial improprieties' were just as vague then as they are now." 
</P>
<P>
Once, Martin wrote, at a staff prayer meeting, "Crouch prayed aloud in my 
presence that God would 'kill' a man in the community who had filed for an FCC 
license to take over TBN's flagship station" in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch acknowledges that "I did pray for the wrath of God to fall on enemies of 
TBN who at the time were attempting to take the license of KTBN-Channel 40. 
This would have destroyed the entire ministry, which was just beginning to 
burst forth with growth. At the time we had four TV stations. Today, eight 
years later, we have 154. I probably did pray that God would kill anyone or 
anything that was attempting to destroy the ministry. My prayer has not changed 
today."

Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities were mixed, with rates on 
six-month bills climbing to the highest level in nearly four years. The 
Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at an average 
discount rate of 8.49%, down from 8.57% last week. Another $7.2 billion was 
sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.54%, up from 8.53% 
last week. The rates for six-month bills were the highest since April 8, 1985, 
when they averaged 8.56%. The rates for three-month bills were the lowest since 
they averaged 8.33% on Jan. 30. The new discount rates understate the actual 
return to investors -- 8.80% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,785.40, and 9.05% for a six-month bill selling for $9,568.30.

PACIFIC TEL CAN HOLD STAKE IN OVERSEAS CABLE 
</P>

Pacific Telesis Group was granted permission on Monday to own up to 10% of a 
Japanese telecommunications consortium, allowing it to become the first of the 
seven U.S. regional phone companies to participate in a major foreign 
long-distance venture. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene could make San 
Francisco-based Pacific Telesis the first U.S. company to have an ownership 
interest in the Japanese end of a transpacific telecommunications venture. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Commerce Department and the Federal Communications Commission have 
strongly supported U.S. participation in the Japanese consortium, called 
International Digital Co., and no assurances exist that any other American 
company besides Pacific Telesis would be granted that opportunity, Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is expected to stimulate competition and technological development 
among other American telecommunications companies seeking to invest in the 
fast-growing business of using high-capacity optical cable for transoceanic 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Significant Advance 
</P>
<P>
If Pacific Telesis' request was denied, "not only would an immediate foreign 
trade opportunity be lost, but the United States could also lose a long-term 
opportunity to influence policies that could open more Japanese markets," 
Greene wrote in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity for Pacific as an American company to participate in the 
Japanese end of communications in competition with what was formerly a Japanese 
monopoly," said Brian D. Kidney, a Pacific Telesis spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's decision represents a significant advance beyond the limitations 
imposed on Pacific Telesis and the six other "Baby Bell" regional phone firms 
when they were created in the 1984 breakup of American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co. The divestiture decree granted the Baby Bells monopolies over 
local telephone service in their assigned regions. 
</P>
<P>
But under the decree, which Greene administers, the Baby Bells were prohibited 
from entering certain businesses where they could use their regional monopoly 
powers to gain unfair advantages over competitors. 
</P>
<P>
In granting the waiver for Pacific Telesis to enter the foreign long-distance 
market, Greene ruled that the venture did not raise the monopoly powers issue. 
He noted that the transpacific cable would enter North America through Oregon, 
which is outside the territory controlled by Pacific Telesis and thus it would 
not have direct access to it. 
</P>
<P>
However, while granting the Pacific Telesis waiver, Greene on Monday denied a 
similar one requested by New York-based Nynex Co. to take a 50% interest in a 
transatlantic telecommunications venture with Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless 
Co. Greene ruled that the transatlantic cable would have linked Europe to New 
York City, which Nynex serves.

The founder of Recruit Co. and three other businessmen were arrested in a 
stock-trading scandal that has shaken Japan's governing party and contributed 
to its loss in a special parliamentary election. The opposition Japan Socialist 
Party, victorious in Sunday's by-election, demanded that Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita resign or dissolve Parliament "so the people can express their will" 
about the Recruit scandal. Recruit reportedly sold thousands of unlisted shares 
of stock at bargain prices to politicians, their aides and other prominent 
people. The purchasers then profited when the stocks were publicly traded and 
skyrocketed in value. The four who were arrested were Hiromasa Ezoe, founder 
and former chairman of the information services conglomerate; a vice president 
of a Recruit subsidiary and two former officials of Nippon Telegraph &amp; 
Telephone, Japan's largest firm.

DOUGLAS UNDERGOES BIG SHAKE-UP; 
</P>
<P>
9 EXECUTIVES NAMED TO POSTS IN BID TO FOCUS ON QUALITY

In a major executive shake-up and reorganization, McDonnell Douglas Chief 
Executive John F. McDonnell removed any doubt Monday that he intends to reshape 
the firm's Douglas Aircraft unit in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of more than 5,000 managers called inside a paint hangar at 
Douglas, McDonnell disclosed a top-to-bottom reorganization of the commercial 
aircraft company, including the appointment of nine new executives to head up 
programs and special business areas. 
</P>
<P>
The action follows closely last month's decision by McDonnell to name Robert H. 
Hood the new president of Douglas, replacing James E. Worsham. McDonnell named 
new top management for virtually every Douglas aircraft program. (Worsham is 
expected to take a new job within McDonnell after his retirement as Douglas 
president.) 
</P>
<P>
The new organization will assign to each aircraft program responsibility for 
manufacturing, engineering, personnel, administration, testing and a host of 
other functions. Historically, aircraft companies have maintained one 
engineering department that was drawn on by different aircraft programs. 
</P>
<P>
In a formal announcement, the changes were described as part of a "streamlined 
organizational structural" that is supposed to assist Douglas in improving the 
quality of products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Compromise Quality 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Vice President Michael Burch said the changes are also a 
response to the cost problems that have resulted in poor profit performance not 
only at Douglas but in the aircraft industry in general. 
</P>
<P>
"We do need to get our costs down but at the same time not compromise quality," 
Burch said. "The process of making quality takes too long and as a result the 
company isn't getting a good return on its investment. 
</P>
<P>
"John McDonnell said today that he would rather be known for the quality of his 
product than the size of his order book," Burch added. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, led by the personal sales efforts of Worsham, has run up a commercial 
backlog of $61 billion of orders and options. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim (Worsham) has done a fantastic job of turning around a company that was 
losing money every year," Burch said. "There is absolutely no criticism of 
James Worsham." In addition to the nine new vice presidents named Monday, 
dozens of new or restructured jobs will be filled in coming weeks. That 
includes the head of commercial marketing for Douglas. Of the nine vice 
presidents appointed to head programs, only Robert Clepper, chief of the C-17, 
previously headed the same program. 
</P>
<P>
An organization chart provided to The Times leaves out Senior Vice President 
William Gross, who has been the second highest ranking executive at Douglas and 
is expected to be reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the executives moved into new job slots at Douglas took demotions in 
title and in rank. McDonnell ranks executives under a system of gradation 
running from A through H. Some executives, such as John D. Wolfe, was at a 
position A and will now be at a position C. But the intent of reducing the rank 
and titles was to "flatten out the organizational chart," Burch said, which 
means that there is less hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
"The main emphasis is to get people to be responsible for their own product 
area," he said. "There will be no passing on a service or a product until the 
quality is right." 
</P>
<P>
The executives, who are described as "team leaders," introduced Monday are: 
</P>

MEXICO MOVES TO ARREST 150 FOR ILLEGAL CRASH-RELATED TRADING

The government moved Monday to issue arrest warrants for 150 employees of stock 
brokerage firms on charges of illegal trading related to the October, 1987, 
stock market crash, the government news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The Notimex agency quoted Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe as saying he asked the 
federal attorney general to issue arrest warrants for employees of the 
Operadora de Bolsa and Mexicana de Valores e Inversiones firms. The report did 
not say on what specific charges the arrests were being sought. 
</P>
<P>
An official with the office of Atty. General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said 
by telephone that no one was available to comment on the case Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50 Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Hoyo D'Addona, the fiscal attorney general, said last week the Treasury 
Department was investigating reports of illegal trading by all but one of 
Mexico's 24 registered brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
He said his department received 50 complaints of alleged fraud by stockbrokers 
stemming from the crash. Officials uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing on the 
Mexican Stock Exchange in five of those cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department is responsible for enforcing securities and tax laws, 
but it must ask the federal attorney general to perform any arrests of 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal trading allegations surfaced after the October, 1987, crash, when 
Mexico's market index fell by 74% in 28 trading days. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the attorney general said last week that more than 200 
investors lodged complaints against stockbrokers alleging that brokers 
speculated in the market or invested clients' funds without their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
A congressional panel voted on Wednesday to summon D'Addona, Deputy Attorney 
General Luis Porte Petit and Oscar Espinosa Villareal, president of the 
National Securities Commission, to testify about the fraud allegations.

SARA LEE BIDS $321 MILLION FOR ATHLETIC WEAR MAKER

Sara Lee Corp. carved out a bigger piece of the consumer goods pie Monday, 
agreeing to buy Champion Products Inc., in a deal that values the athletic-wear 
company at about $321 million. 
</P>
<P>
Best known for its frozen baked goods, Sara Lee is expanding its non-food 
operations. It said it will soon begin a tender offer for all outstanding 
Champion Products shares at $77 each, beating out a $61-a-share bid from 
Phonicam Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Champion stock climbed $12.125 to close at $75.75 in American Stock Exchange 
trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rochester, N.Y.-based Champion Products makes athletic, recreational and 
leisure wear products that are sold to educational institutions, including 
college bookstores. It reported sales of $219 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A Champion Products official said the company has 4.17 million shares 
outstanding on a fully diluted basis, which would make the Sara Lee offer worth 
$321 million. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase would be the latest in a string of small acquisitions by Sara Lee, 
which has annual sales of more than $10 billion. Last week, it announced plans 
to buy Hygrade Foods Products Corp., a Southfield, Mich.-based meat processor, 
for $140 million from Britain's Hanson PLC. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owns Hosiery Maker 
</P>
<P>
"Sara Lee is absolutely in an acquisition mode," said securities analyst Janet 
Mangano of Josephthal &amp; Co. Mangano said the company's recent moves were 
strategically logical because "you can do only so much through product 
development and by adding new capacity on your own." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company struck a deal to buy hosiery maker Adams-Millis Corp. 
for about $80 million.

Stock prices posted some scattered losses in a quiet session Monday, extending 
last week's decline. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which had fallen 36.97 on Friday, 
slipped 3.57 to 2,282.50. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 602 up, 861 down and 509 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 143.52 million shares, down from 173.56 million in the 
previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, 
including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
over-the-counter market, totaled 172.72 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates edged upward in the credit markets amid expectations of action 
soon by the Federal Reserve to tighten credit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prime Rate Rises 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said stock traders also were in an edgy mood after the market's 
decline Friday, which was the largest since Wall Street's winter-long rally 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Prices tumbled Friday after the Labor Department reported that producer prices 
of finished goods jumped 1% in January, exceeding analysts' projections. 
</P>
<P>
Then stocks had to absorb another jolt when banks across the country raised 
their prime lending rates from 10.5% to 11%. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, early selling of blue chips apparently pushed them down to 
levels where they attracted a few traders who had been waiting for a pullback 
as a buying opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Emery Air Freight climbed 1 1/2 to 7 5/8 as the most active NYSE issue. The 
company agreed to be acquired by Consolidated Freightways for $7.75 a share. 
Consolidated's shares fell 1 7/8 to 32 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Long Island Lighting gained 1 1/2 to 14 1/4. Over the weekend, a federal judge 
dismissed a verdict of fraud returned against the company by a jury in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included Eastman Kodak, down 7/8 at 47 1/2; General 
Electric, down 1/8 at 46 1/8, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 1/4 
at 31 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, General Motors, which a week ago announced a dividend increase and 
plans for a two-for-one stock split, rose 1 3/8 to 91 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson &amp; Johnson gained 1/2 to 89. The company reported higher 
fourth-quarter earnings, increased its dividend and voted a two-for-one stock 
split. 
</P>
<P>
Champion Products, traded on the American Stock Exchange, jumped 12 1/8 to 75 
3/4 on word of an agreement for Sara Lee Corp. to acquire it for $77 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 2,884.333, down 0.484, or 0.02%, 
from the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
Large blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded on the NYSE totaled 2,983, 
compared to 3,474 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 0.14 to 
164.15. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.13 to 337.39; its 500-stock 
composite index was up 0.52 at 292.54. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index dropped 1.10 to 401.27; the Amex index closed at 
321.76, down 1.01. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, share prices fell Monday. The Nikkei index dropped 146.67, or 0.46%, 
to close at 31,985.32. It rose 53.56 to a record close of 32,131.99 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices closed sharply lower in London but above their worst levels 
Monday. The Financial Times 100-share index was down 23.4, or 1.1%, at 2,032.7.

BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: 'THIRTYSOMETHING' SHOWS PERIL OF L.A. AGENCIES' 
RELIANCE ON ONE CLIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When an ad agency goes down the tubes, the general public rarely notices. But 
when that agency happens to employ two co-stars of the popular ABC television 
show "thirtysomething," plenty of people notice -- even if the agency is only 
real in a TV script. 
</P>
<P>
During the past few weeks, the show has been tackling one of the most feared 
issues in the ad business: What happens when your biggest client dumps you? 
</P>
<P>
Well, in the case of two "thirtysomething" co-stars, who together ran a 
struggling advertising agency, Michael &amp; Elliott Co., it meant bankruptcy. 
"We felt there was enormous creative potential in seeing what happened if the 
ad agency failed," said Marshall Herskovitz, the show's co-creator and 
executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
It might seem that a tiny, fictional ad firm on a TV show would be pretty far 
removed from the Los Angeles scene. But there is a striking similarity: the 
dependency on one large client. 
</P>
<P>
The agency on "thirtysomething" happened to rely on a baked goods company. Many 
of the biggest agencies in Southern California depend heavily upon Japanese car 
makers. Executives say that in Los Angeles, more major agencies rely upon 
single, huge clients for the bulk of their business than in any other big city. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a small, struggling agency, you often have only two choices," said 
Dean Fueroghne, senior vice president at the Good Guise, a small Encino ad 
firm. "You either merge with someone else or you go under." 
</P>
<P>
To make that point, last week Fueroghne's agency mailed hundreds of T-shirts 
with bold lettering across the front that suggests that the agency on the TV 
show has been acquired by what is in real life the world's largest ad firm, 
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. 
</P>
<P>
The T-shirts spell out a newly merged "Michael &amp; Elliott Co./Saatchi." This 
is the kind of long name that newly merged ad agencies tend to use, such as the 
recently merged mouthful, Della Femina, McNamee WCRS. A note along with the 
Saatchi T-shirt said, "It's hard to tell where the reality ends and 
make-believe begins." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," said Gerrold R. Rubin, president of Los Angeles' Rubin Postaer &amp; 
Associates, which counts on Honda for about 60% of its business, "I've spent 
time in bed looking up at the ceiling wondering, what the hell would I do if I 
ever lost that business?" 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the agency has pressed hard for other clients -- then tried to 
coax those same clients to boost their ad budgets. It has persuaded clothing 
maker Bugle Boy to triple its annual budget to $6 million over just the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
But many Los Angeles agencies seem to be thumbing their noses at the industry's 
general rule of thumb: No client should represent more than 20% of an ad firm's 
business. Executives estimate that at least eight of the Los Angeles area's top 
ad firms depend on one client for more than half of their business. 
</P>
<P>
"If an agency is dependent on one account, it's really skating on thin ice," 
said Fred Danzig, editor of the magazine Advertising Age. "But that seems to be 
a crap shoot that a number of Los Angeles agencies are willing to take." 
</P>
<P>
It's mostly a matter of geography. The big packaged goods makers are mainly in 
the East and Midwest, so that is where many of their agencies are. That leaves 
West Coast agencies with little option but to rely on the film studios, the 
Japanese car makers and a mishmash of smaller clients for virtually all their 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles office of the city's largest ad firm, Chiat/Day, counts on 
Nissan for about 80% of its business. And the Torrance office of Saatchi &amp; 
Saatchi DFS, which creates ads for Toyota, estimates that nearly 90% of its 
business comes from the Japanese car maker. Similarly, the Culver City ad 
agency, Vic Olesen &amp; Partners, says more than 60% of its business comes 
from Chevrolet. And Campbell &amp; Wagman estimates that more than 60% of its 
business is generated by client First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Japanese car makers represent a majority of the ad business for 
Southland offices of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding (Mazda), Rubin Postaer (Honda), 
Della Femina, McNamee WCRS (Isuzu) and Key/Donna/Pearlstein (Suzuki). 
</P>
<P>
"There are only two bad consequences that could result from this," said Alan 
Gottesman, analyst at the New York investment firm Paine Webber. "The client 
leaves, in which case the consequences are clear. Or, the client doesn't leave, 
in which case you sometimes wish it did." 
</P>
<P>
Agencies fight like the dickens to land those big Japanese car makers, which 
often spend more than $100 million annually apiece on advertising. And when the 
agencies win them, they are the envy of every other shop in town. But sometimes 
the agencies become so dominated by the client that they have a tough time 
landing other business. 
</P>
<P>
"When an agency is so glued to a major account, it doesn't have the time or 
wherewithal to look for other business," said Cy Schneider, executive vice 
president at the New York Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt, and former 
chairman of the agency's Los Angeles office. "And you can spend so much time on 
that account that the culture of your office becomes the culture of that 
account." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi even announced that it was changing the name 
of its West Coast operations to Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS/Pacific, in part, to 
try and attract more Pacific Rim business in addition to Toyota. "When clients 
have such an apparent dominance," said James Lindsey, chairman of the office, 
"there can be a problem in attracting other clients who are concerned that they 
won't get the attention they want." 
</P>
<P>
Many Los Angeles ad firms originally opened to service a single advertiser. In 
some cases, that can be highly profitable -- such as it has been with Rubin 
Postear and Honda. But it can also be risky. In May of 1987, the agency William 
Esty closed its Los Angeles office when it lost the Nissan ad business, 
although it has since reopened with another smaller client. And in 1988, the 
New York ad firm Scali, McCabe, Sloves backed out of the Los Angeles market two 
years after its key client, Continental/West airlines, went belly-up before the 
agency could create its first ad. 
</P>
<P>
One way to avoid such headaches is to rely less on a single client. "That's 
easier said then done," said Craig Campbell, president of Campbell &amp; 
Wagman, a 2-year-old agency with annual billings of $53 million that depends on 
First Interstate Bancorp for well over 60% of its business. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, that's too much," said Campbell, whose agency has slowly picked up a 
few other advertisers, including Marshall's department stores. But with a 
client as big as First Interstate, he said, "some potential clients won't even 
talk with us because they feel we're dominated by one account." 
</P>
<P>
Few Los Angeles ad agencies are so dominated by a single client as Chiat/Day is 
by the Japanese car maker Nissan. More than $200 million of the office's $250 
million in annual billings are from Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure," said Advertising Age's Danzig, "Jay Chiat has spent some time 
wondering what would happen to his Los Angeles office if it lost Nissan." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Herskovitz said, Chiat/Day officials have even been consultants to 
"thirtysomething." Chiat/Day was repaid the other week when its name was 
passingly mentioned on the show. 
</P>
<P>
"But we don't spend much time thinking, 'Oh no, what if we lost this or what if 
we lost that?,' although that may be the nature of many Los Angeles agencies," 
said Lee Clow, president of Chiat/Day. "That's because there are only so many 
clients to go around here. For a West Coast ad agency, an account like Nissan 
is the gold ring." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the gold ring at the Los Angeles office of Ogilvy &amp; Mather was 
Mattel. Just five years ago, the toy maker accounted for nearly 80% of Ogilvy's 
business. "We were perceived as an agency that just did toy advertising," said 
Gerald McGee, managing director at Ogilvy. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Mattel represents less than half of the office's total billings, 
said McGee. For one thing, Mattel has since cut back on advertising. And it 
also handed some of its advertising to a competing agency, Foote, Cone &amp; 
Belding. This forced McGee to hunt up new business, including clients like 
Carnation, Microsoft Corp. and Tandem Computer. But none of this new business 
came easy. 
</P>
<P>
About two years ago, Ogilvy's New York office put the pressure on McGee to find 
more business in Los Angeles. It got so intense that the Adweek magazine even 
ran a story that detailed the tremendous pressure McGee was under. McGee 
reacted as any creative ad man would. He pinned a special button to his suit 
that read: "I'm under tremendous pressure." 
</P>
<P>
So is Herskovitz. After all, the Hollywood-invented ad agency that has been a 
key setting for "thirtysomething" is history. "We even destroyed the set," 
Herskovitz said. "It was very weird. A lot of people who work around here still 
can't believe it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aussie Firm's S.F. Chief to Step Down 
</P>
<P>
Just one month after Chiat/Day made a bid for the Australian ad firm Mojo/MDA, 
the chairman of Mojo's U.S. headquarters in San Francisco has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Donald F. Dorward, 57, said Monday that he would leave the agency April 30. The 
office is scheduled to be merged with Chiat/Day's San Francisco office, and 
Dorward said in an interview Monday that he didn't intend to play second fiddle 
to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly haven't been forced out," said Dorward, who would not reveal his 
plans. "As a matter of fact, I approached them about it. But I'm too old to be 
the No. 2 guy and too young to retire." 
</P>
<P>
The newly combined office would be run by Fred Goldberg, president and chief 
executive of Chiat/Day's San Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Agency Likes Rent-A-Wreck's Name 
</P>
<P>
Rent-A-Wreck has long been apologizing for its oddball name in its advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let the name fool you," has been the slogan of the Los Angeles-based car 
rental company for the past two years. But last week, Rent-A-Wreck named a new 
Los Angeles ad firm to handle its $1-million-plus account. And the new agency, 
DCA Advertising Inc., says it plans some big changes in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to apologize for your name," said Chuck May, senior vice 
president at DCA. But, he added, the ad firm might want to explain what the 
company is all about. For example, he said, most of the cars the agency rents 
are actually less than 2 years old -- although some are as old as six or seven 
years. "They're walking a fine line with the name," he said, "but we'll come up 
with a new slogan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ads for Volunteers Pitch Brotherly Love 
</P>
<P>
For years, public service ads for Catholic/Jewish Big Brothers have tried to 
shame people into volunteering. Typically, the ads show some lonesome kid in 
need of a father figure. 
</P>
<P>
But in a new commercial produced in Spanish -- aimed at drumming up 300 Latino 
volunteers -- the Hispania division of the Los Angeles office of J. Walter 
Thompson has tried a new twist. 
</P>
<P>
In the ad, a Big Brother volunteer and his "little brother" shoot the breeze 
while washing a car together. "We decided not to focus on the guilt angle," 
said Steve McNally, vice president and associate media director at Thompson, 
and a former Big Brother volunteer. "Traditional stuff, like washing a car 
together, is really what being a Big Brother is all about."

YOUR BODY: VALENTINE'S DAY: THRILLS FOR TYPE TS, LESSONS ABOUT GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thrill-seeking or Type T personalities and their romantic interests likely will 
find more excitement than many people on Valentine's Day, but all lovers must 
think carefully about the gifts they plan to give today, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Type T personalities tend to be romantic, generous people, in love with love 
and willing to take risks in a relationship," said Frank Farley, a psychology 
professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He developed the Type T 
theory, which holds that certain people love intensity, novelty, variety and 
change while shunning structure and the mundane. 
</P>
<P>
Type T personalities, he noted, likely will bypass buying flowers or chocolates 
for their loves today. Instead, they're more likely to throw a surprise party, 
plan an adventurous night on the town or dispatch a singing Valentine. "T-types 
tend to keep a relationship fresher, more novel," he said. "They're willing to 
try new things." 
</P>
<P>
But even non-Type Ts need to take a lesson about Valentine gift-giving, other 
mental health experts say. They note that tokens of affection, chosen with care 
and exchanged today, can help strengthen relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"A box of chocolates is no big deal," says Milton Wolpin, a USC associate 
psychology professor. "It's like shaking hands." 
</P>
<P>
Gifts also should reflect the recipient's personality. "When the gift reflects 
that the person knows the other person, it really matters. And the giving of a 
Valentine's Day gift can temporarily make relationships smoother," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Roderic Gorney, a UCLA School of Medicine psychiatry professor, agreed, 
noting that a Valentine gift, "might ease communication in a relationship and 
it might help the recipient get over the results of some real or presumed 
neglect from the giver." 
</P>
<P>
But only if the gift is chosen with care, he cautioned: "A Valentine's Day gift 
reveals how well you know the other person and whether you cherish that 
person's actual characteristics or your fantasy about that person." 
</P>
<P>
As for empty-handed lovers, Gorney warned: "The giving of ceremonial gifts is 
taken by many as evidence of the devotion and love they want. But neither the 
absence or presence of a gift may represent a person's real devotion to you." 
</P>
<P>
Which Comes First? 
</P>
<P>
Should you exercise, then eat? Or should you eat and exercise after allowing 
for a reasonable time for digestion? 
</P>
<P>
Experts don't agree on the answer to those questions. 
</P>
<P>
Fat people should exercise, then eat, but lean people should eat, then 
exercise, says Karen Segal , an exercise physiologist and assistant professor 
of pediatrics at New York's Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
She bases her advice on a study of eight fat and eight lean men, each fed a 
750-calorie meal before or after 30 minutes of cycling. She found the obese men 
burned more calories if they cycled first and ate later; the reverse was true 
for the lean men. 
</P>
<P>
But Stephen Welle, a metabolic physiologist at the University of Rochester 
School of Medicine, says it makes little difference whether people exercise or 
eat first. "Just exercise," said Welle, who has studied the issue. "It doesn't 
matter when you eat. Most important is to exercise regularly to burn more 
calories." 
</P>
<P>
Childhood Counts 
</P>
<P>
Parents interviewing potential child-care givers should ask them about their 
own childhood, a Washington physician says. 
</P>
<P>
"A person's capacity for mothering (or fathering) in large part depends on how 
well he or she was mothered," said Dr. Constance U. Battle, medical director 
for the Hospital for Sick Children in Washington. Those who enjoyed a healthy 
parent-child relationship are more likely to provide good child care 
themselves, she contends. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. Alan Stern, an educational and developmental psychologist 
at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, said some people with inadequate 
parenting may actually be more sensitive to child care issues, especially after 
undergoing therapy and educational courses. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of asking care-givers about their childhoods, he suggests asking: What 
is your philosophy of raising children? What forms of discipline do you feel 
are best? What do you see as the major developmental issues of childhood? 
</P>
<P>
Think, too, he added, about the personality match between care-giver and child. 
"Certain kids are more vulnerable, for instance, and need more attention," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Retin-A Dosages 
</P>
<P>
A lower dose of Retin-A -- the acne medication that also may lessen wrinkles -- 
appears to give the same results while causing less skin irritation, some 
dermatologists report. 
</P>
<P>
In an 11-week study of 556 acne patients, the .025% cream was found comparable 
to the .05% cream but the lower dose caused half the skin irritation, said Dr. 
Stephen Mandy, clinical professor of dermatology at the University of Miami 
School of Medicine and one of the investigators. The study was funded by the 
Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. of Raritan, N.J., which manufacturers Retin-A and 
introduced the .025% cream last October. 
</P>
<P>
The low-dose Retin-A "might take a little longer (to work)" but "it's easier to 
use for some," said Dr. Albert Kligman, professor of dermatology at the 
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the drug's developer. The 
lower-dose cream might be better for those with fair or freckled skin, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the low-dose cream, patients should start the regimen gradually, 
advised Dr. Norman Brooks, an Encino dermatologist and assistant professor of 
dermatology at the UCLA School of Medicine. He recommends applying the night 
facial treatment once or twice a week at first, increasing applications 
gradually. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks and other dermatologists caution patients against simultaneous use of 
Retin-A and fragranced moisturizers. "The aldehydes (highly reactive compounds) 
in the moisturizer may inactivate the Retin-A," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration has approved Retin-A as an acne medication but 
Ortho plans to seek approval of Retin-A as a photodamage treatment, a company 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all dermatologists are convinced the drug is an effective anti-aging agent. 
Some say perceived cosmetic improvement may be due to redness obscuring 
wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
Nitroglycerin Patches 
</P>
<P>
Heart patients who wear nitroglycerin patches intermittently rather than 
continuously may lessen the tendency to build a tolerance to the drug, an 
advisory panel told the Food and Drug Administration recently. 
</P>
<P>
The best schedule, the panel said, may be a regimen of 8 hours on and 10 hours 
off. FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said the agency will change the label on the 
nitroglycerin patches to reflect the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
But some patients still may be better off wearing the patch continuously, said 
Dr. David Lowenthal, a professor of medicine, pharmacology and exercise science 
at the University of Florida School of Medicine, and a member of the FDA's 
Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee. "If a patient is stable with 
a (24-hour) regimen, don't mess with success," he advised. 
</P>
<P>
Don't self-adjust the dose, warned Dr. Jeffrey Hendel, a cardiologist and 
director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at St. Vincent Medical 
Center in Los Angeles. "If patients are concerned (about which regimen is 
best), they should speak to their doctor," he said.

HOW THE OTIS/PARSONS SCHOOL DESIGNS THE COMPLETE STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Francisco Guttierez, a sophomore in the Environmental Design course at the 
Otis/Parsons School of Design, struggled with a problem of conscience: How do 
you design a podium for a politician if you distrust the entire business of 
politics? 
</P>
<P>
The balsa model Guttierez had built to explore the problem reflected his 
confusions. A cross between a Sunset Boulevard billboard and a stick-like 
electronic media construction, Guttierez's podium for a politician seemed gawky 
and muddled to Fred Fisher, chairman of the school's Environmental Design 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher and Guttierez put their heads together to puzzle out the conflict, which 
Guttierez described, saying, "I have many doubts about encouraging politicians 
to spread their lies in public. So how do I express this while also creating a 
functional platform for speeches?" 
</P>
<P>
Fisher replied: "It's a real-life tension only the individual designer can work 
through on his own. Follow your intuition, but be informed. Find out what you 
really feel about politicians, and present a design that is resolved, not 
confused. That's the object of the exercise." 
</P>
<P>
It also defines the objectives of the innovative environmental design course, 
which in Fisher's words seeks "to deal with all aspects of the human context, 
from furniture through interiors, buildings, landscape and urban design. In 
essence, you need to know how you want to make people feel in the environments 
you contrive. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
To open their minds and hearts, students "pursue some projects that are 
consciously designed to instill calm, and others meant to instill anxiety." 
Whether they go on to become artists or architects, set designers or furniture 
makers, "our students will approach their tasks not as narrow specialists but 
as generalists aware of the whole human condition," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
He says the Otis/Parsons course is unmatched in Los Angeles for training design 
generalists, serving as a basis for graduates to choose a range of options from 
pursuing post-graduate architectural degrees to designing movie sets or 
studying landscape architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The three-year bachelor of fine arts course was named "Interior Architecture 
and Design" in 1986 when Fisher replaced architect David Meckel as department 
chairman. Under Meckel, the part-time faculty had been almost all architects. 
</P>
<P>
But Fisher said, "I chose the designation 'environmental design' because it 
encompasses a wider range than 'interior architecture.' I almost totally 
reconstituted the faculty to reflect this change, and brought in a spectrum of 
specialists, from artist Sheila Klein to environmental psychologist Dru 
Sherrod, furniture designer Judith Wachsmann and historian Charles Calvo." 
</P>
<P>
An architect with degrees in fine arts and art history, Fisher is very aware of 
the need to broaden the background and training of designers. The projects that 
emerge from his busy Santa Monica practice are noted for their strong 
connection with other visual arts and the influence of artists in the design 
process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laying a Foundation 
</P>
<P>
As outlined in Fisher's term, the environmental design course begins with a 
yearlong foundation of general and liberal arts courses, which all Otis/Parsons 
students must complete. 
</P>
<P>
After their first sophomore semester in environmental design, students undergo 
a faculty review and those that do not seem suited to advance are encouraged to 
change departments. 
</P>
<P>
"We work them hard the first year, and if they don't respond to the way we 
approach design, we tell them to drop it," Fisher said. "We're looking to 
graduate well-rounded visual artists who can turn their talents to any field." 
</P>
<P>
With only 45 students in the course, the studios are small and intimate; 
faculty and students collaborate closely. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental design students also work with those in other departments. In 
their "Fabricated Image" project, for example, they team with fashion, fine 
arts and photography students to produce a life-size model of a "real-world 
scale environment," replete with the clothes or costumes for its supposed 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
"Every artist and designer is in the business of fabricating images," faculty 
member Klein said. "Painters, sculptors, architects, landscape architects, 
fashion photographers and art photographers and set designers -- even people 
who create shop window displays -- are filling the environment with new imagery 
intended to evoke a particular mood or response. This is the powerful common 
ground we all share." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher agreed, adding, "We're constantly pushing students out into the real 
world. We feel all environmental ideas have to be tested in a real-life 
situation, and at full scale. Models and drawings can only take you so far." 
</P>
<P>
Janice Beckenbach, a junior in the program, chose it "because it connects me 
with a wide variety of things out there in the real world, and because I'm 
interested in so many things." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Flexible Approach 
</P>
<P>
She already works after school in the woodworking department of an 
architectural timber mill, which turns out furniture details. She also designs 
window displays for local department stores. Because of its flexible, open 
approach, she chose Otis/Parsons over its sister school, Parsons School of 
Design in New York; the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena; and the 
prestigious Rhode Island School of Design. 
</P>
<P>
"Otis-P gives me a unique range of choices," she said. "I love its rare 
combination of looseness and rigor, of freedom of ideas along with disciplined 
work habits. It's a mix you seldom find in more conventional design courses." 
</P>
<P>
Not that all is absolutely ideal at the school. Fisher has a major battle on 
his hands with "sheer ignorance" -- his students' generally poor cultural and 
educational background, especially in arts history and literature. 
</P>
<P>
"Contemporary art students are seldom in love with the past or the word," he 
lamented. "They feel that artists need exist only on the plane of a visually 
based intuition. They have no sense of history, even in the the arts, and tend 
to think they've invented the world from scratch. This is a grievous 
limitation. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
As an intellectual Easterner educated at Oberlin College and the University of 
Pennsylvania, he suspects he is "out of sync with the lazy-minded West Coast 
ethos." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, he insists that a liberal-arts component is vital in designers' 
education. He argues passionately that literacy matters when artists and 
architects think about the man-made environment they hope to enrich. 
</P>
<P>
"The images we fabricate have to have a potent cultural resonance, if they are 
to have a real impact and improve our environment at every level of endeavor," 
he said. "That can only happen if designers know their culture and are 
responsible to its history."

WORKERS WHO DRAG A COLD TO THE OFFICE MAY JUST BE LONESOME -- OR EXERCISING A

Actress Sherri Stoner spent intermission backstage at the Groundlings Theatre 
this weekend doing more than painting her lips flame red for her next scene. 
</P>
<P>
She also was gulping down medication, as she has for the last three weeks, to 
quell her aches, chills and a 101-degree fever so her show could go on. Her 
persistence was as much for artistic as economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"They need me," she said, explaining why she worked while ill. "There are only 
two other girls in the cast." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Miss a Day 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the cold and flu season, countless other ailing Los Angeles 
residents are sniffling and struggling through work, dragging themselves in by 
their fingernails to finish projects on deadline or to attend important 
meetings impossible to reschedule. 
</P>
<P>
They work sick, despite objections from their concerned families and the advice 
of public health officials who claim that bed-rest is best, especially in the 
initial stages of flu and colds. 
</P>
<P>
"You're most infectious in the first 48 hours after the onset of cold or flu 
symptoms," said Dr. George Gellert, medical epidemiologist with the Los Angeles 
County Department of Health Services. "The ability to infect another person 
starts to drop off after 48 hours." 
</P>
<P>
So why do so many of us keep laboring with those runny noses and raging fevers? 
</P>
<P>
Many workers often have no choice because of concerns about money or a home 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
But some personality types do feel compelled to shun rest and chicken soup when 
ill, while others actually experience some unexpected psychological fringe 
benefits from working sick, mental health experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, downplaying or even denying cold or flu symptoms can actually make us 
physically stronger in the long run, some experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Who is most likely to work while sick? Not surprisingly, it's the enthusiastic 
workers. "People who really love their job are more apt to work through 
sickness," said Albert R. Marston, a USC psychology and psychiatry professor. 
</P>
<P>
Those whose lives revolve mostly around their work also are less likely to give 
up when stomach cramps and sniffles strike. 
</P>
<P>
"The job is their identity," said Marc Schoen, a Woodland Hills psychologist on 
staff at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. "To not work means almost being without 
an identity, which has predictable roles and duties. Take it away and there's 
puzzlement about how to act. (They ask,) 'How do I stay home and relax?' " 
</P>
<P>
Individuals who have trouble handling idle time also are likely to work while 
sick. Patrick Joyce, a Glendale real estate agent who recently worked through a 
bad cold, observed: "I'm just not the kind of person who can sit at home." 
</P>
<P>
Team players are more likely than prima donnas to show up with tissues and 
medications in hand, experts say, because they're concerned about letting down 
co-workers or clients if they don't show for work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sack of Medications' 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Lisa Bradberry, a supervisor at a Los Angeles coffee service 
company. She packed a "lunch sack full of medications" during her recent bout 
with the flu and commuted the 55 miles from her home in Acton. "We're short one 
person," she said. "If I didn't service the accounts, it wouldn't have gotten 
done." 
</P>
<P>
For some people, being sick -- and working through an illness -- is considered 
an inevitable part of life, especially if they've grown up believing that life 
isn't always roses, Schoen said, noting: "When they get a cold or the flu, they 
say, 'Yeah, I do feel miserable, but life is supposed to be tough.' Therefore, 
when life is difficult, that creates a sense of self-value." 
</P>
<P>
For others, the negative aspects of staying home while ill outweigh the 
headaches of work. "It's very lonely for some people to stay home sick," 
particularly if they live alone, Marston said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoen agreed, saying: "Going to work sick may get some workers more sympathy 
than staying home." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the experts note that some workers simply like to play the role of 
martyr, countering co-workers' sympathy and appeals for them to leave work with 
the standard reply, "Oh, no, I'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
Some sick workers do slow down after others nag them. Bradberry finally saw a 
doctor after her husband, Randy West, insisted. Joyce, the real estate agent, 
closed a Sunday open house early after a former client came by and told him he 
looked awful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nothing Heroic' 
</P>
<P>
But nagging doesn't always work. John Weir, a Los Angeles public relations 
executive, worked on Friday over the objections of his wife, Paulette. She 
reminded him that he "wasn't a kid anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he countered through sniffles: "A new business proposal has to be ready 
Monday. Ironically, it's for a hospital chain." 
</P>
<P>
Weir's argument holds no weight with Gellert, the epidemiologist. "There's 
nothing heroic in going to work when you're ill," he said. "You probably do 
inferior quality work and may infect other people. We urge employers to take 
the long view of illnesses such as colds and flu, and to encourage employees to 
lose one or two days over the course of a year rather than have them coming to 
work and causing widespread infection, which results in greater loss of 
employee work time and productivity." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some workers swear the best way to combat most common colds and flu is 
to downplay or even deny their symptoms, to look at the illness as a temporary 
deficiency to be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admitting Defeat 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us are health-conscious and being sick is kind of an indication you 
haven't been doing your health job -- taking your vitamins, say, or 
exercising," Marston said. "Going back to work is a mind-over-body notion." 
</P>
<P>
Some people, Marston said, even believe that going back to work will actually 
speed their recovery. 
</P>
<P>
That view may not be totally preposterous, Schoen said: "Denial can be bad if 
an illness is serious. But maybe there's such a thing as healthy denial." 
</P>
<P>
The best approach, Schoen suggested, may be to acknowledge an illness but not 
be obsessive about its symptoms; cold sufferers may pack a big box of tissues 
but not talk endlessly about how lousy they feel. 
</P>
<P>
"Some studies suggest that people who infrequently get sick say, 'I don't have 
time for this,' " Schoen noted. "When they feel initial symptoms, they begin to 
say, 'I'm not going to let this slow me down.' " 
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Dienstbier, a psychology professor at the University of 
Nebraska-Lincoln who has studied physiological toughness, observed: "People who 
feel psychologically distressed by colds and flu are likely to produce more 
cortisol, a hormone that can suppress the immune system. Therefore, they are 
likely to have more of a bacterial or viral invasion," he says, though not all 
experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
There's no conclusive proof that healthy denial works, Schoen said, but he 
added that "lots of anecdotal reports" suggest it probably can't hurt.

The thing about jazz is that while it keeps evolving, it never says goodby to 
the places it's been. 
</P>
<P>
There are jazz fans eager to locate the leading edge of experimentation, 
fascinating rhythms and tonal paths never trod before. Others see no need to 
move beyond the most primitive of blues, where it all began. 
</P>
<P>
But then again, a large number of us grew up on the music that falls somewhere 
in between -- north of late Dixieland but south of early Bop. Ours were the 
sounds of the jazz-flavored big bands (Ellington, Goodman, Shaw, Basie, Kenton) 
and of the innumerable, shifting, small groups that featured soloists of 
now-legendary status and that sometimes stayed intact for no longer than a 
recording session or two. 
</P>
<P>
Some 500 worshipers from this generation (roughly defined as over 55) filled a 
ballroom at the San Diego Marriott over the weekend for Bill Muchnic's second 
San Diego Jazz Party. 
</P>
<P>
The musical celebrities, direct from the great days and still playing with 
remarkable energy, inventiveness and joy, included the bassists Milt Hinton, 
who is 78, and Bob Haggart, 75. The other seniors included drummer Gus Johnson 
(75), Marshall Royal (76) on alto and Flip Phillips (73) on tenor. At 60, the 
fine soprano sax and clarinet player Bob Wilber represents a later generation. 
</P>
<P>
And since any brand of jazz must renew itself or die, it was reassuring and 
reaffirming to hear the outstanding younger players present. Notable among them 
were the horn men, Ed Pelcer on cornet and Warren Vache on trumpet. Scott 
Hamilton on tenor and drummer Butch Miles have built impressive reputations, as 
have guitarist Howard Alden and trombonist Dan Barrett, both West Coast men now 
working in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist John Clayton is also Los Angeles-born and studied with Ray Brown. 
Clayton did arrangements for and conducted the 18-man ad hoc big band that 
played with amazing power and precision, given its short rehearsal time. 
</P>
<P>
Muchnic's gathering is a reduced but unapologetic copy of Dick Gibson's Rocky 
Mountain Jazz Party, now a quarter-century old. Muchnic, an engineer by 
training, retired to San Diego from Atkinson, Kan., after the family's 
manufacturing firm was bought by Rockwell. He had discovered live jazz in 
Kansas City and played trumpet at the University of Kansas. He attended the 
Gibson parties from the beginning, until his doctor cautioned him away from the 
Colorado altitude. 
</P>
<P>
He concluded that the only answer was a West Coast party of his own. The first 
one sold out six weeks ahead of time and broke even. He decided to do it again, 
hiring two dozen musicians, many of whom had played the first party. The $130 
tickets this year bought some 14 hours of music: four hours on Friday and 
Saturday nights, a noon to 6 session Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Muchnic runs a tight ship: half-hour sets with minimal stage waits between, 
changing but thoughtfully composed groups, solo turns by each of the players 
before the weekend is over. Three pianists (Paul Smith, Ralph Sutton and Dick 
Hyman), three bassists (Haggart, Clayton and Hinton) and three drummers (Miles, 
Johnson and Jake Hanna) made for a variety of rhythm sections, all uncommonly 
propulsive. 
</P>
<P>
"No rock 'n' roll, no progressive," Muchnic says, knowing his own and his 
patrons' tastes. He also provides a master list of suggested tunes, mostly to 
avoid repetitions from one set to another. "The guys aren't limited," Muchnic 
says, "but they tell me they find the list helpful." 
</P>
<P>
Like a film festival, a jazz party reduces to a relatively few indelible 
memories. From San Diego, one will be of a duet -- Bob Wilber on curved soprano 
sax, Kenny Davern on clarinet -- on the Jelly Roll Morton tune "Sweet 
Substitute." The slow, soaring interplay of the two instruments, like a lyrical 
conversation of like minds, was astonishingly beautiful. You were reminded that 
among all its other possibilities, jazz can indeed be pretty. 
</P>
<P>
At another extreme, a tune Davern introduced as "The Shriek of Agony" -- the 
well-worn "Sheik of Araby" -- became the foundation for a blazing series of 
choruses by Flip Phillips, George Masso on trombone and Bucky Pizzarelli on 
guitar. Standing ovations were frequent but the "Sheik" richly deserved the one 
it received. You were reminded that fine playing defies the years. 
</P>
<P>
What gives improvisational jazz its undiminished appeal for those who love it 
is that when the right players come together a kind of musical magic happens, 
and the whole, constructed on the spot in a so-called head arrangement, is 
larger than the soaring parts. There is an admiration and a delight among the 
players themselves that the listeners can see as well as hear. 
</P>
<P>
When the dazzling young guitarist Howard Alden was taking a long chorus, the 
other musicians watched him with grinning approval and mimed applause before 
they returned to their own chores. 
</P>
<P>
There was, you had the feeling, at least as much pleasure in the playing as in 
the receiving.

CARL'S JR. FOUNDER STILL FACES SEC SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
6 IN KARCHER FAMILY AGREE TO PAY FINES IN INSIDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, Donald F. Karcher, his wife 
and four family members have agreed to pay $187,560 in fines and penalties to 
end a federal lawsuit accusing them of insider stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
In signing the agreements, which were approved by a federal judge Monday, 
Donald Karcher and his family did not admit or deny the insider trading 
allegations made in a civil lawsuit filed in April by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. But the six defendants consented to permanent court orders 
prohibiting them from future violations of insider trading laws. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements by Donald Karcher and his family do not affect insider trading 
charges pending against his older brother, company founder Carl N. Karcher, 
seven of his immediate relatives and Alvin DeShano, director of general 
accounting at Carl Karcher Enterprises in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC suit accused Carl Karcher, who is chairman and chief executive of the 
company, 14 family members and DeShano of avoiding stock market losses of at 
least $310,000 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1984, according to the suit, Carl and Donald Karcher and their wives 
tipped other family members -- through a series of phone calls and discussions 
-- to upcoming news about a 50% drop in profit at Carl Karcher Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC action, which seeks more than $1 million, is scheduled to begin a four- 
to six-week trial April 11. 
</P>
<P>
All the defendants have consistently denied the SEC's charges of insider 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
But in September, one of Carl Karcher's sons, Carl Leo Karcher, was found 
guilty of insider trading without a trial after a federal judge ruled that he 
had made admissions to investigators that clearly established his guilt in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Karcher was required to repay $10,500 that he saved by selling 
Karcher debt securities after learning that the fast-food company was about to 
report a dramatic drop in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC announced the consent agreements Monday, the same day they were signed 
by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie in Los Angeles. The agreements were 
signed over a period of about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the civil lawsuit against Donald Karcher and his family does not 
preclude the possibility that the U.S. Attorney's Office could also bring 
criminal charges of violating insider trading laws. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Attorney's Office and SEC attorneys declined Monday to indicate 
whether the civil settlement includes an agreement that Donald Karcher and his 
relatives will not be targets of a later criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
But Irving Einhorn, SEC regional administrator in Los Angeles, said it is 
common for his office to negotiate tentative civil settlements that hinge on 
the U.S. attorney agreeing not to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Agree to Deal 
</P>
<P>
"We do that all the time," Einhorn said. "And if the U.S. Attorney won't agree, 
(the defendants) can walk away from a settlement with me." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Donald Karcher and his wife, Dorothy, those who signed 
settlement agreements are Doneta Ann Thomason, daughter of Donald and Dorothy 
Karcher, and her husband, David R. Thomason, as well as Rosemary Bruns, the 
sister of Dorothy Karcher, and her husband, William T. Bruns. 
</P>
<P>
Doneta Thomason, who worked at the company payroll department, and her husband 
have agreed to repay $47,125, the amount of potential losses they avoided by 
allegedly selling their stock based on inside information. In addition, they 
have also agreed to pay a one-time penalty of $47,125. 
</P>
<P>
The Brunses, who live in Huber Heights, Ohio, have agreed to repay $15,395 that 
they allegedly saved by selling stock they owned or controlled before adverse 
information was made public, plus a one-time penalty of the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Karcher -- who was accused of telling his wife, daughter and son-in-law 
non-public information -- and his wife agreed to pay a one-time penalty of 
$62,520 under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984. That amount is equal 
to the potential losses allegedly avoided by the Thomasons and the Brunses. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC contended that Carl and Donald Karcher, and their wives, had violated 
insider trading laws because they tipped their relatives -- not that they had 
avoided losses by selling any of their stock. 
</P>
<P>
Donald and Carl Karcher could not be reached Monday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Is a Factor 
</P>
<P>
But Don Smaltz of Los Angeles, the lawyer for Donald Karcher and his wife, said 
the one-time payment of $62,520 "is significantly less than what would be 
required to take the case to trial." Smaltz added his clients "certainly" still 
maintain their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"You always have to consider settlement when the costs of litigation far exceed 
the amount of money at issue," said David W. Wiechert of Irvine, the attorney 
for Al DeShano, the one non-family member accused of illegal trading. Wiechert 
would not say whether his client is also discussing a similar settlement. 
</P>
<P>
But Einhorn of the SEC hailed the settlement as a victory for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"The SEC considers this to be a vindication of its case. We got everything we 
asked for," Einhorn said. "You would think there must be some doubt on their 
part (about) whether they'd prevail at trial because these are people that have 
the money, the wherewithal, to prosecute the case." 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, the company will have to disclose that Donald Karcher is 
under an injunction from the court for insider trading, Einhorn said, "but they 
can also disclose (the order) was entered by consent without admitting or 
denying the allegation." 
</P>
<P>
What remained unknown was whether Carl Karcher and his immediate family are 
trying to negotiate similar settlements.

RUNWAY LIGHTS FAILURE CLOSES WAYNE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's John Wayne Airport closed down Monday night after new runway 
lights failed, sending incoming flights to Ontario and Los Angeles 
International airports and canceling outgoing flights. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of passengers were stranded, and hundreds more were bused back to John 
Wayne from other airports after the runway lights went out at 6:45 p.m., 
reportedly because of rain. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for American Airlines said the 3-hour airport closure forced the 
carrier to re-route seven flights carrying a total of 300 to 400 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"A failure like this can mess up a good chunk of our West Coast system," 
spokesman Edward Martelle said. "The logistics of placing planes and crews in 
the right place at the right time is very similar to playing a chess game. We 
have three that are inbound (to John Wayne) right now that we still have to 
decide where to route." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Delta Airlines said that carrier was forced to re-route two 
flights heading for John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
The lights came back on at 9:50 p.m. -- 10 minutes before the airport's usual 
deadline to end takeoffs for the day. Because of the situation, however, planes 
were allowed to take off until 11 p.m. Incoming flights also were allowed to 
land for that hour (the normal deadline for incoming flights is 11 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
The blackout, which affected only the runway lights, was blamed on the weather, 
as a new system of runway light fixtures and cables encountered its first storm 
and apparently sustained water damage, airport spokeswoman Kathie Rutherford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a water-related problem. We have not pinpointed the exact cause, but 
our crews are working on it as we speak," Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second failure of runway lights at John Wayne in 24 hours. The 
airport was closed for almost an hour Sunday evening after a faulty Southern 
California Edison cable cut power to the runway and about 1,800 airport area 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
An Edison spokesman said none of the company's equipment had failed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne Airport is in the midst of a $310-million remodeling project. The 
runway lighting was completed within the last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Like all things, when you install a new system, there always are going to be 
bugs and they have to be worked out," Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
The airport's old lighting system also had a history of failures. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been one of a series of problems that we have experienced over the 
last 4 or 5 months. Most of the failures have been caused by the old system's 
age," Rutherford said. A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said 
Ontario and LAX airports apparently were able to handle the additional flights 
and passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not heard of any problems, and I would be the first one to be 
notified," spokesman Jack Doyle said. "During the evening at John Wayne, there 
wouldn't be that many flights to handle anyway." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at Ontario Airport said that at least three flights had been 
rerouted there from John Wayne and that the additional traffic was not a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
A reservations clerk for USAir said the blackout affected eight inbound flights 
and canceled eight outbound flights. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disgrace," the clerk said. "They have had at least seven problems with 
those lights in the last 8 months. Our customers are missing their connections 
and understandably they are getting mad. The last time they said a rat bit the 
line and they say that they are fixing it, but frankly to me that's like saying 
the check's in the mail."

TELEVANGELIST DEMANDS ETHICS PANEL HEARING; 
</P>
<P>
TRINITY NETWORK FOUNDER IS 'GRIEVED AND OFFENDED' BY UNETHICAL CONDUCT 
ALLEGATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The founder and president of the Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting Network has 
responded for the first time to allegations of unethical conduct and business 
practices and is demanding a hearing before the Ethics Committee of the 
National Religious Broadcasters, which is investigating the network. 
</P>
<P>
Televangelist Paul F. Crouch also acknowledged, in a letter to the NRB, that in 
1981 "I probably did pray that God would kill anyone or anything that was 
attempting to destroy the ministry. My prayer has not changed today." 
</P>
<P>
Trinity, now a 24-hour-a-day Christian programming service, was founded by 
Crouch and several other backers in 1973. Since then, Crouch has assumed total 
control of the network, which has experienced spectacular growth and now 
encompasses 14 full-power commercial stations, three educational stations and 
more than 90 low-power television stations in the United States, along with 
more than 20 overseas stations. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 2 The Times reported that Crouch and TBN were the subject of an 
investigation by the NRB's Ethics Committee, in part because of complaints that 
Crouch used unethical practices in building and acquiring Christian television 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
In the first of two letters of response to Richard Bott, Sr., chairman of 
ethics panel, Crouch said he was "deeply grieved and offended by your actions 
as head of the NRB Ethics Committee," adding that "I now demand a hearing 
before your committee." TBN provided copies of both letters to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Bott, president of Bott Broadcasting of Independence, Mo., was traveling Monday 
and could not be reached for comment. However, in an interview last week, Bott 
said that Crouch would have 30 days to respond to the complaints before the NRB 
would decide whether TBN could retain membership in the voluntary organization. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics committee is looking into two formal complaints against TBN. 
</P>
<P>
The first, made in the form of a sworn affidavit by the Rev. Keith A. Houser, 
of Irving, Tex., grew out of a dispute over control of an upstate New York 
television station that is now owned by Trinity. The Federal Communications 
Commission has ruled in favor of Trinity, but the matter is scheduled to be 
decided soon in civil court in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Houser alleged in court documents that Crouch unethically took over the New 
York station, which Houser said he founded. Crouch joined with other station 
board members, Houser alleged, and "cut deals with these parties without my 
prior knowledge and virtually started a hostile takeover of the television 
station." 
</P>
<P>
The second complaint was made in a four-page letter to Bott from Marvin L. 
Martin, an Orange County resident who said he worked for Crouch for 10 years, 
until 1981. His duties, he said in the letter, included producing the nightly 
talk show "Praise the Lord," which featured Crouch and his wife Jan. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, that in 
1981, "I gave Paul Crouch a letter demanding his and Jan's resignation because 
of their moral and financial improprieties. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Martin declined Monday to elaborate on his letter and the substance of his 
allegations could not immediately be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Both Houser and Martin testified before a closed meeting of the ethics 
committee in Los Angeles in late September. Crouch expressed outrage that 
copies of the two complaints were leaked to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"At a minimum," Crouch wrote to Bott, "I feel ethics charges should be brought 
against you and your ethics committee as well as Keith Houser and Marv Martin." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch said he denied "categorically" Martin's allegations, characterizing them 
as "mostly fabrications and outright lies from a bitter and sick mind." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch referred to Martin's "infamous letter of demand for my resignation. . . 
. He did produce such a letter and I fired him on the spot. His allegations 
about 'moral and financial improprieties' were just as vague then as they are 
now. What are these improprieties? Let my accusers come forward if they can!" 
</P>
<P>
Martin alleged that in the mid-1970s, as TBN became more successful, a number 
of employees complained to him about the pay scale at the network. "Employees 
were constantly complaining to me that their families were hurting," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
When a group of these employees attempted to organize, Martin wrote, the 
Crouches took action against them. 
</P>
<P>
The way Crouch recalled the incident, "an attempt was made by a handful of 
disgruntled production employees to form a labor union attempting to force 
raises which the ministry could not afford. We resisted these attempts and 
proved that the (National Labor Relations Board) had no jurisdiction over a . . 
. tax-exempt ministry organization. A few (five or six) did resign when they 
realized that their attempt had failed but no one was fired by TBN for their 
actions. . . . Nearly all the employees involved have since returned to ask my 
forgiveness for the harm and dissension they caused. Jan and I freely have 
forgiven and continue to work with some of the employees in question." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the NLRB could not immediately be reached to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Martin also wrote that "at one staff prayer meeting in the TBN chapel, Paul 
Crouch prayed aloud in my presence that God would 'kill' a man in the community 
who had filed for an FCC license to take over TBN's flagship station (in Orange 
County). Paul Crouch said that those who opposed him or did anything to hurt 
the Trinity Broadcasting Ministry were 'coming against God's anointed.' " 
</P>
<P>
Crouch acknowledged that "one of Martin's charges is true. I did pray for the 
wrath of God to fall on enemies of TBN who at the time were attempting to take 
the license of KTBN-Channel 40. This would have destroyed the entire ministry 
which was just beginning to burst forth with growth. At the time we had four TV 
stations. Today, 8 years later, we have 154. I probably did pray that God would 
kill anyone or anything that was attempting to destroy the ministry. My prayer 
has not changed today." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, in place of a scheduled live telecast of "Praise the Lord," the 
network substituted a year-old tape which included Paul Crouch accepting an 
award on behalf of TBN from the National Religious Broadcasters at their 1988 
national convention in Washington. Before the award was made in 1988, the 
ethics committee voted unanimously to withhold the award, according to a 
committee member, but their recommendation was overruled by the NRB's executive 
committee after a stormy meeting with Crouch. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Philip Crouch, Paul Crouch's brother and vice president of TBN, said 
in a telephone interview last week that he did not make the decision to run the 
year-old tape but that he assumed the purpose in airing it at this time was "to 
kind of settle anyone's fears that we were in good standing with the NRB."

DONALD KARCHER AND FAMILY TO PAY STOCK-CASE PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Donald F. Karcher, president of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, his wife and 
four family members have agreed to pay $187,560 in fines and penalties to end a 
federal lawsuit accusing them of insider stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
In signing the agreements, which were approved by a federal judge Monday, 
Donald Karcher and his family did not admit or deny the insider-trading 
allegations made in a civil lawsuit filed in April by the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But the six defendants consented to permanent court orders prohibiting them 
from future violations of insider trading laws. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements by Donald Karcher and his family do not affect insider trading 
accusations pending against his older brother, company founder Carl N. Karcher, 
seven of his immediate relatives and Alvin DeShano, director of general 
accounting at Carl Karcher Enterprises in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC lawsuit accused Carl Karcher, who is chairman and chief executive of 
the company, 14 family members and DeShano of avoiding stock market losses of 
at least $310,000 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Late that year, according to the lawsuit, Carl and Donald Karcher and their 
wives tipped other family members through a series of phone calls and 
discussions to upcoming news about a 50% drop in profits at Carl Karcher 
Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC's civil suit seeks more than $1 million, including treble damages, from 
the remaining defendants. It is scheduled to begin a four-week to six-week 
trial on April 11. 
</P>
<P>
All the defendants have consistently denied the SEC's charges of insider 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
But in September, one of Carl Karcher's sons, Carl Leo Karcher, was found 
guilty of insider trading without a trial after a federal judge ruled that he 
had made admissions to investigators that clearly established his guilt in the 
case.

The younger Karcher was required to repay $10,500.

The SEC announced the consent agreements Monday, the same day that they were 
signed by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie in Los Angeles.

<P>
The end of the civil lawsuit against Donald Karcher and his family does not 
preclude the possibility that the U.S. attorney's office could also bring 
criminal charges of violating insider-trading laws. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office and SEC attorneys declined on Monday to say whether 
the civil settlement includes an agreement that Donald Karcher and his 
relatives will not be targets of a later criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
But Irving Einhorn, SEC regional administrator in Los Angeles, said it is 
common for his office to negotiate tentative civil settlements that hinge on 
the U.S. attorney agreeing not to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Donald Karcher and his wife, Dorothy, those who signed 
settlement agreements are Doneta Ann Thomason, daughter of Donald and Dorothy 
Karcher, and her husband, David R. Thomason, as well as Rosemary Bruns, the 
sister of Dorothy Karcher, and her husband, William T. Bruns. 
</P>
<P>
Doneta Thomason, who worked in the company payroll department, and her husband 
have agreed to repay $47,125, the amount of potential losses they allegedly 
avoided by selling their stock based on inside information. In addition, they 
have also agreed to pay a one-time penalty of $47,125. 
</P>
<P>
The Brunses, who live in Huber Heights, Ohio, have agreed to repay $15,395 that 
they allegedly saved by selling stock they owned or controlled before adverse 
information was made public, plus a one-time penalty of the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Karcher and his wife agreed to pay a one-time penalty of $62,520 under 
the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984. That amount is equal to the 
potential losses allegedly avoided by the Thomasons and the Brunses. The SEC 
contended that Carl and Donald Karcher and their wives had violated insider 
trading laws because they tipped their relatives, not that they had avoided 
losses by selling stock. 
</P>
<P>
Donald and Carl Karcher could not be reached Monday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Don Smaltz, the lawyer for Donald Karcher and his wife, said the one-time 
payment of $62,520 "is significantly less than what would be required to take 
the case to trial." Smaltz added that his clients "certainly" still maintain 
their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Einhorn, the SEC's regional administrator, hailed the settlement as a victory 
for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"The SEC considers this to be a vindication of its case. We got everything we 
asked for," Einhorn said. "You would think there must be some doubt on their 
part (about) whether they'd prevail at trial because these are people that have 
the money, the wherewithal, to prosecute the case." 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, the company will have to disclose in public documents 
that Donald Karcher is under an injunction from the court for insider trading, 
Einhorn said, "but they can also disclose (that the order) was entered by 
consent without admitting or denying the allegation."

COLLEGE DISTRICT TRUSTEES OPPOSE LOAN PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trustees of Saddleback Community College District have sent a resolution to the 
U.S. Department of Education objecting to a proposed crackdown on student 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, then-Education Secretary William Bennett proposed a ban on most 
federally backed loans to students if the students attend a college that has a 
high default rate on paying back the federal Guaranteed Student Loans. 
</P>
<P>
But that proposal unfairly penalizes colleges, which neither make the loans nor 
collect them, trustees said. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's proposal, which is still pending before the U.S. Education 
Department, called for a cutoff of all federally backed loans to a college that 
has a default rate of 20% or higher. Most California community colleges, 
including Saddleback College and Irvine Valley College, have default rates 
higher than 20% for that type of student loan. 
</P>
<P>
The Saddleback trustees, in their resolution, noted that "the colleges do not 
award or collect on (federal) loans to students yet are held accountable for 
student defaults." 
</P>
<P>
They added that all student loans to a college should not be threatened because 
of "perceived inadequacies" of one type of student loan. 
</P>
<P>
And current and future students should not be penalized because of non-payment 
mistakes made by past students, the resolution said.

TAKEOVER URGED IF TOLL ROAD AGENCIES RESIST MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's toll road agencies, under fire for spending nearly $1 million 
on legal fees, should be the targets of a hostile takeover unless they agree to 
merge with the county's other transportation panels, a key county 
transportation official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Such questions about the toll road agencies' legal costs and unusual travel 
spending could undermine efforts to seek voter approval of a countywide sales 
tax for highway and transit projects in November or in June, 1990, said lawyer 
Dana W. Reed, who is the at-large public member of the Orange County 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Joaquin Hills and Eastern/Foothill Transportation Corridor agencies are 
overseeing design and construction of three toll roads planned in south Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"We must seriously consider consolidating the (corridor agencies') activities 
with other Orange County transportation providers, regardless of whether or not 
(they) are willing to cooperate," Reed told fellow commissioners Monday in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Reed's comments reflected the continuing power struggle between the commission 
and the corridor agencies over control of decision-making on major 
transportation projects, at a time when many such projects are being planned 
and funded in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies last year rejected a proposed merger with other transportation 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Questions were raised publicly last week about the agencies having racked up 
nearly $1 million in legal fees, which were paid mostly to the politically 
influential Los Angeles-based law firm of Nossaman Guthner Knox &amp; Elliott 
during the last 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Also, several thousand dollars in recent travel expenses have drawn criticism 
from Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who is also chairman of 
both the Orange County Transportation Commission and the San Joaquin Hills 
agency board. 
</P>
<P>
Those legal and travel expenses have been vigorously defended by John Meyer, 
executive director for both toll road agencies, which share the same office and 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer also said Monday that he stands by the agencies' rejection of the 
proposed merger on the ground that it could jeopardize financing for the toll 
roads, which are expected to open in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to do anything to create a level of uncertainty about our 
finance plan," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The toll road agencies have raised more than $100 million from developer fees. 
A countywide super-agency created through a merger would be dominated by cities 
in the northern county but would control the developers' funds -- which may be 
used legally only for the three toll road corridors in the south county, Meyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Mayor pro Tem Richard B. Edgar, who is a member of the Foothill/Eastern 
road board, as well as a member of the county transportation commission, took 
strong exception to Reed's comments Monday. 
</P>
<P>
During the commission meeting, Edgar said it is "premature" to pressure the 
toll road agencies to merge with other boards and commissions, because a study 
of the potential economic benefits is incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
"I violently object to what he (Reed) said," Edgar added after the meeting. "I 
don't think that consolidation (merger) is going to be advantageous." 
</P>
<P>
The toll road agencies were created by state legislation and by joint-powers 
agreements between the county and the cities along each of the toll road 
routes. Edgar predicted that any attempt to force a merger would fail legally, 
because the cities involved would not approve. 
</P>
<P>
Toll road officials last year rejected merger discussions, saying that 
consolidation with other panels and commissions would complicate the agencies' 
efforts to sell revenue bonds needed to help pay for building toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, attorney Gregory W. Sanders, a member of the Nossaman 
law firm, accused Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the county 
transportation commission, of prompting Riley aide Mark Goodman into 
questioning spending by the toll road agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders also said Oftelie has been upset with the toll road agencies since they 
pushed through legislation in Sacramento that authorized toll collections in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sanders, Oftelie opposed the legislation behind the scenes while 
supporting it in public statements. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Oftelie -- who has been promoting a proposal now under study to 
merge all of the county's transportation agencies -- said he briefly discussed 
the toll road agencies' legal costs with Goodman and Riley a year ago, but has 
not since then. 
</P>
<P>
And Oftelie insisted that he has steadfastly promoted the toll road 
legislation.

GROUND TO BE BROKEN FOR ASIAN SENIOR CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIMBERLY L. JACKSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc. will hold ground-breaking 
ceremonies Wednesday for a 7,000-square-foot center in Santa Ana to help 
recently immigrated seniors adapt to Western culture. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian Senior Acculturation Center, to be located at 1618 W. 1st St., will 
provide companionship, meals and activities for up to 150 seniors, according to 
Tuong Duy Nguyen, executive director of the nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We want our seniors to join the mainstream, Nguyen said of the mostly 
Vietnamese seniors who will be served. To accomplish that, the organization 
will offer English classes and will familiarize seniors with Western traditions 
and laws, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said 7,200 of the estimated 120,000 Vietnamese in Orange County are 60 
or more years old. The center, however, will be open to all nationalities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serves Vietnamese, Latinos, Other Asians 
</P>
<P>
The group already operates a prototype of the larger center from a small room 
next to its office at 3701 W. McFadden Ave. in Santa Ana. That center, opened 
in 1984, serves mostly Vietnamese but also other Asians and Latinos. The 
seniors are encouraged to share their cultures with each other and to make new 
friends, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
While loneliness is common among seniors, it often is more acute for immigrants 
who do not speak English and are unfamiliar with American culture. 
</P>
<P>
"They are too lonely," Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
When the 1st Street center opens early next year, the smaller operation on 
McFadden Avenue will move there. The 2-story building, expected to cost 
$930,000, will feature an Oriental motif. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Community of Orange County expects to raise half of the 
construction cost from private donations, Nguyen said, and the balance will 
come from state and local grants. The services will be free to the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
The ground breaking will be held at 10 a.m. For more information, call (714) 
775-2637.

CYPRESS DOWNS DEVELOPMENT BALLOTING TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. today in Cypress as voters decide 
the fate of the controversial Cypress Downs development, a proposed 167-acre 
business and recreational complex surrounding Los Alamitos Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
The only item on the special election ballot asks Cypress' 23,491 voters 
whether a zone change should be approved for one of the largest remaining open 
spaces in northwestern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the project spent more than $215,000 in a mail and publicity 
campaign, all but about $645 of the money contributed by SDC Co., the Newport 
Beach firm that will buy and develop the land if the measure passes. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents, Concerned Citizens of Cypress for Greenbelt and Open Spaces 
Preservation, raised only $25,989, which was less than its $38,870 campaign 
debts. They contend that the Cypress Downs development will increase traffic 
and lower property values. Under present zoning laws, the land may be developed 
only for public or semipublic uses.

CANADA WARNED OF FUGITIVE 'HAVEN' ROLE

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian told Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in a letter 
released Monday that Canada could become "a haven" for murder suspects fleeing 
prosecution because of its perceived reluctance to extradite fugitives facing 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian raised the issue in a letter praising the Canadian courts for 
finding, after lengthy legal maneuvering, that there is enough evidence to 
extradite mass murder suspect Charles Ng. 
</P>
<P>
The governor, however, cited the case of a second murder suspect, Rudy Milan 
Blanusa, as evidence to support his belief that Canada's slowness in returning 
criminal suspects to the United States for trial may encourage more fugitives 
from the death penalty to seek refuge in Canada, which has no capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Blanusa, suspected of two murders near Modesto, was arrested by Canadian 
authorities Jan. 23 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Deukmejian said in the 
letter to Mulroney that Blanusa's case is "an example of a death penalty 
fugitive fleeing the law for refuge in your country." 
</P>
<P>
Blanusa is a suspect in the murders of two brothers, whose bodies were found in 
a field south of Modesto 3 years ago. The Stanislaus County district attorney's 
office has initiated extradition proceedings to return Blanusa to California.

MANY TOP GIRLS TEAMS GET BYES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The first round of the Southern Section girls' basketball playoffs starts 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck trying to catch a top team in action, though. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda High School, Orange County's top-ranked team and the No. 1-seeded 
team in the 3-A pairings, has a bye. 
</P>
<P>
So does Mission Viejo, the No. 1-seeded team in the 4-AA. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the 4-AA really doesn't have much of a first round. Valencia, Tustin, 
Orange, University, Kennedy and Canyon also have first-round byes. 
</P>
<P>
The only 4-AA games Thursday night are San Bernardino against Perris, San 
Clemente against Downey and Agoura versus Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A, third-ranked Katella is seeded No. 4 and a bye. Woodbridge and La 
Habra also have byes in that division. 
</P>
<P>
The byes are because of the Southern Section's restructured playoff format, 
which has created four more divisions (there are nine this season). There just 
aren't enough teams to fill the brackets, so a number of teams will have to 
wait until Saturday's second round to play their first game. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at the pairings: 
</P>
<P>
In the 5-AA, fourth-ranked Fountain Valley (16-8) is seeded No. 4 and plays 
host to Saddleback (13-11). 
</P>
<P>
In the 5-A, fifth-ranked Ocean View (23-3, the No. 1 team from the Sunset 
League) has a bye and plays the Diamond Bar-Capistrano Valley winner in the 
second round Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo (21-4) has the top spot in the 4-AA and awaits the winner of 
Thursday's San Bernardino-Perris game. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia (16-9) plays at Cajon (15-8) in the second round. Tustin (15-10 and 
seeded No. 4) plays the San Clemente-Downey winner. University (19-6) plays 
host to Orange (Pacific Coast No. 2) and Canyon (19-4, the second-seeded team) 
plays host to Kennedy (11-9) in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A, Katella (22-3) plays the winner of the Buena Park-Bishop Montgomery 
game in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A, Brea-Olinda (23-2) awaits the winner of the Sierra Vista-Bellflower 
game. La Quinta (21-3, the third-seeded team) also has a bye. The Aztecs play 
the Foothill-Brawley winner on Saturday.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL;

<P>
THIS SEASON, LAMOUREUX IS MAKING HIS HEADLINES ON THE COURT 
</P>

<P>
When Andre Lamoureux played basketball in high school, he had a little 
different attitude about the game. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet-9 and 260 pounds, he was taller and bigger than most he played 
against. His advantage allowed things such things as points and rebounds to 
come easily to him. He averaged 21 points and 14 rebounds a game as a senior at 
Los Alamitos High School. 
</P>
<P>
But that advantage left a bit of a hole in his game -- defense. 
</P>
<P>
"My thing last season was that I had to score more than the player I was 
guarding," Lamoureux said. "I figured that was good enough." 
</P>
<P>
Lamoureux was termed a project player out of high school by scouts and coaches 
in the area, but last March, Lamoureux appeared good enough for UCLA coach Walt 
Hazzard to recruit him. The two came to a verbal agreement and Lamoureux 
planned to play at UCLA this season. 
</P>
<P>
Things got complicated a month later. 
</P>
<P>
Hazzard was fired and replaced by Jim Harrick, who had a meeting with 
Lamoureux. Neither side would say exactly what was discussed, only that UCLA 
would honor the scholarship if Lamoureux wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
But the tone of the visit with Harrick became obvious a few weeks later when 
Lamoureux announced he would not be playing at UCLA. When no other four-year 
college recruited him, he decided to attend Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
The local papers reported the story chapter by chapter and Lamoureux's mother 
tried to shield him from the news. But he saw the stories anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to read your name in the paper and see it's not positive," 
Lamoureux said. "But that is part of playing the game, having people write bad 
things about you sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was removed from the situation and there was nothing I could do about it. It 
doesn't bother me anymore. I watched UCLA and USC play the other night and I 
thought I could be there, but I know I wouldn't have been playing." 
</P>
<P>
This season, Lamoureux has made a few changes. He has lost 35 pounds and is 
running the court better. He is also going by his proper name -- Andre, instead 
of Dre. It sounds more formal, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Lamoureux, a starter most of the season, leads Cypress (13-14 overall and 5-5 
in Orange Empire Conference play) with 13.3 points and 5.6 rebounds a game. 
Lamoureux is shooting 59% (138 for 235) from the field and 73% (83 of 114) on 
free-throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress Coach Don Johnson says Lamoureux isn't the most dedicated team member 
when it comes to improving his strength or working on defense and rebounding -- 
and Lamoureux agrees. 
</P>
<P>
He gets into the gym an hour or more before practice. But he seems to work more 
on his 20-footer, something power forwards don't use much in college. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm finally getting it in my mind that defense wins game," Lamoureux said. 
"There are some things that I have to work on to improve and I know it. I have 
improved on defense a little, it just might not look like it." 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
The championship game of the Cypress baseball tournament between Cypress and El 
Camino scheduled Monday at Cypress was postponed because of rain and 
rescheduled for 2 p.m Wednesday at Cypress. . . . Jackie Cook, an all-state 
volleyball player from Golden West, has made an oral commitment to play at 
California next fall. Cook led Golden West to the state title last fall. . . 
Dereck Crane of Orange Coast scored 52 points in two games last week to move 
into fourth place on the college's all-time scoring list. Crane scored 432 
points as a freshman and has 502 this season. Crane will have at least two more 
games to try and pass Bruce Champion, who scored 967 points from 1966 to '68. 
John Vallely (1966-68) heads the list with 1,538 points . . . Vince Hizon, a 
freshman guard for Cypress, has made 25 consecutive free throws, one short of 
the school record set this season by Ian Donnelly. Hizon has made 86% (102 of 
118) of his free-throw attempts and is shooting 90% (46 of 51) in conference 
play . . . San Diego Mesa defeated Fullerton, 5-0, Sunday in the championship 
of the Rancho Santiago Softball Tournament.

ESPERANZA GIRLS NO. 1 IN 4-A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In its first year in the 4-A division, Esperanza High School gained the top 
seeding in the Southern Section girls' soccer playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza, 22-0-3 overall, is the only undefeated team in the 4-A division. 
Last season, the Aztecs reached the final of the 3-A division before losing to 
Buena, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Esperanza, which was moved up to the 4-A division along with the 
rest of theEmpire League teams, has shown strong improvement in its offense, 
while maintaining its tenacious defense. 
</P>
<P>
But Esperanza, strong as it is, is in for a battle. No. 2 Capistrano Valley 
(17-5-1), No. 3 Royal (18-1-2), No. 4 Mission Viejo (18-2-1) and No. 5 Simi 
Valley (20-2-2) make this year's 4-A division the toughest in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
While Esperanza might rank as the division's toughest defensive team -- the 
Aztecs have shut out 18 opponents and allowed only seven goals this season -- 
Capistrano Valley is well-balanced. Royal, led by striker Tanya Schraml and 
sweeper Stevie Campbell, is a finesse-oriented team, while Mission Viejo has 
won the past three 4-A championships. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (20-0), the Southern Section 2-A champion the past three years, is 
considered by many to be almost unbeatable this season. But if any team has a 
shot, it could be No. 2 Mater Dei (17-4-2). 
</P>
<P>
Other top 10 3-A teams include No. 5 La Habra (12-3-4) and No. 6 Canyon 
(15-2-3). 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A division, No. 5 Valencia (14-6-0) is the only Orange County team in 
the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1-A division, only two Orange County teams -- Capistrano Valley 
Christian and Santa Margarita -- are involved, and both must play wild-card 
matches Wednesday.

REGISTRY'S CLOSING MAY POSE TEST OF ADVANCE NOTICE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Registry Hotel in Irvine closed and laid off 230 workers a week ago, 
it became one of the first apparent violators of a new federal law requiring 
companies to give advance notice of most plant closings and large layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But several provisions of the law -- called WARN, for Worker Adjustment and 
Retraining Notification -- are so vague that it will take a court ruling to 
determine whether the hotel's owners really broke it. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the plant-closing law was intentionally written so no federal, 
state or local agency has enforcement powers. In other words, WARN is 
relatively toothless. 
</P>
<P>
While the federal Department of Labor was given jurisdiction to write 
regulations to implement the law, the only way to prove a violation is through 
a civil suit filed by aggrieved employees, their labor unions or local 
government officials, said Don A. Balcer, regional administrator of the Labor 
Department's employment and training branch. 
</P>
<P>
For the Registry, whose employees were non-union, that means that either a 
laid-off worker or Irvine would have to sue in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
No former Registry employees could be reached for comment. But Irvine officials 
said it is unlikely that the city will sue because the Registry's owners -- 
Associated Investors Joint Venture in Dallas -- are in bankruptcy proceedings 
and apparently have few assets. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the situation, and they certainly did not file any advance 
notice of the closing with us," said Paul Brady, Irvine's assistant city 
manager. "But we have been working with them for 2 years -- that's how long 
they've been in arrears on the (city-imposed) bed tax, and it doesn't look like 
there is much to go after" in a suit. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Katz, an attorney for the Registry, declined to comment on the reasons 
the hotel was closed and its employees fired without the advance warning 
required in the new law. "We gave notice to employees on the day they picked up 
their checks," was his only response. 
</P>
<P>
For most Registry workers, that was the day after the closing. Workers 
interviewed at the time said they had not been given any advance notice and, in 
fact, had been assured just before the hotel was closed that their jobs were 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
WARN took effect Feb. 4, just 3 days before the closing of the posh hotel, 
which is across MacArthur Boulevard from John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the law requires 60 days' advance notice of most business shutdowns 
or "mass layoffs" involving 50 or more full-time workers. It subjects violators 
to fines of up to $30,000 and payment of up to 60 days' back wages and fringe 
benefits for affected workers. 
</P>
<P>
But the hotly debated law contains several exemptions for financially troubled 
businesses and fails to define the earliest date on which advance notifications 
are to begin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two of Three Interpretations 
</P>
<P>
In the Registry's case, two of three possible interpretations of the 
notification process would find the hotel in violation of the law, said a 
senior attorney with the federal Department of Labor 
</P>
<P>
Supporters and opponents of the law agreed that only future court decisions can 
hash out the ambiguities. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Manufacturers, a major trade group that fought bitterly 
to keep WARN from being enacted, said the law is riddled with inconsistencies 
and unclear language. 
</P>
<P>
And WARN does not receive high marks for clarity from some federal Labor 
Department officials, either. 
</P>
<P>
Even the law's principal author, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), expects it to 
end up in court. Nancy Coffey, a spokeswoman for Metzenbaum, said uncertainty 
over when the 60-day advance notice period begins "will probably go to court." 
</P>
<P>
She said, however, that Metzenbaum has been consistent in insisting that 
companies cannot go ahead with layoffs that are governed by the law without a 
full 60-day notice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Err on the Side of Fairness' 
</P>
<P>
"So a company that had a Feb. 6 layoff should have filed notice on Dec. 6," 
Coffey said. "We told people to err on the side of fairness and live by the 
spirit of law -- which is to give people a fair and humane amount of notice so 
they have a shock absorber and can get retraining or find new jobs." 
</P>
<P>
That is the same advice that the National Assn. of Manufacturers has been 
giving its 13,500 members since the law was passed in July. 
</P>
<P>
Balcer, the regional labor department official, called the measure "poorly 
written." He said that in drafting the regulations, department officials "left 
it up to the courts to decide" some key issues, including when the 60-day 
notification begins. 
</P>
<P>
A Labor Department attorney in Washington, who spoke on condition that his name 
not be used, said there is "a lot of vagueness in the law, and there is no way 
we can define all possible circumstances" in the implementing regulations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only Measure of Enforcement 
</P>
<P>
Several Labor Department officials also criticized the law for making a civil 
suit the only measure of enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney in Metzenbaum's office said that was done to keep from creating a 
new government bureaucracy to enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the manufacturers' association "didn't like any of the language 
in the law," said Renee Reymond, director of legislative affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Labor is reviewing comments on its interim WARN regulations, 
including a manufacturers association brief that Reymond described as "a 
27-page document pointing out 17 areas" that should be clarified. 
</P>
<P>
"We see problems with it being enforced by the courts," she said. "It will lead 
to overloading the court system because it contains all kinds of undefined 
terms and phrases . . . including the effective date." 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department attorney said that while the law became effective Feb. 4, 
there is no consensus on when companies had to begin giving notice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When Do 60 Days Begin? 
</P>
<P>
"The law says you can't close (or lay off a substantial number of employees) 
unless you give 60 days' notice," he said. "But for the early cases, the 
question is whether that 60 days began even before Feb. 4, or is it 60 days 
from Feb. 4, or just as much notice as you can give between Feb. 4 and the time 
you close? We did not take a position in the regulations; we left it to the 
courts to decide." 
</P>
<P>
In the Registry case, the Labor Department attorney said, the hotel would be in 
clear violation of the law and liable for 60 days of back pay and fines of $500 
per day if the notice period began before Feb. 4, or would be liable for 3 days 
of fines and back pay if a truncated advance notice was given Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
But if a court holds that only closures and layoffs occurring 60 days or more 
from the Feb. 4 effective date are covered, he said, then there will be no 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
The Registry case includes one other wrinkle that illustrates the vagaries of 
the new law: The hotel's owners had filed for protection from creditors under 
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in November and were in Chapter 11 
proceedings when the hotel was closed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reasonably Foreseeable' 
</P>
<P>
One section of WARN says companies are excused from the 60-day advance notice 
requirement when a layoff or plant closure is the result of "business 
circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of that time that notice 
would have been required." 
</P>
<P>
A second exemption, called the "faltering company" clause, says that notice of 
less than 60 days is permissible if the full notice would have squelched 
arrangements for new capital or new business that would have enabled the 
company to avoid or postpone the layoff. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its bankruptcy proceedings, the Registry could not claim that its 
demise was caused by unforeseen circumstances, the Labor Department attorney 
said; the faltering-company clause still requires companies to file notice as 
soon as practical. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel owners, according to an earlier interview with sources involved in 
the bankruptcy proceedings, failed to meet a Feb. 1 deadline to arrange for new 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
So even if the partnership met the other tests of the faltering-business 
exemption, the Labor Department attorney said, the management still let 6 days 
elapse without filing the required notifications before finally shutting the 
hotel's doors.

NEWPORT ELECTRONICS ACCEPTS OFFER BY SENSOR CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just 2 days after Chairman Barret B. Weekes offered to buy Newport Electronics 
Inc. for $10 million, the Santa Ana company's directors fell into the arms of 
another suitor who had earlier offered the same price. 
</P>
<P>
That suitor is Sensor Control Corp., an aggressive Silicon Valley manufacturer 
of heat and pressure sensors that run machines on factory assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Electronics makes the meters used to "read" information from sensors, 
including some of the devices that Sensor Control manufactures. 
</P>
<P>
If the deal goes through, it would be Sensor Control's fourth acquisition in 3 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The offer values Newport Electronics, with 1.1 million shares outstanding, at 
nearly $10 million -- a handsome price for a stock that had not traded for more 
than $5.50 in the year before Sensor Control made its offer. 
</P>
<P>
Sensor Control had first offered $8 a share in December but informally raised 
the offer to $9 early last week, both companies said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Weekes too offered $9 a share after discussing his offer with 
seven other company officers. 
</P>
<P>
Weekes, who owns 20% of the stock, abstained Saturday when Newport directors 
voted unanimously to accept Sensor Control's offer, said Director Norman Gray, 
a consultant to the company. That vote behind them, the board took no action on 
Weekes' offer. 
</P>
<P>
Weekes -- who is also chief executive and president of the company -- did not 
return a call Monday after Newport Electronics announced the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The sale to Sensor Control is contingent on the company obtaining financing by 
March 3. The agreement signed Saturday also provides for a breakup fee of 
$300,000 for Sensor if Newport accepts a higher offer for its shares. 
</P>
<P>
Sensor Control already has a lender lined up but no firm commitment. Still, 
that was enough to give it a leg up on Weekes' offer, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
"The board felt his timing was too late," he said. "Sensor's initial offer was 
made in December, and they had a loan commitment from a major lender, even 
though it was conditional." 
</P>
<P>
Yet another suitor, which offered $8.50 a share shortly after Sensor Control 
made its first offer of $8, said it is now out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
InterVen Partners of Los Angeles, whose $8.50 offer expired earlier, said 
Monday it would not make a higher offer for Newport. 
</P>
<P>
A venture capital firm, InterVen thought Newport Electronics stock was a deal 
last year when it was trading at $4 a share on the over-the-counter market, or 
only 70% of the value carried on the company's own books. InterVen approached 
Newport Electronics about a buyout that would take the company private. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Electronics reported sales through the third quarter of $13 million; 
sales were $11.1 million last year. It expects to end the year with about $16 
million in sales. But the company said higher expenses this year knocked 
earnings down to $499,000, from $569,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sensor Control, based in Sunnyvale, is less than half the size of Newport 
Electronics, with sales of $5 million for the fiscal year that ended in the 
middle of last year. That was up from $3.7 million the year before. But much of 
the boost in sales last year actually came from a new company Sensor Control 
bought. 
</P>
<P>
Profits were a very respectable $529,000 last year, but that was a drop from 
$885,000 the year before. Sensor Control had to write off $300,000 it spent 
last year when it gave up a hostile takeover of a New Jersey company. 
</P>
<P>
Few changes are planned for Newport Electronics, Sensor Control President Jim 
Hawkins said, but he answered with a "no comment" when asked whether Weekes 
would stay on. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a fine guy, and it's obviously a fine company, and that's all I really 
want to say," Hawkins said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Archive Corp. has agreed in principle to acquire a private, Florida-based, 
computer tape-drive maker for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard Electronics is a 7-year-old company that makes tape drives for 
International Business Machines Corp. personal computers and compatible 
machines. Like Archive's products, Maynard's tape drives are used to make 
copies of data stored on hard-disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
Financial details of the sale were not disclosed. Archive said only that the 
deal will not involve the issuance of new Archive stock. 
</P>
<P>
"The products and market served are complementary in all aspects," said B.J. 
Rone, Archive's vice president of finance and administration. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard had sales of about $16 million for the last 6 months of 1988. Sales

FIRMS HAD SOUGHT TO PUT CHAIN INTO BANKRUPTCY; 
</P>
<P>
HEIDI'S REACHES A SETTLEMENT WITH 3 CREDITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heidi's Frogen Yozurt Shoppes Inc. has quietly settled its differences with 
three creditors who last week filed papers to put the troubled chain into 
involuntary bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. But at least one of the creditors, 
the Paper Co. of Anaheim, should eventually receive all of the $18,655 it is 
owed for bags, cups and other paper supplies, the company's president, Mike 
Madden, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The other two creditors are Southwest Traders Inc, a Temecula distributor that 
said it is owed $51.634 for yogurt, toppings and juices that it delivered to 
Heidi's, and Superior Electrical Advertising Inc. of Long Beach, which wants 
$35,786 for signs at Heidi's stores. 
</P>
<P>
Company founder Heidi Miller confirmed the settlement and said the creditors 
will receive about 15 cents for every $1 they are owed. She said she didn't 
know whether the Paper Co. would receive all of its money over time. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed Feb. 6 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, the three 
creditors contended that they were never paid for merchandise or services 
provided to the Laguna Hills dessert chain or to its handful of company-owned 
stores. They filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition under Chapter 7 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
But within hours of the filing, executives with Steve's Homemade Ice Cream of 
New Yorkhad stated publicly that a settlement was in the works. Steve's has 
agreed to purchase the 86% of Heidi's that is owned by founder Heidi Miller and 
Executive Vice President Brian Pallas. 
</P>
<P>
"The (bankruptcy) judge has to accept their offer," said Jeff Stern, who heads 
Superior Electrical. "But I've negotiated with them, and as long as they're 
doing things by the book, I'll settle." He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Madden said he is "real satisfied" with the agreement. "I'm getting all my 
money," although not in a lump sum. 
</P>
<P>
Madden said his company is the only one of the three that filed the bankruptcy 
petition that will not continue to do business with Heidi's. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of Southwest Traders, Ken Smith, said last week that Heidi's had 
terminated his agreement to supply products to the chain. But according to 
Madden, Southwest Traders has reached a new agreement and will continue to 
supply yogurt and toppings and begin supplying paper products to Heidi's. 
</P>
<P>
Smith could not be reached for comment.

THE ULTIMATE VALENTINE'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Did you remember the roses? How about the truffles? Champagne, too? 
</P>
<P>
Now that the eyes, nose and taste buds are covered, how about a Valentine's Day 
present for the ears, the mind and, perhaps, even the soul of the one you love? 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Calendar writers asked Orange County arts mavens to count 
the ways that great artistic creations -- the sweetest pop songs, the most 
touching classical music, the most poetic plays -- figure into this day that 
honors love and romance. 
</P>

Theater 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Rowe, artistic director of the Laguna Playhouse in Laguna Beach: 
</P>
<P>
"Elizabeth the Queen" by Maxwell Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
We'll be doing the play next year. It's about how the leadership of the Western 
world is set aside for the sake of romance. Essex gives up his career and his 
life for a woman who is very obviously his senior, Queen Elizabeth. It has 
beautiful, romantic language as well. It speaks poetry. 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano de Bergerac" by Edmond Rostand. 
</P>
<P>
This is an obvious choice. Again, love is shown to be the pre-eminent impulse 
in life. 
</P>
<P>
"Play It Again, Sam" by Woody Allen. 
</P>
<P>
This choice comes to mind because of how I met my wife, Katherine. On closing 
night of ("Sam") we fell in love at the cast party. I had wandered into the 
empty theater feeling the usual post-partum depression. The set was down, and 
there was a cherry picker in the middle of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
I climbed into the cherry picker and pressed the button. On the way up I began 
reciting the nose speech from "Cyrano": "The face that launched a thousand 
ships and burned the topless towers Illium. . . . These are the things you 
might have said had you some tinge of letters or of wit." 
</P>
<P>
When I got to the top of this 20-foot arc, I was finishing up the speech, and I 
took off my hat and sailed it into the empty theater. Katherine had walked in 
without my knowing, and sat down and -- this is a true story -- my hat landed 
in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
Well, she jumped up and said, "I want to have your child!" A year later we were 
married. We now have two kids. I guess she got more than she bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas F. Bradac, artistic director of the Grove Theatre Company in Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Romeo and Juliet" by William Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
This play is about the passion of young love and the blindness of doing 
anything for love. 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano de Bergerac." 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano" is about unrequited love, the pure love of giving oneself for the love 
of another. 
</P>
<P>
"Venus and Adonis" by Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a play, it's an epic poem. But we presented it in a dramatic 
one-man version last summer. It's very passionate and sexual. 
</P>
<P>
The interesting thing is that all of these choices have tragic endings. You 
don't walk off into the sunset hand in hand in any of them. You pay for love. 
</P>
<P>
"Two Gentlemen of Verona" by Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
I would choose this one for silly romance. . . . We all are a little silly when 
we fall in love. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Cohen, chairman of the UC Irvine drama department: 
</P>
<P>
"Much Ado About Nothing" by Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
This is the most romantic play ever written. It's a very modern play about the 
crisis of love. How do you balance the privacy of the individual and the need 
for love and companionship? How do you have both? That is what Benedick and 
Beatrice and Claudio and Hero are trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Benson, artistic director of South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa: 
</P>
<P>
"The Playboy of the Western World" by John Millington Synge. 
</P>
<P>
To me, this is the most romantic play of all time. It is gorgeous stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano de Bergerac." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to go wrong with that one. 
</P>
<P>
"Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
It captures people falling in love -- the "limmerance," if you will. 
</P>
<P>
David Emmes, producting artistic director of SCR: 
</P>
<P>
"Cyrano de Bergerac." 
</P>
<P>
I put "Cyrano" in a class by itself because of its great lyricism and because 
of the non-demanding, selfless love that we see manifest there. 
</P>
<P>
A distant second and third are "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (by Shakespeare) and 
"Fool for Love" (by Sam Shepard). "Midsummer Night's Dream," because it is 
about youthful, exuberant love and sexual awakening. "Fool for Love" because, 
in its bizarre way, it is about consuming, compelling visceral love, an almost 
ineffable love. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Terry, artistic director of the Alternative Repertory Theatre in Santa Ana: 
</P>
<P>
"The Eagle With Two Heads" by Jean Cocteau. 
</P>
<P>
The two characters would rather be dead than not be in love. They want an 
idealistic understanding. The language is beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
"Much Ado About Nothing" and "Cyrano de Bergerac," of course, would be my 
classical selections. 
</P>
<P>
For a contemporary choice I would say Tom Stoppard's "The Real Thing" because 
it grasps the modern dilemma of falling out of love with your spouse and 
falling in love with someone else, and all the pain and guilt that accompanies 
that.

PEROT DEAL COULD UNLOCK DOORS FOR AN ORANGE COUNTY COMPUTER FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Archive Corp. officials go on the road to woo investors these days, they 
have something jazzier to talk about than their hit computer memory product. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Archive officials can talk about H. Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, 
computer entrepreneur and former General Motors director and chief critic. Last 
month, Perot's Dallas-based investment company announced plans to invest $6.7 
million in Archive for the rights to certain technology developed by the small 
Costa Mesa firm. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the name-dropping value, Perot's involvement promises to bring Archive 
exposure and attention that few computer-component manufacturers are able to 
get. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement enhances Archive's credibility on Wall Street as a firm "that can 
do leading technology work and is a valuable company with promising growth," 
said Marshall J. Leisten, an analyst with the Volpe &amp; Covington brokerage 
firm in San Francisco. "It also says they've got something sexy." 
</P>
<P>
Added B. J. Rone, Archive's vice president for finance and administration: 
"There are people who have never heard of Archive, but they have heard of Ross 
Perot. They watch where people like Perot invest." 
</P>
<P>
It was Rone, a former Texan, who initiated the deal last summer by calling on a 
former business acquaintance who now works for Perot in Dallas. One thing led 
to another, and soon Rone and Archive Chairman D. Howard Lewis were on a plane 
bound for Dallas and a meeting with Perot. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a wild shot, and it worked," said Rone. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Perot Investment Management Corp. will help bankroll Archive's 
development of new products. Archive and Perot officials, citing competitive 
reasons, won't say much about the specific technologies involved. 
</P>
<P>
The Perot company has acquired the right to buy more than 1 million shares of 
Archive stock, or about 7.4% of the company. In addition, Perot's firm will own 
the rights to any new technology developed through the partnership. Archive has 
retained the right to buy back the technology or license it from Perot. 
</P>
<P>
"We think they have exciting technologies and are very well-positioned to 
exploit them," said Steven L. Blasnik of the Perot Group, the parent of Perot 
Investment Management. "We were impressed with the quality of the management 
people . . . and with their financial performance. We realized these were 
people who know how to run a business." 
</P>
<P>
For Archive, the Perot deal means the company won't have to dip into its 
$12-million cash kitty to fund new product development. Instead, Archive 
officials say, the company will use the cash to buy up competitors. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, on Monday Archive announced such a deal -- the company said it reached 
an agreement to acquire Maynard Electronics, a small Casselberry, Fla., tape 
drive maker, for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
Technology investments are nothing new for Perot. He has invested $20 million 
in Next, the computer company headed by Apple Computer co-founder Steven Jobs. 
But Archive is Perot's first investment in a publicly held computer firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Perot connection has helped Archive's stock, which has been floundering 
between $6 and $7 a share for most of the past year. The over-the-counter 
stock, which traded at $8 just before the Perot deal was announced Jan. 18, 
closed Monday at $10. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts speculate that Perot was attracted by Archive's involvement in digital 
audio tape products for storing computer information. For example, the company 
has an agreement with a unit of Japan's Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co. to 
develop and manufacture DAT products. 
</P>
<P>
DAT technology, which is beginning to make an appearance in consumer audio 
products, allows information to be converted and stored on tape as digital 
pulses, rather than as magnetic pulses. 
</P>
<P>
Digital audio tape offers several advantages over magnetic tape. Because it is 
smaller, DAT can be fit into the same slot in a desktop computer where a 3 
1/2-inch hard disk drive usually goes. It is also thought that DAT technology 
might eventually offer more storage capacity than magnetic tape. 
</P>
<P>
Archive manufactures streaming cartridge tape drives, which are magnetic tapes 
used to make backup copies of data stored on computer hard disks. The backup 
tapes prevent data from being lost if the computer "crashes." Founded in 1980, 
the Costa Mesa firm pioneered the market for its streaming quarter-inch-wide 
tape drives. (Streaming refers to the way the tape move through a cartridge.) 
</P>
<P>
As the number of personal computers and workstations equipped with 
high-capacity hard disks has grown, so has the market for tape drives. Today's 
PCs typically come with a hard disk capable of storing in excess of 100 million 
characters of information. Unlike floppy disks, the hard disks cannot be 
removed and stored in a safe place. 
</P>
<P>
While floppy disks are fine for copying small amounts of data, they are 
impractical for storing information from the high-capacity hard disks. Copying 
the data from a 20-megabyte hard disk, for example, requires 40 floppies and 
about 80 minutes of time. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of computer users who still use floppies or who don't back up 
their files at all," said Raymond C. Freeman, president of Freeman Associates 
in Santa Barbara, a computer industry consulting firm. "But there is an 
ever-expanding number of people who are using quarter-inch drives" for copying 
data. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Piece of Market 
</P>
<P>
Fear of computer viruses that can destroy software programs has also aided 
Archive, said independent computer analyst Donald Sinsabaugh. "If you want to 
make sure you have up-to-date files and keep away from viruses, the best way to 
do that is to have back-up files," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts cite Archive's strong position in a growing market as a major reason 
for the company's favorable prospects. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa firm has about 26% of the $400 million market for quarter-inch 
tape drives, according to Freeman Associates. Archive's sales have grown from 
$38 million in fiscal 1984 to $122.7 million for its latest fiscal year, ended 
in September. Net income last year was $10.5 million, up 72% over the earlier 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The financial picture hasn't always looked so rosy. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1986, Archive's auditors discovered a huge accounting error that 
resulted in a $5-million inventory writedown and an $845,000 loss for the 
quarter. The embarrassing episode led to the resignation a week later of the 
company's president, J. Peter Wilson. Lewis, who had given up the president's 
job in 1985, returned to try to clean up the firm's finances. 
</P>
<P>
Perot has a reputation as a strong-willed businessman who likes to be in 
control. A Newsweek magazine article recently described Perot, who once 
organized a commando unit to rescue two employees jailed in Iran, as "the Last 
Take-Charge Guy in America." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Take Advice 
</P>
<P>
The best-known example of the Perot fighting spirit followed the sale of his 
Electronic Data Systems company to General Motors in 1984 for $2.5 billion. 
Perot, who joined GM's board, engaged in a very public squabble with GM 
Chairman Roger Smith over how the giant auto maker was being run. Smith finally 
had enough of the persistent criticism and kicked Perot off the board, but not 
before agreeing to pay him $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Archive officials say they don't anticipate Perot playing a 
similar role with their company. They point out that, unlike the GM situation, 
Perot will not serve as a director nor have any direct involvement in managing 
the firm.

The state ended the 1987-88 budget year last summer with a deficit of $1.445 
billion calculated under generally accepted accounting principles, the auditor 
general's office said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration said the state treasury had a slim surplus of $4 
million when the budget year ended June 30, 1988, but a variety of other state 
fiscal experts have disputed that finding. The $1.445-billion figure offered by 
acting Auditor Gen. Kurt Sjoberg was the highest yet in assessing the state's 
financial condition for 1987-88, when a $1-billion revenue shortfall 
materialized in April in personal and corporate income tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
The perilous condition of the treasury was exacerbated, Sjoberg said, by a 
$1.1-billion tax rebate that Californians received a few months before the 
shortfall surfaced.

JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT BACK IN SERVICE

<P>
Operations were back to normal at John Wayne Airport today after the blast from 
jet engines damaged new electrical cables Monday night, causing the new runway 
lights to fail, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Workers had not yet had a chance to bury the cables underground, and the jet 
blast blew off sandbags that were protecting the electrical line, airport 
manager George Rebella said. "It was kind of a freak situation," he said. "The 
jet blast stretched the cables and exposed them to water, causing shorts." 
</P>
<P>
The new cables, at the north end of the main runway, would not have been 
affected by jet blast if air traffic controllers had not reversed the take-off 
pattern because of weather conditions, Rebella said. The new electrical system 
replaces a decades-old system that had shorted out repeatedly because it was 
worn out, Rebella said. More than a dozen airlines' flights were diverted or 
cancelled because of the electrical failure, and some incoming passengers were 
bused to John Wayne from other airports late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said service was back to normal this morning. Airport 
spokeswoman Kathie Rutherford said the affected cables will be buried 
underground when the airport closes at 11 p.m. tonight, the normal curfew for 
incoming airline flights. She said the airport will also be closed to small 
general aviation aircraft at that time.

A Fullerton man fatally shot his estranged wife and then himself after an 
argument Monday night, police said. Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry said the 
31-year-old man, whose name was withheld pending notification of his family, 
went to the Travelodge motel in the 1700 block of East Katella Avenue about 
9:30 p.m. to see his wife, Sandra Melendez, a hotel employee. Witnesses said 
they heard three shots fired after Melendez and her husband, who had recently 
separated, had an argument. When police arrived at the hotel, near Anaheim 
Stadium, both were found in the hotel's office. Paramedics pronounced Melendez, 
who was in her 30s, and her husband dead at the scene.

A new Air Force Delta 2 rocket successfully boosted a $65-million navigation 
satellite into orbit today in an apparently flawless maiden flight marking the 
debut of a revitalized post-Challenger military space program. 
</P>
<P>
Under a clear blue sky, the 126-foot, $30-million rocket roared to life and 
majestically climbed away from launch complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air 
Force Station adjacent to NASA's Kennedy Space Center, 48 hours behind schedule 
because of bad weather Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five minutes after blastoff, the satellite was safely deployed in its 
planned preliminary orbit, an Air Force spokesman said. If all goes well, an 
on-board rocket will fire later this week to circularize the orbit at an 
altitude of 12,500 miles.

New York's Democrat-controlled Assembly rejected, after rancorous debate, a 
resolution honoring former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, for 
their eight years in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"He made selfishness the national byword," said Democratic Assemblyman Anthony 
Genovesi. "He made it legitimate for people to say 'I don't give a damn, I'm 
not my brother's keeper.' " 
</P>
<P>
Genovesi's remarks, which drew hisses from Republicans, echoed other Democrats 
who said Reagan's America left out the homeless, the poor and organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's vote was 78 to 58. Only two Democrats voted for the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution said "mere words cannot express the debt owed nor may brief 
phrases make manifest the leadership rendered."

A former mail carrier whose home was stacked with tons of undelivered junk mail 
was sentenced today to a year and a day in federal prison for failing to 
deliver two first-class letters. 
</P>
<P>
William Ryan, 59, told the court that he felt he couldn't deliver all the mail 
assigned to him on his rural route and started leaving a few pieces in his car 
every day about three years ago. "Things just seemed to snowball," Ryan told 
U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson. 
</P>
<P>
The first-class letters were discovered among nearly 500,000 pieces of mostly 
advertising brochures, catalogues, sweepstakes offers, give-aways and other 
so-called junk mail found heaped in and around his home last August by 
authorities following up on a tip.

The rampaging Sinking Creek carried away one motorist who ignored police

BLACK BOROUGH PRESIDENT TO CHALLENGE KOCH IN N.Y.

Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins today announced plans to challenge 
Mayor Edward Koch's almost certain reelection bid in a race that could make 
Dinkins the city's first black mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"I am running for the office of mayor," Dinkins told a packed news conference, 
ending more than a year of speculation over whether he would challenge the 
city's outspoken, three-term mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"I am running because New Yorkers deserve leadership that can set a new tone, 
offer a renewed spirit of hope and optimism, reawaken citizen participation and 
restore civility to the governmental process," Dinkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Polls show Dinkins has a good chance of defeating Koch. 
</P>
<P>
His expected candidacy had already persuaded at least three potential 
contenders to shy away from the race for fear too many entrants will split an 
organized opposition to the politically embattled mayor. 
</P>
<P>
A Daily News poll in January showed that Dinkins would capture 51% of the vote 
against Koch's 37% if the two were the only candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Koch has indicated that he will seek election to an unprecedented fourth term, 
while conceding that the bid will be his toughest fight yet. 
</P>
<P>
Koch's combative style appears to have soured many voters. The candidate who 
once said, "I'll get a better job, but you won't get a better mayor," found 
himself stumbling in his relations with many important voting blocks, including 
blacks.

A Briton jailed in Iran for more than three years on spying charges has been 
sentenced, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
The report did not specify the penalty against Roger Cooper, 52, but quoted 
Iranian Intelligence Minister Mohammed Mohammedi-Reyshahri as saying a "heavy 
ruling" had been issued. 
</P>
<P>
He said Cooper, a businessman who had worked in Iran for more than 30 years, 
confessed to spying and "nothing could halt this case." Cooper worked in key 
Iranian government agencies since 1958 and began spying for Britain in 1966, 
Mohammedi-Reyshahri said. He was arrested in November, 1985, and his continued 
detention has been a source of tension between Britain and Iran.

In the first simultaneous survey ever conducted of public attitudes toward 
health care in the United States, Britain and Canada, only 10% of Americans 
said their nation's health care system works "pretty well" and needs only minor

Box office revenues hit a record $4.46 billion last year although theater 
attendance took a slight dip, the president of the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America told theater owners today. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of competition for the eye and ear of the American consumer, in spite 
of an avalanche of visual options, the movie theater has not only refused to 
die, it has held firm," Jack Valenti told the opening session of SHOWEST. 
</P>
<P>
Theater admissions totaled 1.085 billion in 1988, Valenti said, the 12th 
consecutive year that attendance topped the 1-billion mark. The attendance 
figure was down .03%, Valenti said. Revenues were up 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti told theater owners that they are in a "watching war," with 90 million 
TV households across America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
"As alternate delivery systems invade the American living room, the 
conventional wisdom was and is: 'The cinema is bound to die.' " 
</P>
<P>
The movie industry has held firm despite predictions of its demise, Valenti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States recorded a per capita movie theater attendance mark of 4.4 
last year, compared to Great Britain with 1.4, Canada with 2.8, France and West 
Germany, 1.9 and Italy, 1.6.

USX Corp. said today it plans to establish a joint venture with Kobe Steel Ltd. 
of Japan to operate the U.S. company's specialty bar and tubular products plant 
at Lorain, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Each partner will own 50% of the joint venture, which will buy the Lorain plant 
and become the new employer of the approximately 3,000 workers who operate the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
USX withheld the proposed purchase price in a printed statement. 
</P>
<P>
The deal will be the first investment in the U.S. steel industry for Kobe, 
Japan's leading producer of steel bar products. A Kobe official in Tokyo said 
the partnership will help the company adjust to steel product requirements of 
Japanese vehicle makers in the United States.

An early advance faded in the stock market today, leaving prices mixed as 
investors continued to keep an eye on the outlook for interest rates and 
inflation.

<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 15 points in the early 
going, closed with a 1.25 loss at 2,281.25.

</P>
<P>
Rates rose in the credit markets today after the Commerce Department reported 
that retail sales rose 0.6% in January, slightly higher than expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said some traders took the strong growth in retail sales as a fresh 
bit of evidence in the case for tighter credit. 
</P>
<P>
Investors also seemed to be looking ahead uneasily to a series of other 
government reports later this week, including monthly data Friday on the 
nation's international trade position for December. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were mostly higher today but backed off from earlier gains that 
followed news of higher-than-expected retail sales in January. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was up 3/32 point, or about $1 for 
every $1,000 in face value, around midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to 
its price, was at 9.05%, down from 9.06% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices jumped after the Commerce Department reported that retail sales 
rose 0.6% in January, but by midday the market had given up most of its gains. 
</P>
<P>
The retail data was the best since a 1.3% increase in November, but the overall 
rate was held back by a 0.9% drop in car sales last month, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
The brief jump in bond prices surprised many analysts who said the retail data 
should have been neutral to negative for the market. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised, after the retail sales data, that the market did as well as it 
did," said Elizabeth Ginste Reiners, vice president of money market research 
for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"But the market is settling back to levels more appropriate with what the 
retail sales data would indicate: that possibly greater levels of spending 
could fuel inflationary psychology." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bad News for Bonds 
</P>
<P>
Normally, data suggesting higher inflationary pressures is bad news for the 
bond market because inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities like 
bonds and notes. An acceleration of inflation could also prompt the Federal 
Reserve to tighten credit and encourage higher interest rates, depressing bond 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
A sagging dollar was also helping pull down bond prices at midday, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues were up 1/16 point, intermediate maturities increased between 1/16 point 
and 1/8 point and long-term issues were unchanged to 1/8 point higher, 
according to the Telerate Inc. financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
advanced 0.45 to 1,127.08. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials also declined. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer, was up 0.17 to 297.56. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.78% as the discount slipped to 
8.55%. Yields on six-month bills declined to 9.04% as the discount fell to 
8.54%. Yields on one-year bills slipped to 9.21% as the discount declined to 
8.54%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9 1/4%, unchanged from late Monday.

Prices for existing homes in California went through the roof in 1988 while 
most other parts of the country experienced modest price increases or declines, 
the National Assn. of Realtors said today. 
</P>
<P>
From the fourth quarter of 1987 to the final three months of 1988, the median 
price of existing homes in Orange County skyrocketed 32.2% to $231,200, tops in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The second highest median price -- the point at which half the homes cost more 
and half cost less -- was the San Francisco Bay Area, up 29.6% to $228,100. The 
Los Angeles area experienced a 24.6% run-up in median prices to $191,200, and 
San Diego was in fourth place with a 18.6% appreciation rate to $157,200 median 
price, association said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the median price of a house, condominium or co-op was $87,900 in 
the fourth quarter, up 3.4% in one year. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen metropolitan areas of the United States had median prices of more than 
$100,000 in the last quarter of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In markets outside California, Honolulu had the highest median price at 
$225,000.

A Montreal Expos pitcher could face up to 60 days in jail after his arrest 
during a widespread prostitution sweep, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryn Smith, 33, was among 116 people charged with solicitation during the Feb. 
6-8 operation in which six police officers posed as prostitutes along a busy 
street in West Palm Beach, about 60 miles north of Miami, said Police Chief 
Billy Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sending a message. . . . Don't come into our city looking for 
prostitutes," Riggs said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pat Schwab said maximum penalties should be sought for the suspects. 
Under Florida law, soliciting for prostitution is a second-degree misdemeanor 
punishable by 60 days in jail, a $500 fine or both. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was 12-10 with the Expos last season with a 3.00 earned run average.

The Indiana Pacers are attempting to trade for veteran NBA guard Randy Wittman, 
an Indianapolis native and former player at Indiana University, general manager 
Donnie Walsh confirms. The 6-foot, 6-inch Wittman, a three-year starter with 
the Atlanta Hawks, has played sparingly this season with the Sacramento Kings, 
averaging 4.0 points in 29 games. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get him, but Sacramento has something to say about that," 
Walsh told the Indianapolis News. He would not say what the Kings were asking 
in return. Walsh also would not comment on other recent trade talks with 
Dallas.

Dale Earnhardt escaped injury today in a crash that destroyed his Grand 
National race car during practice at Daytona International Speedway. Earnhardt, 
a three-time Winston Cup champion who campaigns his own Grand National car, was 
running a hot lap at the end of the session when he tangled with a car driven 
by L. D. Ottinger. Neither driver was injured, but Earnhardt's Chevrolet was 
too badly damaged to repair. Ottinger's crew was working frantically on his 
Pontiac in an effort to repair it in time to qualify for Saturday's Goody's 300 
Busch Grand National stock car race. Earnhardt, who had been planning to run in 
both the Goody's race and Sunday's Daytona 500, will concentrate on the Winston 
Cup event.
