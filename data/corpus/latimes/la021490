L.A'S FOUL AIR BLAMED FOR RISE IN S.D.'S SMOG;

Smog in San Diego County worsened for the second straight year in 1989, 
primarily gauged by an increase in the number of days when polluted air was 
pushed south from Los Angeles, according to an annual air quality "report card" 
released Tuesday by the county Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary data showed that the county exceeded federal ozone levels on 55 
days last year, up from 45 in 1988. Also, as in 1988, there were two Stage 1 
smog alerts in 1989 -- both of them caused by transported pollution, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
R. J. Sommerville, the county's air pollution control officer, said extended 
Santa Ana conditions played a major role in the increase of smoggy days. Under 
certain conditions, Santa Ana winds send smog generated in Los Angeles over the 
ocean. High pressure systems then force that smog back toward shore, frequently 
hitting North San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, 41 of the days over (federal) standard, or 75%, was from smog blown 
here from Los Angeles," Sommerville said. 
</P>
<P>
Sommerville also noted, however, that a five-year trend from 1980 to 1985 of 
reducing locally generated pollution is being counterbalanced by population 
growth and increased traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"California has now learned what many of us already knew: 
transportation-related growth can overcome any technological control program," 
Sommerville said. "It appears that those dramatic reductions are not going to 
be coming forward until we do added work." 
</P>
<P>
Smog is produced by a photochemical reaction in the atmosphere among sunlight 
and hydrocarbon emissions and oxides of nitrogen. In San Diego, about 80% of 
the oxides of nitrogen and half of the hydrocarbons come from motor vehicle 
emissions, which are consistently rising. According to the San Diego Assn. of 
Governments, the number of miles driven in San Diego County has increased 56% 
in nine years, from 36 million in 1980 to 56.4 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the increase from 1988 of 10 days with high ozone levels, the 1989 
smog statistics are consistent with a trend toward cleaner air in San Diego 
County, Sommerville insisted. By contrast, in 1980, there were 87 days of 
excess smog and eight smog alerts, statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
Sommerville said the Air Pollution Control District is revising its air quality 
plan to further reduce emissions and counter trends. Among the approximately 50 
strategies under consideration are reducing volatile chemicals in solvents and 
requiring state-of-the-art technology to be installed on boilers and power 
generation plants. 
</P>
<P>
Under provisions of the 1988 California Clean Air Act, the District will also 
have the authority to recommend measures designed to reduce the number of 
vehicles on highways and the number of miles driven. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to look at van pools and car pools designed to really move people and 
take them where they want to go," Sommerville said. "It's easy now to get a bus 
to a mall. It's not so easy to get to work. We need to change that." 
</P>
<P>
The federal minimum health standard for smog is 12 parts per hundred million 
(p.p.h.m.) for one hour. Anything that exceeds that affects the lungs of normal 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Smog detected at 20 p.p.h.m. or greater triggers a Stage 1 Alert, during which 
the elderly, children and people with respiratory and cardiac problems are 
advised to limit their physical activity. A Stage 2 Alert is called when smog 
exceeds 35 p.p.h.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smog in San Diego County 
</P>
<P>
As map shows, the number of days on which areas of San Diego exceeded federal 
smog standards increased from 45 to 55 in 1989. While the number of those days 
caused by local pollution sources has remained roughly steady during the past 
five years, pollution transported from other areas-mainly the Los Angeles 
area-increased for the second straight year.

A TIME FOR HEARTS AND FLOWERS AT COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
RoBin Hollingsworth and Eric Johnson stood nervously before Frank Lundry, one 
of San Diego County's deputy commissioners of civil marriages. The painting 
behind Lundry's head -- of flowers in water -- looked like a motel reject. 
</P>
<P>
The background noise? Well, it wasn't soft and sweet -- the business of a 
county clerk's office rarely is -- and a candle was nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
To Lundry's left was the California flag, to his right the Stars and Stripes. 
The walls were a tired mustard yellow, and the carpet beneath the feet a faded 
mixture of orange and green. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but there was no mistaking the language, or the intentions . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"To have and to hold, from this day forward," Lundry intoned, in a crisp, 
authoritative voice. "For better or for worse, in sickness and in health, to 
love and to cherish, as long as you both shall live. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In no time at all, Johnson was kissing his new bride -- an act that's happening 
more and more these days on the first floor of the county courthouse in San 
Diego and in other offices in Vista. Lundry said a record number of weddings 
may be performed today in both places. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen are booked for San Diego, where, he said, "walk-ins" may double the 
number. Valentine's Day is considered so special around the county clerk's 
office that Robert Zumwalt, the county clerk himself, will come down from his 
upstairs office and officiate at most of today's weddings. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Powell, one of nine deputy commissioners of civil marriages appointed 
by Zumwalt, said that, since 1981, when the County Board of Supervisors 
appointed the county clerk marriage commissioner, scores of ceremonies have 
taken place right there in the office, where newlyweds-to-be obtain marriage 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Lundry said that, since July 1, the start of the current fiscal year, 153 have 
been performed in San Diego and 340 in Vista. He said the numbers are soaring, 
partly because the population of the county is also and partly because private 
weddings have gotten so expensive. Weddings in the county clerk's office are 
free, although the licenses cost $35 for conventional and $41 for confidential. 
(A health certificate is not required for a confidential marriage, and the 
record of the marriage is kept confidential.) 
</P>
<P>
As in the case of Hollingsworth and Johnson, who, as of Tuesday at 3 p.m., 
became Johnson and Johnson, couples walk behind a counter in Room 1001 and into 
a small cubicle partitioned from the rest of the room. 
</P>
<P>
The bride and groom hold hands, and, as their eyes grow soft and moist, they 
listen as a deputy commissioner executes a ceremony utterly devoid of religious 
reference and does so in no more than seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Lundry treasures this part of a bureaucrat's job. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy it because it's so upbeat," he said. "Normal proceedings in a 
courthouse are either mundane or dismal. Generally, these folks are here 
because they're happy." 
</P>
<P>
Lundry and his colleagues tell some funny stories. In one of the many weddings 
he performed in Vista, before he transferred to the San Diego courthouse, 
Lundry instructed an elderly man to kiss his middle-aged bride. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked at me kind of startled-like and said, 'I've already done that 
today!,' and immediately stalked out," Lundry said. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Strand, another deputy marriage commissioner, has officiated at weddings 
for three years. During that time, she joined a couple, who, as soon as vows 
and kisses were exchanged, were booked into County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
"That same morning, I did a ceremony for an elegantly dressed couple," Strand 
said. "I have to say, though, that both brides reacted the same way -- the one 
nicely dressed and the one going to jail. Both were choked up and weeping. A 
wedding is a very human occasion that touches people with pretty much the same 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"On one occasion, though, the bride changed her mind in the middle of the 
ceremony and didn't come back. Once, I had a groom call back the next day and 
ask for an annulment, which, of course, we don't do. And, I marry a lot of 
people who used to live in Mexico. 'Lawfully wedded wife' usually comes out 
'awfully wedded wife' or 'lawfully leaded wife.' " 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Powell said one of the more intriguing aspects of the courthouse 
wedding scene is the clothing worn by the bride and groom. She said it ranges 
from tuxedos and lacy gowns to bathing suits, even skimpy ones. 
</P>
<P>
Hollingsworth, 24, and Johnson, 26, were dressed quite smartly as they arrived 
at the clerk's desk, moments before becoming husband and wife. Hollingsworth 
said they had known each other for eight years and had lived together for five. 
She said they wanted to be married because they share a daughter, who is 3, and 
have another child on the way. The due date is March 23. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnsons met in an English class at Crawford High School. They have "no 
regrets" about not being married more elaborately, but she said they hope to 
"do it up right" exactly one year from now. 
</P>
<P>
Jamey Robison, 26, and Annette Jerfita, 21, were there, obtaining a license, 
one of about 20,000 people who do so every year in the San Diego office. They 
met on a pistachio ranch in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"He came over to pick up some boxes, and I threw some nuts at him -- you know, 
just kind of flirtin' and all," Jerfita said. "And, well, the rest is history!" 
</P>
<P>
A person sitting nearby suggested it was just a couple of nuts getting 
together, to which Robison said, "Don't pecan me, man." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Scott Sanford, 31, and Pamela Dawn Williams, 41, were there, too, as a 
pair of the many walk-ins who come in each day. 
</P>
<P>
They said they went to San Francisco last weekend to get married, but didn't. 
They "hopped over" to Tahoe, intending to do it there, but didn't. They didn't 
get it done in Reno, either -- "We just kept gambling -- and losing," Williams 
said -- and, finally, "to save face," they resolved to do it as soon as the 
plane landed in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to waste any more time," Williams said. "We just came from the 
airport, and, before we go home to San Marcos, we intend to be married. There's 
no casino around here, is there?" 
</P>

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTIES KILL PIT BULL GUARDING COCAINE STASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies chasing a group of gang members shot and killed a pit bull 
guarding a stash of rock cocaine and weapons in a doghouse, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began shortly after 10 p.m. Monday when a man flagged down a 
sheriff's patrol car and said he had been robbed of $20, Deputy Roger Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim said the muggers had fled to a house at in the 11100 block of New 
Hampshire Avenue in Los Angeles, where deputies entered the rear yard and 
encountered a man and four teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the boys, who according to Hom were members of a local gang, threw a 
plastic bag into a doghouse guarded by a pit bull on a 15-foot chain. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies lured the dog away from the doghouse while one of them reached inside 
to retrieve the bag. The dog later charged the deputies, and one of them fired 
two shots, killing the dog, Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, Reuben Almonte, 29, and the teen-agers were arrested.

CITY IS ASKED TO CHIP IN ON PARAMEDICS' WAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials will review the labor contract negotiated by Hartson Medical 
Services and the paramedics' union before deciding on any subsidy for the 
company to meet employee wage demands contained in the proposal, said Deputy 
City Manager Maureen Stapleton. 
</P>
<P>
The final agreement was reached Tuesday by Hartson and the Service Employees 
International Union, Local 102, which represents about 160 San Diego 
paramedics. Both sides declined to disclose the size of the rate increase 
negotiated for paramedics, and Stapleton said the city still does not know how 
much Hartson will ask for in extra money. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Glen Roberts, Hartson's chief executive officer, briefed City 
Manager John Lockwood on the contract but "did not indicate what the amount 
will be," said Stapleton. 
</P>
<P>
"Hartson will provide specifics to the city by the end of the week. At this 
point, we're obligated to analyze the proposed wage increase and its potential 
impact and present the matter to the City Council," said Stapleton. 
</P>
<P>
Eliseo Medina, president of Local 102, said the new contract "goes a long way 
to establishing parity" for Hartson paramedics. During the drawn-out 
negotiations, which began in April, the union said that Hartson paramedics earn 
24% less than other county paramedics. Hartson paramedics earn $6.50 to $9.55 
an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency medical technicians at Hartson start at $5 an hour, and Medina said 
the new contract will make them the highest-paid in the county. Paramedics and 
EMTs are expected to vote on the contract next week, Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Medina said a settlement is "contingent on receiving the pay increases 
we agreed on." If the City Council balks at paying for the increases, the union 
will have to decide on its next move, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The union is already putting pressure on the city to approve and fund the pay 
raises by announcing that some paramedics may go to work for other local 
agencies if the City Council does not move on the increases by the end of the 
month. Medina said the other agencies will begin hiring paramedics in March. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said he is aware that other agencies will begin hiring paramedics next 
month and hopes that the city will move quickly on the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Stapleton promised quick action by the city once Hartson indicates how much 
money the company needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is committed, as soon as we receive details of the proposal, to move 
as quickly as possible and get it through the council," Stapleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said the additional revenue could come from a straight subsidy from the 
city or by the city allowing the company to increase its rates. Hartson has a 
$6.8-million contract with the city that expires in June, 1991. Under terms of 
the contract, the city allows the company to charge a patient no more than $281 
a call. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to pass the expense of doing business to the people to whom we 
provide the service. . . . It'll have to be either some increase in fees or 
increase in subsidy. We know that subsidies are very hard to come by these 
days. We always go back to the cities we work for and ask to increase our 
rates," Roberts said.

JUDGE SAYS COLLEGE GETS INDIAN RELICS -- FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's moving day for dozens of boxes and bags of artifacts dating back 600 years 
or so. An archeologist was ordered Tuesday to return the fragments of a 
long-dead Indian civilization to Palomar Community College 
</P>
<P>
Palomar President George Boggs said he was pleased with the decision awarding 
the college temporary custody of the collection, which archeologist Leslie 
Quintero removed from a science laboratory during the Thanksgiving holiday last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero, an instructor at Palomar, contended that she needed possession of the 
Indian artifacts for her research into the culture of San Luis Rey-area tribes. 
She had landowner permission to keep the relics, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Palomar officials filed a criminal complaint against Quintero, charging her 
with theft of the artifacts, which they valued at $100,000. They also sued to 
force return of the artifacts and to determine who owns them. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Superior Court Judge Raymond Zvetina issued a temporary injunction 
ordering Quintero to return the materials to Palomar by Saturday, but ordered 
the college to allow Quintero free access to the artifacts until the issue of 
ownership is settled in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Guenter Cohn, Quintero's attorney, called the judge's ruling "a temporary 
setback" for his client. "Now the battle starts," Cohn said, but declined to 
outline any legal moves he may make. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs said he hopes the issue will be settled without a court battle. The 
college always has been willing to give Quintero access to the materials, which 
she and Palomar students have been extracting from an ancient trash dump north 
of Escondido for nine years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that she (Quintero) does not intend to appeal the judge's 
ruling," Boggs said, "and perhaps now the climate for talks is at hand." 
</P>
<P>
Quintero, who has been a part-time instructor in archeology at both Palomar and 
San Diego State University, was notified last fall that her contract at Palomar 
would not be renewed for the spring semester. Late last November, during 
Thanksgiving holidays, she removed the artifacts from Palomar with the 
intention of relocating them at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
She concedes that she is not the owner of the artifacts but claims that Palomar 
College is not the owner either. According to state law, the owner of the land 
on which the artifacts were found is the owner of any materials found, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The ownership of the land also is in a legal snarl. Donald Sullens, who claims 
to own the land and who gave Quintero the right to remove and retain the Indian 
artifacts, apparently is not the present owner. Lusardi Construction Co. of San 
Marcos bought the 190-acre property on which the midden is located in August, 
1988, at a foreclosure sale, according to Lusardi Vice President Ken Lounsbery. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lusardi has sent "cease-and-desist" notices to both Quintero and to 
Palomar College, ordering them to stop removing materials from the property, 
which is along Deer Springs Road north of Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lounsbery said, "a college or university seems a logical repository 
for such things," and preliminary negotiations with Palomar to allow students 
to resume the dig are under way. 
</P>
<P>
The $100,000 grand theft complaint that Palomar lodged against Quintero was 
investigated by county Sheriff's Department investigators who found that 
criminal charges were unfounded because of the question of ownership of the 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
The materials under dispute consist of thousands of small pieces of animal 
bones, shell, pottery, charcoal and other debris that the ancient Indian tribe 
tossed away while camping at the inland valley.

KILLER WHALE KASATKA, A SEA WORLD VETERAN, RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kasatka the killer whale arrived Tuesday at Sea World after a 2-hour, 40-minute 
flight from San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
The move was part of a long-term breeding program among the four Sea World 
parks, said Brad Andrews, assistant zoological director of Sea World San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said Kasatka, a female, will be kept alone in a breeding and research 
pool until she acclimates to her surroundings. However, she can see and hear 
other killer whales. And they can see and hear her. "They are pretty excited," 
Andrews said. "They are vocalizing and swimming around." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said he expects Kasatka to get along with the other female adult 
whales, Knootka and Corky, because she spent about two years with them in San 
Diego before she was moved to Texas for breeding in 1987. Another female, 
Kandu, died last year after she was involved in a fight with Corky. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to breed Kasatka, whose estimated age is 14, failed, Andrews said. 
"It may be that she is too young," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials will wait about two years before trying to breed her again, 
Andrews said. Because there are no eligible males in San Diego, a potential 
mate will either be brought to Kasatka, or she will be moved to another park. 
</P>
<P>
Kasatka was captured 13 years ago and has been performing for about 10 years, 
Andrews said. He said she will "definitely" perform in San Diego, but she will 
not be rushed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three male bottlenose dolphins were transported Monday from San 
Diego to San Antonio, also for breeding. Andrews said the exchanges prevent 
inbreeding among the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said there are 15 whales in the four Sea World Parks in San Diego, San 
Antonio, Aurora, Ohio and Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In order to move Kasatka, Sea World officials placed the 4,000-pound whale on a 
stretcher, then into a water-filled transport cabin that was loaded on a 747. 
</P>
<P>
There have been five successful killer whale births at Sea World parks, said 
Dan LeBlanc, spokesman for Sea World San Diego. The most recent was in 
September, 1988, when Baby Shamu was born to Kandu in San Diego.

FROM STAGE TO SOUND, AMBASSADOR PERFORMS LIKE CONCERT VIRTUOSO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stage looks warm and intimate, with russet wood walls and a piano gleaming 
in a pool of light. In 45 minutes, veteran concert pianist Eugene Istomin will 
walk to the piano and fill the Ambassador Auditorium with nimble-fingered 
trills and runs in a program of Beethoven, Schubert and Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
Stage manager Mark Morris gives the stage and empty seats a critical once-over. 
"After the concert, this will all be just an empty, hollow space," he said. 
"I'm always amazed at it." 
</P>
<P>
From the outside, the Ambassador in Pasadena is the Rock of Gibraltar of 
concert halls. Columns, square cornices and a flat half-acre roof give it a 
solid, monumental look. But inside the hall, the Ambassador can be as 
changeable as an itinerant swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
In minutes, acoustic panels can be tucked away, banks of curtains hauled into 
place, batteries of spotlights switched on or off, and rows of seats added or 
subtracted. 
</P>
<P>
Administering a major concert hall such as the Ambassador, which began a 
cultural boom in Pasadena when it opened in 1974, is a theatrical roller 
coaster. Few handle the curves as well as the Ambassador staff, visiting 
artists have said. 
</P>
<P>
"A fabulous hall, the best that money can buy," flamboyant Yugoslav pianist Ivo 
Pogorelich told an interviewer, "and there's a lot of money in Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
There are 100 or more events in the hall's nine-month season. Piano soloists 
give way to jazz bands, chamber orchestras follow on the heels of pop singers. 
Each event has its own peculiar staging requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Take the hall's convertible acoustics. The crisp, brilliant sound that the 
Ambassador's house staff has programmed for Istomin's lyrical piano pieces 
won't work for the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra, the big band scheduled to 
play in the hall the next evening. 
</P>
<P>
"With all of that sound bouncing around the room, it would start coming back to 
the microphones," said Peter Eddington, the Ambassador's technical and lighting 
supervisor. "After a while, it starts sounding like you're in a toilet bowl." 
</P>
<P>
To "deaden" to sound, the Ambassador staff will fold away the teak sidewalls, 
remove the gold-leaf-covered acoustical panels (the "gold clouds") that hang 
above the piano and swathe the stage in black curtains. 
</P>
<P>
"With the piano, the hall approaches about two seconds of reverberation time," 
Eddington said. "For a big band, you want to get below one second." 
</P>
<P>
Every Monday morning, the house staff gets together in the orchestra of the 
1,262-seat hall to work out technical requirements for the week's events. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's events began with an opera in concert on Monday, complete with 
orchestra, chorus and soloists. That was followed by the Istomin recital on 
Wednesday and the jazz concert on Thursday. The cycle ended with a performance 
by Mummenschanz, the Swiss mime, dance and puppetry troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Each event requires radical restructuring of the Ambassador stage. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, lighting technicians tinker with some spotlights as 
Istomin, a studious-looking man in wire-rimmed glasses, rehearses a Beethoven 
sonata, his fingers ruminatively exploring a dense adagio passage. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for the concert pianist, Istomin said, is conveying a 
19th-Century composer's intent while performing in a 20th-Century concert hall. 
"All of these pieces were written to be played in a place which was about 
one-quarter the size of this hall," Istomin said. "There are subtleties -- 
perfumes -- that can only be communicated through a kind of stage whisper." 
</P>
<P>
Eddington is gratified to hear Istomin talking about music instead of staging. 
"When he walks onto the stage," Eddington said, "there should be nothing to 
worry about as far as the facility or the crew are concerned. He should only 
worry about the piece of music." 
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador is run by the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation, an 
arm of the Worldwide Church of God. Ambassador College, on whose elegant 
Pasadena campus the concert hall sits, is another arm of the church. The church 
plans to relocate the college later this year to a facility in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no way that the church would give up this gem, church officials 
say. In just 16 years of operation, the hall brims with musical lore. There's 
the backstage elevator that was installed ahead of schedule so Italian tenor 
Luciano Pavarotti wouldn't have to climb the 28 stairs from the dressing room 
to stage level. "He said that climbing the stairs would interrupt his breathing 
patterns," spokesman Michael Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
An electric eye was installed in the elevator so Mstislav Rostropovich wouldn't 
worry that his cello would be smashed by the closing door. 
</P>
<P>
Here and there are some extraordinary features of the edifice itself, including 
its pinkish lobby walls, from basement to balcony, which used up Turkey's 
entire export quota of rose onyx for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Even that much wasn't quite enough," Snyder said, pointing to a single 6-foot 
panel of grayish marble at the balcony level. 
</P>
<P>
By early evening, the recital shell is in place and lights are set for the 
performance. Istomin arrives, tense and unsmiling in a black tuxedo. He tells 
technicians not to turn on the "bow lights" when he walks on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want any spots on me, none of that show-biz stuff," said Istomin, who 
has been performing since 1943. "Make it boring. The glamour should take place 
in the sound." 
</P>
<P>
A warmly appreciative audience, marveling at Istomin's light-fingered facility 
at the keyboard, applauds enthusiastically and demands two encores. As audience 
members trickle away into the night, Morris and three assistants begin to strip 
the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The teak walls, folded up into five panels, are winched toward the ceiling, 60 
feet above the stage. There is a loft full of catwalks and folded equipment up 
there -- a dark, cavernous space hidden from the audience by slatted ceiling 
panels -- that is almost as big as the performance hall itself. 
</P>
<P>
The golden clouds are lowered to the stage, turned on their sides and hauled 
up; the same with banks of lights. Each piece of movable equipment is 
counterbalanced with lead weights, so that stage assistants can move them up or 
down just by pulling on ropes. 
</P>
<P>
In just 41 minutes, the four men have stripped the stage. The next day, rows of 
black curtains will be lowered into place, putting the stage into what is 
called a "theater black" mode, and risers and microphones would be installed 
for the jazz band. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, the stage is just a forlorn, empty space, waiting for technology 
and magic to convert it into a place where musicians can somehow be intimate 
with a crowd of more than 1,200 strangers.

COUNCIL VOTES MONEY FOR ADDED STAFF AND FIGHT AGAINST UTILITY MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council gave tentative approval Tuesday to spending about $4 
million to increase its staff, remodel its City Hall offices and continue the 
city's legal fight against the merger of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and 
SoCal Edison. 
</P>
<P>
The council members took action after City Manager John Lockwood advised them 
that $3.5 million in expenses for acquiring land to build two new police 
substations could be deferred until the 1991 fiscal year, and that an 
additional $500,000 is still available from the city's unallocated reserve 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
His recommendations helped the council escape making the politically difficult 
decision of choosing between upgrading their staffs and City Hall offices or 
cutting either the police substations or the legal costs related to opposing 
the utility merger. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council voted not to hire a $75,000 consultant to help it redraw 
boundaries of council districts. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the $4 million will go to pay upcoming legal costs. About $2 
million will be placed in the city's general litigation fund to cover future 
lawsuits, and another $1.5 million will go for legal fees in the city's fight 
against the proposed utility merger. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos removal at city-owned buildings will cost about $137,000, and $100,000 
will be used to pay for growth-management consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The rest, or about $331,500, will be used to remodel the council chambers and 
council suites, and to hire seven new staff aides for six council members. 
</P>
<P>
Before voting, however, the council was chastised by John McClain, a council 
aide in the 1970s, who said the current City Council is spending too much money 
on itself and not enough on other city needs. 
</P>
<P>
"None of you need additional staff," he said, noting that in 1970, just one 
council assistant served the entire City Council. "If anything, you are 
overstaffed." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members now have four to six staff assistants each, and McClain 
contended that increasing those numbers reflects "bankrupt leadership." 
</P>
<P>
"Let me be blunt," he said. "You are engaged in empire building, pure and 
simple." 
</P>
<P>
But several council members defended the move to increased the staff, pointing 
out that the city's population and the city budget have grown dramatically in 
the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, I don't think one person can possibly answer the phone in my office," 
said Councilman Bruce Henderson. "It's ringing constantly because constituents 
demand service. There's a tremendous amount of work to be done, and we've got 
to have the staff to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Councilman Wes Pratt: "I don't apologize for the staff assistance I'm 
requesting. We need information. We need quality research. I need adequate 
preparation." 
</P>
<P>
In giving the temporary nod for the other projects, the council directed 
Lockwood to draft an ordinance by Feb. 20 incorporating the spending package.

STRONG WINDS TO CHILL HEARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sweethearts, children and other tender living things should bundle up today 
against a cold blast of Siberian air. 
</P>
<P>
Blustery winds up to 35 m.p.h. have been working their way from the Bering Sea 
down California and will pass through San Diego today, said Wilbur Shigehara, 
forecaster for the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a reminder that it is still winter, and spring is over a month away," 
Shigehara said. "The good news is it's going to be sunny, but the bad news is 
it's going to be windy and cold." 
</P>
<P>
"These winds can be ferocious. Flying small airplanes and sailing can be 
dangerous today," he said. A small-craft advisory for gale-force winds has been 
posted. In the desert, residents may get sand- as well as wind-blasted. 
</P>
<P>
The strong winds will be accompanied by low temperatures, Shigehara said, 
adding that the thermometer is not expected to rise above 60 degrees anywhere 
in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The winds will die down tonight, but "it's going to get so cold tonight and 
Thursday night, we have posted a frost advisory that will extend almost to the 
water's edge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma, Del Mar, Carmel Valley and La Jolla growers and residents should 
protect frost-sensitive plants from temperatures that are expected to dip as 
low as 31 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
In inland areas, including Escondido, Bonsall and the San Pasqual Valley, 
citrus, avocado and blooming strawberry crops will be subject to frost and 
temperatures ranging from 23 to 35. Farmers should keep a close watch on 
temperatures through Thursday night, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
The cold may also prompt city and county shelters to expand their services to 
the homeless. The city's Office of Emergency Services opens a makeshift shelter 
in Balboa Park's Municipal Gymnasium and gives permission to private shelters 
to expand their services during unusually cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
The county Office of Disaster Preparedness opens the California National Guard 
armories at Vista and El Cajon if temperatures of 35 or lower are expected. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cold, skies will be fair and sunny through Friday, with a chance of 
showers on the weekend, Shigehara said.

MAN SOUGHT AFTER FIRING AT OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police using search dogs and a helicopter scoured a rugged area in the Santa 
Susana Pass near Chatsworth Tuesday evening looking for a man suspected of 
shooting at two Oxnard police officers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers were not injured when Mark M. Richendollar, 32, allegedly fired at 
them with a police service revolver he pulled from the holster of one of the 
officers during a scuffle in an Oxnard apartment complex about 5:45 p.m. 
Tuesday, Oxnard Police Sgt. Denny Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Richendollar tried to shoot again but the gun failed to fire, Phillips said. 
Richendollar drove off in a nearby car. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said the officers had gone to the apartment complex at Charles and 
Clara streets to arrest Richendollar on an assault warrant. The officers 
wrestled the gun from him before he started running, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour later, a California Highway Patrol officer pulled over a car 
registered to Richendollar near the Topanga Canyon Boulevard off-ramp of the 
Simi Valley Freeway, Los Angeles police Lt. Frank Malan said. The driver, 
believed by police to be armed with a pistol and a large knife, fled into thick 
brush next to the freeway, Malan said. 
</P>
<P>
Malan said winds up to 50 m.p.h. made it difficult for police dogs to track the 
man's scent. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said Richendollar had been staying with his girlfriend at the Oxnard 
apartment, but police did not know how long he had been living there.

THE SPILL NEXT TIME (CONT.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smog-free and potentially cheap, nuclear power would be far more prevalent if 
the public really believed that the industry was capable of controlling any 
potential accident. The fact that nuclear power does not enjoy that confidence 
is not an economic disaster since there are alternative forms of power. But the 
nation does not yet have a substitute for the petroleum needed to run much of 
its economic machine. For now, we are stuck with oil. Therefore, as the Exxon 
Valdez and the American Trader have demonstrated, we must do a better job of 
handling the millions of barrels of petroleum products the nation guzzles daily 
-- from the moment the stuff comes out of the ground, or the ocean floor, to 
the point at which the last vapors flow from the exhaust pipe. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that an oil spill does not carry the potential for mass human 
destruction that people fear -- whether rationally or not -- from a nuclear 
accident. Long-term environmental damage is bad enough, though. And 
fortunately, Americans have the technical skill to develop safeguards against 
major oil spills and adequate cleanup programs. But the people and their 
political leaders must demand that the job be done, and agree to pay the 
necessary cost. 
</P>
<P>
The Alaskan spill conceivably might have been prevented if budget cuts had not 
reduced the Coast Guard's ability to track and control shipping traffic, 
according to Congress' General Accounting Office. Damage to Huntington Beach 
might have been limited if the Environmental Protection Agency hadn't been 
forced to suspend research and development in oil-spill prevention and cleanup 
because of lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
If offshore moorings are a problem, safer alternatives must be found. Double 
tanker skins will prevent or minimize spills. And much more work needs to be 
done in developing booms that truly contain the oil in the immediate vicinity 
of a spill. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, accidents don't just happen to ships. Offshore rigs, tanker trucks, 
refineries and every other facility pose a risk. Petroleum industry workers 
everywhere must conduct themselves as if an accident could happen at any place 
at any moment. Because it could.

JUNK BONDS, MARKET MALNUTRITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing new in the idea that those who are ready to take big economic risks 
should be compensated, if they're lucky, with big economic rewards: It's as old 
as commerce itself. For centuries, the prospect of huge profits was precisely 
what encouraged investors to finance dangerous years-long sea voyages or land 
caravans. If the ships or the camels eventually came home, laden with eagerly 
sought cargoes, the daring investor had a good chance to become rich. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s this ancient idea was put in the service of a new concept. 
Companies that had trouble raising capital in traditional markets began to 
issue "high risk, high yield" securities, more commonly known as junk bonds. 
They proved attractive to venturesome investors and also highly lucrative to 
some big plungers in the financial community, notably Drexel Burnham Lambert 
Inc., the Wall Street investment house that pioneered their sales. Now Drexel 
Burnham has discovered anew that great rewards invite great risks. Its parent 
company, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, says it is suffering from a severe cash 
shortage. It has defaulted on $100 million in loans and is looking to protect 
itself with a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
Does any of this matter to the ordinary person who has never invested in junk 
bonds? Unhappily it does. Junk bonds are now held by many mutual funds, 
insurance companies, pension funds, savings and loan institutions and even the 
federal government, thanks to its ownership of failed S&amp;Ls. Drexel 
Burnham's woes have shaken the $200-billion junk bond market. Regulators have 
moved quickly to contain the problem, but it's too early to tell how far the 
ripples will spread. As with the collapse of many S&amp;Ls, innocent people 
could find themselves harmed by the greed of others. 
</P>
<P>
This is obviously an important matter for Congress to look into. Care will have 
to be taken, however, not to produce a legislative remedy that could lead to 
over-regulation of the market.

DRUG OVERDOSE WASTES COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a group, chief justices are more inclined to understate than exaggerate. So 
California now has more than enough warning -- not just from one top jurist but 
from two -- that drug cases are threatening to swamp the federal and state 
justice systems. 
</P>
<P>
The latest warning is from Malcolm M. Lucas, chief justice of the state Supreme 
Court, who said Monday that California's trial courts "are close to foundering" 
in a flood of drug cases. And Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist recently said 
roughly the same thing about the federal court system. 
</P>
<P>
But the politics of drug control as they are practiced these days make it 
certain that the situation will get worse before it gets better, that 
legislators will plow a great deal more barren ground before they discover that 
there are no easy answers to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas told a joint session of the California Legislature that courts should be 
among the last resorts in the fight against drugs, something to which people 
turn after they have tried education, treatment, early intervention and 
research. Lucas is absolutely correct, but such wise counsel is considered 
"soft" stuff, and politicians are more comfortable sounding tough on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Why are drug cases soaring? One reason is that legislators love to rattle 
missiles on drugs and keep stipulating longer prison terms, stripping judges of 
the right to issue lighter sentences if defendants plead guilty. More 
defendants choose a full trial because a defendant must serve the same time for 
a guilty plea as for a conviction, and at least there is a chance of beating 
the case in court. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in both Washington and Sacramento, the emphasis is still on more police, 
more prisons and tougher sentences. Bills calling for longer prison terms keep 
getting introduced and passed, because challengers can use nay votes as weapons 
in the next election. 
</P>
<P>
But all such easy answers come to no good. Lucas warned Monday that drug cases 
are crowding out important civil cases involving "the environment, civil 
rights, the economy and other important aspects of our lives," because there 
are not enough judges or courtrooms to try both and criminal cases have 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
So far, policy makers in both Washington and Sacramento seem to have it in mind 
that taxpayers are happy to pay for prisons but not for new courtrooms. The 
politicians should not count on it, now that the voters have been given fair 
warning not just by one chief justice but by two.

THE SKY ABOVE, THE CHURCH BELOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looks as if the Rev. Robert Schuller really does have enormous influence in 
high places. No one else has been able to stop aerial spraying of malathion in 
his neighborhood. But Schuller did, and more than divine intervention, that 
takes big-time political clout. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that state agricultural officials ordered the helicopter pilots who 
were sprayinga 36-square-mile area in Orange County Jan. 25 to spare Schuller's 
famous Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove from an aerial shower of malathion. 
And to date that's been the only exemption granted by the authorities in the 
increasingly controversial and widespread spraying program to eradicate the 
Mediterranean fruit fly from the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
One can hardly blame Schuller for requesting the cease-fire. (A pastor needs 
always to look out for the physical as well as the spiritual health of his 
flock). Indeed, many thousands of people would surely have liked similar 
dispensation. The issue is the state's decision. Schuller got special 
consideration, say officials, because on the night of the scheduled spraying of 
that area, Schuller was hosting a conference at the Crystal Cathedral and had a 
large outdoor dinner scheduled under a tent on church grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the official concern is understandable, but what of other, 
less-well-connected people who may have been outdoors in the same area that 
night? Say, the many homeless people unprotected in Garden Grove's Pioneer 
Park? Moreover, the church grounds are less than 2 miles from where a Medfly 
was found last month, and is well within the designated spray zone. The grounds 
also contain an ample number of trees, shrubs and flower gardens. 
</P>
<P>
It was wrong to make an exemption for the Crystal Cathedral. The decision only 
adds to the controversy over spraying and undermines public confidence in the 
state's claim that the spraying, which they say is absolutely necessary, poses 
no health risks. The exception also raises another question: If the state 
believes it is all right to exempt one property within a spray area, is the 
need for widespread, blanket spraying really as critical as the state 
agriculture officials claim it is? 
</P>
<P>
No doubt officials will insist that the answer is yes, and continue to fight 
all efforts to stop aerial malathion spraying. Perhaps they're right. And, 
perhaps they now rue the night they made a no doubt well-intentioned exception 
for a popular and influential public figure. At least we hope so.

RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the environmental status does not disgust anyone enough to do something 
about it, one should think about the world our children (and their children) 
will be living in -- if it still exists. Recycling is a step in the right 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
The United States throws away enough aluminum to rebuild our entire commercial 
air fleet every three months. We also throw away enough paper annually to 
construct a 12-foot wall from Los Angeles to New York. Glass is also often 
thrown away. The only way to solve these problems is to recycle. This way we 
could cut down on waste products and also save money. The opportunity for every 
individual to recycle is a bright spot in our ailing environment.

RESPECTING NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So the Lancaster City Council is considering building two new streets through a 
desert woodlands area to protect children walking to school (Part B, Feb. 7). 
We get this news on a page filled with news about a drive-by killing near 
Carson High School and another in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
The next page relates the trial of a man who drove into a group of pedestrians 
in Glendale and killed four people. So the parents want two streets built to 
protect their children? 
</P>
<P>
This brings to mind the time in Manhattan Beach when parents complained about 
the dangers of Polliwog Pond, a small body of water once big enough for small 
boats and fishing. Parents feared a child might drown, so the pond was fenced 
off, partly filled in, and became a murky, trash-filled swamp. All this within 
one-half mile of the ocean. Were they to fence and fill the ocean as well? Kids 
climbed the fence and went polliwog catching. To my knowledge nobody drowned. 
The city fathers eventually saw the light. They created a park and re-created 
the pond as a place for fish, wild birds and people to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
Why do we fear our natural environment? Training people to know how to interact 
with Mother Nature is a better solution than to destroy the natural 
surroundings. Beach kids learn to swim and to respect the ocean and the pond. 
Desert children can learn to respect the desert and its wildlife and walk 
safely to school.

NOW THEY CALL IT 'CO-DEPENDENCY'; 
</P>
<P>
LOVE: ONCE, PASSION FOR ANOTHER COULD LAUNCH SHIPS, CHANGE NATIONS AND CONSUME 
A SOUL. NOW IT'S PATHOLOGICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
They used to call it love. Now, it's co-dependency. 
</P>
<P>
Love -- the living for, in, through, of and with another -- was once a godly 
emotion, worthy of the poet's labor, the artist's creation, the philosopher's 
brooding. Wars were fought in the name of love, civilizations destroyed and 
nations founded. 
</P>
<P>
The history lessons that no one slept through were those explaining the mess 
that Paris and Helen caused to the city of Troy, or how Rome was forever 
changed by the torrid love of Marc Antony and Cleopatra. Even the little 
megalomaniac Napoleon looked more attractive through his devotion to Josephine. 
</P>
<P>
But love in the classic sense no longer exists. Compared to the emotions that 
inspired the Taj Mahal, the Rubaiyat or the Mona Lisa, what we now call love 
seems sanitized, de-bugged and plastic-coated. We are proud of having 
demystified love. 
</P>
<P>
Neatly packaged and labeled, we now sell what Dante once called the "power that 
moves the sun and other stars" as "intimacy," "commitment" or "communication" 
in group sessions, private counseling and at the local bookstore. What doesn't 
fit this mold is diagnosed as "addictive," "compulsive," "dysfunctional" or 
"pathological." The only "healthy" form of love we are taught today is 
self-love. 
</P>
<P>
Best sellers tell us that "Women Who Love Too Much" end up with men who suffer 
from the "Peter Pan Syndrome" or are "Men Who Can't Love." We learn that 
"Learning to Love Yourself" helps to avoid making "Wrong Choices," and that 
"Understanding the Psychology of Romantic Love" is the map to finding "The Road 
Less Travelled." 
</P>
<P>
The buzzword is co-dependency. Family counselor and PBS television host John 
Bradshaw believes that the relationship of two "inseparable" people who must be 
together is "co-dependency," which -- among other scary things -- is a "symptom 
of abandonment" often coupled with "sexual addiction." 
</P>
<P>
 My love is a fever, longing still 
</P>
<P>
 For that which longer nurseth the disease, 
</P>
<P>
 Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill, 
</P>
<P>
 Th'uncertain sickly appetite to please. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern psychology, I'm sure, would interpret the emotions expressed in this 
Shakespeare sonnet as a case of high-grade co-dependency. 
</P>
<P>
I have trouble thinking of Mozart's Constance and Verdi's Aida as dysfunctional 
individuals who must learn to "nurture the inner child." And I can't imagine 
anyone telling Orpheus that losing his Eurydice in Hades "may have been a 
blessing in disguise" that will "allow him to focus on himself." 
</P>
<P>
In this sensible, self-sufficient and salubrious world of ours, the existence 
of another as the reason for our own is no longer necessary. We grow babies in 
test tubes, see and hear ourselves in movies and on tapes and proudly satisfy 
our needs and wants alone. We no longer see ourselves reflected in the soul of 
another. A mirror does just fine. 
</P>
<P>
Walking units of emotional health who have successfully rid themselves of 
addictive-compulsive emotions, severed the dysfunctional ties of co-dependency 
and no longer are in danger of loving another, we can proudly ask ourselves: 
</P>
<P>
"How do I love me? Let me count the ways. . . ."

LOWERY RULES OUT MIRAMAR AS SITE FOR AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking at Miramar Naval Air Station as an alternative to Lindbergh Field 
wastes taxpayers' money and squanders valuable time that could be spent 
garnering federal funds for other airport options, Rep. Bill Lowery said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing military and civilian airplanes to share Miramar "is about as feasible 
as letting the Indianapolis 500 race cars and Greyhound buses share the same 
track," said Lowery, (R-San Diego) during a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the spotlight on Miramar as a replacement for Lindbergh Field 
has intensified. A city-commissioned study, released last week, ruled out Brown 
Field as an option. Faced with three sites, Miramar, Miramar East (West 
Sycamore Canyon) and Otay Mesa, county supervisors recently supported the two 
at Miramar. And Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) has said that he will introduce 
legislation to press for joint civilian and military use of Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
"Miramar appears to be the most economical and as well the most technically 
valid option available for this region," Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal for a joint-use military and civilian facility has been revisited 
numerous times through the decade as the city presses for a solution for 
Lindbergh, which experts say cannot keep pace with San Diego's growth. By the 
middle of the next century, an estimated 35 million passengers will fly into 
San Diego annually -- three times the number now served. And, as the city 
searches for a solution, Bates and others, including the Airline Pilots Assn., 
have supported Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
To slow the growing momentum, Lowery and other lawmakers gathered by a display 
of an E2B Hawkeye at Miramar's west gate to condemn the option and read a 
letter written by Deputy Secretary of Defense Don Atwood. 
</P>
<P>
"Since 1983, the Department of Defense has adamantly opposed any actions which 
would adversely effect the operations," at Miramar, said Atwood in the letter. 
"If anything, joint use of NAS Miramar is even more objectionable now than it 
was in 1983." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery says the continued quest for an airport site endangers San Diego's bid 
for federal funds. The Federal Aviation Administration has $2.75 billion 
available to improve airports that are operating at full capacity. FAA has 
pledged money to nine cities, and three others are preparing their bids.

TASK FORCE WANTS METHANE SENSOR LAW ENFORCED; 
</P>
<P>
GAS: ONLY 35 DETECTORS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN A 400-BLOCK HIGH-RISK ZONE NEAR 
THE FARMERS MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city task force has found that a requirement for gas detectors to be 
installed in homes and commercial structures in the methane risk zone near the 
Farmers Market is being widely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
The detectors proved themselves as recently as one year ago, when a portable 
device warned that a dangerous concentration of gas was building up in a store 
across the street from the spot where a methane explosion and fire injured more 
than 20 people on March 24, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
To date, 35 of the sensors have been installed in a 400-block area that was 
declared to be a potentially dangerous area after the 1985 fire, the task 
force's chairman, city geologist J. W. Cobarrubias, said. 
</P>
<P>
Because city law requires sensors whenever a home or building with a basement 
that could trap methane changes hands, the actual number should have been much 
higher, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the report, which is awaiting action by the Los Angeles City Council, the 
task force said that wells and ditches should be dug to provide a safe exit for 
any further gas buildups in the porous soil beneath the corner of 3rd Street 
and Ogden Drive. 
</P>
<P>
It also called for commercial and industrial buildings to be equipped with 
ventilation systems that can change the air in a room as soon as a dangerous 
accumulation of the odorless and colorless gas is noticed by the mechanical 
sensors. 
</P>
<P>
The task force recommended that a special priority be given to a several-block 
area close to the Ross Dress for Less store, where the 1985 blast occurred, and 
that the Fire Department and the Department of Building and Safety be 
authorized to devote time and money to inspections and other measures to 
prevent additional explosions. 
</P>
<P>
In this priority area, the task force recommended that a team of inspectors be 
hired to make a systematic survey of existing apartment houses and commercial 
and industrial buildings to make sure that the required gas detection and 
venting systems are in place. 
</P>
<P>
The report also recommended that technical surveys be conducted to identify 
other potentially dangerous locations in the Fairfax District. 
</P>
<P>
Cost of the surveys was estimated at $75,000, but installation of $133,600 
worth of relief wells and collector trenches probably would cost the city no 
more that $4,600 because state funds would pay for the rest, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force recommendations must first be considered by the City Council's 
Finance and Revenue Committee, but a spokeswoman for Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, chairman of the panel, said that it has not yet been scheduled for 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Cobarrubias said this month that the group devoted "a lot of time" to the 
question of where the methane comes from, but did not reach a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
One study, funded by a grant from the Gas Research Institute, concluded that 
the methane seeped up from deposits in an oil field thousands of feet below the 
surface. But other research paid for by the state of California found that 
similar gases could be produced by microbes near the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The debate most likely will end up in the courts, where victims of the 1985 
explosion and fire in the Ross store are suing McFarland Energy Inc., an oil 
company that operates 42 wells under the area from a compound behind the 
Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
The latest methane incident took place on Feb. 7, 1989, when seepage was so 
strong that a fountain of gas, water and mud burst through the pavement near 
3rd Street and Ogden Drive, outside the Gilmore Bank on the Farmers Market 
property. The same day, a sensor in the basement of a K mart store across the 
street detected a dangerous methane buildup. 
</P>
<P>
Although the City Council required in 1986 that gas detectors be installed in 
nearby homes and buildings with basements where methane could collect, the 
Building and Safety Department has no way to check on compliance, Cobarrubias 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The main line of defense is recognition of incursion by use of these 
detectors," he said. In the 1989 incident, "there's no telling how long it 
would have taken people to notice it." 
</P>
<P>
In that case, workers at K mart saw the alarm flashing when they came in 
shortly after 6 a.m. Nobody was hurt, but the area was closed off for two days.

POLICE SEEKING OWNERS OF RECOVERED ITEMS 
</P>

<P>
Torrance police are looking for Bill West, Tracy, D. B. J. and others whose 
homes have been burglarized in the last two years in cities throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
West's name was found inscribed on a 1962 class ring from USC. Tracy is missing 
a charm bracelet and D. B. J. a gold pocket watch. The items are part of a huge 
cache of stolen merchandise collecting dust at the Torrance Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
All of the items, which have an estimated value of $50,000, are at Torrance 
police headquarters, 3300 Civic Center Drive, where they can be seen by people 
who believe they may be the rightful owners. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they recovered the items after arresting John Wesley Milligan, 27, 
last month on burglary charges. Milligan, dressed in a blue suit and tie, was 
spotted climbing into a window of a Torrance home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A search of Milligan's home in Carson uncovered thousands of dollars' worth of 
property that police say was taken from residences throughout Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Milligan, who has pleaded guilty to two burglary charges, is in the custody of 
the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, police said. Four additional burglary 
charges against him are being filed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Property has already been returned to victims in Rancho Palos Verdes, Long 
Beach, Huntington Beach and Torrance. But the police still have a Yamaha 
keyboard, a gold-colored locket with the initials EML on one side, a pair of 
pewter Indian scout statuettes and other valuables. 
</P>
<P>
Police sa they will ask those claiming the merchandise to describe their 
missing items and show police reports documenting a burglary at their home. 
Items that are not claimed may be sold at the next police auction. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll screen people before they see the stuff so that they don't come up and 
just say, 'Yes, that's mine,' " Sgt. Ronald Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are confident that the owner of one item is sure to show up if the 
message gets out. 
</P>
<P>
"The strangest thing we have is a three-quarter-length hooded coat made of 
skunk fur," Detective Pete Velis said. "It has to be the ugliest thing I've 
ever seen in my life. It's one of a kind."

MICHIGAN STATE COMES OF AGE IN BIG 10 RACE 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Michigan State recruiting class that two years ago was considered one of the 
nation's best is coming on quickly in the Big Ten Conference basketball race. 
</P>
<P>
The timing is exquisite. Michigan State's emergence coincides with a Purdue 
mini-slump. The race could tighten even more when Michigan plays at Minnesota 
on Thursday. The Gophers are 12-0 at Williams Arena in Minneapolis this season. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue, once the unchallenged leader, has come back to the pack at 9-2, but 
still leads the league. Michigan State is 9-3 and Michigan 8-3. Minnesota is 
7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Boilermakers coach Gene Keady put his fist through a blackboard in his team's 
locker room after Melvin Newbern's 12-footer beat Purdue 73-72 Sunday in 
Minneapolis. Meanwhile, Michigan State coach Jud Heathcote celebrated in his 
team's locker room Monday night after the Spartans won 80-70 at Iowa. The 
conference road victory was the fifth for Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois coach Lou Henson says Michigan State "is playing as well as anybody in 
the league right now. Not only are they winning on the road, they're winning 
big." 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans have won three in a row to keep the heat on Purdue, and now 
they'll be home in brand-new Breslin Center for three in a row. They meet 
Illinois on Saturday, Indiana on Feb. 25 and Michigan on March 1. The spacing 
is perfect. Heathcote has more than enough time to prepare for each game. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a position to do something," Heathcote said. "We hope we can keep the 
run going." 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans' late-season spurt is due mostly to the return to form of Steve 
Smith, a 6-foot-6 scoring whiz at guard, and 6-10 Mike Peplowski. 
</P>
<P>
Peplowski, a 270-pounder, has been battling a damaged knee for two years. He's 
put the pep in Michigan State. Smith played the early part of the season with a 
broken bone in his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Smith is back 100 percent on offense," Heathcote said. "We're elated about 
Peplowski. The last two games he's been able to play 25 minutes apiece. He's a 
space-taker. He's not a force offensively. We don't go to him much. We don't 
have time to work on pivot moves. What we tell him is 'be in the right place at 
the right time.' His shots will come seldom, but when they do they should be of 
a high-percentage type. He can make a difference for us. He gives us a big 
player in there that we've lacked." 
</P>
<P>
After the Michigan game, the Spartans play at Minnesota and at Northwestern. 
They finish at Breslin against Purdue in a game that could settle the title. 
The Boilermakers have four of their final seven at home. 
</P>
<P>
Tourney Talk: Iowa coach Tom Davis, recalling the circumstances of last season, 
said: "Our best team from the conference in the NCAA Tournament may not be the 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two different races going on -- one for the title and one to see who 
can make the best run from the Big Ten to the Final Four. The team that stays 
healthiest has the best chance of getting to the Final Four." 
</P>
<P>
Indiana was the Big Ten champion last season. Illinois, the runner-up, wound up 
with the No. 1 seed in the Midwest Regional and represented the conference in 
the Final Four along with Michigan, which placed third in the conference. The 
Wolverines then knocked off Illinois and Seton Hall to win the national title. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Michigan State Coach Jud Heathcote on the Big Ten race: "There are a 
lot of key games yet. I still like Minnesota's depth. I like Michigan's awesome 
size inside. I don't think we've got a great team in the league this year. I 
thought we had two or three last year."

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK / LAURA PALMER: WALTON SCORING RECORD WITHIN CLARK'S RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Clark will attempt to break Bill Walton's 20-year record for points in a 
season when Christian plays at Coronado at 3 p.m. today 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who is averaging 44.1 points a game, needs only 35 to break Walton's 
record of 960 points set for Helix in 1970. Clark scored 44 points in 
Christian's 77-60 victory over Hoover Friday to bring his total to 926. 
</P>
<P>
Clark has been selected to play in the McDonald's Western Wildcat Classic April 
21 at the University of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Times have finally been set for the section basketball finals March 1-3 at 
Golden Hall, according to the San Diego Section Commissioner Kendall Webb: 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, March 1 -- Division III, girls at 5:30 p.m., boys at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, March 2 -- Division IV, girls at noon, boys at 2 p.m.; Division V, 
girls at 4; Division I, girls at 6, boys at 8. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, March 3 -- Division V, boys at 11:30 a.m.; Division II, girls at 1:30 
p.m., boys at 3:30. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said the San Diego Sports Arena, which had been the location of the 
championships for the past 14 years, has been reserved for next year. 
</P>
<P>
Vista Football Coach Dick Haines, who gave his 1985 state championship ring to 
the family of Sal Aunese so that it might be buried with Aunese after his death 
in September, has been presented with a copy of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Vista went 13-0 and won the mythical state championship in 1985 with Aunese as 
quarterback. The players and coaches were given the opportunity by the Joston 
Jewelery Company to buy championship rings, but Aunese chose not to. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Aunese's mother went to Haines and inquired about having a ring 
made. Aunese died soon after. 
</P>
<P>
"His mom wanted one made, but there just wasn't time," Haines said. "So I gave 
her mine. He was a nice young man." 
</P>
<P>
Pat McDonald, who worked for Joston's before retiring, had sold Vista players 
the rings in 1985. When he heard about Haines giving up his ring, McDonald 
called his former boss, and the company provided a new one. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pleasant surprise, but it wasn't necessary," Haines said. "I was not 
sorry I gave mine up and would do it again in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
Monday was the third meeting of the Sweetwater and Chula Vista basketball teams 
this season, and it went like the first two: Chula Vista came up short. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista had a 13-point lead before losing, 79-65, in the Hilltop tournament 
and then lost, 77-75, in the first Metro Conference meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Chula Vista had a nine-point lead with 3 minutes 15 seconds remaining 
and lost, 73-71. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mental thing," Chula Vista Coach Carnell Penn said. "Everybody's afraid 
to shoot the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Following No. 1 Sweetwater's victory, Coach David Ybarra said, "I'm exhausted."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: BLACKMAR'S LONG DRIVE WINS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Blackmar outdistanced two former San Diego State players to win the Long 
Drive title at the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open Tuesday. Blackmar, who won 
$3,500, drove 270 yards to defeat Lon Hinkle's 266 yards and Greg Twiggs' drive 
of 262. 
</P>
<P>
Hinkle won $2,000 and Twiggs received $1,000 in the contest held on the first 
tee of the South Course at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Price won the Shootout with an eagle-three on the 18th hole of the South 
Course and won $3,000. Bob Tway was second and Craig Stadler, who played at La 
Jolla High School, was third. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Mikulus, who played at Grossmont High School, is the second-round leader 
of the University of Arizona Dominos Pizza Classic after shooting a three-under 
69. Mikulus, who is competing as an individual and who's score does not count 
for her Arizona State team, has a one-shot lead over teammate Missy Parr. 
</P>
<P>
Even without Mikulus, Arizona State is the team leader with a 596, five shots 
ahead of UCLA. San Diego State's Joann Walker is tied for seventh at 148 and 
the Aztecs are eighth with a 614. U.S. International is 12th in the 18-team 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
PADRES 
</P>
<P>
The Padres completed their spring-training roster by signing free-agent pitcher 
Bruce Tanner to a minor-league contract, and will invite him to spring 
training. Tanner, the son of former major league manager Chuck Tanner, was 1-6 
with a 2.77 ERA last season with Phoenix and Tacoma of the Pacific Coast 
League. Tanner joins Roger Smithberg, who was 7-7, 4.47 ERA at Las Vegas last 
season, as the only non-roster pitchers invited to camp. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State center Marty Dow underwent successful surgery Tuesday to repair 
a partially torn tendon in his right foot and ankle, SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't nearly as torn as they thought," Brandenburg said. "They didn't have 
to do as extreme of a surgery as they thought, and the rehabilitation time will 
be the same." 
</P>
<P>
Dow, who is out for the season, was averaging 12 points and six rebounds a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU guard Arthur Massey missed practice with a pinched nerve in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
Massey is expected back in time for Thursday's game with Air Force at the San 
Diego Sports Arena, as is guard Kevin Honaker, who missed practice Monday with 
a sore calf. SCOTT MILLER

ADD 'BANKING' TO SHOPPING LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>

<P>
In addition to stocking the pantry, shoppers at five Ralphs grocery stores in 
San Diego County can now complete a full range of consumer banking transactions 
at in-store branches operated by Union Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based bank intends to eventually open branch offices in 50 
grocery stores throughout California, Union Bank vice president Linda Odenath 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Union Bank's supermarket branches, which open this morning at stores in Rancho 
Penasquitos, Rancho San Diego, Chula Vista, Mission Valley and North City West, 
were a response to "increased demands from consumers for more convenience," 
Odenath said. The Union Bank branches, which will be open every day, will offer 
"everything but safety deposit boxes," Odenath said. 
</P>
<P>
Grocery store branches are typically less expensive and easier to build than 
traditional "brick and mortar" branches, according to John Garnett, vice 
president of International Banking Technologies, an Atlanta-based firm that has 
helped financial institutions open 300 grocery store branches. 
</P>
<P>
Banks are finding that in-store branches present a cost-effective way to 
attract new customers. The banks and savings and loans that use International 
Banking Technologies typically convert 20% of a grocery store's regular 
shoppers -- including many who have no previous banking affiliation -- into 
customers during the first year alone, Garnett said. 
</P>
<P>
With their lower capital and operating costs, grocery store branches also turn 
a profit faster than traditional branches, according to John LeCave, marketing 
director at National Bank of Commerce in Memphis, Tenn., which operates 33 
grocery store branches. 
</P>
<P>
National Bank of Commerce's in-store branches have generated 60,000 new 
accounts with $303 million in deposits and more than $100 million in loans, 
LeCave said. 
</P>
<P>
Relatively few California financial institutions have opened branches in 
grocery stores. Security Pacific recently opened 12 branches in Safeway stores 
in Washington; California Savings &amp; Loan has one location in a San Ramon 
grocery, and Great American Bank operates several branches in grocery stores in 
Tucson and Phoenix. Citicorp Savings opened four branches in Ralph's stores in 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and savings and loans nationwide have opened 700 supermarket branches, up 
from just 100 in 1983, Garnett said. 
</P>
<P>
National Bank of Commerce has created a separate company that has established 
170 branches in supermarkets for other banks and savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
"Supermarkets are the No. 1 traffic location in America," LeCave said. "We 
figured, if you could provide banking at the same place, you have the ultimate 
in terms of one-stop shopping." 
</P>
<P>
Grocery chains view the bank branches as one more way to bolster customer 
loyalty. "This is another service department . . . like the pharmacy, the 
floral shop or the bakery," Garnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Although financial institutions have operated branch offices in supermarkets 
for several decades, observers said some banks and S&amp;Ls backed away from 
the concept after First Nationwide made an ill-fated attempt to operate 
financial service centers in K mart, J.C. Penney and Sears stores. 
</P>
<P>
"The First Nationwide idea wasn't implemented in the right way," Odenath said. 
"Consumers weren't going to K mart enough to make it worthwhile. But every 
family makes an average of 2.3 trips to the grocery store each week." 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of grocery store shoppers are not your customers, but 99% of 
the people who walk into your (bank) lobby are customers," LeCave said. "Our 
lobby is now the entire cross section of people who walk into the grocery 
store."

Spelling and Principal Team: Independent producer Aaron Spelling, who hasn't 
had a TV series on this season for the first time in 21 years, will be back on 
the screen next season -- and at his old stomping ground, ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Spelling, who while under exclusive contract to ABC turned out such hits as 
"Dynasty," "The Love Boat," "Charlie's Angels" and "Family," is joining with 
Victoria Principal Productions to make a series about an investigator for the 
Los Angeles district attorney's office. Principal, who played Pam Ewing on 
"Dallas" for nine years, will star. The series, as yet untitled, has a 
13-episode commitment from ABC. CLAUDIA PUIG

Fox to Air Mandela Film: On the heels of Nelson Mandela's release from prison, 
the Fox network will present the HBO film, "Mandela," March 7 at 8 p.m. 
Starring Danny Glover as the anti-apartheid leader and Alfre Woodard as his 
wife Winnie, the film chronicles Mandela's association with the African 
National Congress and his battles against apartheid in South Africa -- up until 
his imprisonment in 1962. "Mandela" won four ACE awards, cable's highest 
honors, last year, including best acting trophies for Glover and Woodard. This 
presentation will mark the film's first time on broadcast TV and also marks the 
first time Fox has reached outside the 20th Century Fox library for one of its 
network films. CLAUDIA PUIG

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSIC; 
</P>
<P>
UNKNOWNS GET ON TRACK AT COZY HILLCREST CAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The San Diego pop-music community could use more people like Georgia Bankston. 
Last October, the 42-year-old former Alaska pipeline worker pooled her 
resources and opened Uptown Sound in Hillcrest, a combination record store and 
coffeehouse that provides local pop fans with a badly needed alternative to the 
Top 40 bar scene. 
</P>
<P>
Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night, there's live music in the Soundtrax 
Cafe, which occupies the back half of the store. The spotlight is on 
up-and-coming home-grown talent outside of the nightclub mainstream. Regular 
performers include piano man Bill Harris, jazz piano-vocal duo Turiya and Joe 
Garrison, and singer-guitarist Jill Warren, a thin, peroxide-blonde in torn 
jeans who last Saturday night delivered a compelling two-hour set of folk and 
country standards. 
</P>
<P>
Every other Wednesday is "Open Mike Night," with a dozen or so amateurs 
commanding the stage between 8 and 10 p.m., for a song or two apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"I have jazz, blues, rock, folk and country musicians," Bankston said. "A lot 
of people who come to me are interested in playing here because they can't get 
exposure anywhere else, and because it's a totally different environment from 
the bars. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not into the Top 40, and many of them are unknown, but if you come 
here on a number of weekends, you'll find there's a lot of talent out there, 
just waiting to be discovered." 
</P>
<P>
In the four months that Uptown Sound has been open, Bankston said, concert 
attendance has steadily increased -- to the point where two weeks ago, the 
Soundtrax Cafe's seating capacity was more than doubled, to 90. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney Bramlett will be back at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach on 
Saturday night, a little more than a month after his first appearance there in 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
Like John Mayall, Bramlett is best remembered for the company he keeps -- or, 
rather, the company he kept. In 1969, he and his wife, Bonnie Lynn, toured as 
Delaney and Bonnie and Friends. The "friends" included several L.A. studio 
players and occasionally had such celebrated sidemen as Eric Clapton, George 
Harrison, Dave Mason, Leon Russell, Rita Coolidge and Duane Allman. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Clapton left, and most of the non-celebrity "friends" were hired 
away by Russell to tour with Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen. Delaney and 
Bonnie made four more albums together -- fusing gospel, country, funk and rock 
-- and scored two hits in 1971, "Never Ending Song of Love" and the 
Mason-penned "Only You Know and I Know." 
</P>
<P>
The husband-and-wife duo broke up in 1973, the same year their marriage 
dissolved; Delaney Bramlett subsequently released several albums but never 
quite found his way back into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Several half-hearted comeback attempts later, Mississippi native Bramlett 
finally seems serious: he's recently formed a 10-piece band, Warhorse, and 
there's a possibility he'll be opening for Fleetwood Mac on their upcoming 
world tour. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Eric Clapton will be making his first San Diego appearance in 
nearly a decade May 3, at the Sports Arena. Tickets will go on sale in late 
March. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale today at 10 a.m. for the L.A. Guns' March 10 concert at 
Iguanas in Tijuana, and for Sam Kinison's Feb. 24 double-header at the 
Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Phil Quinn, executive vice president and general manager of the San Diego 
Sports Arena, is in Palm Springs this week, attending the 1990 Performance 
magazine summit. The annual parley brings together booking agents, managers, 
concert promoters, record-company representatives and facility operators from 
around the country. This year, the arena is sponsoring the closing night 
"Readers Poll Awards Dinner." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show with the 
Premieres, tonight at Mr. D's in El Cajon; the Dynatones, tonight at the Belly 
Up Tavern; Laurie Anderson, Thursday at Symphony Hall downtown; the Sugarcubes 
with the Primitives, Thursday at the California Theater downtown; the Desert 
Rose Band with Travis Tritt, Thursday at the Bacchanal; the Kentucky 
Headhunters with the Savery Brothers, Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern; Melissa 
Etheridge with Webb Wilder, Friday at the California Theater; Soundgarden with 
Voi Vod, Friday at Iguanas; Tower of Power, Saturday at the Bacchanal; El Vez, 
Saturday at the Spirit in Bay Park; the Fuzztones, Saturday at Rio's in Loma 
Portal; and Deborah Harry, Feb. 20 at Symphony Hall.

SoHo Heist: Thieves smashed through a SoHo gallery's front door Tuesday in New 
York and snatched $750,000 worth of art works -- including nine oil paintings 
and drawings by leRoy Neiman -- in a lighting-fast pre-dawn heist, police said. 
The burglars broke through glass panels in the double doors at Dyansen Gallery, 
hot-wired an electronic operated steel security gate and made off with the 
artworks in less than five minutes. In addition to the paintings and drawings 
by Neiman, the thieves made off with six other paintings and four sculptures.

RICH SALUTE TO AN AMERICAN FOLKLORIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruby Dee has fashioned a rich salute to an obscure American folklorist whose 
voice is as authentic as Mississippi mud. "Zora Is My Name!" on "American 
Playhouse" tonight (at 9 on Channel 28, 9:30 on Channel 15) infers that the 
little-known Zora Neale Hurston was a 20th-Century Joel Chandler Harris who 
recorded adult folk tales told by those "who lived on the other side of the 
crik." 
</P>
<P>
The production, written, performed and narrated by Dee, is expressionistically 
staged and visually bountiful under the liquid direction of Neema Barnette. But 
it is the ore of idiom and anecdote that Dee assembled from Hurston's books 
(notably "Dust Tracks on the Road" and "Of Mules and Men") that make this show 
sing. 
</P>
<P>
The program is obviously a labor of love, but here that's not a limpid 
sentiment. The KCET production introduces to most of us a Southern 
Afro-American literary figure whose portrayals of black life in the rural South 
in the '20s, '30s and '40s catch the map of Dixie from a unique aural 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
The aptly-named Zora (the "uncolonized African" as she's admiringly called in a 
scene depicting the Harlem Renaissance) was born at the turn of the century in 
an all-black town in Florida, where we see her luminously played by Lynn 
Whitfield. Juxtaposing the young girl and the adult woman, the production 
dramatizes Zora collecting the oral stories of Southern and Haitian blacks so 
Negro folklore would not disappear. 
</P>
<P>
It is quite clear that Zora Hurston, who died in 1960, leaving a trunk of 
manuscripts that were nearly destroyed, would be a major name today if she 
hadn't been a black woman who came to flower in the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which is loaded with flavorful characters played by Paula Kelly, 
Oscar Brown Jr., Beah Richards, Roger E. Mosley, Louis Gossett Jr., and Flip 
Wilson (as God), among others, catches the same cultural totems and spirits 
that earmark August Wilson's plays, notably "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" and 
"Piano Lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Dee's teleplay mines the language of metaphor and lively invective 
("shovel-footed," "butt-sprung") and ends with Dee's Zora reminiscing on a 
backwater front porch: "I been in sorrow's kitchen and licked out all the 
pots," she says. "I've been raggedy but right, patchy but tight, stringy but I 
will hang on." 
</P>
<P>
Black History Month can feast on this one. RAY LOYND

THE HARD WORK BEHIND ART-MAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Work of Art," the latest project of KCET's Arts and Culture Unit (10:30 
tonight on Channel 28), has two simultaneous agendas that don't always fuse, 
well, artfully. 
</P>
<P>
The agenda suggested by the title is to show how five Los Angeles artists work 
-- more importantly, how art-making is work, hard work. 
</P>
<P>
Photographer John Humble traipses through brush and garbage-strewn wastelands 
to position his large-format camera for the right shot. Sculptor Charles 
Dickson, looking like a low-budget astronaut, wears protective gear as he 
creates enormous works out of Lucite and styrene plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Patssi Valdez, late of the performance art scene, has been producing painting 
after painting in the past year. Comic book artist Geof Darrow's intricate, 
post-apocalyptic fantasies look very hard to do, yet he seems like a jolly 
worker. Elizabeth Garrison and Victor Henderson share their work, as their 
painting prototype for a piece of billboard art is taken over by the billboard 
pros, who copy it faithfully. 
</P>
<P>
The other agenda here is to show how art-making in Los Angeles is different 
from elsewhere. This comes across fitfully at best. Certainly Humble's 
extraordinary photo-dramas of nature and industry in beautiful and terrible 
conflict, and the freeway-perfect Garrison/Henderson billboard work (Lincoln 
crawling on his knees, with the caption underneath, "Don't Hate Me Because I'm 
Beautiful") are very L.A. Valdez's vibrant canvasses, mixing Spanish and 
Mexican colors and icons, are interesting, but not the most exciting examples 
of current L.A.-Mexican art. Dickson and Darrow create unique work, but they 
could be doing it anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, cramming five artists' lives into a half-hour segment is simply a 
terrible idea, and another example of how local artists remain in a time-zone 
ghetto at KCET.ROBERT KOEHLER

SMITHEREENS EVOKE HIGH SCHOOL AT COACH HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a wonderful thing the Smithereens accomplished at the Coach House in San 
Juan Capistrano on Monday: They put high school back into rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey band, which plays Friday at the Universal Amphitheatre, was 
clipping along midway through a solid but hardly remarkable set when something 
happened, some Proustian leap of inspired memory that let a whole lost world 
become vivid and immediate. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to pinpoint exactly what turned this show around, but it may have 
been something as simple as a whiff of an old, remembrance-provoking melody 
line. 
</P>
<P>
What rock fan's memory wouldn't be warmed by the lovely harpsichord solo from 
"In My Life" by the Beatles? Smithereen Mike Mesaros retraced that solo 
winsomely on his bass during the ballad "Blue Period." Then, as he started the 
next song, Mesaros tossed off another recollection of mid-'60s Brit-pop bliss, 
the rumbling introduction to the Kinks' "Sunny Afternoon." From that linkage of 
momentary remembrances of rock past arose a blazing, extended finish, a great 
leap backward in which the Smithereens, though playing '80s originals, 
transformed the Coach House into a high school auditorium, circa 1968-69. 
</P>
<P>
What Michael J. Fox did in fantasy in "Back to the Future," the Smithereens did 
in the flesh. They jumped back in time, turning into the kids they must have 
been when they first fell in love with the rock 'n' roll of the Beatles, the 
Kinks, the Who and the other '60s bands who so obviously inspire their music -- 
maintaining all the while the mature, honed skills they have acquired in their 
decade together as a band. Nostalgic? Not a bit. Nostalgia is burnished and 
old. This was immediate and so bracingly young.MIKE BOEHM

JACK SMITH: A FEW WORDS ON THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF THE MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with lawyers and bookmakers, journalists are held in generally low esteem 
by the public, being regarded as little higher on the evolutionary scale than 
leeches. 
</P>
<P>
A Walter Cronkite may be elevated to godlike status, but his lesser colleagues, 
who grovel in the fields of news-gathering, are regarded with suspicion and 
distaste. 
</P>
<P>
This view of the press (an estate now generally referred to as the media, a 
more inclusive word that I dislike and tend to think of as singular) is hardly 
softened by "If No News, Send Rumors: Anecdotes of American Journalism" (St. 
Martin's Press) by Stephen Bates. 
</P>
<P>
The book is an excellent collection of journalism's facts and fables, its 
heroics and charades, its giants and its scalawags. Indeed, Bates shines his 
light on the nobility of the profession, and reports on the fulfillment of its 
high mission in our democracy, but the stories that illustrate its venality, 
irreverence, irresponsibility and weakness for high jinks are more fun and 
perhaps no less representative. 
</P>
<P>
He reports that Bob Considine once wrote a column that I have often been 
tempted to write. 
</P>
<P>
It said, in its entirety: "I have nothing to say today." 
</P>
<P>
I am also tempted to emulate the Baltimore Sun's curmudgeon, H. L. Mencken, who 
sent post cards to all his critics with the printed message: "Dear Sir or 
Madam: You may be right." 
</P>
<P>
Bates also cites numerous definitions of news, including the classic attributed 
to John B. Bogart, city editor of the New York Sun: "When a dog bites a man, 
that is not news, but when a man bites a dog, that is news." Stanley Walker, 
city editor of the New York Herald Tribune, said news concerned "wine, wampum, 
and wrongdoing." Lord Northcliffe, owner of the London Times, came closest: 
"What somebody somewhere wants to suppress. The rest is advertising." Charles 
A. Dana, editor of the New York Sun, might have been speaking for today's 
press: "Whatever Divine Providence permits to occur I am not too proud to 
report." 
</P>
<P>
In matters of taste, newspapers have come a long way since this Seattle Times 
rule: "The physiology of conception and childbirth and all matters relating 
thereto will not be discussed in the columns of The Times." 
</P>
<P>
(When I came to work for The Times the words abortion and rape were taboo in 
its columns. The acceptable synonyms were illegal surgery and criminal attack. 
("Police said he kicked her downstairs and beat her with a club, but did not 
criminally attack her.") 
</P>
<P>
Bates reports many deceptions employed by reporters to get their stories. 
Nellie Bly of the New York World pretended insanity to get herself admitted to 
an asylum, worked in a sweatshop, danced as a chorus girl and got herself 
imprisoned, all for story material. 
</P>
<P>
More reprehensible: When survivors of the Titanic reached New York City piers, 
reporters got through police lines by pretending to be doctors or priests. 
</P>
<P>
Several stories are told of Charles Chapin, the terrible swift sword of the 
Evening Herald city desk. When a reporter wrote of a body in "the melancholy 
waters" of the East River, Chapin praised the phrase. It then began turning up 
repeatedly. Chapin banned its use and said the next reporter who used it would 
be fired. One did, with reference to the Hudson, and was duly fired. Curious, 
Chapin asked him why the waters of the Hudson were melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps," the reporter said, "because they just went past Yonkers." "Not bad," 
Chapin responded. "You're hired." 
</P>
<P>
I do not find my favorite story in the book. It concerns a young reporter who 
was sent by his paper to do a story on the Johnstown Flood. He wired back a 
story that began, "God sits on the mountaintop tonight, while death and 
destruction lie in the valley below." 
</P>
<P>
His editor wired back: "Forget flood. See God. Get interview. Rush pictures." 
</P>
<P>
My own feeling for my profession was best expressed by the New York wit and 
critic, Alexander Woollcott. 
</P>
<P>
"I count it a high honor," he said, "to belong to a trade in which good men 
write each piece, each paragraph, each sentence, as lovingly as any Addison, 
and do so in the full knowledge that by noon the next day it will have been 
used to light a fire or served, if at all, to line a shelf." 
</P>
<P>
I have nothing to say today.

SCREEN STYLE : HORSEFEATHERS! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
THE SHOW: "Mr. Ed," a '60s series in reruns on Nick at Nite, the Nickelodeon 
cable channel, airing intermittently throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
THE SET-UP: Newlywed architect Wilbur Post (Alan Young) discovers that his 
purchase of a home in the 'burbs includes a talking horse -- not as good as 
finding an attic full of antiques, but better than septic problems. 
</P>
<P>
THE CLOTHES: Wilbur (pictured) is a man of the '90s (which is kind of like the 
'60s upside down), working out of his home and dressing casual chic. He wears 
slim-cut dark slacks (actually, all the clothes are pretty dark -- it's a 
black-and-white show) and sports shirts hiply buttoned to the top. He'll greet 
clients that way, but dresses up in a Beatles-like suit with a pencil-thin tie 
to play bridge. Carol (Connie Hines), who would fit right into today's 
post-feminist attire, dons tight, figure-revealing dresses or stirrup pants. 
Mr. Ed, on the other hand, is pretty much a fashion frump. He favors straw hats 
with flowers and tacky sunglasses. You'd think a talking horse could do a 
better job accessorizing. Well, it is hard to find cool clothes in the larger 
sizes. Intruding on the happy threesome are buttinsky neighbors Kay and Roger 
Addison. Kay is always classically over-dressed. Roger looks like a gentleman 
farmer.

COMPASSIONATE TALES OF BEHAVIOR UNDER STRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Expendables by Antonya Nelson (University of Georgia Press: $15.95; 200 
pages) 
</P>
<P>
"The Listener," the first story in this fine collection, explores the 
exquisitely delicate relationship of a sighted woman to her blind husband. 
Julia and Averil have recently moved to Chicago from Kansas and haven't yet 
become accustomed to the differences between urban and rural living, though 
Averil is adjusting more quickly than Julia. 
</P>
<P>
In Kansas, their lives somehow seemed more natural; here in the city, she's 
begun to wonder at her motives for marrying Averil -- "a man unlike other men, 
one who followed her lead without having a real choice." 
</P>
<P>
Such thoughts seldom intruded on their bliss in Kansas, where the remoteness of 
the farm would have made social life difficult for any couple. 
</P>
<P>
In the city, where everyone is constantly surrounded by neighbors and 
colleagues, "a lone soul stood out," and for the first time, Julia feels that 
her life is no longer happily private, but eccentrically lonely. With some 
misgivings, she invites her assistant to the apartment for dessert, an event 
that precipitates a crisis in the fragile fabric of the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"Maggie's Baby" explores the issue of teen-age parenthood from an unexpected 
and highly individual perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other stories in the book, the fundamental situation is 
straightforward, the treatment refreshingly oblique. 
</P>
<P>
The title story also takes place during a wedding, an occasion ideally suited 
to the author's fascination with behavior under emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
This time the narrator is a teen-age boy whose sister is marrying a fellow 
suspected of mob connections, and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a month ago, Chris had sold one of my brothers a Cadillac for a song. 
Mint condition, 1964, black interior of leather. Well, not quite mint; there 
were the holes along the side -- bullet holes or repair holes, depending on who 
told the story." 
</P>
<P>
In "The Expendables," the ratio of dark to light seems weighted in favor of the 
storyteller's flippant irony, until you start to brood about what he's trying 
to express with his notion of human expendability. 
</P>
<P>
"Helen in Hollywood" invites you into the bedroom and into the mind of an 
alcoholic at 3 in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Like all members of AA in good standing, Helen has a phone number to call if 
she finds herself backsliding, though this particular number belongs to a woman 
who lives on Laguna Beach, and who "sometimes walked straight into the surf 
when she felt like drinking, diamonds, furs, whatever and all, straight into 
the waves." 
</P>
<P>
That solution doesn't have much relevance to Helen, trapped in her stuffy 
Hollywood apartment. Still, she calls it, only to get a hang-up from that 
woman's angry husband. 
</P>
<P>
Helen then assumes the role of counselor to herself, not only letting us in on 
the causes of her despair, but incidentally treating us to a succinct analysis 
of the methods of AA itself. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the dozen stories here deal with a single set of characters: a family 
attempting to come to terms with the death of a daughter in an explicable 
motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
Compassionate and excruciatingly realistic, they demonstrate the extensive 
range of Nelson's talent and her remarkable ability to find the small, mundane 
detail to relieve but not violate the essential pathos of her material. 
</P>
<P>
The first, "Mud Season," is told from the vantage point of the victim's mother; 
the second, "Looking for Tower Hall," from the somewhat more detached 
perspective of a son-in-law, the husband of surviving sister Tina. 
</P>
<P>
Here the tragedy has begun to slide into the background, but not entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Though the narrator tells Tina that she's now part of a new family, he realizes 
he's merely reminding her "she is really more a member of another, more complex 
and scarred one," and that despite all his sensitivity and good intentions, he 
"will always be on the outside, away from the ignition heat of her family" and 
its unique history. 
</P>
<P>
Such special circumstances are Nelson's central theme, and she finds the 
precisely appropriate tone for each set.

VITAMIN INTAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that some vitamins are what is 
called water-soluble. 
</P>
<P>
I also believe that if these vitamins are taken in large doses, they will 
simply be flushed out of the body. As I think you once said, this may result in 
expensive urine, but what harm has been done? Would there be any possible harm 
in taking vitamins as long as they're water soluble? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Taking large amounts of some water-soluble vitamins can be toxic. If 
you feel the need for a supplement, first consult your physician.

</P>
<P>
MUSIC: ROSTROPOVICH LEADS THE NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA IN THE 'PATHETIQUE,' 
THE LAST SYMPHONY HE CONDUCTED BEFORE HIS EXILE. THE MESSAGE: THAT HE HAD KEPT 
THE FAITH OVER 16 YEARS AWAY FROM HOME.

<TEXT>
<P>
The last symphony that Mstislav Rostropovich conducted in Moscow before leaving 
on what turned into 16 years of exile was Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, the 
"Pathetique." On Tuesday, the "Pathetique" was the first symphony he conducted 
at the start of the National Symphony Orchestra's appearances in Moscow and 
Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
The symmetry was Rostropovich's way of saying that he had kept faith, cultural 
as well as political, during those long years abroad and that he was anxious to 
pick up, as best he could, where he had left off. 
</P>
<P>
"These past 16 years that we were in the West . . . we have been true soldiers 
of our Russian art, Russian music," he said on his return this week. "We have 
familiarized a lot of people with the Russian orchestral repertoire and Russian 
operas." 
</P>
<P>
The welcome that Rostropovich, the music director of the National Symphony 
Orchestra in Washington since 1977, received Tuesday evening at the Great Hall 
of the Moscow Conservatory -- the same place where he had last conducted in 
Moscow -- was enthusiastic and emotional. 
</P>
<P>
Shouts of "Bravo, Slava, bravo!" erupted as the last notes of the "Pathetique" 
died. "Well done!" one of Rostropovich's old colleagues at the Conservatory 
called out. The rhythmic applause brought Rostropovich back for five bows. 
</P>
<P>
"He is one of our greatest musicians, and we were deprived of him for these 
many years," the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko said. "The joy of our people at 
Slava's return can barely be explained and probably not understood by a 
foreigner. He is Russian, and he is ours. He makes us proud. 
</P>
<P>
"Understand, he took a stand for artistic integrity and for the basic truths of 
life, and he did not compromise. His return tells us that a new era has begun, 
and it will be a time of a great cultural renaissance as well as of political 
and economic reforms -- a national rebirth." 
</P>
<P>
The performance of Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 brought a 12-minute 
standing ovation and forced Rostropovich into a series of encores for an 
audience that wanted more and more. 
</P>
<P>
But tears were flowing in the audience of government ministers, members of 
parliament and leading figures in Soviet culture even as Rostropovich took the 
podium amid cheers of "Slava, Slava, Slava." 
</P>
<P>
"So many years in the West but so Russian, so very Russian," the music 
commentator Svyatoslav Belza remarked. "The mannerisms, the attitudes, the 
tolerance of chaos, the desire for the spiritual -- the whole feel is Russian. 
That's why people love him so much. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The hall was packed well beyond its capacity of 2,000. There were chairs in the 
aisles, people standing at the back and the stairwells were filled. Outside, 
hundreds stood in the snow behind police barricades, vainly hoping for a spare 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Among those in the audience was Raisa Gorbachev, wife of President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, who was accompanied by Queen Sophia of Spain. The French minister of 
culture, Jack Lang, had also flown in for the performance. 
</P>
<P>
Even the orchestra's two-hour morning rehearsal was filled with students and 
professors from the Conservatory and other music lovers, who were rewarded with 
Rostropovich's playing of Dvorak's Cello Concerto as well as a look at him 
fine-tuning the orchestra for the evening performances. 
</P>
<P>
Rostropovich had chosen not only the Tchaikovsky symphony but also 
Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 to show how well his American orchestra has come 
to play Russian music, traditional and modern. Today, it will perform Serge 
Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5, another Rostropovich favorite. 
</P>
<P>
He also brought two American works, Stephen Albert's "Rivering Waters," drawn 
from his symphony "River Run," and Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings, which he 
wanted to introduce to Soviet audiences. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rostropovich will play the Dvorak concerto in Moscow today and in 
Leningrad later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The concert Tuesday night was recorded for broadcast across the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The performances here are part of the Soviet-American cultural exchange 
program, and also have extensive corporate support. The Dvorak concerto and the 
"Pathetique" are being recorded live by Sony for its classical records series, 
and a documentary is being made.

IS IT PROPER FOR TV NEWS TO USE VIDEO SHOT BY AMATEURS?; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: HOME TAPES NOW A STAPLE BUT HOAX FOOTAGE OF CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR 
ACCIDENT REVEALS THE RISKS.

Home-video footage has become a key ingredient of popular entertainment 
programs such as ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos" and Fox's "Totally 
Hidden Video." But it also is now a staple of television news, although some TV 
professionals worry about the propriety of using material shot by amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
Home video is so much a part of news coverage at Cable News Network that the 
organization has set up a hot line for amateurs who may have footage, said Ed 
Turner, CNN's executive vice president for news gathering. 
</P>
<P>
The network solicits amateurs -- whom it calls "Newshounds" -- through a 
campaign of commercials and announcements on its news programs. Only spot news 
is accepted, and contributors are paid $150 and given CNN T-shirts and mugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I would guess that we get, on a normal to slow day, 10 calls," Turner said. 
"Sometimes when the moon is funny, we get hundreds. Out of those, I'd say we 
use something once a week, once every 10 days." 
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 920,000 video cameras currently in use in U.S. 
households, and that number is expected to climb to 2.5 million next year, 
according to the American Electronics Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic example of the role that home video can play in news coverage 
came during last October's Northern California earthquake. Debbie and Thomas 
Kelly, tourists from Ringwood, Okla., were on the Bay Bridge facing Oakland 
when a span collapsed. They pulled out their camcorder just feet from the 
gaping crack -- "because people in Oklahoma would never believe us," Debbie 
Kelly said later in a telphone phone interview. Their stunning pictures of a 
red car careening off the broken edge of the bridge made all the networks. 
</P>
<P>
Other images burned into television history that have come from amateurs 
include shots of East German pilot Matthias Rust landing unannounced in 
Moscow's Red Square in 1987 and pictures of last year's devastating explosion 
aboard the Battleship Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"Home video has become in the last couple of years a part of the news," said 
Jack Reilly, executive producer of ABC's "Good Morning America." 
</P>
<P>
But accepting -- which in most cases means purchasing -- news footage from 
non-professionals can pose serious risks to a news organization's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
After the explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear reaction in the Soviet Union in 
1986, for example, ABC and NBC bought what was purported to be home-video 
footage of the blast. The pictures were later revealed to be of a cement 
factory fire in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody contacted our Rome bureau, saying, 'I have pictures of the reactor 
showing some smoke,' " said Walter Porges, director of news practices for ABC 
News. "One of our people went to look at it, and from the pictures you really 
couldn't tell whether it was or was not. There was not a sign that said 
Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor, but there was no reason to think that it was not 
what it was alleged to be. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out because somebody else in Rome, somebody at the Italian network, 
said, 'That's not really the reactor -- that's from a cement plant,' " Porges 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Singer, news director of KCBS Channel 2 in Los Angeles, said he avoids 
the use of home video for fear that it might turn out to be phony like the 
Chernobyl footage. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of thing I would worry about," Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
Television journalists, because of their deadlines, often have to make news 
decisions so quickly that it's difficult to evaluate even professionally shot 
tape, Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day we're trying to avoid mistakes and, to introduce a lot of home video 
shot by people we don't know and whose motives we don't recognize, introduces a 
tremendous possibility of making mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
But even Singer has used home video on occasion, typically airing shots of 
weather- and sports-related spot news. 
</P>
<P>
Most news organizations have some kind of guidelines when dealing with amateur 
video. NBC, for example, will not buy pictures that one of its producers has 
not seen, said Jack Chessnut, domestic news producer for "NBC Nightly News." 
The network does not, like CNN, solicit amateurs, and will not accept footage 
from hidden cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Besides veracity, one problem with using amateurs is that they're starting to 
demand steep fees for their footage, Chessnut said. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'pro' is you might get some really incredible footage of a big news event, 
and the 'con' to that is you're potentially bidding, not only against two or 
three other networks here in the United States but, if it's a big enough deal, 
you might be in competition with worldwide organizations," Chessnut said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, KNBC Channel 4 has been soliciting home video for use on its 
nightly news programs for about four years. But most of that footage has been 
for entertainment purposes and is typically used by sports anchor Fred Roggin. 
</P>
<P>
"No one had any concerns. We just tried it," Roggin said. "In the context of 
what we do in sports, showing lots of video, it really fit that format." 
</P>
<P>
Parents and teachers, for example, have turned over footage of record-breaking 
games in high school sports, Roggin said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had great shots because parents are rolling cameras," Roggin said. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC, which is currently running a home-video contest for weather shots, does 
not pay contributors. Instead, they get an on-air thank you and a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Roggin, for one, is concerned about the boom in using home-video footage. "I 
think there's a danger," he said. "Once something works, everybody jumps on the 
bandwagon and it becomes oversaturated. It's only funny if it's done right and 
you don't do it for too long. If you do it all the time, it's not funny."

U.S. PLANS 10% TROOP CUT IN 3 ASIAN NATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The United States is preparing to withdraw 10% to 12% of its military forces 
from South Korea, Japan and the Philippines over the next three years, 
according to a classified Pacific strategy plan being prepared by the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will present the plan to South Korean defense 
officials today as he begins 10 days of high-level meetings with leaders of the 
East Asian allies. 
</P>
<P>
He will also ask the three countries to assume far greater responsibility for 
their own defense, by spending more on their own militaries and contributing 
more to the cost of maintaining U.S. bases on their soil. 
</P>
<P>
The troop cuts, while not as large as those planned for Europe, will involve 
the demobilization of 12,000 to 15,000 American troops out of the 120,500 
currently stationed in the three Pacific nations. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's attempted balancing act is likely to unsettle the allies, who want the 
U.S. troops to remain for political, military and economic reasons, while 
leaving unsatisfied those in Congress who want more drastic cuts in the costly 
overseas deployments. 
</P>
<P>
The shift in U.S. military strategy in the region reflects a changing global 
power balance as well as intense pressures on the Pentagon's $295-billion 
annual budget, defense officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The review of Pacific strategy, formally known as the East Asia Strategy 
Initiative, or EASI, is being prepared at the direction of Congress, which last 
year demanded that the Pentagon present a detailed justification for the large 
U.S. military presence in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
In the review, which is due April 1, Cheney plans to present a vision of the 
U.S. role in the region over the next 10 years. For the short term, the next 
two or three years, the report will argue that the United States can withdraw 
10% to 12% of its forward-deployed forces in Asia because of diminished Soviet 
military activity in the region and greater self-defense efforts by U.S. 
allies. The report will cite the surging economies of South Korea and Japan as 
a factor in allowing a reduction of U.S. defense efforts there. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate reductions could be a prelude to deeper future cuts if these 
trends continue, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
According to officials involved in drafting the strategy study, the United 
States expects South Korea to assume "the leading role" in its own defense 
within the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
"For 37 years, the United States has dominated the relationship (with South 
Korea)," one official said. "You can't learn to drive sitting in the passenger 
seat." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the United States plans shortly to turn over command of the joint 
U.S.-Korea military structure to a South Korean general. Since the end of the 
Korean War in 1953, that post has always been held by an American four-star 
general. 
</P>
<P>
The initial U.S. troop withdrawals in all three countries will involve support 
and headquarters personnel, not combat troops, a knowledgeable official said. 
The military services will be allowed to determine the types of troops to be 
removed and the timetable. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has already announced plans to remove 2,000 Air Force 
personnel working at three South Korean air bases that are to be closed for 
economy reasons. The planned new cuts of 10%-12% would bring the remaining 
troop levels down to about 37,000, the lowest number since the start of the 
Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
Forces stationed in Japan would be reduced to about 52,000 from the current 
59,000, while 1,500 to 2,000 troops would be cut from the 17,800 now based in 
the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions will save at most $2 billion a year if the troops are retired 
from the service and not redeployed to U.S. bases, officials said. There will 
be no savings if the soldiers are simply relocated, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In public statements at the outset of Cheney's trip, which began Saturday with 
three days in Hawaii, the American defense secretary has stressed that the U.S. 
military plans to stay in the region for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no change in the commitment, and our strategic interest in the area 
will continue undiminished. We will continue to be very actively involved in 
the area," Cheney said Sunday. He said that the United States would consider 
some troop reductions "if the threat had diminished significantly or if our 
allies were able to do more." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, however, Cheney and other U.S. officials have warned the Asian 
nations that unless the Administration makes substantial cuts in U.S. forces in 
Asia, Congress will step in with far deeper reductions. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Cheney delivered just before he left Washington, Democratic 
Sens. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas urged a "substantial 
reduction of U.S. military personnel from South Korea, in conjunction with 
corresponding reduction in North Korea if possible but without them if 
necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Bumpers last year called for a 10,000-troop cut in U.S. troops in South Korea, 
and sentiment is growing on Capitol Hill for reductions of that magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last week on U.S. forces in the 
Pacific, Adm. Huntington Hardisty, head of the U.S. Pacific Command, testified 
that the North Korean army remains a threat to South Korea and that social and 
economic unrest throughout East Asia will continue to pose security concerns 
for the United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
He urged lawmakers not to be swayed by Soviet calls for reductions in U.S. 
naval forces in the region, saying they are vital to protecting shipping lanes 
and other economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.) accused Hardisty and other U.S. military leaders of 
suffering from "a Holy Roman Empire complex with respect to stationing standing 
forces overseas." Dixon particularly objected to the continued presence of more 
than 40,000 American soldiers in South Korea at a time when its economy is 
growing rapidly, when it holds a huge trade surplus with the United States and 
when it refuses to match the size of the North Korean army opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is outrageous for us to maintain a standing force of 40,000-plus troops" in 
a nation that enjoys such advantages, Dixon thundered. "There is only one 
nation in the world stupid enough to go along with that sort of a deal." 
</P>

COUNCIL APPROVES ETHICS PACKAGE TIED TO PAY RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday passed a sweeping ethics reform package 
that revives a proposal to establish public financing of local political 
campaigns but ties the reforms to pay raises for the council and other elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The council pay raises, approved by a 10-4 margin, are $8,187 larger than those 
proposed three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Council salaries would rise by $32,822, or 53%, bringing members' annual pay to 
$94,344, the level of Superior Court judges. The mayor would get a $20,110 
raise, bringing his salary to $122,647. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to provide city matching funds to political candidates but 
placed an $8-million limit on the amount that could be spent over four years. 
Providing unlimited public financing could have cost taxpayers $27 million, 
according to city estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed pay raise, public campaign financing and ethics reforms will be 
linked in a single ballot measure in June, meaning that voters must grant 
elected officials the pay raise if they want to adopt the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members said that voter sentiment against the pay raises will 
be so strong that the entire package will go down to defeat. As originally 
envisioned, the ethics reforms would have been split into several ballot 
measures, none calling for pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that we accomplished absolutely nothing," Councilwoman Gloria Molina 
said of Tuesday's action. "You're not giving the options to the voters. You've 
linked everything together, and I think what you have done is dismantle any 
attempt at . . . ethics . . . and campaign reform by adding a $30,000 salary 
increase to the members of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes the statement, 'I will be honest if you pay me enough,' " said 
Molina, who opposed making the pay raise part of the package. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members may have voted for the pay increases as a way to 
indirectly defeat other parts of the package that they oppose. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a foe of public campaign financing, voted for the 
pay raises even though he says he opposes them. "I think it makes the whole 
package more vulnerable," Yaroslavsky said in an interview. He said he favors 
the other ethics reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The sponsors of the broad-ranging package pronounced themselves satisfied with 
the results Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo, who has been shepherding the measures through the 
council, said key provisions of the package were restored. 
</P>
<P>
Through a frenzy of amendments three weeks ago, the council had thrown out the 
public financing provision and had inserted numerous exceptions to proposed 
bans on outside work, gifts and honorariums. Under the new proposal, the 
council reinstated the ban on all outside work and honorariums but allowed 
elected officials to accept certain gifts. 
</P>
<P>
The result comes close to the compromise worked out in mid-January between Woo 
and Geoffrey Cowan, head of an ethics-in-government commission appointed by 
Mayor Tom Bradley one day after his narrow election victory last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about Bradley's personal finances began to emerge a year ago and are 
at the heart of the renewed interest in ethics reform that led to passage of 
Tuesday's package. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan and several citizens groups had threatened to place a citizens initiative 
on the November ballot if the council did not pass an ethics package that 
contained the major provisions of the commission's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan called the reforms as they now stand "probably the most comprehensive in 
the nation." 
</P>
<P>
"In many respects, it's probably the toughest in the nation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan said that a citizens initiative is now unlikely, but that the paper work 
for a ballot measure will be filed this week as insurance against the council 
changing its mind. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics package will be sent back to the council next month for approval of 
ballot language drafted by the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, it's another opportunity for the council to tinker with the 
package," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Woo called the council action "a real accomplishment" because a majority of 
members voted to ban outside employment and honorariums, and to put public 
financing and expenditure limits on the ballot. The council showed a 
"commitment to at least give the voters a chance to enact meaningful campaign 
finance reform," said Woo, who voted to include the pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
The reforms hit an unexpected snag Tuesday when representatives of the city 
attorney's office issued an opinion saying that the council cannot make the new 
ethics code apply to city employees who are members of unions without running 
afoul of labor contracts. As a result, the council made the proposed new code 
applicable only to elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
The council will attempt to devise ethics guidelines for administrators and 
others in policy-making positions at a later time, Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
The pay raise was the most politically troublesome feature of the package 
approved Tuesday, and Councilman Richard Alatorre was one of the few who spoke 
out in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not see anything wrong with linking public financing, salaries and an 
ethics package," Alatorre said. "I don't believe that we are paid adequately 
for the work that we do. . . . I believe we are worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, who had objected to a number of the provisions banning 
outside income, said he could support the ban if the proposed pay raises were 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
The council then approved Wachs' motion to link council members' pay to that of 
Superior Court judges rather than Municipal Court judges, who make $8,000 a 
year less. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Molina, council members Marvin Braude, Joy Picus and Joan Milke 
Flores voted against the raise. Councilwoman Ruth Galanter was not present. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the mayor's salary would be 30% higher than that of 
Superior Court judges. But Bradley said in a letter to the council on Monday 
that he objects to linking ethics reforms and pay raises and would give his 
raise to charity. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said Bradley could use his veto power to remove the measure from the June 
ballot but that he could not single out particular issues, such as the ethics 
reform proposal. His office had no comment Tuesday on whether he might take 
such action.

JUST WATCH THE SWISS GO -- AGAIN;

<P>
THE JAPANESE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN MET. BOTH INEXPENSIVE AND LUXURY TIMEPIECES 
FUEL THE EUROPEAN RECOVERY.

LA CHAUX-DE-FONDS, Switzerland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For five centuries, the craft of watchmaking was what made life tick in the 
valley towns and hillside hamlets in the Jura Mountains of western Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
In the 100-mile arc between Geneva and the Rhine River city of Basel, 
watchmaking was the economic mainspring and one of life's noblest callings. The 
whole wide world operated on Swiss time. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the battery-powered quartz watch revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted by a dynamic, aggressive quartz industry in Japan, the Swiss 
watchmakers -- inventors of the minute hand, the second hand, the self-winding 
watch and the waterproof watch -- fell on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1970 and 1985, nearly two-thirds of Switzerland's watchmaking firms 
went out of business. In 1970, there were 1,620 companies employing 90,000 
people; by 1985, fewer than 600 companies employed 32,000. Unemployment in some 
of the high valleys above Lake Neuchatel exceeded 20%, an economic disaster in 
the Swiss context. 
</P>
<P>
In many other countries, this would have been the end of the story: rest in 
peace for another tradition-bound Western industry overtaken by the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
But Switzerland, although much smaller than Japan -- 6 million people compared 
with 120 million -- has its own commitment to national unity and collective 
purpose. Its bankers, businessmen and engineers hunkered down under the 
Japanese challenge. Independent companies consolidated their resources. Working 
together, most of the Swiss companies converted to quartz. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the makers of traditional luxury watches came out with spectacular 
new models that could do everything from anticipate leap year to predict a 
solar eclipse -- all without batteries. 
</P>
<P>
Design engineers at one of the new consolidated companies, SMH (Swiss Corp. for 
Micro-Electronics and Watchmaking), were assigned the job of inventing a highly 
accurate, waterproof wristwatch that would sell for less than $30. By reducing 
the number of parts from more than 100 to 54, the engineers succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
The result was the hugely successful brand name Swatch, which has been one of 
the keys to the Swiss industry's remarkable recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Figures just made public by the Assn. of Swiss Watchmakers in Biel show that in 
1989 the Swiss industry reached an important milestone, accounting for more 
than 50% of the revenue of watch sales worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one of the greatest increases was in Japan, where sales of Swiss 
watches surged by 70%, to $295 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss industry is not the dominant leader it was in the years after World 
War II. "After the war we were practically the only watchmakers in the world, 
and watchmaking was the biggest industry in Switzerland," Max Hool, general 
secretary of the watchmakers' association, told a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
But strong sales in the higher-price sector, combined with the counterattack 
against the Japanese on the quartz front -- mainly with the popular low-price 
Swatch -- have brought the Swiss back into the race. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the higher sales result in part from the Japanese 
government's lowering of prohibitive import duties on foreign-made watches, 
from 30% to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
But Swatch executives also mounted an aggressive marketing campaign in the 
heart of Japan. At one point they draped a 500-foot-long Swatch wristwatch over 
the side of a Tokyo skyscraper. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do something spectacular on our enemy's home ground," Swatch 
spokesman Marianne Egli said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The Swatch is only six years old, but by the end of last year its total sales 
had exceeded 65 million, company executives said. The Swatch, which now carries 
an average price tag of about $40, accounted for a good part of the Swiss 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the colorful plastic watches -- sometimes so boldly fashionable that 
it was difficult to tell the time -- were not welcomed by some of the old guard 
in the Swiss industry. An earlier experiment with inexpensive "pin-lever" 
mechanical watches, in an effort to meet the Japanese challenge, had ended in 
failure. Many felt that the Swiss reputation for accuracy and quality had been 
damaged in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, there were some who opposed the Swatch idea," Hool said. "But now 
practically everyone credits it with rebuilding the Swiss industry and keeping 
Switzerland in the game." 
</P>
<P>
The luxury companies borrowed some ideas from the Swatch promoters and began to 
advertise their watches as articles of fashion that also keep time. 
</P>
<P>
Ornate, jewel-encrusted watches were introduced into the market, and they sold 
well -- a direct reversal of the attitudes that had brought Switzerland into 
the watchmaking business in the mid-16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Geneva and the surrounding region were under the austere 
religious leadership of Protestant John Calvin. Calvin regarded jewelry as an 
unnecessary vanity and encouraged jewelry makers to switch to watchmaking, 
which had a practical, acceptable application. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's overall watch sales for 1989, the association reported, were a 
record-setting $4 billion-plus. In Japan, meanwhile, the Citizen watch company 
reported only a modest increase of 1% in the Japanese industry, compared to 20% 
for the Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
The generally positive picture in the Swiss industry has put the watchmaking 
craft back in demand, so much so that the Union Bank of Switzerland, in a 
recent report on the industry, expressed concern about a shortage of skilled 
craftsman. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it has lost nearly 60,000 jobs since the beginning of the 1970s," the 
report said, "the Swiss watch industry currently suffers from a shortage of 
skilled labor." 
</P>
<P>
The shortage has revived interest in Switzerland's five watchmaking schools, 
among them the Ecole de Mechanique here in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a hillside town 
where auto pioneer Louis Chevrolet and architect Le Corbusier once lived. 
</P>
<P>
"The quartz watch revolution gave the false impression that there was no longer 
a need for watchmakers," Ecole de Mechanique's director, Claude Laesser, said. 
"People said that the watchmaking trade was obsolete. A total lack of 
confidence set in." 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, when the Swiss industry was at its peak, the school had 160 students. 
They could look forward to a salary of about $50,000 a year after four years of 
study and at least three years of apprenticeship. 
</P>
<P>
But in the doldrums of the quartz revolution, interest among young people fell 
off precipitously. In 1986, only two new students enrolled at the school. By 
the time Carole Forestier, 21, began studying there three years ago, she said, 
her friends ridiculed her. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me I was a fool," she said, smiling shyly during a break in her 
studies. "They told me it was a dead craft." 
</P>
<P>
But now, with guaranteed jobs awaiting them in the revived industry, Forestier 
and her colleagues are no longer objects of ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage of skilled workers has become so acute that some of the famous 
high-quality watch firms, like Patek Philippe in Geneva, have become concerned 
about finding the artisans needed to hand-craft watch parts, engrave gold cases 
and enamel watch faces. 
</P>
<P>
Expensive, high-quality watches are still the base of the Swiss industry. While 
taking in more than half the revenues in 1989 watch sales, Switzerland made 
only 10% of the watches sold on the world market. The average price of a Swiss 
watch was $60, contrasted with $9 for a Japanese watch and less than $4 for a 
watch made in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its prices, which range from $1,500 to $16,000, Patek Philippe has a 
waiting list of five months to several years for its watches. It produces only 
15,000 watches a year, contrasted with more than 400,000 Rolexes, which are 
much larger and turned out with mostly automated equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had an especially difficult time finding painters and engravers," 
Patek Philippe spokesman Petra De Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
This encourages Laesser in his hope of rebuilding the once-proud watchmaking 
school in La Chaux-de-Fonds, where nine new students enrolled this year. Next 
year he hopes for more. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a gap," Laesser said. "We have no watchmakers between the ages of 40 
and 25. There is a lost generation."

EUROPE: TWO HALVES OF DEFEATED NATION AND WORLD WAR II VICTORS MOVE TOWARD 
FINAL PEACE SETTLEMENT. SECURITY CONCERNS OF NEIGHBORING STATES WILL BE 
DISCUSSED.

<P>
The Big Four victors of World War II and the two halves of defeated Germany 
agreed here Tuesday to begin historic talks "shortly" to reunify Germany and to 
discuss the security concerns of neighboring states. 
</P>
<P>
After a frenetic day of bilateral talks among their foreign ministers, the six 
nations issued a brief statement that, however vague, begins a process that 
will finally lead to a peace settlement with Germany 45 years after the end of 
the war. With a defeated Germany divided into zones of occupation in 1945, no 
peace treaty was ever signed to formally end the war. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was the product of an almost nonstop flurry of meetings between 
the foreign ministers involved in the reunification issue. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, developed on the basis of a draft proposed by Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III, said that after talks among the Soviet Union, Britain, 
France, the United States and the two Germanys here, they agreed that the 
foreign ministers of the two Germanys would meet with the foreign ministers of 
the Big Four "to discuss external aspects of the establishment of German unity, 
including the issues of security of the neighboring states." 
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary discussions at the official level will begin shortly," it 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union held out adamantly against setting a date for starting 
reunification talks between the two Germanys, Soviet spokesman Vitaly I. 
Churkin said. The Western allies wanted the communique to call for talks to 
begin immediately after elections scheduled in East Germany for March 18. That 
vote is expected to oust the Communist-led government of Prime Minister Hans 
Modrow. 
</P>
<P>
But Moscow apparently wanted to avoid casting any doubt on the legitimacy of 
Modrow's government in the election campaign by implying that it would not 
survive. And it has also wanted to slow down the reunification process as much 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets also oppose a plan offered by West German Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher to keep a reunified Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, while pledging that no NATO forces would move onto the territory 
that is now East Germany. That plan is supported by the Western allies. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's announcement made no mention of NATO membership, nor were any other 
security issues cited. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings began early Tuesday almost in full view of the "open skies" 
conference that had brought the foreign ministers here. The conference, called 
to prepare a treaty for the peaceful overflights by military aircraft of 
territory of the opposing blocs, is being attended by the top diplomats of all 
23 NATO and Warsaw Pact nations. German reunification and disputes over 
conventional force cuts in Europe pushed the conference far into the 
background, however. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Genscher first met privately for 10 minutes in the morning; then 
Baker and Shevardnadze met along one side of the conference hall. Genscher and 
Shevardnadze met for more than two hours, so long that Genscher had to cancel a 
scheduled meeting with his East German counterpart, Oskar Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd said he had been meeting continuously 
with Baker and Genscher as well as with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from one meeting, Hurd said the Soviets and the Western powers, 
including West Germany, were "quite close" to agreement on the reunification 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd also disclosed that Poland and Hungary had both rejected the Soviet demand 
that a unified Germany be neutral, despite earlier Soviet claims that its 
position was the Warsaw Pact view. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no joint Warsaw Pact position on anything -- not on anything," said 
one East European source. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-afternoon, Genscher met again with Baker to consult over a U.S. draft of 
a joint statement that said the Big Four powers and the two Germanys "agree to 
meet shortly after the March 18 elections" in East Germany. It added that the 
six ministers will "discuss external aspects of German unification," presumably 
including the key security consideration of whether Germany will remain a NATO 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the almost feverish meetings, Genscher addressed the open skies 
conference, explaining Bonn's policy on reunification, which his spokesman said 
could occur as early as next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We seek German unification in the context of integration in the European 
Community, the CSCE (Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe) process, 
East-West partnership for stability, the building of the common European house 
and the creation of a peaceful order throughout Europe," he said, notably 
omitting any mention of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told him and West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Moscow last week that "unity of the German nation can 
only be decided by the Germans themselves and that they must themselves choose 
in what political forms, in what periods, at what pace and under what 
conditions they will realize their unity." 
</P>
<P>
"We Germans are aware of the historical dimension of this (reunification) 
process," he said, adding that Germans remember "all the suffering inflicted on 
other nations in the name of Germany." 
</P>
<P>
He promised that "Germans united in freedom and democracy will contribute to a 
better Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Reunification, he continued, involves only East and West Germany and Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have territorial claims against any of our neighbors," he said. "We 
respect the rights and responsibilities of the Four Powers with regard to the 
whole of Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Associated Press reported from Brussels that an adviser to Mikhail 
S.Gorbachev said Tuesday that some East European nations may eventually leave 
the Warsaw Pact. Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, former Soviet chief of staff, did 
not say which ones might leave.

BIRD RESCUE CENTER VOLUNTEERS WORK TO RUFFLE A LOT OF FEATHERS

Hundreds of pelicans, grebes and other oil-slicked birds found along Orange 
County beaches are being treated at a hastily constructed recovery center in a 
warehouse on Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of volunteers were working Tuesday at the center, which was completed 
Saturday night and is operated by the Berkeley-based International Bird Rescue 
Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum America, owner of the 394,000 gallons of spilled oil, has 
already spent $150,000 on the rescue center, according to BP spokesman Tom 
Thomson. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in rain suits and garbage bags cut into ponchos, about 40 volunteers 
Tuesday were cleaning birds using the tools of the trade: dish-washing 
detergent, warm water and toothbrushes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get every last bit of oil and detergent off," said Robin Butler, a 
volunteer from Long Beach, who was busy rinsing off a squirming western grebe. 
</P>
<P>
Although centers near the spill are receiving birds, most cleaning and medical 
treatment is taking place at the Terminal Island recovery center, according to 
officials of the Berkeley group. 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday afternoon, the makeshift infirmary had taken in 325 western grebes, 
surf scoters and endangered brown pelicans. Jay Holcomb, director of the 
International Bird Rescue Center, said it expects to receive about 200 more 
injured birds. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, some die before we can get to them," Holcomb said. "And we have to 
wait until they come ashore before they can be captured." 
</P>
<P>
Federal and state wildlife officials have not yet released any birds for fear 
that they will return to the spill site. The recovery center will keep many of 
the birds for up to a month.

JUDGE GIVEN DISABILITY PAY OF $56,002 FOR 'STAGE FRIGHT' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former San Diego Municipal Court judge who resigned from the bench because of 
intense "stage fright" has been awarded a disability pension currently worth 
$56,002 a year, court records reveal. 
</P>
<P>
Former Judge Joseph K. Davis, 44, will receive the retirement pension for the 
rest of his life. The amount of the pension is keyed to the annual salary paid 
an active Municipal Court judge, so as the salary goes up, so will the pension. 
</P>
<P>
Davis won the pension by settling a lawsuit that followed a lengthy and 
complicated fight with a state administrative agency over the severity of the 
psychiatric problems he suffered during most of his eight years on the bench, 
according to court records. The agency was among the parties agreeing to the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The "stage fright," complicated by "depression with anxiety," was so severe it 
interfered with Davis' ability to perform routine judicial tasks and required 
him to take "inordinate" amounts of tranquilizers to get through the job, 
according to Davis' lawsuit. Often, it caused him to miss work entirely, the 
suit said. 
</P>
<P>
While Davis tried to hide the problem, it worsened, the suit said. He began 
experiencing panic in any public setting where he was expected to speak. 
Eventually, his ability to do his job was "totally impaired," so he quit and 
applied for the pension, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis could not be reached for comment. A source close to him said he was still 
in San Diego, but not working. 
</P>
<P>
His San Diego attorney, John Mitchell, declined comment Tuesday on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Vista Superior Court Judge Kevin Midlam, who initially ruled in Davis' favor in 
the case and then approved the settlement that ended the dispute, did not 
return a phone call Tuesday to his chambers. 
</P>
<P>
The legal fight in Davis' case developed after the state Commission on Judicial 
Performance, which oversees the retirement benefits and discipline of state 
judges, initially approved his pension application -- and then denied it. 
</P>
<P>
Davis stepped down from the bench on Jan. 1, 1989, the final day of a six-year 
term. He had been appointed to the bench in April, 1980, by former Gov. Edmund 
G. Brown Jr. and elected to the post in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Before he decided not to seek reelection in 1988, he had become embroiled in a 
personal problem. In November, 1986, his former girlfriend accused him of 
beating her. Prosecutors filed a misdemeanor battery charge, but the woman 
declined to testify at Davis' trial in February, 1987, and the charge was 
dismissed after a jury deadlocked, 11 to 1, for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
The episode appeared to doom Davis' reelection chances and he did not run 
again. 
</P>
<P>
But in the lawsuit Davis filed last summer in Vista Superior Court against the 
judicial performance commission asking for his disability pension, he made no 
mention of the battery charge. Instead, he detailed the progression of his 
psychiatric difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Before he became a judge, Davis had been a lawyer for seven years, practicing 
with the Legal Aid Society of San Diego and with the San Diego city attorney's 
office, but his suit said that it was about a year after he took the bench that 
his troubles began. 
</P>
<P>
State law provides for lifetime monthly payments equal to 65% of an active 
judge's salary for any judge who shows that he or she can no longer do the job 
because of a mental or physical disability that is -- or is likely to become -- 
permanent.

SPILL'S CLEANUP COST ESTIMATED AT $750,000 A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cleanup of the Orange County oil spill is costing roughly $750,000 a day, and 
the tally already has reached at least $4 million, James H. Ross, president and 
chief executive of BP America Inc., said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The estimate reflects "cash (paid) out, with BP acting as agents for the ship 
owner (American Trading Transportation Co.)," Ross said in a telephone 
interview from BP America's Cleveland headquarters. He said the shipping firm 
may have paid out money directly that is not reflected in the estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said it would be premature to put a more precise figure on cleanup costs 
or to predict how much longer crews will be cleaning up the goo spilled last 
week from the tanker American Trader, which BP chartered to transport Alaskan 
crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
If winds were to kick up, the remaining oil could hit the beaches in the next 
12 to 24 hours, while an army of workers waits to mop it up, he said. If not, 
"with light winds, the oil could just slop around before coming onto shore, and 
that could take a long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how long the cleanup takes, Ross' estimates suggest the total cleanup 
will cost far less than the $2 billion that Exxon estimated was spent in 1989 
to deal with the much larger oil spill in Alaska last March. 
</P>
<P>
American Trading, which owns the tanker chartered by BP, has assumed 
responsibility for the Orange County spill and cleanup, Ross said. BP, which 
owned the spilled oil, is helping American Trading coordinate the cleanup but 
will not assume costs, he added. In any case, it is likely that much, if not 
all, of the cleanup cost will be covered by insurance, including $400 million 
in pollution insurance coverage held by American Trading, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is unlikely the spill and subsequent cleanup will adversely affect 
BP's first-quarter earnings. BP America's parent, British Petroleum Co., is 
scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter and full-year 1989 earnings on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup costs must pay for about 688 contract employees, plus a fleet of 66 
vessels, including 22 skimmers and a helicopter. Another 500 contract workers 
are available should more oil hit the beaches because of rough weather, a BP 
spokesman said at the cleanup site. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, BP America has sent 121 of its staff to the cleanup site in Orange 
County. Other oil companies -- including Atlantic Richfield Co., Chevron Corp. 
and Exxon Corp. -- have lent 25 to 30 of their employees to give technical 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who surveyed the spill scene Friday, played down the effect of the spill 
on BP's fortunes. Some observers have said it will increase opposition to BP 
and other oil companies' plans to prospect for oil in offshore areas, including 
those off Alaska, and it will strengthen efforts to stiffen tanker regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly some legislators are enjoying the timing of this incident relative to 
pending oil spill legislation in Washington . . . and that legislation may make 
things much more expensive for the whole industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the spill comes a couple of months after BP America's in-house 
magazine published a feature article titled "Upping the War on Oil Spills." The 
article quotes John Morgan, BP's senior vice president for transportation, as 
saying, "We're putting the emphasis on (oil spill) prevention. 
</P>
<P>
"The best defense is to do everything you can to ensure spills don't happen," 
said Morgan, who is also chairman of the company's task force on oil spill 
prevention and response.

EPA DISCOVERS MILITARY SALES OF TOXIC WASTES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A HOUSE PANEL ACCUSES THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT OF FRAUDULENTLY 
DISPOSING OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TO AVOID DISPOSAL COSTS.

In selling a wide variety of surplus materials, the Department of Defense has 
at times resorted to public sales as a mere sham for hazardous waste disposal, 
according to an internal memorandum of the Environmental Protection Agency made 
public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, from the EPA's regional administrator in San Francisco, 
included an account of six instances in California where hazardous substances 
originating with the military had wound up endangering the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The department "has gone to great lengths to sell as much hazardous material 
and hazardous waste as possible to the general public," said Rep. Vic Fazio 
(D-Sacramento). "While the Department of Defense contends this is a means for 
generating revenue for the Treasury and providing the public with access to 
usable, surplus items, in reality the sale of many of these hazardous materials 
is nothing less than a fraudulent disposal of hazardous waste in order to avoid 
the high cost of proper disposal." 
</P>
<P>
Fazio's comments came during hearings he and Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) 
co-chaired in Sacramento Tuesday. 
</P>

The problem came to light last summer when EPA regional administrator Daniel W. 
McGovern in San Francisco wrote agency headquarters after the discovery that 
40,000 gallons of hazardous solvents, thinners, lacquers, and acids were 
purchased by a businessman and left in a warehouse in the town of Collinsville. 
</P>
<P>
The leaking drums created a million-dollar cleanup task whose bill is still 
being debated. The memo noted five other cases in which military surplus items 
auctioned to civilians created similar hazards. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of those cases, the EPA regional office warned that the Defense 
Department's sale of a sweeping variety of hazardous items to the public had 
become a national problem. 
</P>
<P>
The report, along with a follow-up study by the General Accounting Office, was 
made public in Sacramento Tuesday as the Government Operations subcommittee on 
energy, environment and natural resources heard calls for tighter regulations 
of government sales of hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
The Collinsville case and the investigations that followed, Fazio said, shows 
that the Defense Department "mismanages the hazardous materials it uses and the 
wastes it generates at unnecessary expense to the taxpayer, and in some 
instances at substantial risk to human health and the environment." 
</P>
<P>
In the investigation requested by Fazio and Synar, the GAO found the Defense 
Department had sold hazardous materials and waste with an original acquisition 
cost of $116 million for about $7 million between October, 1986, and March, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Logistics Agency, it said, estimated that the sales had avoided 
disposal costs of $170 million. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO said the government should provide safeguards against improper use of 
hazardous items that it sells. It added that steps should be taken to ensure 
that buyers are informed of special handling requirements. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving the report from the regional administrator in San Francisco, 
the EPA's federal facilities compliance office asked the agency's nine other 
regions for reports on similar experiences. 
</P>
<P>
It is now preparing an agency position paper on the issue. It is also preparing 
actions against the Defense Department to recover cleanup costs in cases in 
which auctioned materials created environmental hazards.

Chanting that they refused to "work for peanuts anymore," at least a thousand

across Washington state staged a one-day walkout to draw attention to their 
demands for a pay raise. The walkout by a quarter of the state's 43,000 
teachers gave about 200,000 public school students a day off that will have to

<P>
The Navy has moved two warships to join a Colombian vessel in the waters off 
Colombia's coast as President Bush makes final preparations for Thursday's drug 
summit in Cartagena, the Pentagon announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ships, a destroyer and an amphibious assault vessel carrying a 
complement of Marines as well as helicopters and fighter-attack jets, will 
provide "logistical support" for the President's trip, said a Pentagon 
spokesman, declining to specify what sort of support might be involved. 
</P>
<P>
The American vessels will be accompanied by a Colombian escort ship, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ship movements are the most visible signs so far of the awidespread concern 
over Bush's security during the eight-hour visit to Colombia, the site of 
repeated bombings and other acts of violence related to the U.S.-backed 
crackdown on the nation's powerful cocaine cartels. 
</P>
<P>
Some senior White House aides argue that the concerns have been overplayed and 
that the trip poses little real danger to Bush. But for the Secret Service, 
which believes that the best means of protection is to keep the President away 
from threatening situations, the trip has become a headache. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft conceded Tuesday 
that the trip "is an unusual situation." Even so, he insisted, "we're 
comfortable about the President's security." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever threats exist, Scowcroft said, "we think they're adequately taken care 
of." 
</P>
<P>
Although Thursday's summit has been the subject of elaborate planning, the 
actual event may be far less dramatic. White House officials have spent several 
days cautioning reporters against expecting major advances from the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials representing Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, the three South 
American countries participating in the session, hope to use the summit to 
press the United States to provide considerably more financial assistance than 
the Administration is willing to give. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia's leaders have worked with the U.S. government in attacking their 
drug-trafficking cartels, which pose a serious threat to the government in 
Bogota. Peru and Bolivia, in contrast, have been less enthusiastic about moving 
against their primary contribution to the drug problem -- the hundreds of 
thousands of peasants who depend financially on cultivation of coca leaf. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has said it will not provide additional economic assistance 
until next year, after the nations have demonstrated their determination to 
wage a sustained anti-drug crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Another point of tension is continued sensitivity about the use of U.S. 
military force in the region. Bush probably will discuss the question of 
increased military cooperation with Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas 
during the summit, Scowcroft said. But, he noted, the subject is unlikely to be 
resolved during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration would like to station U.S. warships permanently off the 
Colombian coast to help establish a "radar net" that would track airplanes 
carrying drug shipments north. But such plans are "on the shelf" after 
publicity earlier this year caused heated Colombian objections, Scowcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was felt that could be best done after the summit rather than in the 
summit," said one senior official. There could be an "agreement in principle" 
on the issue, the official added, saying that Bush and Barco might "agree on 
the climate and the process and then just let it take its course quickly after 
that." 
</P>
<P>
For the "logistical support" assignment, the Navy has chosen the amphibious 
ship Nassau, based in Norfolk, Va. It can carry more than 1,900 Marines and act 
as base to 21 helicopters and 10 AV-8B Harrier fighter-attack jets. A Pentagon 
source confirmed that Marines from Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, N.C., are 
aboard the Nassau but would not say whether the ship is carrying its full 
complement. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the Nassau is the destroyer Sampson, based in Mayport, Fla., and 
armed with ship-attack missiles and torpedoes.

ILLICIT DRUG USE BY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS DROPS; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: TEEN-AGERS SURVEYED REPORT REDUCED CONSUMPTION OF POWDERED COCAINE. 
BUT, THE NUMBER OF REGULAR CRACK SMOKERS CHANGES VERY LITTLE.

<P>
In a new indication of a declining American appetite for illicit highs, a 
federal study has found that the use of drugs by high school students continued 
to decline last year even as the availability of the substances appeared to 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
While the Bush Administration hailed the new findings as evidence of success in 
curbing the demand for drugs, its top anti-drug official warned that the 
government still must muster its energies behind efforts designed to cut off 
their supply. 
</P>
<P>
"More work needs to be done on the supply side," said drug czar William J. 
Bennett, underscoring the Administration agenda for this week's summit in 
Cartagena, Colombia, where U.S. officials hope to reinvigorate an anti-drug 
offensive "where the coca is." 
</P>
<P>
The latest survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse confirmed that broad 
trends toward declining drug use are continuing, but it also showed that the 
reductions were becoming less steep and that the number of frequent users of 
crack cocaine remained about constant. 
</P>
<P>
The proportion of high school seniors who said they had used drugs within the 
last year dropped to 35.4%, the lowest figure since the closely watched surveys 
began in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of students who acknowledged using cocaine within the previous 
month decreased to 2.8% in 1989 from 3.4% in 1988 -- a smaller decline than the 
year before. Almost all of last year's decline appeared to be in use of 
powdered cocaine, with regular crack users essentially unchanged at 1.4% of 
those surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the proportion of students who said cocaine would be "fairly easy" 
or "very easy" for them to get climbed to 58.7%, an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers said the survey indicated that drug use among hard-core users has 
persisted in defiance of an otherwise widespread shift in national behavior. It 
also suggested that future reductions in usage are likely to be smaller than 
the dramatic declines of past years. 
</P>
<P>
"The further down we go, the more difficult it will be," said Frederick K. 
Goodwin, a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, the architect of a new Administration strategy designed to curb drug 
use, described the findings as a "welcome sign that progress against the drug 
problem can be made." The slow-down in the rate of decline, however, showed 
that "the work may now get harder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusion that drug use has continued to fall, which was based primarily 
on a survey of some 17,000 high school seniors, was supported by the findings 
of a companion study of about 10,000 high school graduates. The latest 
disclosures follow last summer's release of a major national institute survey 
that found the number of regular drug users in American households had declined 
by 37% from 1985 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Demand is changing," said University of Michigan researcher Lloyd Johnston, 
who headed the survey of high school seniors and cited the likely influence of 
anti-drug peer pressure, media coverage and drug education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the President's anti-drug strategy has aimed in large part at 
curbing demand, Bennett and other officials emphasized at a White House 
briefing Tuesday that the Administration would continue those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the right course," said Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health and 
human services, "and we must not allow our efforts to slacken." 
</P>
<P>
But Bennett, a longtime champion of law enforcement efforts aimed at staunching 
the flow of cocaine, said he found "particularly disturbing" the parallel 
indications that the drug remained readily available even to high school 
students. 
</P>
<P>
The latest indications of a gradual decline in drug use held true for nearly 
every illicit substance, including marijuana, LSD and cocaine. The only 
significant increase was in the use of PCP, with current use reported up from 
0.3% to 1.4% in the past year. Federal officials said they were concerned by 
the upsurge. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers who conducted the latest high school study acknowledged that it 
may tend to underestimate the exact rate of drug use because it is based on 
self-reporting by students and is not administered to dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
But they said that studies of frequent truants -- regarded as "near dropouts" 
-- have also shown overall declines in consumption of illicit drugs. 
</P>
<P>
As secretary of health, Sullivan expressed particular concern that the use of 
tobacco and alcohol by high school students has failed to decline at a similar 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the survey found that 29% of high school seniors were current 
smokers -- the same proportion as in 1981 -- while the percentage of those who 
had used alcoholic beverages in the last month was 60%, only a modest decline 
from a 72% peak in 1980.

WOMAN, BOY HIT IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: MOTHER OF 6-YEAR-OLD SAID SHE LEFT HER HUSBAND 'TO GET AWAY FROM THIS.'

<P>
A 6-year-old boy, whose mother said she was trying to escape her estranged 
husband's gang life style, was seriously wounded Tuesday when alleged gang 
members opened fire at a rival in Pomona and hit the child instead, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman was also wounded in the shooting, becoming the fourth member of 
her family to be shot in what her relatives believe were gang-related 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The child, Daniel Rodriguez, was in critical condition after surgery for a head 
wound at Pomona Valley Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Olga Perez, 23, was in good condition, also with a head wound, the spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother, Marie Rodriguez, 23, said she had separated from Daniel's 
father and moved in with Perez a month ago, partly because of her husband's 
gang affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
"I left him to get away from this," she said at the hospital. "I just want this 
to stop." 
</P>
<P>
She said she and Perez were cleaning house at about 11:30 a.m. when they took 
down the curtains. She said she saw men flashing gang signs with their hands as 
they drove slowly by. She said she recognized the men as members of a rival 
gang of her husband's. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor who police said belongs to a gang was on the porch, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said she pushed one of her two children inside and was about to shut 
the door when "the next thing I saw was my son lying on the floor holding his 
head and crying. I don't remember any shots. I just saw the glass breaking." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe the shooting was directed at the unidentified neighbor 
as he stood on the porch in the 300 block of East Monterey Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Two men had twice driven by in separate cars when the shots were fired, 
striking Perez -- the mother of three children between 2 and 5 -- and the 
Rodriguez boy, Lt. Ron Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just innocent bystanders who just happened to get in the way," said 
Kris Reece, 28, a neighbor. "She's a good person, and I don't see what a little 
kid could do to cause a shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Police found the gunmen's cars -- a late-model gold Honda and a 1964 Chevrolet 
Impala -- abandoned near the shooting scene. Investigators were checking them 
for fingerprints, Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
No weapons were found and no arrests have been made, the lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez's mother, Olga Gomez, 52, said her daughter is the fourth of her eight 
children to be wounded in what she believes were gang-related attacks. Her 
24-year-old son is a quadriplegic as a result of a drive-by shooting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"All my kids graduated," she said. "What for? So they could get shot as soon as 
they could do something for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
She alleged that the gang members responsible for Tuesday's shooting belong to 
the same group behind the shooting of her other three children. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't care," she said. "They're animals. They could see the children 
there, but they just shoot and run." 
</P>
<P>
She said there were arrests after the earlier shootings, but that there were no 
prosecutions because witnesses were afraid to testify. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had seen this," she said. "I certainly wouldn't be afraid to testify. 
I've got nothing to lose. They've taken all my family." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Police Sgt. Ron Windell said investigators have not determined whether 
there was one gunman or several. He said at least one gunman fired buckshot. 
</P>
<P>
"You build up a callousness to a lot of this," Windell said. "But when you see 
a 6-year-old kid with his brains spilled out, it kind of rips all the callouses 
you've built up."

Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich has been accused in a lawsuit of 
attempting to influence a judge on behalf of a campaign donor who had an 
interest in a case before the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich has denied any impropriety, saying he called Superior Court Judge 
Eric Younger, an old friend, simply to offer himself as a character reference 
for Kirkor Suri, whose jewelry store partnership was being sued by a business 
associate. 
</P>
<P>
"What I did in the call to Eric was to ask him, before I stated what I was 
going to say, if there was a conflict," Antonovich said in a deposition in 
February, 1989. "Not being a lawyer, I said if there was a conflict, please 
stop me. If not, I would like to state that I know Mr. Suri, and the fact that 
he was a person who came here with nothing . . . and was able to become a 
success." 
</P>
<P>
Younger disqualified himself from the case last year after privately informing 
attorneys of the phone call and after the plaintiff's attorney objected to him 
continuing with the case. The suit was reassigned to another judge, and is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
The case is a breach of contract suit filed in March, 1988, against a limited 
partnership that owns the Western Jewelry Mart in downtown Los Angeles. 
Although he is not named as a defendant, Suri said he is one of the partners in 
the mart. 
</P>
<P>
The businessman suing the partnership filed a separate suit last October 
against Antonovich, accusing the supervisor of attempting to influence the 
judge "in order to secure future contributions and to repay Western Jewelry 
Mart for past contributions." 
</P>
<P>
The jewelry mart and owners have contributed about $19,000 to Antonovich in the 
last five years, according to campaign reports. The mart contributed $3,000 in 
December, 1988 -- less than a month after Antonovich's call to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
"Antonovich knew that the law required judges to be impartial and be influenced 
only by evidence duly admitted in court," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, contending that Antonovich was acting within the scope of his 
official duties, also names the county as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Damages are sought, but no dollar amount is specified. The plaintiff, Avedis 
Kasparian, contends that Antonovich's actions caused a delay in the trial on 
the jewelry mart suit and may have cost the plaintiff a $3-million settlement. 
He said that before Antonovich's call to the judge, the suit was close to 
settlement -- a claim disputed by the Western Jewelry Mart's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich on Tuesday called the suit against him "frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
Principal Deputy County Counsel Louis Aguilar, who is defending Antonovich, 
said the supervisor's conversation with the judge was "totally innocuous . . . 
lasting a few seconds." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Antonovich is not a lawyer," Aguilar added. "He was acting in what he 
thought was good faith on behalf of a constituent." 
</P>
<P>
Younger, citing the pending lawsuits, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
In a deposition, Antonovich said he called Younger after attending a November, 
1988, luncheon at the Biltmore Hotel with Suri and three of his partners in the 
downtown Western Jewelry Mart -- Edvard and Jak Sukyas and Hackick Madilian. 
</P>
<P>
The partners have been involved in a bitter court fight with Kasparian over the 
leasing of space in the jewelry mart. 
</P>
<P>
Western Jewelry Mart, Suri and his companies have contributed $17,885 to 
Antonovich since 1985, campaign reports show. Jak Sukyas contributed $1,000 to 
Antonovich last year. 
</P>
<P>
Suri, who Antonovich said is active in the Armenian community, declined 
comment. He referred questions to lawyer Robert Mayman, who said, "I think that 
Antonovich did this with an innocent intent, with absolutely no intention 
whatsoever of influencing Judge Younger and anyone else, but more so to gather 
information about his constituents." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Kasparian declined to discuss specifics in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich in his deposition said he could not recall whether any of the men 
asked him to call Younger or whether he did so on his own. But after the 1988 
luncheon, Antonovich said, he called Younger to attest to Suri's "good 
character, and that was all." 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, people may not be as sensitive to immigrants," Antonovich said in 
the deposition. " . . . I have a sensitivity because of my own background." 
Antonovich's grandparents were Croatian immigrants who arrived in the United 
States with little means. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought nothing of (making) a character reference because you write letters 
all the time for people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Younger gave a similar account of the phone call in a deposition. He said that 
Antonovich told him, " 'I hope this isn't improper,' or words to that effect. . 
. . To which I kiddingly responded, 'Well, if you say something improper, I'll 
hang up on you.' " 
</P>
<P>
The judge recalled in his deposition that Antonovich said, "I just wanted to 
tell you that certain of the people in that case . . . are good people. 
</P>
<P>
"My response," Younger said in the deposition, "was something to the effect of 
'Yes . . . I've met some of the litigants on both sides of that case, and they 
all seem like good folks. . . .' He further talked about the same individual 
that he had previously talked about, stressing that they were up the hard way. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I rather promptly changed the subject," the judge said in his deposition. 
</P>
<P>
Younger said the conversation lasted "maybe 30 to 40 seconds, maximum." 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1989, Younger called attorneys for both sides in the case into his 
chambers and advised them of the phone call. 
</P>
<P>
"I was uncomfortable about the call, either having an impact or an appearance 
of an impact," the judge said in his deposition. 
</P>
<P>
Younger said in his deposition that he later visited Antonovich's Hall of 
Administration office to inform the supervisor that he was disqualifying 
himself from hearing the case. 
</P>
<P>
Younger said Antonovich told him that he was asked for character references all 
the time and "he hadn't thought there was anything unusual about this request 
and that he certainly hadn't any idea that there was anything improper about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The judge recalled that the supervisor said the plaintiff in pressing the 
matter was "greatly exaggerating its importance."

BEVERLY HILLS CITY MANAGER TO QUIT AT MIDYEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edward S. Kreins, the strong-willed city manager of Beverly Hills whose 
greatest achievement, a monumental new Civic Center, has been stalled 
indefinitely because of a contract dispute, announced Tuesday that he will 
retire at midyear. 
</P>
<P>
Kreins, 55, had said as recently as December that he was enjoying his job and 
that retirement "would depend if I was happy or not." 
</P>
<P>
But that was before contractor J. A. Jones Inc. walked off the job in January, 
charging that the city had refused to pay $10 million in bills for three months 
of work on a new police station and refurbished library. 
</P>
<P>
With lawsuits looming and city staff members scrambling to find another 
contractor, Kreins said in a letter to Mayor Max Salter that "it is time to 
move on to new challenges" in teaching or consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
Kreins, city manager for 10 years and police chief for four years before that, 
said he will stay on until July 1 to oversee completion of the Civic Center 
project, which has been rising for half a decade along Santa Monica Boulevard. 
It may end up costing as much as $94 million, city officials have said, several 
million dollars over the original estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Salter said he received Kreins' letter over the weekend and that it came as 
"kind of a surprise." The mayor said the City Council will discuss it in 
closed-door sessions later this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, he's going to be a hard guy to replace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Kreins said he has worked for 16 different City Council members, 
"each demanding an expertise suited to their individual styles and egos, as 
well as their personal agendas. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"My style has not always suited each individual and I have always been a strong 
personality when it came to working through the staff," he said. "I feel that 
my style has best served the city of Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
The city, which was facing a $2-million deficit when he became acting city 
manager in 1978, has had a balanced budget for the last 10 years. It now holds 
an investment portfolio valued as high as $150 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, the city's capital improvements program built apartments for 
senior citizens and parking structures for the business district, among other 
projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also appointed all but one of the city's 22 department heads and key staff 
members, whom he credited with providing "quality of life . . . at a level 
higher than any city in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Friends and foes agree that he is gruff, intelligent and a natural leader who 
is fiercely defensive of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 4-inch, 225-pounder made fun of his own image when he appeared at a 
charity musicale last year dressed as King Henry VIII. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Eddie the Fist, I am," he sang, delivering his own version of the 1960s 
Herman's Hermits hit, "I'm Henry VIII." 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Eddie the Fist, I am, I am; I rule the city with a velvet glove; I get 
no pointers from the man above. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It was a star turn, drawing cheers and hoots of laughter because everyone knew 
that the big man, if he does not rule the city, has run it virtually his way 
for the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel like I'm the czar of Beverly Hills," he said in an interview in 
December. "I've been married for 38 years. Maybe Emily (his wife) is the czar." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning his career as a police patrolman in Hayward, Kreins became police 
chief at Sausalito in 1966 and later was the founding chief of a new police 
force in Pleasant Hill, a small city east of Oakland. He was named Beverly 
Hills police chief in 1975 and formally became city manager in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Kreins makes $127,300 a year and lives within walking distance of City Hall in 
a condominium he bought with the help of a $144,000, no-interest loan from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Beverly Hills different is that its people are willing to pay for 
the best of everything, from pothole repairs and tree trimming to garbage 
collection and police protection, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the people tell you to take what you want and get the job done, if you 
don't get it done they should find someone else," Kreins said. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have criticized the size and cost of the Civic Center. And 
Kreins has acknowledged that the project, which includes police, fire, and 
parking facilities as well as a refurbished City Hall and library , is 
"expensive and big." 
</P>
<P>
But he argued that the passage of time will make it seem too small. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee you that in 28 years, whoever's city manager is going to try to 
figure out where to put all the people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his career, Kreins has pushed for more and better equipment and 
higher salaries for his staff. 
</P>
<P>
One month after fielding a brand-new force in Pleasant Hill, which had been 
served previously by the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department, he stunned 
the City Council by asking for, and eventually winning, raises for all his 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Nunes, the present chief at Pleasant Hill, recalled the time he and Kreins 
ran their squad cars into each other while chasing a robber. 
</P>
<P>
"I always admired him for taking responsibility for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all who know Kreins idolize him. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Spadaro, a former Beverly Hills mayor and City Council member, said 
he has "enormous power . . . and unless there is a very strong mayor who takes 
interest in these things, even then it's hard to have much input on what's on 
the agenda of the city." 
</P>
<P>
But Salter, the current mayor, said in December that he has no complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have the same type of personality I do, but the city functions 
well," he said. "You can't have a pussy cat. You have a pussy cat and nothing 
gets done."

DEEJAY, 84, IS STILL SPINNING PLATTERS; 
</P>
<P>
AT HIS AGE, HE'S SOME KIND OF RECORD HOLDER IN THE BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

When Frank Meyers dusts off an oldie from his record collection and slaps it on 
his turntable, it's a real oldie. Frank Meyers is 84 years old. That's young 
for a piece of classical music, perhaps, but pretty old for a disc jockey still 
trying to make toes tap and joints jump. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Clark, for instance, was a schoolboy when Meyers started spinning 
platters. Glenn Miller was still a struggling band leader. Wolfman Jack's voice 
had yet to change. And the long-playing record hadn't been invented. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers is a performer who knows his audience. When he spins records tonight at 
a Valentine's dance at the Hotel Knickerbocker in Hollywood, hundreds of 
retirees are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers said his 1,000-record collection is filled with romantic songs and Big 
Band ballads that can set the oldest of hearts beating and toes tapping. And if 
that doesn't work, he'll even toss in "a little rock 'n' roll" -- tunes from 
the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
"None of this hard-rock stuff," Meyers said. "I play real music. Things that 
really swing." 
</P>
<P>
The energetic Meyers has been doing that kind of swinging since he purchased 
his first portable sound system in 1941, signed up for a night school 
announcing class and began playing at parties, weddings and dances. 
</P>
<P>
He had worked in Canada as a carnival shooting gallery operator, welder and 
accountant before deciding that music was his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing records for $7 a night. Pretty soon, I got so many jobs that I 
had to hire four other boys to help me out," Meyers recalls. 
</P>
<P>
As his fame as a Toronto disc jockey grew in the 1940s, Meyers rented a small 
ballroom and staged his own dances for adults. In the 1950s, he launched a 
nightclub for teen-agers. By 1960, he was running a discotheque called 
Frankie's Surf Club, large enough for 600 dancers at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers sold out and moved to California in 1965, working for an aircraft parts 
company and as an apartment manager while continuing part-time jockeying of 
discs. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing at bowling banquets was a big thing then," he recalled. "I was never 
on the radio. I never made a name for myself like Dick Clark. That's my big 
regret. 
</P>
<P>
"After night school, I got a radio job offer at a little 2-by-4 station for $80 
a month. But at the time I was buying a convertible for $85 a month, so I 
couldn't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
Although no piece of officialdom seems to keep track of party disc jockeys, 
Meyers figures he is this country's oldest active deejay. Officials of the 
National Assn. of Broadcasters said Tuesday they know of no one on the air who 
is older -- although legendary New York radio personality Hal Jackson is 
celebrating his 50th year in the business this month. 
</P>
<P>
Because of space problems in his one-room, 12-by-16-foot apartment at the Hotel 
Knickerbocker, Meyers has converted about half of his albums and 78 r.p.m. 
platters to tape cassettes for his shows. His collection includes 
Charleston-type music popular in the 1930s, Big Band music of the '40s, ballads 
of the '50s and "soft" pop music from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
There's not a Beatles tune in the bunch. Or disco or heavy metal. 
</P>
<P>
Or rap. 
</P>
<P>
"I never went in for any of that," he said. "That stuff leaves me out in the 
cold. I don't speak that language." 
</P>
<P>
That's music to the ears of those who will be in Meyers' Valentine's dance 
crowd tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm too old for romance," joked 73-year-old Mildred Feldman, a Glenn Miller 
fan who will be there. "But I still love his music." 
</P>
<P>
Lester Lees, 78, said he will be listening for "the old-time" tunes from the 
'50s. "That's my kind of music," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Maier, a 1928 Golden Gloves boxing champion, said he will also be there to 
listen. "I'm 81. I don't dance anymore," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
But Meyers figures that his dance contest prizes will lure the crowd to its 
feet, even if his music doesn't. Along with cash, he'll give away bags of 
groceries. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what older people need," he said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MORNINGSIDE STUDENTS WALK OUT FOR 2ND DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several hundred students left Morningside High School in Inglewood Tuesday, the 
second straight school day that classes were interrupted in a protest over what 
the students view as substandard conditions on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Students congregated in front of the school and met with Principal Art Murray 
and Supt. 
</P>
<P>
George McKenna of the Inglewood Unified School District to complain about poor 
security, a short supply of textbooks and vandalism in bathrooms. Tuesday's 
protest began about 10 a.m. and many of the students never returned to class. 
</P>
<P>
The protests began Friday -- before Monday's holiday for Abraham Lincoln's 
birthday -- when 500 students marched from Morningside to school district 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna has promised to upgrade the 1,300-student campus, but he said some 
changes have been stalled because the district is $1 million over budget.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY'S DAUGHTER GETS JAIL FOR DRUNKEN 
DRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phyllis Bradley, daughter of Mayor Tom Bradley, pleaded guilty Tuesday to a 
misdemeanor drunken driving charge and was sentenced to 60 days in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, 44, was ordered to surrender March 9 to begin serving her jail term. 
</P>
<P>
Besides ordering her to jail, Municipal Court Commissioner Mitchell Green 
sentenced her to work with a Caltrans crew for 30 days and to undergo alcohol 
counseling for one year. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was arrested Dec. 15 on suspicion of drunk driving after she was 
stopped by a police motorcycle officer for allegedly making an illegal U-turn 
on Pico Boulevard near Bronson Street in the Mid-Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
Green also fined Bradley $1,000 and placed her on five years' informal 
probation. The commissioner also restricted her driver's license so that she 
may only drive to and from work and her counseling sessions.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LEGAL AID GROUP LOSES BID TO HALT MEDFLY 
SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County legal aid group acting on behalf of that county's homeless 
residents lost a bid Tuesday to halt the spraying of malathion over unprotected 
street people in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Aid Society of Orange County had filed suit in federal court in Santa 
Ana seeking a temporary restraining order to halt the spraying of the pesticide 
in the battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly. The Orange County 
infestation is an extension of one that began near Dodger Stadium in Los 
Angeles last summer and has spread through both counties. 
</P>
<P>
In denying the order, U.S. District Judge Alicemarie Stotler said she would 
hear further arguments in the case in two weeks.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ALL-WINTER SHELTER FOR HOMELESS TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to look into opening 
shelters for the homeless every night during the winter, not just in the bitter 
cold and rain. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman's motion, approved unanimously, asks county staff to 
report within two weeks on whether the existing policy should be changed, and 
if so, what funds are available. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, National Guard armories are opened when the temperature dips below 
40 degrees or below 50 degrees with a 50% chance of rain.

STORM BRINGS WINDS, SHOWERS, SNOW, HAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fast-moving storm system swept into Southern California Tuesday night, 
whipping up strong winds and bringing showers, snow and reports of hail in some 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Pasadena reported heavy showers late Tuesday, and residents on Mt. 
</P>
<P>
Washington near downtown Los Angeles said hail fell in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The upper-level low-pressure area, combined with cold air funneling down from 
the north, will create winds gusting up to 65 m.p.h. in desert and mountain 
passes today, said a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Winds will probably reach 45 m.p.h. in most parts of the Los Angeles Basin, the 
forecaster said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol reported snow on Interstate 5 in the Tejon Pass 
area, but not enough to close it to traffic. High winds also whipped through 
the pass Tuesday night. Rain was also reported on mountain roads in San 
Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said they had received no reports of rain Tuesday night, and 
that police helicopters, which would be grounded during showers, were still 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service places the chance of rain at 20% through early 
this morning. But mostly clear skies are expected today with cool temperatures. 
Highs are expected to reach only into the 50s, with lows in the 40s.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

To Register Voters 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 289 to 132, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2190) 
requiring states to make it easier for citizens to register to vote in federal 
elections. The bill enables eligible individuals to automatically register as 
part of getting a driver's license, authorizes registration by mail and sets up 
sign-up desks at some government offices in communities. It takes effect in 
1993. It combats fraud by requiring states to regularly purge voter rolls of 
the names of those no longer eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Martin Frost (D-Tex.) complained that "turnout in our elections is at 
an embarrassingly low level." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent William L. (Bill) Dickinson (R-Ala.) said the bill usurps the right of 
states to regulate voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes favored the bill.

The Invasion of Panama 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 389 to 26, the House approved of the American invasion of Panama 
last December. The advisory measure (HCR 262) commended the U.S. military's 
performance in Operation Just Cause while deploring the loss of American and 
Panamanian lives, among other wording. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush and America's fighting men and women stayed the course" in 
ridding Panama of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, said supporter William S. Broomfield 
(R-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Don Edwards (D-San Jose) termed it "patently ludicrous to think any 
nation has the sacred right to invade another" because it dislikes its leader 
or government. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the resolution.

Double-Hull Tankers 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 376 to 37, the House restated its position that oil tankers and 
barges using U.S. ports have double hulls. The standard would apply immediately 
to new vessels and within 15years to old ones, under terms of a pending bill 
(HR 1465) inspired by the Exxon Valdez oil spill last March in Alaska's Prince 
William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The House approved the double-hull requirement last year. The Senate included a 
softer requirement in its version of HR 1465. This vote instructed House 
conferees to insist on the tougher language when they negotiate final wording 
of the bill with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Dean A. Gallo (R-N.J.) said the Exxon Valdez spill "would not have 
occurred if the ship had been double-hulled." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (D-La.) said that even if double-hulled the tanker 
"would still have lost 200,000 gallons of oil in Prince William Sound." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes want double hulls for oil tankers.

MARTIN OUT, SO MARINI PICKS UP AGOURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agoura High might have been stunned by an unexpected twist, but, ultimately, it 
was Crespi that was left twisting in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
Posting a convincing rebuttal to the loss of its best player, Agoura downed 
Crespi, 75-66, Tuesday night in the first round of the Southern Section 4-A 
Division basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Charger guard Sean Martin, who averages a team-high 22.5 points a game, took a 
spill just 2 1/2 minutes into the contest. He twisted his ankle and watched the 
remainder of the game from the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi (11-12), too, played without its leading scorer, Rasaan Hall (17.7 
points), ruled academically ineligible two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (14-8), who had not played without Martin since summer league, 
used his departure as a rallying point. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our best player without a doubt," Coach Kevin Pasky said. "But our kids 
know that we're not a one-man team." 
</P>
<P>
It was one man, however, who clinched the game in the stretch. Joe Marini hit 
six consecutive free throws during a two-minute span to expand the Agoura 
advantage from two to eight points. The Celts never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Marini transferred from Crespi two years ago because of limited 
playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm totally stoked," he said. "This is sweeter because it's against Crespi. I 
could very easily be playing here." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi could have used Marini's sharpshooting in the second half. Although the 
Celts made 64% of their shots from the field in the first half, they made just 
seven of 29 shots (24%) after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't bury them in the first half and then we just went flat," Crespi 
Coach Ed Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point was a pivotal five-point play late in the third quarter. 
Agoura's Eddie Corridori buried a three-point shot and his brother, Gino, was 
immediately fouled in the paint. Gino converted the one-and-one situation and 
gave the Chargers a 56-49 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pasky: "I thought, now they gotta start thinking threes, and that's not 
their strength." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi was paced by center Christian Fauria, who scored 18 points and grabbed 
15 rebounds, and guard John Curtin, who came off the bench to score 17. Point 
guard Matt Luderer and Scott Barton each added 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Center Tony Marko scored 19 for the Chargers. Marini (15 points) and Bryce 
Arledge (14) scored in double figures. Eddie Corridori contributed nine points 
and six assists. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said he expects to be back for Agoura's second-round game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi led, 44-37, at intermission. The Celts staged a 10-4 rally midway 
through the second quarter that was sparked by two three-point baskets and a 
layup by Curtin.

OCEAN VIEW PUTS HART ON OUTSIDE LOOKING IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hart High's inside game was no match for Ocean View's outside game Tuesday 
night in the opening round of the Southern Section 5-A Division basketball 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View made seven three-point shots, including a game-clincher by freshman 
Jimmy Harris with 3 minutes 21 seconds left, and defeated Hart, 76-67, in an 
up-tempo game. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (15-10), which trailed at the half, 33-31, before erupting for 26 
points in the third quarter, advances to the second round Friday night against 
Moreno Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (18-8) used a 1-3-1 zone defense and failed to adjust to Ocean View's 
perimeter shooters, who repeatedly let fly uncontested three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't do anything that surprised us, we just didn't adjust to their 
shooters," Hart Coach Greg Herrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Forwards Marty Downen (18 points) and Keith Halcovich (19 points) gave Ocean 
View problems through three quarters, but Hart appeared to tire in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Herrick played his starters most of the game and the lack of depth appeared to 
hurt Hart down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"Their forwards took our front line apart," Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said. 
"They made us look as if we never played defense before. But, yeah, I thought 
they got tired at the end of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Hart, which averages 80 points a game, showed that kind of explosiveness, 
scoring 11 consecutive points at the end of the second quarter to go ahead by 
two at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
But Ocean View put on the brakes by utilizing a four-corner delay game. Ocean 
View held a 61-56 lead with 6:09 remaining when guard Greg Evans stole a pass 
and scored on a layup. Hart never got closer. 
</P>
<P>
"We made them come out of the zone and play us in the fourth quarter, and that 
turned the game around," Harris said.

SAN FERNANDO CARRIES ENOUGH FIREPOWER IN ARSENAL TO WIN A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After his team had defeated El Camino Real High on Friday night to win its 
second league title in three years, San Fernando basketball Coach Dick Crowell 
was being needled by Tiger football Coach Tom Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"Lethal weapon," Hernandez teased, poking Crowell. "Lethal weapon, baby." 
</P>
<P>
And what, pray tell, was all that about? 
</P>
<P>
As Crowell tells it, on game day, the morning's announcements to the student 
body broadcast over the public-address system included an item regarding the 
district's policy on weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Crowell, never one to miss a cue, grabbed the mike. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," Crowell barked to the students. "If you people want to see some real 
weapons, come out to the gym today and see the inside weaponry of (center) 
Lance Whitaker and (forward) Russell Baldwin. See the outside shooting of 
(guards) Michael Wynn and Marco Renteria. See the deadly defense of Errol 
Garnett." 
</P>
<P>
So the whole bit got big laughs? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Crowell's wife said sympathetically, standing nearby. "You got their 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Wily Woodard: It has not been a particularly enjoyable season for Taft Coach 
Jim Woodard, the Wizard of Woodland Hills. Taft finished 4-6 in North Valley 
League play, losing two games by one point, two by four points and another by 
seven points in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard's refrain this season has been an apologetic, "Good teams win close 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, a good coach can win one, too. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's 55-53 victory over host Kennedy, Woodard showed his court savvy. 
After a timeout, with Taft holding a two-point lead in the waning moments, 
Woodard instructed his team to inbound the ball to 6-foot-7 Jason Deyoe, a 
senior. "I told Jason to hold the ball as high as he could and wait to be 
fouled," Woodard said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy obliged. Deyoe, who has made 28 of 34 free throws in league play 
(82.3%), made both attempts with four seconds left to seal the win. But what if 
Deyoe had been tied up by a defender or whistled for a five-second count? 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at the possession arrow (during the timeout) and it was going our 
way," Woodard said. "So the worst thing that happens is that we get the ball 
out of bounds again." 
</P>
<P>
However, Woodard's best call came a few minutes later when Taft won a 
tiebreaking coin toss with Kennedy (4-6 in league play) to decide which team 
would be the league's fourth-seeded team in the City Section 4-A Division 
playoffs. Kennedy will visit second-seeded Crenshaw, the defending 4-A and 
state Division I champion. 
</P>
<P>
Red alert: Harvard Coach Barclay Mackinnon feared the worst when striker Andrew 
Weiss, the Saracens' leading scorer, was ejected from a San Fernando Valley 
League finale at La Salle last week after receiving consecutive yellow cards. 
When a player is ejected, he automatically is suspended from his team's next 
match. 
</P>
<P>
His team's diminished chances in the Small Schools Division playoffs flashed 
across his mind when he saw the senior walking off the field late in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Mackinnon, though, heaved a sigh of relief later when he remembered that he had 
scheduled a nonleague match against Buckley, which was played last Friday. 
Weiss sat out that match, freeing him to participate in Harvard's playoff 
opener at home against Cabrillo on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God I scheduled that Buckley game," said Mackinnon, whose team 
prevailed, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Nail biters: Four of the past five Westside League titles won by Highland Hall 
have been clinched on the last day of the regular season in overtime or in 
extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' and girls' basketball teams beat South Bay Lutheran last week in 
championship games. The baseball team won titles in 1988 and '89 in 
eight-inning games. 
</P>
<P>
As baseball and girls' basketball coach, Dave Desmond has been involved in 
three of the four heart-stoppers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our school concentrates on the arts," Desmond said. "And they certainly take 
that to heart in athletics, because everything is so dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
Forward march: Jon Civita has spent three years leading the Canyon basketball 
team, another two leading the student body. 
</P>
<P>
Civita, a 6-6 forward who led the second-place Cowboys with 16 points in their 
72-57 Golden League finale against Saugus on Friday night, has accepted a 
scholarship to attend Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
A leadership scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Civita, student body president, member of the honor roll and debating team, 
hospital volunteer and all-around good guy, will have four more years to 
develop his leadership skills -- especially since he is giving up basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Civita, averaging 10 points and nine rebounds, has drawn interest from Baylor 
and Santa Clara, among other schools, but a basketball offer has not 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't want to give up basketball, but the offers don't seem as 
prominent," said Civita, who is of the Mormon faith. "I don't feel I'm Division 
I material, so I'd rather attend a school that I like."

STATWATCH: HART, OHLMAN ESTABLISH SCHOOL SCORING RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hart High completed the regular season with a school-record scoring average of 
80.6 points a game, breaking last year's mark of 73.4. The Indians' 18-7 
regular-season mark is the team's best in six years. 
</P>
<P>
Micah Ohlman, who has scored 466 points during the regular season, moved into 
fourth place among Hart's career scoring leaders. Ohlman this season has made a 
school-record 72 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring: Saugus junior guard Geoff Dains made a team-high 30 of 96 three-point 
shots, including 12 in the past three games. Dains, a late-season starter, 
scored 171 points in 22 games (7.7 average). 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter of its 106-69 victory over La Salle last week, Harvard 
scored a school-record 31 points. That mark did not last long -- the Saracens 
scored 35 in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hoover won just five games, senior John Hillman scored 440 points (20 
points a game) and finished his career third on the school's all-time scoring 
list with 1,125 points, a 16.3 average. John's brother, Joe, is first with 
2,213 points. 
</P>
<P>
Encore: Crescenta Valley has made the Southern Section playoffs in 20 of the 
past 25 seasons and in 10 of 12 under Coach John Goffredo, who has 190 career 
wins. "I was hoping to get to 200 so I could retire," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Flip-flop: Crespi's Christian Fauria had his best and worst games against St. 
Francis. In the teams' first meeting, Fauria scored 20 points, had 18 rebounds 
and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
In a loss to the Golden Knights last week, he was two of 14 from the field and 
finished with four points. "We seem to play as Christian plays," Celts Coach Ed 
Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
Almost there: Six of Newbury Park's 11 Marmonte League losses were by seven 
points or fewer. "We get there, but can't get over the hump," Coach Greg Ropes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Girls: North Hollywood's Jacinda Sweet broke two school records this season. 
The junior guard, who attempted 394 field goals, edged 1989 graduate Michelle 
Cabaldon, who attempted 370 shots. She also scored 176 field goals, breaking by 
28 the previous record held by Debbie Herz.

DIGEST: VAN NUYS, SAN FERNANDO TO RENEW FOOTBALL RIVALRY LAUNCHED IN 1919 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The oldest high school football rivalry in the Valley will be renewed in the 
fall, 71 years after its inception. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys and San Fernando, two of the first four high schools in the Valley, 
will meet in a nonleague encounter. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the teams met, in 1978, San Fernando won, 62-0. That victory 
marked San Fernando's 13th consecutive win over its longtime rival. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando, which finished 5-6 last season and lost a first-round playoff 
game to Crenshaw, currently competes in the 4-A Northwest Valley Conference. 
Van Nuys, which finished 5-5 last season and lost a first-round playoff game to 
Locke, plays in the 3-A Valley Pac-8 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando leads the series, 37-25-4. 
</P>
<P>
Phronsie Franco, a striker for the Thousand Oaks High girls' soccer team who 
holds 32 school records, will sign a national letter of intent with UC Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Franco, 17, holds Thousand Oaks goal-scoring records for a career (75), a 
season (26) and a match (12). Her high school soccer career will continue 
Thursday when the Lancers (13-3-2) meet Hart in the first round of the Southern 
Section 4-A Division playoffs at Hart.

LOYOLA'S SUPERIOR HEIGHT TOO MUCH FOR THOUSAND OAKS IN 5-A LOSS, 100-73 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola used an imposing front line -- including 6-foot-11, Cal-bound center 
Ryan Jamison and 6-7 forward Jamal Adams -- to intimidate Thousand Oaks and 
cruise to a 100-73 first-round victory Tuesday night at Loyola in a Southern 
Section 5-A Division playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison scored a game-high 26 points for Loyola (19-3), and teammates Wayne 
Stamps and Adams added 16 and 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sandlin led Thousand Oaks scorers with 11 points. Teammates Chris Loll and 
Brian Capella each added 10 points. 
</P>

A PERFECT TIME TO TREAT 'VICTIMS OF LOVE';

<TEXT>
<P>
The timing was perfect. Here it was, the week before Valentine's Day, and 
Susana Weinstein was giving her "Victims of Love" talk at the local YWCA. 
</P>
<P>
Ten people showed up for the program, sponsored by San Gabriel Valley Singles, 
a support group for people who are divorced, widowed or never married. They 
listened attentively, but revealed little of their own romantic quandaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's such a thing as situational shyness," said the only man in the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein stayed around to chat, however, offering some perspectives -- both 
gloomy and optimistic -- on relations between the sexes on Valentine's Day, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
First, the bad news. Weinstein believes that the vast majority of people 
involved in relationships -- 80% to 95% -- are some kind of "victims of love" 
who suffer rather than benefit from their involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"Only 5% to 20% of the population has a background that allows for total 
support of the self," said Weinstein, 61, a licensed marriage counselor and 
family therapist who has a bilingual (English-Spanish) private practice in West 
Covina. "The rest are in some way victims." 
</P>
<P>
Victims of love, both women and men, find themselves in rigid, limiting roles 
in their relationships, she said. Such roles -- such as acting subservient or 
over-attentive -- can cause unhappiness and inhibit personal growth, said 
Weinstein, also a licensed hypnotherapist. 
</P>
<P>
"Pain comes from constriction of the self," she said, "and constriction of the 
self brings unhappiness. When love hurts, there is something that is not 
responding to our natural need to grow." 
</P>
<P>
Victims of love often are haunted by their own fears, neuroses and imaginary 
thoughts of doom, and are afraid to do what's best for themselves, she said. In 
severe cases, they are battered by their spouses or partners. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, they are dependent on their partners for emotional fulfillment, 
Weinstein said, adding that many are the children or spouses of alcoholics or 
drug addicts. "Being a victim of love is a disease." 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that there is a cure, she said. But sufferers have to be ready 
to take action. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein says she knows this from firsthand experience. Originally from 
Argentina, she married at 19, raised two children (both are now psychologists) 
and one day concluded that she was letting life pass her by. 
</P>
<P>
Although she returned to college, earned a doctorate in psychology at the 
University of Belgrano in Buenos Aires, and even opened a parental counseling 
school called the Institute for Integral Preparation, it wasn't enough. After 
28 years of a "long and fulfilling" marriage, Weinstein filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"At a certain point I realized what my level of victimization was. I could see 
other women growing, but not me. My purpose was to raise a family and make this 
man happy. Reality showed me that I felt very constricted. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, it became too tight. It became too painful. I needed to look into 
it. I realized we had grown differently. We had grown apart. I finally had to 
make a choice." 
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Weinstein said, she had been persecuted and detained by 
Argentina's ruling junta for her activities in education and psychology. 
</P>
<P>
Between that and the break-up of her marriage, she realized it was time for 
action. So she fled her native land in 1977 and immigrated to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"I started from zero with one suitcase, 48 years of age, just trusting in the 
universe," she said. "I left everything behind. I finally took total 
responsibility. I was looking inside and recognizing my limitations, but also 
my possibilities. When I came here I was able to find all those aspects of my 
life that were inhibited before." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Weinstein, who has not remarried, rarely counsels her clients to 
take such extreme measures to find happiness. Indeed, she usually recommends 
that they stay in relationships and examine them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the severity of the problem that determines the recovery. It's the 
willingness to look at what may be painful," she said. "It's only pain that 
teaches us. It's such a wonderful master, pain. It's like the popular saying, 
'No pain, no gain.' " 
</P>
<P>
Not that discoveries are necessarily grim. On Valentine's Day, for instance, 
when many couples renew their commitment to love, victims of love have a 
"wonderful opportunity" to make a commitment to grow, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two ways you can go. Either on the road of protection, in which you 
inhibit yourself and live the life that is basically safe but meaningless. Or 
you can travel the path of learning about each other. Love can't happen when we 
only see our own fantasies and illusions."

DOUGLAS GAINS TITLE, BUT TYSON GETS A REMATCH; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: HOLYFIELD'S MANAGER SAYS HIS FIGHTER WILL PROBABLY STEP ASIDE FOR THREE 
MONTHS BUT WANTS FIRST SHOT AT THE WINNER OF DOUGLAS-TYSON II.

<TEXT>
<P>
Now, the boxing world agrees: Buster Douglas is heavyweight champion. And it 
almost agrees: His first challenger will be Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
The final barrier to Douglas-Tyson II was breached Tuesday when Evander 
Holyfield's manager, Ken Sanders, said in Atlanta that his boxer probably would 
step aside to allow the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
Billionaire developer Donald Trump says Douglas-Tyson II will be June 18 in 
Atlantic City, although neither Douglas nor Tyson have signed contracts. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Douglas only learned hours earlier that he was undisputed champion 
when the World Boxing Assn. became the last of the sport's three major 
governing bodies to recognize his 10th-round knockout of Tyson on Sunday in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a rematch now," Don King, Tyson's promoter and adviser, said 
Tuesday at a news conference. "We're trying to get one. The first thing we have 
to do is get a rematch. As you know, the catching comes before the hanging." 
</P>
<P>
King said he was negotiating with representatives of Douglas and Holyfield to 
work out an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who appeared with King at the news conference, said his loss was "a 
temporary, minor setback. I don't take it to heart. I'll be the champion again. 
I'm still one of the best fighters in the world and when the rematch comes I'll 
prove it." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, as the No. 1-ranked contender, is the WBC's and WBA's mandatory 
challenger, but it looks as if he'll wait for Tyson-Douglas II, then fight the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been approached to make a deal, by Don King, to step aside and make way 
for the rematch," Sanders said. "We're waiting for the contract from him. If 
it's what they said it would be, we probably would do it." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders said Holyfield would fight a tuneup on the undercard, then fight the 
Tyson-Douglas winner in September or October. For his part in the rematch, 
Holyfield reportedly will get $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just asking us to move it three or four months," Sanders said. "It's a 
very good deal for us. We know we're going to fight for the championship." 
</P>
<P>
King started the controversy over Douglas' knockout by protesting that referee 
Octavio Meyran counted too long over Douglas when he was knocked down in the 
eighth round. After the fight, Meyran said he had mistakenly taken up the 
timekeeper's count a few seconds too late. 
</P>
<P>
In his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, Douglas said the main thing for him "is that 
I am now looked upon as the heavyweight champion of the world. It was a 
lifelong dream come true, and I thank God for that." 
</P>
<P>
The IBF recognized Douglas as champion immediately, and the WBC extended 
recognition Monday night after King, who promotes Tyson, dropped a protest of 
the result. 
</P>
<P>
"I never asked anybody to change the decision," King said. "We just want a 
first shot at a rematch." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from Los Angeles, WBC president Jose Sulaiman 
apologized for initially withholding the title from Douglas, saying he was 
embarrassed by his actions. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt embarrassed to Buster Douglas," he said. "I felt it was not fair to the 
kid that I had withheld my opinion about the result of the fight." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said King had put no pressure on the WBC to give the title 
back to Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"The WBC is not controlled by Don King or anybody," Sulaiman said. "I laugh at 
those rumors started by people who cannot accept us."

OWNERS MAY BE SOFTENING STAND; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: SOURCES INDICATE PLAYER RELATIONS COMMITTEE HAS OFFERED REVISIONS TO 
REVENUE-SHARING PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a perception of movement in baseball's stalled collective bargaining 
talks Tuesday as Commissioner Fay Vincent and the owners' Player Relations 
Committee suggested revisions in their revenue-sharing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The key change, according to a source familiar with the negotiations, would 
install a 75% ceiling on the amount of increase a player can receive in salary 
arbitration, and dump the pay-for-performance system based on a statistical 
table for determining the salary of players with six or fewer years of major 
league service. 
</P>
<P>
The pay-for-performance plan would have eliminated arbitration. The new 
proposal would retain it with a modification. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Major League Players Assn. will accept any plan that restricts 
arbitration and free agency -- and continues to include the umbrella concept of 
revenue-sharing -- remains doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
But the revisions seemed to indicate a softening of the owners' position that 
surfaced after their meeting in Chicago Friday and may represent a step toward 
graceful capitulation and ultimate acceptance of the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Vincent is believed to have suggested Tuesday that management would 
accept the status quo, providing the union agrees to a joint study of revenue 
sharing and, perhaps, eventual implementation when the industry's salary outlay 
reached a certain level. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rasmussen, the San Diego Padres' player representative, said he has been 
in frequent contact with the players' association and thought that the owners' 
stance was definitely slackening. "I've got to believe something major will 
happen in the next seven to 10 days," Rasmussen said, adding it is his 
understanding that training camps will open a week after an agreement is 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the owners' lockout will begin Thursday, when pitchers, 
catchers and other invited players were scheduled to report to six American 
League and five National League camps. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the union nor the owners' committee would discuss details of what they 
called a series of suggestions offered by Vincent during a 45-minute meeting 
Monday and a 90-minute meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
General counsel Charles O'Connor of the PRC said some of Vincent's suggestions 
were procedural, some substantive. 
</P>
<P>
Don Fehr, the union's executive director, said he was summoning his 17-player 
bargaining team to New York today to discuss the latest changes and 
developments, though he doesn't expect all of the players to be able to make 
it. The negotiations, he said, will resume Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a lockout situation, and I don't see any light at the end of the 
tunnel yet and I don't see a quick agreement yet," he said. "It would be 
premature to suggest there's been a breakthrough that will lead to a 
conclusion. The mere fact that we have a framework for discussing the proposals 
puts us ahead of where we were." 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said he would discuss the situation in detail after updating the players. 
Asked about Vincent's emergence as the PRC'S chief negotiator, Fehr said he 
welcomed input from anyone, even an obvious representative of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
"This commissioner has never made a pretext of who he works for," Fehr said. 
"Coming from a commissioner of baseball, that's refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
The owners have consistently related revenue-sharing to the need for a degree 
of cost certainty. 
</P>
<P>
A 75% cap on arbitration raises -- either as part of revenue-sharing or in lieu 
of it -- would provide considerable saving. 
</P>
<P>
Angel first baseman Wally Joyner, for example, made a base salary of $920,000 
last year. He filed in arbitration for $1.75 million -- a raise of $830,000, or 
90% of his previous salary. The arbitrator awarded Joyner the $1.75 million. 
Had he been limited to a 75% increase, Joyner could have only filed for a 
$690,000 raise, to $1.61 million, saving the club $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
As another example, Paul Molitor of the Milwaukee Brewers is seeking $3.25 
million in arbitration -- a $1.85-million raise from his $1.4-million salary of 
last year. Under a 75% cap, Molitor would have been restricted to a 
$1.05-million raise and forced to file at $2.45 million, a potential saving of 
$800,000 for the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Said an agent, requesting anonymity: "The players aren't going to accept a cap 
and they aren't going to accept a plan that would eliminate arbitration. They 
aren't going to turn the clock back. I would think that should be clear by 
now." 
</P>
<P>
NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
<P>
* Commissioner's role: Vincent is believed to have suggested that management 
would accept the status quo, providing the union agrees to a joint study of 
revenue sharing and, perhaps, eventual implementation when the industry's 
salary outlay reached a certain level. 
</P>
<P>
* Fehr's response: The executive director of the players' union said he 
welcomed input from anyone, even an obvious representative of the owners. "This 
commissioner has never made a pretext of who he works for. Coming from a 
commissioner of baseball, that's refreshing."

MELVIN DURSLAG: BUCKING ARBITRATION ODDS A TOUGH TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG

<TEXT>
<P>
Ruben Sierra is a gentleman of 24, employed gainfully in the outfield of the 
Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
At 17, Ruben rolls in from his village in Puerto Rico to play American baseball 
and, the next thing society knows, he is smashing, in order, 30, 23 and 29 home 
runs, all in behalf of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ruben bats .306 and drives in 119 runs, leading to two requests, one 
from Ruben that Texas pay him $1.9 million, and the other from Bo Jackson that 
Kansas City pay Bo a dollar more. 
</P>
<P>
How Jackson relates to Ruben Sierra isn't known. He doesn't even relate to High 
Sierra. He bats but .254 last year, drives in 14 fewer runs than Sierra, 
appears at the plate 119 fewer times and doesn't play the field as well. 
</P>
<P>
But always moving in a mysterious orbit, Jackson asks the arbitrator for $1.9 
million, not aware he is making a farce of the arbitration process, and he 
comes away with only $1 million, or less than he deserves in the lunacy of 
today's market. 
</P>
<P>
Arbitrators occupy a fascinating role in the everyday give-and-take of 
baseball. To settle disagreements involving millions, they are paid sums 
ranging maybe from $500 to $1,000, plus expenses. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, they hold court in a room at an airport hotel. They fly in, 
listen to the arguments and fly out. 
</P>
<P>
Deluged by statistics unfurled by agents and team lawyers, arbitrators, 
understandably, have been known to doze. 
</P>
<P>
When a ballplayer comes to a hearing announcing he wants $1 more than Ruben 
Sierra, we see an arbitrator saying to himself, "This has to be some kind of 
wise guy. That extra buck is too cutesy." 
</P>
<P>
And the arbitrator votes in behalf of the club. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, we aren't able to document what thoughts pervaded the cerebral 
turbine of the arbitrator listening to the Jackson-Kansas City case, but we 
picture a lot of arbitrators turning down Bo on such a caper. 
</P>
<P>
Now you hear interesting discussions in connection with Jackson's future, some 
guessing that, asked to play baseball for only $1 million, he may switch full 
time to football. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long ago that folks were guessing he would switch full time to 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
What the Raiders would pay Ruben Sierra hasn't yet been disclosed, but what 
they did with Bo Jackson, before salaries began to escalate, was make him a 
deal whereby they would give him sums ranging from roughly $600,000 to $800,000 
a season for reporting in October. 
</P>
<P>
If he did this for five seasons, a balloon payment would await him at the end, 
worth possibly $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Since no kid can resist balloons, you see Jackson playing football two more 
years to complete this little heist. 
</P>
<P>
The unconventional package isn't new to the Raiders. They made a three-way deal 
one time involving themselves, a halfback named Napoleon McCallum and the U.S. 
Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy would station Napoleon on a ship at Long Beach and work him from 4 in 
the morning until noon, at which time a driver from the Raiders would pick him 
up and speed him to practice. 
</P>
<P>
It was a nice arrangement until mothers of other sailors began to holler 
favoritism, and the Navy moved McCallum out in what the Raiders saw as an 
un-American act. 
</P>
<P>
We had a talk about Jackson last season with John Wathan, manager of the 
Royals, who submitted that Jackson would be a better baseball player if he gave 
up football. 
</P>
<P>
"Our season is 162 games, plus 30 exhibitions," Wathan said. "The physical and 
mental strains are big. If Bo rested after baseball season and did light work 
in the instructional league, instead of rushing off to football, it would be 
better for him." 
</P>
<P>
He might even pick up a buck more than Ruben Sierra, who doesn't know a nickel 
defense from a fifth of Bacardi. 
</P>
<P>
In view of his arbitration setback in baseball, will Bo Jackson discuss 
football? Not exactly. It is his policy during baseball season, he says, to 
talk only about baseball and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
During football season, he talks only about football and hunting. 
</P>
<P>
This poses a problem for those who, during football season, might like to talk 
about fishing.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
Among those who believe the Mike Tyson mystique is not dead is Jimmy Vaccaro, 
oddsmaker at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Vaccaro says he will post Tyson as an 18-1 favorite over Buster Douglas once 
the rematch is signed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I could be wrong, and there might be some big bets made on Douglas that will 
lower the odds," Vaccaro said. "But I definitely will open it at 18-1." . . . 
</P>
<P>
That would be one of the highest prices ever for a heavyweight championship 
fight. The highest, of course, was the 42-1 in favor of Tyson over Douglas last 
weekend in Tokyo. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Funny how Don King dropped his protest of the knockout and the WBC and WBA 
immediately followed suit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This was one time that King was forced to bow to public opinion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most surprising result of The Times' poll the other day was that only 29% said 
they followed the Dodgers closely, compared to 39% for the Lakers. Of course, 
it's partly a matter of what have you done for us lately. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The good news: The Rams will play the New York Giants for a second consecutive 
season at Anaheim Stadium. The bad news: The Rams also will play the Phoenix 
Cardinals again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In a change of format, the Los Angeles Athletic Club will present the John 
Wooden Award to the nation's outstanding collegiate basketball player on the 
Sunday between the NCAA semifinals and final in Denver. A one-hour national 
television special, a la Heisman Trophy, is in the works. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don't invite Wooden to any slam-dunk contests. He thinks reliance on that 
maneuver has limited the skills of many players. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Sowell will try for her second consecutive female athlete-of-the-meet 
award Friday in the Times/Eagle Indoor Games at the Forum. Winner of the 60 
meters in the American-record time of 7.15 seconds last year, she will run in 
both the 60 and the 200. . . . 
</P>
<P>
My apologies to Brett Hull. The high-scoring St. Louis Blues wing is showing 
that he's more than half the player his dad, Bobby, was. Maybe even 
three-quarters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The reason for those relatively small hockey salaries that were revealed 
recently is simple: No lucrative national television package. . . . 
</P>
<P>
When the bad boys from the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Chicago Blackhawks 
collide, they're calling it a "Chuck Norris" Division matchup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now that the figures have been taken out of figure skating, the name of the 
sport should be changed. Something simple like free skating. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I'll miss the figures because watching the Zamboni machine clean the ice won't 
seem so exciting now. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Saturday will be bargain day for USC sports. For a total of $4, you can watch 
swimming, against UCLA; baseball and tennis, both against Arizona State, all on 
campus, and basketball, against California, at the Sports Arena. . . . 
</P>
<P>
With Artesia High star Ed O'Bannon in the stands, the Trojan basketball team is 
3-0. . . . If safety Mark Carrier turns pro, it might be a more damaging blow 
to USC than the loss of linebacker Junior Seau. Taking over for Seau will be 
Craig Hartsuyker, who started ahead of Seau two years ago and recorded nine 
sacks last season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Eclipse Award-winning jockey Kent Desmoreaux has been displaying terrific 
athletic moves in pickup basketball games at the Santa Anita YMCA in Monrovia. 
About the only thing he can't do is dunk. . . . 
</P>
<P>
With boxing so much in the news, Ali's Song would have been a good hunch bet 
Monday at Santa Anita. She won the first race and paid $8.80. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The only ballplayers to be hurt by a shortened spring training would be 
pitchers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Four reporters actually voted La Salle No. 1 in the latest Associated Press 
basketball poll. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Her male counterparts should take lessons on playmaking from Stanford guard 
Jennifer Azzi. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Watching Villanova's two upset victories over Syracuse, you got the idea that 
the coaching of Rollie Massimino over Jim Boeheim was the difference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Utah Jazz President Frank Layden, on John Stockton: "I've been in basketball 
almost 50 years, and it took me awhile to realize that he is the best pure 
point guard that I've ever seen." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, but I don't think many Americans are going to pay to see events like 
kayaking, judo, bicycling and track and field preliminaries on TV during the 
1992 Olympic Games. You can be sure NBC isn't going to farm out any of the 
bigger attractions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf might be extended to three sets if she played left-handed while her 
broken right thumb heals.

BABCOCK EXPECTED TO LEAVE DENVER, JOIN ATLANTA AS GENERAL MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Babcock, the off-again, on-again general manager of the Denver Nuggets, 
will take over as general manager of the Atlanta Hawks in a move expected to be 
completed Wednesday in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' sources said that Stan Kasten, currently president and general 
manager of both the Hawks and the Atlanta Braves, will remain the president of 
the Hawks but relinquish the Hawks' general manager job to Babcock and 
concentrate on the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Babcock, once an assistant coach of the old San Diego Clippers under Paul 
Silas, was the Nuggets' general manager until he was replaced by Dave Checketts 
when a new minority ownership took over the Denver team last summer. But when 
that deal fell through in late summer, Babcock was back in his old job. Soon, 
however, the minority ownership deal went through, with help from TV official 
Bob Wussler, and Babcock was replaced by Jon Spolestra, formerly of the 
Portland Trailblazers. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Spoelstra was fired and Babcock was back in once again with the 
Nuggets. But when his powers were reduced considerably in the areas of trades 
and player personnel, he began negotiating with the Hawks. BILL DWYRE

NBA ROUNDUP;

<P>
BIRD'S FREE THROW STREAK ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Bird's flirtation with at least one bit of history came to an end Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Bird's consecutive free throw string ended at 71, but the veteran forward still 
scored 38 points and grabbed 14 rebounds to lead the Boston Celtics to a 107-94 
victory over the Houston Rockets at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Bird missed a free throw with 4:17 left in the third quarter, ending his string 
seven short of the NBA record of 78 set by Rocket guard Calvin Murphy in the 
1980-81 season. 
</P>
<P>
Bird said he didn't take time to think much about the free-throw record. 
</P>
<P>
"The game was really too close to think about it," Bird said. "I just missed 
it. There's no explanation." 
</P>
<P>
After his miss, Bird made his next four. 
</P>
<P>
Bird made seven of his first nine shots and scored 25 points in the first half, 
when he didn't shoot a free throw, giving the Celtics a 55-49 lead at 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Akeem Olajuwon led the Rockets with 22 points and 17 rebounds. Otis Thorpe had 
24 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 128, Charlotte 105 -- Chuck Person and Reggie Miller each scored 23 
points at Indianapolis as the Pacers extended the Hornets' losing streak to a 
club-record 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets have an NBA-worst 1-21 road record. It was also the sixth loss in 
as many games for interim coach Gene Littles. 
</P>
<P>
Miller scored in double figures for his 61st straight game, tying the Pacers 
club record set by Billy Knight in the 1976-77 season. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 106, Denver 96 -- Bill Laimbeer scored nine points in the fourth 
quarter as the Pistons rallied at Auburn Hills, Mich., for their 10th win in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets were ahead by five points at the start of the fourth quarter, but 
Laimbeer -- who finished with 13 points and 20 rebounds -- made a shot from the 
top of the key with 8:01 left to break an 85-85 tie and the Pistons then pulled 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Adams led the Nuggets with 19 points, 15 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 107, Miami 95 -- Michael Jordan scored seven of his 26 points during a 
13-point second quarter run that sparked the Bulls at Miami and overshadowed a 
franchise-record 40 points by the Heat's Rony Seikaly. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago led, 49-43, when a three-point play by Jordan started the burst that 
ended with the Bulls ahead, 62-43, with 1:27 left in the first half. Miami 
committed seven turnovers as they failed to score over a 4:13 span while 
Chicago broke the game open. 
</P>
<P>
Seikaly also had 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
New York 114, Atlanta 109 -- Patrick Ewing scored 31 points at Atlanta as the 
Knicks won their sixth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Knicks' third victory in as many meetings with the Hawks this 
season, giving New York a 2-0 sweep in Atlanta for the first time since 
1974-75. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Wilkins led the Hawks with 33 points, Moses Malone added 24 and Kevin 
Willis had 23 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 110, Minnesota 104 -- Karl Malone scored six of his 40 points in overtime 
to lead the Jazz to victory at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz outscored Minnesota, 11-1, over the final 4:15 of regulation, with 
Malone sending the game into overtime when he scored with 61 seconds left to 
tie the score, 98-98. 
</P>
<P>
Baskets by Tyrone Corbin and Tony Campbell brought the Timberwolves within 
104-102 with 2:15 left in overtime, but Mark Eaton, Malone and Bobby Hansen 
scored successive baskets to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen had 22 points for the Jazz and John Stockton had 18 assists. Tony 
Campbell led Minnesota with 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 110, Seattle 106 -- Kevin Duckworth made two free throws and a key 
steal in the final 40 seconds as the Trail Blazers won at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Duckworth's free throws with 40.6 seconds left snapped a 104-104 tie. He then 
made a steal and fed Terry Porter, who had 25 of his 31 points in the second 
half, for a layup and a 108-104 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 103, San Antonio 96 -- Derek Harper scored a team-high 22 points at 
Dallas as the Mavericks won their eighth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Cummings scored 22 points and David Robinson and Willie Anderson added 21 
each for the Spurs, who had won five of their previous six games, and their 
first two meetings with Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 106, Washington 98 -- Danny Ainge scored 33 points at Sacramento as 
the Kings ended a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has lost seven of its last eight road games.

Irving Fryar of the New England Patriots, a former Nebraska football player, 
denied a published report that he shared cocaine with Doug DuBose, a troubled 
former Cornhusker star running back. 
</P>
<P>
"I used marijuana through college," Fryar told the Omaha World-Herald, "but I 
didn't use cocaine until after my senior year in college, right before I got 
into the pros." 
</P>
<P>
The Hartford Courant, which published a four-part series about DuBose last 
week, has said it stands by its stories, which alleged that DuBose was 
introduced to drugs by Fryar and running back Mike Rozier. 
</P>
<P>
Fryar, a wide receiver for the New England Patriots, told the World-Herald: 
"Let's get this straight, OK? You can print this. I go around and speak to 
schools now. As everyone knows, I've been involved with drugs before, not to 
the extent that I was addicted."

Former Cleveland Brown running back Jim Brown said he is thinking of asking 
that his name be removed from the Pro Football Hall of Fame, calling the hall 
"racist." 
</P>
<P>
The Dayton Daily News said Brown made the remarks in an interview before the 
Ohio Professional and Amateur Athlete of the Year awards dinner Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"How can John Mackey not be in it?" Brown said. "How can Lynn Swann not be in 
it? It's racist." 
</P>
<P>
Mackey, a former tight end for the Baltimore Colts, and Swann, a former end for 
the Pittsburgh Steelers, are both black.

<P>
Bryan Trottier has reached numerous milestones in his 15-year NHL career, and 
Tuesday night he added another by scoring his 500th career goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Calgary Flames, however, took some of the luster off the achievement by 
defeating the New York Islanders, 4-2, at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Trottier became the 15th player in NHL history to reach the 500-goal mark when 
he scored at 9:57 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames got a tie-breaking goal early in the third period from Doug Gilmour 
and a pair of goals by Joe Nieuwendyk. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 5, Vancouver 3 -- Tony McKegney and Mark Fortier each scored two goals 
at Quebec as the Nordiques ended a club-record 11-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Nordiques, who were closing in on the NHL's longest losing string -- 17 
games by the Washington Capitals in 1975 -- had not won since they beat the 
Montreal Canadiens on Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
N.Y. Rangers 4, Philadelphia 3 -- John Ogrodnick scored two goals at 
Philadelphia, including the game-winner in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Buffalo 1 -- Alain Chevrier turned back 25 shots at Chicago in the 
Blackhawks first home game since Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrier lost a bid for his first shutout of the season when Buffalo's Jeff 
Parker scored with 2:22 remaining in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 2, Minnesota 1 -- Rick Meagher scored the game-winning goal 2:49 into 
overtime at Bloomington, Minn., when North Stars goalie Jon Casey deflected 
Meagher's pass into his own net. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull, the NHL's leading scorer with 52 goals, had his team-record 20-game 
scoring string snapped.

What's wrong with Wayne Gretzky? 
</P>
<P>
At first, it was just a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's being asked in newspaper headlines. Especially in Canada, where any 
hint that Gretzky, still the pride of his native land, might be a mere mortal 
is treated as a national crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tyson getting knocked out? 
</P>
<P>
It happens. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky becoming the Late Great One at 29? 
</P>
<P>
Never! 
</P>
<P>
Let's hasten to add that there is nothing to indicate the Kings' center is in 
anything more than a normal slump. 
</P>
<P>
True, he has gone pointless in nine games this season, has scored just one goal 
in his past six games and has recorded only two assists in his past four. 
</P>
<P>
He missed a crucial breakaway in Monday night's 5-3 loss to the Toronto Maple 
Leafs and has generally been ineffective during the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But to put it all in perspective, with 23 games left, Gretzky has 29 goals and 
78 assists, and is second in the league in scoring with 107 points. 
</P>
<P>
That would be a season worth talking about for most players. 
</P>
<P>
But when you have set almost every major NHL record, have won the Hart Trophy 
as the league's most valuable player nine times, have been on four Stanley Cup 
champions, and have signed a $30-million contract, the standards are a bit 
different. 
</P>
<P>
After Monday's performance, columnist Mark Harding wrote in the Toronto Star: 
"Until now, the dispatches from NHL boroughs across North America have been 
nothing more than hearsay. From near and far came bulletins that Wayne Gretzky, 
the Great One, No. 99, was tired, that his game wasn't up to snuff. That he was 
listless, unenthused . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It was all a bit much to believe. The Great One tired, not putting out 100%? 
Inconceivable. In a slump? When pigs fly, perhaps." 
</P>
<P>
After watching Gretzky, Harding went on to write: "He looked, dare we say it, 
human. An ordinary superstar." 
</P>
<P>
Voted the Player of the Decade in the 1980s, Gretzky has had a rough start in 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
His troubles began at the All-Star game in Pittsburgh last month when he missed 
an optional practice on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"The Great One became the Invisible One. . . . So much for his pristine image," 
wrote a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Another reporter suggested that Gretzky must have been watching Saturday 
morning cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess if you don't go to practice in the morning," Gretzky responded, "it's 
a sin. I had more trouble missing a practice than I ever had playing." 
</P>
<P>
His troubles continued in the All-Star game as he went pointless while his 
growing rival for the national spotlight, Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh 
Penguins, scored four goals. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who once scored four goals himself in an All-Star game, was 
good-natured when asked about his Pittsburgh performance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one game," he said. "It's not going to make or break my career. When I 
retire, they are not going to say, yes, he had a good career, but he had a 
rough night in Pittsburgh one time." 
</P>
<P>
But Gretzky admitted he was worn out, both physically and emotionally, the 
latter because of the trade of his closest friend on the team, Bernie Nicholls, 
during the All-Star weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's troubles have continued and have paralleled a troubled period for his 
club. Since Jan. 1, the Kings are 5-11-2 and have fallen into fourth place in 
the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
"When Wayne Gretzky has troubles, it's headlines across Canada and the United 
States," Gretzky said. "Sure, I went through a streak where I didn't feel 100%. 
I go through it every year. But because we're losing, it's magnified. That goes 
with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
Even one of Gretzky's hallowed records seems about to fall. Lemieux has scored 
at least one point in 46 straight games, threatening Gretzky's mark of 51. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has had a problem in Los Angeles finding a right wing to complement him 
as well as Jari Kurri did with the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
The last man to try, Mikko Makela, wound up on the bench Monday night. But 
Gretzky is hopeful that Tomas Sandstrom, obtained in the Nicholls trade with 
the New York Rangers, may be the one. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like we've tried everyone there," Gretzky said. "It's not easy to 
play with Wayne Gretzky. People get nervous playing with me. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomas is not nervous. He can play. He's an All-Star. Now teams just can't 
focus on me any more. They can't pound me night after night. Maybe (Tomas) 
doesn't want the pressure, but he's going to take it." 
</P>
<P>
One solution to ease Gretzky's burden has been to go with four lines instead of 
three, and with three lines instead of two on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
But that really hasn't meant significantly less ice time for Gretzky. For 
example, in the Kings' previous game against Toronto, with three lines going, 
Gretzky played 28 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, with four lines, he played 26 minutes 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Cap Raeder, one of the assistant coaches running the Kings while Tom Webster is 
home with an ear injury, thinks any talk of Gretzky's game declining is 
ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
"He's only human," said Rader of Gretzky's recent slump. "Maybe it is (a slump) 
for someone like him. But I don't look at it as any big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, Gretzky took personal responsibility for his team's losing 
streak, but Raeder doesn't buy that, either. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at it as all 20 guys playing together," Raeder said, "and every one of 
them, along with the coaches, are to blame when we don't do well." 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
When you're called the Great One, you're not just one of 20. 
</P>
<P>
No one -- not Tyson, not Gretzky -- can be great all the time. 
</P>
<P>
But having reached a level of perfection as they did, anything less becomes 
failure.

COGHLAN IS CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eamonn Coghlan, once acknowledged as the Chairman of the Boards, has passed his 
gavel to countryman Marcus O'Sullivan and Britain's Peter Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, in particular, is the premier indoor miler now, thanks to his 
impressive victory in the Meadowlands Invitational last Friday in East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Obliged for the most part to set his own pace, Elliott was shooting for 
Coghlan's world indoor record of 3:49.78. 
</P>
<P>
He had to settle, though, for a time of 3:52.02, making him the fifth-fastest 
runner of all time in the indoor mile, and missed an opportunity for a $100,000 
bonus by failing to break Coghlan's record. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott will compete against a field that includes O'Sullivan, Steve Scott and 
Joe Falcon Friday night in the Times/Eagle Indoor Games at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
With Scott, now 33, apparently on the downside of a productive career, the best 
middle-distance runners are from Great Britain, Ireland, Africa, Morocco and 
other parts of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't an American 1,500-meter runner ranked in Track &amp; Field News' 
top 10 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to assess the comparative dropout on the world scene of American 
middle-distance runners, Coghlan said: 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a poster of Magic Johnson with a measuring tape alongside of it so 
little kids can look up to this big basketball player. That's what's needed in 
this country, hero worship. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have kids who look up to track and field athletes. That's what we 
have in Ireland, Great Britain and Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Professional football, basketball and baseball dominate American sports 
sections and television coverage. Track doesn't get the same exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"Track is on TV in Europe, Britain and Ireland and it's well promoted," Coghlan 
said. "You put the top five milers in the world walking down a street in Dublin 
and everybody knows who they are. You put the top five milers walking down 
Fifth Avenue in New York and people wouldn't know who they are. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids race around the street, playing track and field, in Ireland. It's like 
kids playing pickup basketball here." 
</P>
<P>
Coghlan added that American youngsters need a role model, someone, perhaps, 
like the late Steve Prefontaine, who was exciting and had a lot of charisma. 
</P>
<P>
Said O'Sullivan: "To be the best in your hometown you may have to be the best 
in the world. To win, you have to beat a Seb Coe, or Steve Ovett. Track and 
field is big in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it can be exploited in the U.S. in terms of getting people interested 
in it. Unfortunately, that hasn't materialized. It all goes back to the fact 
that you have great football and baseball players." 
</P>
<P>
O'Sullivan, a two-time world indoor 1,500-meter champion, who has been dominant 
on the boards in recent years, says he isn't in peak condition for the U.S. 
indoor circuit. 
</P>
<P>
He was six seconds behind Elliott at the Meadowlands. However, he has another 
priority this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in the same form as in the past," O'Sullivan said. "But, like in 
anything, you don't want to look back and say that you didn't give it your best 
shot at something. I think my best shot the next three years is the outdoor 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had three or four years of tremendous indoor running, which I'm very 
thankful for. If (not winning) is the price I have to pay for outdoors, it's a 
small price to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day it's what medals you have. I've obtained gold medals in 
the world indoor championships in 1987 and 1989, and, at the same time, I'd 
like to add to my outdoor running." 
</P>
<P>
Coghlan, who said that at 37 he is probably in his final season, attended a 
track luncheon Tuesday along with Elliott, O'Sullivan and Romania's Doina 
Melinte. 
</P>
<P>
Melinte broke her own women's indoor mile record at the Meadowlands with a time 
of 4:17.13. She also set a 1,500 record of 4:00.27, which she didn't learn 
until 15 minutes before the luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
More significant, she was rewarded with $100,000 for breaking it. 
</P>
<P>
As for what she'll do with the money, she said: "I'm going to keep the money in 
an American bank, with a branch in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Melinte, 33, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist in the 800 and silver medalist in 
the 1,500, will run the 800 Friday night.

DOUGLAS MOVES PART OF MD-80 WORK TO UTAH; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: NO JOBS WILL BE LOST IN LONG BEACH. THE PAYROLL IN SALT LAKE CITY 
WILL RISE TO 800. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
McDonnell Douglas announced Tuesday that it will move a portion of its MD-80 
jetliner production from its Douglas Aircraft plant in Long Beach to a facility 
in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer will not reduce the number of jobs at Long Beach, the company 
said, owing to growth in a number of aircraft programs at the Long Beach unit. 
But the move will increase jobs at the Salt Lake City plant to about 800 from 
the current 300, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The production to be transferred involves the assembly of upper and lower 
fuselage sections for the MD-80, a twin-engine passenger jetliner that -- along 
with its predecessor, the DC-9 -- has been the mainstay of Douglas' production 
since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is part of a new Douglas policy, disclosed last month, in which 
the firm plans to divest assets and transfer operations from Long Beach in an 
effort to focus more closely on final assembly of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The MD-80 will be the first commercial aircraft work to be transferred out of 
Long Beach, but last year the company announced the move of the Navy T-45 
trainer jet program, involving 1,800 jobs, to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"This will allow us to reassign skilled assemblers and support personnel into 
other areas of final assembly operation in Long Beach," Buzz Lowry, general 
manager for MD-80 production, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"By moving these two operations to Salt Lake City, we are freeing up 
tremendously skilled groups of employees who not only will be available to 
strengthen our final assembly work, but also to help train the employees hired 
in Salt Lake City," Lowry added. 
</P>
<P>
A Douglas spokesman said Tuesday that the company will begin sending MD-80 
tools to Salt Lake City at the end of this month and will build some new 
production tools there. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the transfers of work, Douglas plans to add 300 jobs in Long Beach this 
year, resulting from stepped-up production activities on its MD-11 jetliner 
program and its Air Force C-17 cargo jet program. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas employs 38,000 workers at its Long Beach facility, 5,000 in Torrance 
and 7,000 in other locations, including a large plant in Canada that makes 
wings for the MD-80. At its low point in the early 1980s, Douglas had about 
14,000 employees, of which 12,000 worked in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas' 194,430-square-foot plant east of the Salt Lake City airport was 
opened in September, 1987, and began making smaller sub-assemblies for the 
MD-80 and MD-11 commercial transports. 
</P>
<P>
"We have already begun hiring qualified structural assemblers in anticipation 
of the upper and lower fuselage work coming here," Al Egbert, general manager 
of the Salt Lake City facility, said in a statement Tuesday.

IBM ANNOUNCES MEMORY CHIP BREAKTHROUGH; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: THE COMPANY BECOMES THE FIRST TO BEGIN PILOT PRODUCTION OF A 
16-MILLION-BIT COMPUTER CHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
International Business Machines on Tuesday became the world's first company to 
announce pilot production of a 16-million-bit computer memory chip, a device 
with four times the capacity of today's most advanced chips. 
</P>
<P>
IBM, the world's largest manufacturer and consumer of memory chips, said it 
would be at least 18 months to 24 months before this new generation of dynamic 
random access memory chips (DRAMs) would be included in its computers. IBM uses 
all the memory chips it produces in its own machines and does not sell any to 
other computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that while other American and Japanese semiconductor 
manufacturers are developing similar DRAMs, IBM's early announcement 
underscores its intention to publicize its technical accomplishments, 
particularly those coming at the expense of the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates how much pressure IBM is under to show that its technical 
powers are still in place," said Dan Hutchinson, president of VLSI Research, a 
San Jose semiconductor market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The announcement answers the question of whether a Japanese company would 
actually beat IBM for the first time ever with a new generation DRAM," 
Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hutchinson, IBM's edge in developing new generations of memory 
chips has been steadily slipping since 1975, when it had a lead of about six 
years. Hutchinson estimated that IBM is currently about six to 12 months ahead 
of Toshiba, the leading Japanese chip maker, in developing the 16-megabit DRAM. 
A 16-million-bit memory chip can store the equivalent of about 1,600 pages of 
double-spaced, typewritten text. 
</P>
<P>
IBM is currently shipping machines, ranging from top-of-the-line mainframes to 
desktop personal computers, equipped with 4-megabit DRAMs. These chips are also 
made by other semiconductor makers worldwide and will be the leading edge 
models until the 16-megabit devices, measuring about one-third inch by 
three-fourths inch, are in widespread use in about 18 months. 
</P>

Last month, IBM announced that it had entered into a joint venture with Siemens 
AG of West Germany to develop a 64-million-bit chip, which would be the next 
generation of DRAMs after the 16-megabit model. Because of the way chips are 
constructed, advances usually take place in intervals of four times greater 
capacity than the previous generation.

Revenue Decline: Microsemi Corp., based in Santa Ana, reported a net loss of 
$630,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 1990, the result of significantly 
lower operating income in its semiconductor group and operating losses within 
the microelectronics assemblies group. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the company posted net income of $857,000 for the first quarter, 
which included a gain of $570,000 from the repurchase of the company's 
convertible debentures. Revenue dropped 17%, to $19.4 million from $23.3 
million for the first quarter of fiscal 1989. Microsemi said that $4 million of 
the revenue decline was attributable to businesses either disposed of or 
targeted for disposition.

A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications. 
</P>
<P>
Inn Style: The operators of inns and small hotels are using gadgetry from the 
home and office to increase business. Some offer videotape rentals through gift 
shops, front desks or vending machines, with outside contractors providing the 
videocassette recorders and keeping tapes up to date. The arrangement frees 
guests from the viewing schedules of cable television and pay-per-view movies 
and, incidentally, threatens Spectradyne Inc.'s hold on the captive hotel 
audience. For the business traveler, such amenities as fax machines, 
photocopying and computer hookups are being offered by inns bent on competing 
with the upscale chains. In a recent survey by Business Travel News, the 
economy hotel with the highest rating among business travelers was Hampton Inn, 
with Fairfield and Comfort Inns running second and third. Philadelphia 
Inquirer, Business Travel News

Power Pinch: U.S. utilities seem to find themselves between a rock and a hard 
place. Environmental regulations have slowed the construction of new power 
plants, with many utilities running close to full capacity. At a national 
conference of utilities executives, the chairman of Chicago's Commonwealth 
Edison said new plants are needed to avoid blackouts similar to those 
experienced in central Florida in December. Yet more stringent acid rain 
legislation could prove expensive to utilities in the North and East, forcing 
them to hike rates to consumers. Under these circumstances, it is unlikely that 
consumers would be happy about paying even more for new construction. The 
outcome of debate over the federal Clean Air Act will determine the fate of 
consumers' bills as well as the future of plant construction. St. Petersburg 
(Fla.) Times, Des Moines (Iowa) Register

Too Little Snow: Mild weather in the Midwest may give farmers a chance to do 
outside repairs, but it is also likely to hurt harvests in Minnesota and 
Wisconsin, where the soil is as dry as has ever been recorded. Some of the 
aftereffects may be fewer fish, weakened forests and higher prices for 
livestock feed. Unless that part of the country gets some last-minute snow or a 
very wet spring, everyone from farm equipment dealers to nature lovers will 
suffer. St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press Dispatch

52-Week T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $9.6 billion of the 
bills at an average discount rate of 7.42%, up from 7.21% at the last auction 
on Jan. 11. The rates were the highest since Sept. 21, 1989, when the one-year 
bills sold for 7.61%. The new discount rate understates the actual return to 
investors -- 7.97% with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,249.80.

VONS PRESIDENT DAVILA TO RETIRE IN '92; ECK TO JOIN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vons Cos. President William S. Davila, who is featured in the supermarket 
company's television commercials, has revealed plans to take early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his duties will be assumed by a new vice chairman hired away from a 
rival company. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis K. Eck, vice chairman at American Stores, which owns Alpha-Beta and 
Lucky's supermarkets, will join Vons as part of a newly created, three-man 
office of the chief executive that will be headed by current Chairman Roger E. 
Strangeland. 
</P>
<P>
The office will include Davila, who will retire in April, 1992. Davila, whose 
duties as chief operating officer will be assumed by Eck, will oversee Vons' 
internal growth, retail development and all marketing and advertising 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Eck nor Davila was available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Davila, 58, joined the company in 1948 and worked his way up from sweeping 
floors. He was named president in 1984. A company spokesman said Davila's 
decision to retire was believed to be triggered by his desire to perform more 
community work. 
</P>
<P>
After his retirement, Davila will retain his seat on Vons' board and remain the 
company's media spokesman indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Eck, 47, who served on American's board and as chairman of its American Food 
and Drug subsidiary, will oversee retail operations, merchandising, procurement 
and support services as chief operating officer for the 328-store chain. 
Besides Vons, the El Monte-based company also operates Pavilions, Pavilions 
Place and Tianguis markets. 
</P>
<P>
The management changes set the stage for a line of new top management, says 
Sarah Stack, who follows the supermarket industry for the brokerage firm 
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts in place what appears to be a plan for a succession," said Stack.

AT&amp;T TO OFFER NEW TRANSLATION SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph today will unveil a new nationwide telephone 
translation service designed to help institutions communicate with callers who 
do not speak English. 
</P>
<P>
The new service will be offered to businesses, public utilities, institutions 
and providers of emergency services, according to an AT&amp;T statement. 
</P>
<P>
Subscribers would be provided quick access by phone to someone who can 
translate a call received from a speaker of a foreign language. AT&amp;T is 
expected to announce that Spanish and some Asian languages -- Japanese and 
Chinese, for example -- will be among those translated. 
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications giant is expected to release further details at press 
conferences today in San Francisco and New York City. Officially, AT&amp;T 
would not name the organization providing the translation operations nor 
disclose how subscribers would be charged or which languages would be 
translated. Sources at the company said AT&amp;T has established a new division 
to operate the service. 
</P>
<P>
The new service is not related to a translation service established about two 
years ago for Spanish-speaking residential AT&amp;T customers. GEORGE WHITE

DOW BEATS BACK EARLY LOSSES TO ADVANCE 4.96

Stock prices closed mixed on Tuesday despite expectations of a bankruptcy 
filing by the parent of the once-powerful Wall Street firm of Drexel Burnham 
Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks opened lower after the federal government announced robust retail sales 
figures for January and then took a sharp dive after Drexel Burnham Lambert 
Group Inc. said it would seek protection under Chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel said Tuesday that it had defaulted on about $100 million in loans and 
that a lack of cash threatened other defaults. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for blue chip stocks began to come back slowly as the market digested 
both developments. However, analysts, who said traders remained in a negative 
mood, predicted that the market would turn downward within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 4.96 to 2,624.10 after falling more 
than 26 points earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
The broader market lagged the industrials. Declining issues outnumbered 
advancing issues in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed 
stocks, with 675 up, 804 down and 489 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume rose to 144.44 million shares, up from Monday's 118.39 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The Drexel announcement came as only a small surprise to Wall Street, which had 
been aware of the investment firm's problems. But the news cast a pall over 
trading as ticker services reported Drexel developments throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred E. Goldman, an analyst with A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis, said 
during more positive times, Drexel's problems would likely not have affected 
the market. But against a backdrop of economic uncertainty and the market's 
recent losses, traders "will focus on obvious negatives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors were concerned that the rest of the securities industry 
would be hit by fallout from a Drexel Chapter 11 filing. 
</P>
<P>
After the Commerce Department's report that retail sales climbed 1.6% in 
January, Wall Street repeated what has become a familiar process in the 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
The figures were first interpreted as a show of economic strength, and traders 
sold the market lower, fearing that the Federal Reserve would now be unlikely 
to relax credit and allow interest rates to fall. 
</P>
<P>
On closer inspection, many traders decided that the surge might be a one-time 
event. Big-name stocks like IBM came back, but the overall market remained 
cautious. 
</P>
<P>
IBM was one of the day's few big winners, picking up 2 1/8 to close at 103 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler was off 1/4 to 16 3/8 after announcing its fourth-quarter results, and 
as expected, said it was selling its Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. for $825 
million to a partnership of Gulfstream Chairman Allen E. Paulson and the 
investment firm Forstmann, Little &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks lost ground, closing with modest losses after buyers all but 
disappeared from the market and the day's volume fell to the lowest level in 35 
years. The 225-share Nikkei index dropped 181.11 points to 37,107.03, adding to 
its 228.10-point fall Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Volume was an abysmal 300 million shares, compared to 350 million Friday. It 
was its thinnest since May 28, 1955, when turnover was 220 million shares, 
according to a Tokyo Stock Exchange official. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks finished slightly higher on London's Stock Exchange after an erratic 
session marked by thin volume. At London's close, the Financial Times 100-share 
index was up 6.3 points at 2,293.2. 
</P>

Drexel News Gives Bond Prices a Boost 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets, government bond prices rose as concern about Drexel's 
financial woes dominated trading activity and helped boost U.S. Treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
The key 30-year bond rose 17/32 point, or about $5.30 for every $1,000 in face 
value. Its yield, which falls when the price rises, sank to 8.38% from 8.43% 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices slid early in the day after a government report that showed retail 
sales climbed 1.6% in January, the steepest increase in more than a year. The 
report briefly raised inflation fears and concern that interest rates could go 
higher, which would depress bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
However, excluding the automobile sector, the sales gains were not significant, 
analysts said, and investors turned their attention to problems in the 
securities industry and the junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasuries benefited from what credit market analysts said was a return to 
the safe haven of government securities. 
</P>
<P>
"We have somewhat of a flight to quality because of the Drexel news," said Jay 
Goldinger, a principal at the investment firm Capital Insight in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel also said its huge inventory of government securities, believed to be 
valued at about $1 billion, would be liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.188%, unchanged from late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Advances on Technical Factors 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was mostly higher in quiet trading, although the prospect of 
Drexel's parent filing for federal bankruptcy protection eroded some of its 
earlier gains. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said technical factors were largely responsible for pushing 
the dollar higher. But they said the announcement from Drexel that it planned 
to file for Chapter 11 depressed the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Linda McLaughlin, a trader with Chemical New York Capital Markets Group, said 
the market was concerned that a Drexel filing would force the Federal Reserve 
to provide more liquidity in the market, thereby lowering interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates tend to depress a currency's value. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices declined after a mixed performance overseas. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled 
at $417.60 an ounce, down $1.60 from late Monday. Republic National Bank in New 
York quoted a late bid for gold at $417.50 an ounce, off $1.20. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Copper Futures Soar to Four-Week High 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures prices surged on New York's Commodity Exchange in reaction to 
the stock market's resilience amid reports that Drexel's parent will file for 
federal bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
On other major commodity markets, precious metals were mixed; sugar futures 
tumbled; energy futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were mostly lower, and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures settled 3.0 to 4.55 cents higher in New York, with the contract 
for delivery in February at $1.0545 a pound, its highest level in about four 
weeks.

MATTEL'S 1989 PROFIT ALMOST DOUBLES; 4TH QUARTER SLIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Barbie, He-Man and Hot Wheels racing cars led giant toy maker Mattel Inc. to 
income of almost $70 million in 1989, although a one-time charge of $11 million 
cut into the fourth quarter, Mattel's chairman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne-based company reported 1989 earnings of $68.7 million, almost 
double the $35.9 million reported in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However, the $9.7 million in earnings during the fourth quarter dropped from 
$10.5 million reported in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Mattel called for redemption of a subordinated debt, which 
resulted in a one-time charge of $11 million to 1989 earnings. The redemption 
will result in annual interest savings in 1990 of $8.8 million, said Johm W. 
Amerman, Mattel's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Amerman said the company's long-established products, its presence in the 
international market and its manufacturing networks contributed to increased 
sales for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Amerman said its 30-year-old legend, Barbie doll, and He-Man, Hot Wheels racing 
cars, Disney toys and Li'l Miss Dolls "are our core business products that 
endure over the years."

The mood was glum and even angry Tuesday at the New York headquarters of the 
investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, as workers prepared resumes and 
waited for their employer to file for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it's over for us," said one of Drexel's 5,300 employees. "We 
were told yesterday (Monday): 'Look for a job.' " 
</P>
<P>
The brokerage firm, which virtually invented the junk bond market, said Tuesday 
morning that a cash shortage affecting its holding company, Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Group, had resulted in defaults on about $100 million in loans. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's parent, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., announced late Tuesday that 
it would seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code. On Monday, Drexel put itself up for sale in an effort to avoid 
a financial collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of long faces up there, a lot of nervous people," said Drexel 
worker Brian Lynskey. "A lot of people are getting their resumes together -- 
just in case." 
</P>
<P>
"The death knell has sounded for the large, unmanageable, unwieldly 
multiservice investment banking firms," said Steven Seiden of Seiden 
Associates, an executive search firm. He said he expects to see the emergence 
of more small investment banking partnerships of 20 to 30 people. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I find a new job," said one Drexel equities analyst. "As far as I can 
tell, Drexel is on its way out of business, and this is a tough market to find 
work in. I assume most of us will be out of work a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Disappointment and anger also were evident. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people stayed with the firm through thick and thin," said one former 
Drexel official. "They were extremely loyal and their management never came 
clean. Now they're going to get screwed. It's like the old saying, 'If you want 
a friend on Wall Street, buy yourself a dog.' " 
</P>
<P>
Police officers prevented unauthorized entry to Drexel's headquarters at 60 
Broad St., and most people leaving the building in the Wall Street financial 
district deflected questions fired from a phalanx of reporters and television 
cameramen lining the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
While several brokerage house officials declined to comment on Drexel's woes, 
some lower-echelon Wall Streeters offered little sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"Drexel didn't make any friends on the way up, so there aren't too many tears 
on the way down," said one trader. "They were such an arrogant firm. They did 
their own thing and they made their own money. They just took care of their own 
and didn't let anybody into their deals."

SOUTH COAST PLAZA REVAMPS ITS RETAILERS 
</P>

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The general manager of South Coast Plaza likes to remember how you could look 
down one of the mall's busy corridors 18 years ago and see only one store -- 
the Magic Pan -- open for business. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a bit of an economic problem, and were extraordinarily grateful to 
have stores like Lynn's Hallmark" open their doors, said Jim Henwood, the 
mall's manager. 
</P>
<P>
But that was then, and this is now. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Lynn's Hallmark is out -- along with Century Stationers, the Pottery 
Barn, New Times, Lee's Fireplace Shop, and Chandler's Shoes. And Chanel, The 
Lenox China Store, Charles Jourdan and FAO Schwarz are in. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old super-regional mall has just announced a long-range plan that 
will add more glitzy, Rodeo Drive-style retailers, while scratching out some of 
the smaller, less profitable names from its directory. The changes involve the 
original South Coast Plaza, the Crystal Court annex and even South Coast 
Village, across Sunflower Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 150,000 square feet of South Coast's 2.6 million square feet of retail 
space will be involved in an interior remodeling and store shuffling, the most 
extensive face-lift in the mall's history (excluding major expansions that 
added department stores). 
</P>
<P>
It's not that South Coast Plaza is indifferent toward its older tenants, 
Henwood said. "We care a lot about our retailers here," he said. "But times 
pass . . . and this is an evolving story." 
</P>
<P>
If the Costa Mesa mall evolves as its developers plan, South Coast Plaza will 
be the first center in America to break the $1 billion mark in retail sales 
sometime this decade, Henwood said. 
</P>
<P>
His prediction is based on numbers like South Coast's sales-per-square foot, a 
standard barometer of retail performance. For the year ended Jan. 31, the mall 
recorded $720 million in sales, or $420 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
That means that South Coast's sales are more than double the median figure of 
about $195 per square foot among the nation's largest super-regional malls, 
according to the Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit research group based in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't doubt that South Coast is one of the best performers in the 
country," said Michael Beyard, director of commercial development research for 
the Urban Land Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Why the face-lift? A rule of thumb in the retail industry is that malls and 
merchants must constantly update their look to keep customers coming back. 
Retail executives estimate that a remodeling can boost sales anywhere from 10% 
to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
So it is not uncommon for malls to toss out stores that are not meeting sales 
expectations and replace them with retailers that offer better sales prospects. 
</P>
<P>
The latest remodeling at South Coast does not affect the walkways, hallways and 
common areas such as fountains or the carousel area. Instead, retailers 
themselves are sparing no expense with catchy interiors to help bring business 
their way. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers such as Wet Seal are adding special touches. The junior women's 
apparel store is remodeling and tripling its size, adding a wall of 16 
video-screens, TV monitors, and concrete boulder sound stages with stage 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the major remodeling plans in the works at the mega-mall: 
</P>
<P>
* To make way for the Chanel store in early fall, three retailers are moving. 
First, Bally of Switzerland, the men's and women's shoes and accessories store, 
will relocate to a choice spot in Jewel Court, opposite Bullock's. Naturalizer 
Shoes has been moved near the May Co. on the second level. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal &amp; Truitt, now located next to Bally, is doubling the size of its 
store and moving its men's accessories to a spot opposite the Magic Pan, 
between the Jewel Court and Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
And Charles Jourdan is moving upstairs opposite the new Barneys New York, the 
men's and women's clothier that is expected to open its first California store 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The Limited, now located between the Limited Express and Victoria's Secret, 
will nearly double its size by taking over the space of its two neighbors. 
Victoria's Secret, in turn, is moving into a second-level store that is three 
times its current size. And the Limited Express is moving into the former 
Alcott &amp; Andrews spot at Crystal Court. 
</P>
<P>
* Laura Ashley Home, a home furnishings store, is scheduled to open in early 
May, taking about half of the space now leased by Snowden-Mize Sportswear, 
which is being renamed Mize Sport. That will put Laura Ashley Home right next 
to the original Laura Ashley and just a short stroll away from Laura Ashley 
Mother &amp; Child. 
</P>
<P>
* In addition, FAO Schwarz, the toy store, this spring plans to open a new 
store in the Carousel Court. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, across Bear Street at Crystal Court, the two-level Limited Express 
should open its doors in May and A Pea in the Pond maternity store moves into a 
larger store in April. 
</P>
<P>
And at South Coast Village, H.G. Daniels, the art supply retailer, opens in 
March, joined in April by Dominion Saddlery. 
</P>
<P>
And the nearly deserted Mercantile Building could soon have a tenant. 
</P>

BUSH AGAIN: Last April, President Bush spoke at a former drug dealers' 
confiscated hideaway (B5) in Orange County -- a coup for Sheriff Brad Gates. . 
. . Now, Bush may be coming to talk about drugs again, with Gates again a 
factor. . . . Bush's trip will be paid for by the Drug Use Is Life Abuse 
foundation -- a Gates project and spinoff of his Citizens Advisory Council. . . 
. For this visit, which could come in a couple of weeks, presidential advance 
men have checked out several Santa Ana-area schools. Dana Parsons

RAM ATTACK: Fresh from their successful 1989 season, the Rams are starting 
earlier than ever to drum up season-ticket support with a radio and newspaper 
ad blitz. . . . "We thought we'd remind fans we do have season tickets," said a 
spokesman. Last season, the Rams topped off at 49,000 season ticket holders in 
a stadium holding 69,000. . . . The team hasn't sold out every game since 1981. 
. . . Still, the Times Poll, above, shows people here follow the Rams more 
closely than any other pro team.

MAULED: South Coast Plaza is saying bye-bye to some of its less prestigious

recently completed mall survey showed that the average annual household income 
of the South Coast shopper is $62,000. Dana Parsons

SOS MOVE NOW MAKING WAVES IN NEWPORT BEACH

Share Our Selves, the charity forced to relocate to an industrial area at the 
edge of Costa Mesa because of protests from residents of that town, now faces a 
campaign launched by Newport Beach residents to keep the organization away from 
their city border. 
</P>
<P>
"Already it's starting -- from Newport," said Jean Forbath, founder and 
executive director of the 20-year-old organization. "Oh, God, we knew we were 
going to have people from Costa Mesa screaming, and now we're going to have 
people from Newport Beach screaming." 
</P>
<P>
Some west Newport residents who live near the Newport Beach-Costa Mesa border 
say they have gathered 90 signatures in hopes of blocking the move. The 
protesters say SOS will bring crime to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, generally, we feel that we don't want to inherit Costa Mesa's 
problems," said Pat Shehan, a Newport Beach resident who announced the 
residents' opposition to the Newport Beach City Council on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
SOS, one of Orange County's largest charities, provides food, clothing, medical 
and financial assistance to about 20,000 needy people a month. After Costa Mesa 
residents complained about SOS, the City Council voted to oust the charity from 
its longtime home at the Rea Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy generated an outpouring of support for SOS and contributions 
totaling more than $300,000. The donations made it possible for the charity to 
pay $1.4 million for a 12,000-square foot building in an industrial area of 
Costa Mesa at 1550 Superior Ave. 
</P>
<P>
However, by the time the purchase agreement was signed last month, business 
owners and residents of a nearby mobile home park had already started 
protesting the organization's plans. 
</P>
<P>
Before the move can take place, the Costa Mesa Planning Commission must approve 
the conditional use permit submitted by SOS. That permit will allow the charity 
to operate in an area zoned for light industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission approves the permit, Forbath said she expects the decision to 
be appealed. Should that happen, a final decision on the permit would be made 
by the Costa Mesa City Council, probably in March. 
</P>
<P>
Shehan said she will present her petitions to the Costa Mesa Planning 
Commission hearing and to the City Council, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Shehan, who lives in Park Lido, a 98-unit condominium complex two blocks from 
the charity's new site, said that the "lack of screening" of the thousands of 
people SOS serves each month would reduce property values and increase crime in 
her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Shehan and Priscilla Michaud, who also has been gathering signatures, said SOS 
clients are likely to walk through Park Lido to get to the bus stop at Newport 
Boulevard and Hospital Road. Residents of the complex, many of whom are 
retired, would probably keep police phones ringing with reports of trespassers, 
Michaud said. 
</P>
<P>
But Forbath said such fears are unfounded. Most SOS clients will be coming from 
west and north Costa Mesa, and would be more likely to use 16th and 17th 
streets and Superior Avenue, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just real unfortunate that before we even move there people have made up 
their minds we're going to impact their lives and their neighborhoods," Forbath 
said. "They need to weigh that decision a little more carefully and give us a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Andy Gonis of the Newport Beach Police Department said Tuesday that the 
department anticipates "some problems" based on what occurred in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"If we begin to get calls about littering and loitering . . . it will become a 
police problem to some extent," Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
Shehan, who started the petition drive on Friday, said she will continue to 
solicit support from other condominium owners and small businesses between 
Industrial Way and West Coast Highway in an effort to block the move.

While public outcry has prevented the return of attempted murderer Charles 
David Rothenberg to Orange County, the number of murderers, sex offenders and 
othr criminals paroled to Orange County increased a dramatic 33% last year, 
according to statistics released Tuesday by the state Department of 
Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 1,420 inmates were released last year from state prisons to Orange 
County, where they were put under the immediate supervision of parole officers 
in Anaheim and Santa Ana, statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
That is up from 1,067 inmates released to the county in 1988, according to 
numbers compiled by the department at the request of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic surge of parolees in Orange County is part of a statewide trend 
that experts say is the inevitable consequence of stiffer mandatory prison 
sentences enacted in 1977 as part of the effort to crack down on crime. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of allowing a judge to determine the appropriate punishment, the 
mandatory sentencing laws require automatic prison terms for those convicted of 
such crimes as murder, rape, kidnaping, burglary and drug dealing. The champion 
for this get-tough approach has been Gov. George Deukmejian, who as a 
legislator wrote the "use a gun, go to jail" statutes as well as the state's 
death penalty law. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a rising tide of criminals sent off to state prisons, which 
held a record 87,863 inmates as of Jan. 28, corrections officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But the same laws also call for an inmate to be automatically paroled to his 
home county, a feature that is now triggering a rising tide of parolees back to 
the streets. Inmates are paroled to the county where they have established 
legal residence. 
</P>
<P>
While the vast majority of these automatic paroles are given scant public 
attention, two highly publicized cases created such a furor that state 
corrections officials had to abort their routine of returning the criminals to 
their hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 release of Lawrence Singleton, convicted of raping a San Diego girl 
and then hacking off her forearms, caused such a backlash in San Diego county 
and throughout the state that he had to be paroled to a trailer on state 
grounds at the San Quentin prison for a year. He was finally released 
unconditionally on April 25, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Orange County residents protested the release of Rothenberg, who 
was convicted of attempted murder, arson and other crimes for setting his 
6-year-old son on fire in a Buena Park motel room on March 3, 1983. The 
protests were led by Rothenberg's son, David, who told reporters he never 
wanted to see his father. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg was subsequently released to Northern California, some believe. 
Corrections officials on Tuesday declined to discuss his whereabouts but say he 
is under 24-hour electronic and physical surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Such cases, however, are rare, and Correction Department studies have shown 
that about half of the former inmates wind up back in jail within two years for 
either violating the conditions of their parole or committing another crime. 
</P>
<P>
Considering those findings, the 1989 statistics are bad news for Orange County 
law enforcement, especially since thousands of inmates must be prematurely 
released on the local level from Orange County's central jail as well, said 
Assistant Sheriff Rocky Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
"Finding that the number of state parolees is also increasing alarms all of law 
enforcement," Hewitt said. "It has been our experience in Orange County that 
parolees do have a high recidivism rate." 
</P>
<P>
"This, coupled with the ever-increasing number of county inmates that must be 
released into the community each year due to overcrowding, concerns us a great 
deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's statistics show that, statewide, the number of parolees has increased 
dramatically in the last five years. There were 18,861 criminals paroled in 
California in 1984 contrasted with 37,879 in 1989 -- a 101% increase. The 
increase between 1988 and 1989 was 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of inmates paroled to Orange County has increased a more 
modest 74%, from 814 in 1984 to 1,420 in 1989. Yet the jump in the last year 
was more than double the statewide average. 
</P>
<P>
Among the group released to Orange County in 1989 were double the number of 
first- and second-degree murderers -- eight in 1989 compared to four in 1988; 
20% more robbers; and 64% more drug dealers and users, according to the 
statistics. There were fewer rapists and inmates convicted of first-degree 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County and all other county courts are just committing more and more 
people to prison, and that's what's driving the increasing inmate population 
and their release," said Robert Bowman, regional parole administrator. Bowman's 
office oversees parole offices in Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, 
Imperial and portions of Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the 1989 releases, there are about 18,000 prison parolees living in 
the six-county area, with each parole officer responsible for an average of 55 
inmates, said Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County parolees are required to report to one of three offices in 
Anaheim, located in an industrial complex off Burton Lane and the Riverside 
Freeway, or two offices in Santa Ana, on Main and 17th streets. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said the high-risk parolees are required to contact their parole officer 
with a personal visit or by telephone at least four times a month. In many 
cases, parolees are sent back to prison because routine urine tests show they 
have been using drugs, which is a violation of their parole guidelines.

VALENTINES ARE IN BLOOM AT CEMETERY

Beneath a wall of marble-trimmed graves, on the stone steps of a mortuary, 200 
squealing children Tuesday cut, pasted and crayoned messages of love in Forest 
Lawn Memorial-Park's annual valentine-making contest. 
</P>
<P>
Braving blustery winds and chilly temperatures, the local children worked 
feverishly, oblivious to the looming presence of a three-story mausoleum with 
its rows of brass nameplates. But that was precisely the contest organizers' 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1971 as a way to ease children's fears of cemeteries, the Forest 
Lawn contest has grown into one of the biggest Valentine's Day events in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole purpose was to encourage families and children to enjoy the park 
area so that they don't think of Forest Lawn as a gruesome place," said 
Christine Klima, former director of the Cypress mortuary. "And it was such a 
hit that we kept it up. It got bigger and bigger every year, and now it's just 
teeming with kids." 
</P>
<P>
Klima said the contest for children ages 2 to 12 began with only 20 
participants. On Tuesday, carloads of them arrived for the event. 
</P>
<P>
The children -- wearing an array of holiday colors from crimson to Day-Glo pink 
-- created valentines from construction paper, pipe cleaners, crayons, Cupid 
stickers and lacy, heart-shaped doilies, all supplied by the mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
As the youngsters worked feverishly to complete their projects in the alloted 
25 minutes, none appeared to be disturbed by the unusual surroundings. In fact, 
many of them said they had been to the cemetery before to visit family graves. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandpa is buried here, so I'm used to it," said Christina Jackson, 11, of 
Buena Park. "I think it's a good place. I even gave my valentine to my grandpa 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
Parents watched the scene from a nearby stone ledge as the laughing children 
chased paper decorations scattered by the strong breeze, and took crayons in 
hand to draw crooked-lined hearts which declared their love for mom and dad. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids just think it's a pretty place," said parent Kim White. "It's no big 
deal. We have relatives and friends buried here, and we're going to go to the 
mausoleums when this is done." 
</P>
<P>
A maintenance worker silently surveyed the scene as volunteers judged the 
contest results. In a matter of minutes, the once-spotless stone steps had 
become covered with paper scraps, dropped doilies, broken crayons and globs of 
glue. 
</P>
<P>
Contest judge Ray Thomson, director of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Cypress, 
praised Forest Lawn Memorial-Park and said children from the club have 
participated in the contest since it began. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an appropriate endeavor for them because in the crisis of death, there 
is always a lot of love and close connections, and that's also what Valentine's 
Day is about," Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
Darin Drabing, vice president of the Cypress mortuary, said, "It's a nice way 
to let children be exposed to a cemetery and to make a somewhat frightening 
experience become not so terrible." 
</P>
<P>
White, however, doubted that children were naturally afraid of cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on how the grown-ups act," she said. "The attitude of the 
parents is what can scare their kids."

HOMELESS SUE TO STOP AERIAL MEDFLY SPRAY 
</P>

<P>
Attorneys for the homeless filed suit Tuesday, contending that aerial malathion 
applications have sickened many who have no shelter, but a federal judge 
refused to grant them a court order halting the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Aid Society of Orange County, representing 100 to 150 homeless people 
who live in and around Garden Grove's Pioneer Park, presented declarations from 
13 homeless people who claim they have suffered from dizziness, nausea, 
diarrhea, cramps, chills, blurred vision and other maladies since the state 
sprayed the pesticide over their area on Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the malathion spraying violated the right of the homeless to be 
"free from grave personal injury at the hands of the state," the Legal Aid 
Society sought a temporary restraining order stopping Thursday's scheduled 
spraying of a 36-square-mile area around Garden Grove and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Legal Aid lawyers also demanded that the state give 48-hour notice of malathion 
applications to all homeless people, provide shelter for them during the 
sprayings and offer medical care and laundry services to those inadvertently 
sprayed with the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler refused to make that order, 
saying she had "serious questions" about whether the homeless had the legal 
right to press a civil rights claim against the state itself. She set another 
hearing for Feb. 27 to consider a request for a preliminary injunction. The 
Legal Aid Society will be allowed to make additional arguments during that 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Charles W. Getz represented the only defendant, Henry 
J. Voss, director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture. Getz argued 
that Stotler had no jurisdiction in the case because the state is not a proper 
target for a civil rights claim. That section of the law was intended for use 
against individuals, Getz argued. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Cohen, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Orange County, 
said "logistical" difficulties would probably preclude him from filing an 
emergency appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Stotler's ruling pinned the hopes of malathion opponents on a hearing Thursday 
in Sacramento Superior Court. Attorneys for the cities of Westminster, Garden 
Grove and Huntington Beach plan to ask again for a court order halting the 
pesticide spraying. A judge there has denied that request once already. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents contend that malathion threatens their health, but state officials 
have stood firm in support of the spraying program, saying it poses no hazard 
and that it is critical to preserve the state's $16-billion agriculture 
industry from the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors, reiterating an earlier action, voted 3-2 on 
Tuesday to perpetuate the "state of emergency" it declared in response to the 
Medfly infestation. The largely symbolic move insulates the county from 
malathion-related liability and facilitates state funding for the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Getz said the state is currently investigating ways to protect the homeless 
from the spraying. But Legal Aid officials said they sued because the state 
failed to make commitments to provide such protection. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd just like the state to oblige the homeless in the same way they oblige 
dogs, cats and goldfish," said Legal Aid spokesman Jere Witter. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the homeless are not well served by radio and newspaper 
announcements of malathion sprayings. And posting notices in parks doesn't help 
them because they have nowhere to go, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crystal C. Sims, another Legal Aid lawyer, said a simple solution would be to 
open California National Guard armories for the homeless during malathion 
sprayings. The armories currently serve as their shelter in cold and rainy 
weather, she said. State Sen. Marian Bergesen (R-Newport Beach) wrote to Gov. 
George Deukmejian on Jan. 19 and made that request, but it produced no results, 
Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, Getz argued that the spread of the Medfly could wreak $200 
million in damage on California's agriculture industry. If the pest gains a 
foothold, state officials might have to use a million extra pounds of pesticide 
a week to eradicate it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In court declarations, officials heading the malathion program defended its 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
"The state does not consider any one exposure to the aerial application of 
malathion a health risk," said Dorthea Zadig, deputy director of the Medfly 
Eradication Project. "Indeed, our helicopter pilots have reported seeing 
persons playing golf or engaging in other outdoor activities while the 
applications are occurring." 
</P>
<P>
But Cohen noted that even the state Department of Food and Agriculture advises 
its malathion workers not to enter treated areas until the spray residues are 
dry. And he pointed to the homeless who are suffering ill health. 
</P>
<P>
Several homeless men detailed their symptoms from the spraying in declarations 
obtained by the Legal Aid Society. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Hort, 46, said in his declaration that he had burning eyes and such 
severe cramps they were "like a doubling-over." David Talevich, 19, said he is 
having "bizarre dreams" and severe mood swings. Danny Daniels, 29, said he had 
heart palpitations and diarrhea for three days.

ATTACK PROMPTS CALL FOR STRICTER DOG LAW

<P>
Residents of a Westminster street on which a 6-year-old boy was mauled by two 
Rottweilers asked the City Council on Tuesday night to write an ordinance 
restricting vicious dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Kerley was playing in front of the dog owners' home in the 7000 block 
of 19th Street about two weeks ago when the two Rottweilers escaped from behind 
a six-foot wooden fence and attacked him. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey is now at home recovering from bite wounds to his arms, legs, abdomen, 
back and buttocks, said his father, Noble Kerley. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing much better than I am," said Kerley, a manager at the Long Beach 
Naval Shipyard. "I don't think there is any place in our society for these 
kinds of dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Kerley said his son required 75 stitches but is recovering and "is in good 
spirits." 
</P>
<P>
Photographs of Jeffrey's injuries were circulated to council members, who asked 
the city staff to prepare a report on ways to strengthen the city's dog 
ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
"I was quite unnerved by those photos," said Councilwoman Lyn Gillespie. "Those 
weren't just dog bites. That was a mauling." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said dog owners need to be conscientious about keeping their dogs 
secure and be legally responsible when they are delinquent. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a senseless situation where the dogs weren't secure," said resident 
Don Fuson. "It doesn't make any sense that a 6-year-old boy would be mauled by 
not one, but two dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Ball, who also lives on the block, said he was concerned for the safety 
of his children. "I have little boys, 3 and 5 years old," Ball said. "I'm 
afraid to let them out now. It's tragic that someone would be so irresponsible 
not to secure such vicious dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Anita Huseth agreed that existing ordinances should be 
strengthened. "I think the area that needs to be strengthened most are the 
locks on the gates," Huseth said. "Kids tend to walk up to gates and try them 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer asked that the topic be placed on the agenda at 
the next council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to find out how we can strengthen our ordinances so that there's more 
authority to control the situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kerley said he would not rule out the possibility of filing a lawsuit against 
the dog owners. "That's yet to be determined, but something will happen," he 
said. GREG HERNANDEZ

124-UNIT PROJECT FOR SENIORS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has approved replacing 21 low- to moderate-income housing units in the 
Civic Center area with a 124-unit senior citizen housing project. 
</P>
<P>
The 21 units, which will be demolished, are within the amended Civic Center 
Redevelopment Project Area at the northwest corner of Walker Street and Orange 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Residents were relocated from the site last year. 
</P>
<P>
The senior housing project is proposed for a property known as the Cypress 
Elementary School site on Grindlay Street near Lincoln Avenue. The school site 
is occupied by two senior citizen centers. 
</P>
<P>
The city is planning to build 124 senior housing units, but may revise the 
project depending on the size of the units and the amenities that will be 
included, said Cypress Planning Director Christine Eynon. 
</P>
<P>
A developer for the replacement housing project will be selected this year, and 
construction is expected to start in early 1992. The project will take about a 
year to build.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS MAY FACE PARAMEDICS FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents soon may have to pay a $30 to $45 annual fee for paramedic services, 
the County Fire Department's chief of strategic planning told the City Council 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Witesman said fire officials are seeking the fees to give the 
department an additional source of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that the fees will generate $2.1 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, half of the department's $83-million annual budget comes from the 
Special District Augmentation Fund, which is paid into by residents via 
property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
According to Witesman, the Fire Department takes more out of the fund than 
Orange County residents put in. The department has been asked to find 
alternatives to its overdependence on the fund. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to try to find a means to be able to fund the demand for our 
services," Witesman said. "We're projecting a $77-million deficit by the year 
2000. We're hoping half of that will be made up by the revenue generation 
program, and the rest we'll have to make up by frugality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to City Manager Robert Nelson, the County Fire Department also might 
seek an increase in the fees paid by 14 area cities for the department's 
firefighting services. If approved by the County Board of Supervisors, the rate 
hike could increase Seal Beach's fees from $1.8 million a year to $2.4 million 
by 1991. MICHELLE NICOLOSI

TUSTIN POLICE DECLARE NEGOTIATION IMPASSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Tustin Police Officers Assn. and city officials have scheduled a meeting 
with a state mediator for today to try to reach a contract agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The association has declared an impasse in contract negotiations with the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department, which has 47 officers, has been working without a 
contract since Dec. 31, when the last agreement expired. 
</P>
<P>
Although both sides have agreed to an 8.2% salary increase for the first year 
of a three-year contract, there is disagreement about a police request for a 
modified work plan that would allow officers to work four 10-hour days instead 
of five eight-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
The modified work plan would provide "more time with your family, more time 
away from the stress of your job," said Officer Pat Welch, chairman of the 
police negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager William A. Huston said that the city is willing to have an outside 
consultant study the cost of the new plan but that there is no guarantee the 
plan will be approved. 
</P>
<P>
"It just wouldn't be responsible for the city to go into this blindly," Huston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin Municipal Employees Assn. also proposed alternative work schedules 
in its contract negotiations, and the city will study the idea, Huston said. 
</P>
<P>
Welch said the officers want a guarantee that the city will either do a 
six-month test program or reopen the contract to negotiate additional 
compensation if there is no test program. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the two sides were unable to agree on a contract even after a state 
mediator was called in and the City Council implemented a 3.5% increase 
unilaterally. SHANNON SANDS

EXPANSION OF BRIDGES STIRS HEATED DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 100 residents showed up at the City Council chambers Tuesday night to 
debate June ballot measures involving two pedestrian bridges on Yale Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Two groups of residents have been arguing for several years over the expansion 
of the two bridges, one over the San Diego Freeway and the other over the Santa 
Fe Railroad tracks, to allow allow vehicular traffic. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the City Council tentatively voted to place one measure, the 
Neighborhood Preservation Initiative, on the ballot. A final vote will come at 
its next meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The Yale Initiative, a measure to expand the bridges, has already has been 
placed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Pyle, a member of CAUTION, a residents' group opposed to the expansions, 
told the council Tuesday: "I don't want the citizens of Irvine to either say 
yes or no on a subject they know nothing about. What happens in June will 
affect our neighborhoods and our children, not theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Tkachenko said: "We were told the traffic would go around the community, 
not right through the community. What about the children?" 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was punctuated by several outbursts from angry residents, and 
Councilman Cameron Cosgrove repeatedly asked the crowd to show composure. 
</P>
<P>
One June ballot measure, called the Yale Initiative, would allow the bridges to 
be widened up to four lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The Neighborhood Preservation Plan, which was tentatively placed on the ballot 
Tuesday night, would prevent current and future attempts at similar bridge 
expansions throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Agran, who supports the latter measure, cited potential dangers 
posed by bridges and their expansion. "Bridges are costly, but beyond dollar 
costs, they are an issue of great safety," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, Calling the Neighborhood Preservation 
Initiative "a can of worms," lambasted the mayor for "confusing the voters." 
</P>
<P>
"Mayor Agran has put together this initiative just to confuse voters," she 
said. "Voters could have simply voted to not build the bridges, without this 
new initiative. But what is new in Irvine politics?" JOE BEL BRUNO

About 60 pro-choice demonstrators gathered Tuesday night in front of the office 
of Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) to protest his stand against 
abortion. A counter-demonstration of about 25 anti-abortion marchers led to 
noisy shouting exchanges, but no violence. Dornan's office was closed at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-choice demonstration, which featured a taped message from Ron Kovic, a 
Vietnam War veteran who is considering a possible challenge for Dornan's seat, 
was organized by the Bayview chapter of the National Organization for Women. 
That chapter has about 300 members in Santa Ana, Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, 
Irvine, Laguna Beach, Laguna Hills and Huntington Beach, said Sandra Solomon of 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"This demonstration is to let him (Dornan) know that we oppose his position on 
many things," said Solomon, the NOW chapter's action chairwoman. "He is not 
only a person who opposes choice, but he also has shown very little sympathy 
for those who are homeless and for those who have AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
The anti-abortion demonstrators came from no central organization, said Ralph 
Buglione of Garden Grove. Buglione and others in the anti-abortion group led 
cheers for Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
Buglione said: "Bob Dornan's a good Christian and a good American. I can't say 
the same for Kovic. He came out with a very sarcastic, cynical attitude. He's 
not typical of the American soldier who fought in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Kovic, whose life is portrayed in the current movie, "Born on the Fourth of 
July," has not yet decided whether he will challenge Dornan this year for the 
38th Congressional District seat. 
</P>
<P>
Bhairavi Guss, coordinator of the NOW chapter, said Kovic could not attend the 
rally because he was in West Germany at a film festival. She played a tape 
recording to the crowd that Kovic had made before leaving. In that tape, Kovic 
praised the pro-choice activists and said, "I strongly support the right of 
every woman to choose to have control of her life and destiny here in America. 
There is no turning back from this now." 
</P>
<P>
The pro-choice demonstrators then broke into cheers and applause. 
</P>
<P>
In the background, the anti-abortion marchers booed Kovic's taped statement. 
One anti-abortion marcher carried a sign that said: "Orange County's Best 
Legislator: Bob Dornan."

More than 200 parents, angered over stalled contract talks in the Ocean View 
School District, jammed a meeting of the district's board Tuesday night to 
voice concerns that their children are being ignored while negotiations drag 
on. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, moved from the district board room in Huntington Beach to Westmont 
School because of the overflow crowd, brought to a peak a recent surge in 
activism by parents who say the contract dispute is just the latest in a series 
of problems that has plagued the district for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, parents and teachers used the forum to vent their frustration 
over budget cuts and declining services. Parents reminded the board that four 
of the five members are up for reelection this year. 
</P>
<P>
Parents also criticized the board for failing to speed up contract 
negotiations, and questioned allocations of funds from the state, arguing that 
surrounding districts are receiving similar funding but paying teachers more. 
</P>
<P>
"I ask you to restore to our teachers the level of dignity and respect they 
deserve, so our kids can receive the level of education they deserve," said 
Chuck Emde, a parent. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Alvino, a parent on the advisory board of Marine View Elementary School, 
said parent activism increased after teachers in the district said they would 
not donate time to supervise extracurricular activities until the contract is 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
Contract negotiations are deadlocked over salaries, health benefits, the use of 
state lottery funds earmarked for education and allocation of money from the 
Proposition 98 school-funding initiative approved in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The district has proposed cutting its share of the total contribution to the 
union's health maintenance organization and is offering teachers a 4.3% average 
pay hike. The union is seeking full health benefits and a 9.3% average raise. 
Talks are scheduled to resume Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sports, except for intramural contests during regularly scheduled 
class time, have been brought to a halt by physical education teachers who have 
declined to coach after-school games, and science fairs in six schools are in 
jeopardy because science teachers have refused to help pupils outside of class. 
</P>
<P>
Still, parents said they are sympathetic to the teachers, arguing that such 
actions would not be necessary if the teachers were adequately compensated. 
"The driving force behind the Ocean View School District is the teachers," one 
parent said at the meeting. "They work very hard, and it seems to me that 
they're getting short-changed." 
</P>
<P>
Board members argued that all of the funds available to increase teacher 
salaries have been put on the negotiating table. The board members also 
explained that other state funds carry restrictions that prevent them from 
being used for teacher salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to put as many resources as we have available for things and for 
people in front of the negotiating group," said board member Carolyn Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Elizabeth Spurlock said, "Classrooms should be our No. 1 budget 
priority." She reiterated the board's contention that new sources of funding 
must be developed before Ocean View teachers can be brought up to the 
countywide salary average. 
</P>
<P>
Spurlock urged parents to contact their legislators and ask them to press for 
new laws that would change the school-funding formula. "I would really hope 
that what we see as a turnout of support for teachers and students can also be 
directed to state legislators."

MWD FINDS NEW CHEMICAL SPILL IN YORBA LINDA CREEK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the same day last week when criminal charges were filed against the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California for a toxic spill in a Yorba 
Linda creek, a second spill fouled the same creek. 
</P>
<P>
"It couldn't have been more horrible timing," MWD spokesman Jay Malinowski said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Feb. 6 spill involved a nontoxic substance, but state water quality 
officials say they are investigating to determine if the water district, the 
biggest in Southern California, violated its discharge permit. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical that spilled from the water treatment plant in Yorba Linda was a 
substance known as alum, or aluminum oxide, and is not considered toxic in low 
concentrations, said Kurt Berchtold, a supervising engineer for the state 
Regional Water Quality Control Board in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not something we like to see routinely discharged," Berchtold said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Orange County district attorney's office filed felony charges 
against the district and misdemeanor charges against four top MWD officials for 
the Oct. 26 spill of 466 gallons of caustic soda into Telegraph Canyon Creek. 
</P>
<P>
The district faces a possible $1-million fine, and each of its officers faces a 
$75,000 fine and three years' imprisonment on charges of negligence and 
knowingly disregarding the law. MWD has denied any criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
In the Feb. 6 spill, an estimated 10 gallons of alum sludge spilled into the 
creek after workers poured the sludge into a holding pond for use in the water 
treatment process, said Bob Gomperz, another MWD spokesman. The alum foamed up 
out of the holding pond and into the creek because the pond was dry for the 
first time in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
When water is in the pond, Gomperz explained, the alum reacts to help coagulate 
smaller suspended particles in the water into larger ones that can be more 
easily skimmed off. But since there was no water, Gomperz said, the alum turned 
into white-gray foam in the pond and a strong wind at the time blew it over the 
side. 
</P>
<P>
The spill was not discovered until the next day, Gomperz said, when workers 
discovered the foam coating a 200-foot stretch of the creek, which leads down 
to the Chino Hills State Park. 
</P>
<P>
Gomperz said that while it was not toxic, the alum is not supposed to be 
discharged into the creek. A state official said the MWD is permitted only to 
discharge 6,000 gallons of treated water per day into the creek. 
</P>
<P>
"Only from an aesthetic point of view are we in possible violation of our 
permit," Gomperz said, adding that the foam was quickly mopped up the day it 
was found and that the district promptly notified state water quality 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Nolan said her office is investigating the latest spill. 
</P>
<P>
The October spill occurred, MWD officials said, when a pressure relief valve 
malfunctioned and the caustic soda backed up into an underground drain line 
that discharges into the creek. The spill was not detected until two days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan said her office has documents showing that the MWD had known since at 
least 1984 that caustic soda -- used at the plant to reduce the water acidity 
level -- would overflow into the creek if there was a malfunction of a pressure 
relief valve. The soda, which consists of sodium hydroxide, burns the skin on 
contact.

Edison High School sent a message to the would-be tacticians remaining in the 
Southern Section 4-AA playoffs -- bring on those gimmick defenses. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, a team that has pounded the ball inside throughout the season, 
demonstrated that their outside game is just fine, thank you. They dismantled 
Woodbridge's triangle-and-two defense for a 70-53 victory in a first-round game 
at Edison Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"To do well in the playoffs, you're going to need good outside shooting," 
Edison Coach Jon Bochert said. "That's the only way you can keep other teams 
from packing it in on defense." 
</P>
<P>
Which is just what Woodbridge Coach Bill Shannon had in mind Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors played man-to-man on 6-foot-10 center Bill Martineau and 6-4 
forward Brandon Jessie, while the rest of the team played zone. 
</P>
<P>
"Edison had made only 12 three-point field goals all season," Shannon said. "We 
wanted to make them shoot the threes." 
</P>
<P>
Guards Dan Lovelady and Tom Smyser obliged, although not to Shannon's liking. 
</P>
<P>
Lovelady, who had made seven three-pointers all season, made three and finished 
with 12 points. Smyser came off the bench and made four of five shots, 
including three three-pointers, and finished with 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers started strong, making their first five shots. Lovelady made two 
of his three-point field goals in the first three minutes, which brought the 
Warriors out of their defense. 
</P>
<P>
But, by then, the Chargers (17-9) had a 18-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The were giving us any outside shot we wanted to take," Bochert said. "We just 
took what they gave us." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge (13-13) made a game of it in the second quarter. Led by guard Toby 
Ramos (18 points), the Warriors closed to within 21-18. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers got into foul trouble in the second quarter, which almost cost 
them. Edison had four starters with three fouls by halftime, including its 
entire starting front line of Martineau, Jessie and Steve Thobe. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors (13-13) were able to go inside and stayed close until 3 minutes 15 
seconds left in the half. However, Jessie scored five points in a two-minute 
span before going to the bench with his third foul. 
</P>
<P>
That helped push the Edison lead to 37-26 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little inconsistent in the first half," Bochert said. "A lot of that 
had to do with the our foul problems. But there were times out there tonight 
when we played very, very well." 
</P>
<P>
With the Woodbridge defense extended, Jessie (17 points) and Martineau (12 
points) dominated inside. Jessie scored 10 points in the second half and 
Martineau nine.

BREA'S MOVE SOLVES BIG PROBLEM . . . FOR SOME OPPONENTS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last season, many Southern Section 3-A girls' basketball coaches were shaking 
their heads in despair, wondering what it would take to beat Brea-Olinda High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
This season, nearly half of those coaches are smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda, the defending state Division III champion, has moved from 3-A to 
3-AA. The Southern Section expanded the division to accommodate more teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God they're in 3-AA," Rancho Alamitos Coach Bob Becker said. "I think 
everyone in the 3-A Division feels that way." 
</P>
<P>
For those who moved up into 3-AA with Brea? 
</P>
<P>
Oh well. 
</P>
<P>
Brea, 26-0 this season, the 3-AA's top-seeded team and defending 3-A champion, 
is as strong as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Aimee McDaniel, a preseason All-American, averages 16.4 points and 
runs the floor as well as any player in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Three other Brea players average in double figures -- Jinelle Williams (15.5), 
Tammy Blackburn (15.2) and Jody Anton (11.2). The team averages 84 points a 
game and holds its opponents to an average of 32.6. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, and the fact that Brea is the top-ranked team in the State 
Division III, Coach Mark Trakh continues to downplay the chances of his team, 
which after a first-round bye, opens against the winner of Bassett (11-9) 
against El Dorado (7-13). 
</P>
<P>
"It's gonna be tough," Trakh said. "We got to come to play every night. We just 
got to play hard and prepare for games, and not overlook anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago, we had a great team, and all everyone said was 'See you in 
the finals. You guys got it made,' " Trakh said. 
</P>
<P>
"But then we lost in the quarterfinals to Los Altos, a team no one had even 
heard of. I reminded the girls of that a lot last year, and I keep reminding 
them of that this year." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of Brea, one team -- second-seeded Palos Verdes -- seems to have the 
best chance. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (24-4) is led by Lisa Humphreys, who averages 18 points a game. 
Palos Verdes also likes to run, press and utilize a pesky man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
Of Orange County teams, Savanna (15-9) might be the biggest threat. The Rebels 
are led by Carrie Fredrick and Jackie Boxley, two aggressive players who helped 
Savanna come closer to beating Brea than any county team has this year. 
(Savanna lost by 18 points). 
</P>
<P>
Foothill (14-9) is the only other county team with a winning record. Still, 
Foothill Coach Sheila Adams, whose team, after a first-round bye, plays Rim of 
the World (16-7) in a second-round game Saturday, doesn't seem overwhelmingly 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if we win our first game, we have to play Brea," Adams said. "So that 
sort of explains it." 
</P>
<P>
The 3-A, along with the 3-AA, is one of the weakest divisions. In the 3-AA, 10 
teams have first-round byes. In the 3-A, 11 teams have byes. 
</P>
<P>
Also, of 22 teams in the 3-AA, nine have losing records. In the 3-A, six of 21 
teams have losing records. 
</P>
<P>
Only three county teams are entered in the 3-A playoffs, top-seeded Rancho 
Alamitos, Rosary and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos (18-3) is led by senior forward Jenny Newsome, who averages 24 
points. The Vaqueros have a first-round bye, then meet the winner of tonight's 
Covina/St. Paul game. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main strengths are our physical condition," Rancho Alamitos' Becker said. 
"We try to push the pace and run the ball, and the girls are in really good 
shape. Also, we're highly intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa (12-11) is led by 5-9 guard freshman Olivia DiCamilli. DiCamilli 
scored 32 points, including nine of her team's 10 points in overtime, and had 
20 rebounds and five steals in an overtime victory over Trabuco Hills last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDING CHAMPION -- Brea-Olinda (was 3-A champion last year before the 
division was split.) 
</P>
<P>
TOP TEAMS -- Brea-Olinda (26-0), Palos Verdes (24-4) in 3-AA; Rancho Alamitos 
(18-3), South Hills (17-5) in 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
DARK HORSE -- Savanna (15-9) in 3-AA, San Marino (16-5) in 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
BEST DRAW -- In the 3-A, South Hills, which, after a first-round bye, will meet 
one of two at-large teams, St. Lucy's (8-17) or Yucca Valley (13-9). 
</P>
<P>
WORST DRAW -- In 3-AA, Foothill (14-9), the Century League champion, will meet 
Brea if it defeats wins its first game against Rim of the World (16-7). 
</P>
<P>
KEY PLAYERS -- In 3-AA, Aimee McDaniel (Brea-Olinda), Tammy Blackburn 
(Brea-Olinda), Lisa Humphreys (Palos Verdes) and Nicki Manzo (Lompoc). In 3-A, 
Jenny Newsome (Rancho Alamitos) and Karen Hecox (South Hills). 
</P>
<P>
NOTEWORTHY -- Splitting the 3-A was not without consequences. In the 3-AA, 10 
teams have first-round byes. In the 3-A, 11 teams have byes. Of 22 3-AA teams, 
nine have losing records. In the 3-A, of 21 teams, six have losing records.

LA HABRA, LA QUINTA HAVE KEY INGREDIENTS TO WIN IT ALL

On paper, Orange County teams have a 50-50 chance of making it to the Southern 
Section 4-A final. Two of the four seeded teams in the division are from the 
county: top-seeded La Habra and third-seeded La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
In a division that needed 12 at-large teams to fill the bracket, La Habra's 
unusually tall Highlanders could easily advance to the final. 
</P>
<P>
"In that top half of the bracket, La Habra looks like they are going to cruise 
through there," La Quinta Coach Kevin Kiernan said. "I don't see any team with 
any height there that can match up with them at all. So I think they've got a 
pretty good path to the finals." 
</P>
<P>
La Habra has three players who are at least 6 feet tall. Leslie Ferguson, a 
6-foot post player, leads the Highlanders with 16 points and 11 rebounds. She 
teams with the Kristich sisters, 6-1 Ana (11.8 points, nine rebounds) and 6-5 
Zrinka (13.1 points, 9.2 rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
La Habra brings a 97-3 league record, compiled over 10 years, into the playoffs 
and has won nine of the past 10 Freeway League championships. While the 
Highlanders tower over most of their opponents they are not invincible. They 
have only two seniors, only one of whom plays regularly, and they are untested 
against tough competition. The Highlanders lost to Valencia in a nonleague 
game. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta doesn't have height but the Aztecs have seniority and scoring punch. 
They start five seniors, including last year's state scoring leader, Amy 
Jalewalia, who has raised her average to 33.4 points a game from 32 last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs last made it to the final in 1985 in the 3-A division, but illness 
and scholastic troubles have hindered them since. Kiernan is hoping nothing 
like that will happen this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're keeping our fingers crossed," he said. "We always seem to lose a body as 
soon as we start talking about CIF (playoffs). Last year Tanya Krill got the 
chicken pox and the year before it was ineligibility. We don't get our grades 
until Tuesday or Wednesday and we always have a couple of kids who are 
borderline. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're healthy and everybody is eligible, we have a good shot at going a few 
rounds. It is a very competitive bracket. There doesn't seem to be any dominant 
teams in there besides La Habra. Everybody's got a good shot." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (16-6) and Cypress (15-9) have strong records and the benefit of 
playing against good league competition. Fullerton lost to La Habra twice in 
close games while Cypress defeated Empire League champion Esperanza once. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton plays host to Redondo (7-14), an at-large team. Cypress faces 
at-large entry La Mirada (10-11) at Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the nine Orange County entrants will play their first game at home and 
the other two, El Modena and Garden Grove, play against county schools. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park (9-9) plays host to Pioneer (10-12), El Modena (7-13) travels to 
Kennedy (14-10) and at-large entries Garden Grove (11-11) and defending 
division champion Katella (9-15) play at Katella. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDING CHAMPION -- Katella 
</P>
<P>
TOP TEAMS -- La Habra (19-3), Palm Desert (23-2), La Quinta (23-3). 
</P>
<P>
DARK HORSE -- Cypress (15-9). 
</P>
<P>
BEST DRAW -- St. Joseph (16-9), the only unseeded team with a first-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
WORST DRAW -- Garden Grove (11-11), with the best record of any at-large team 
in the division, meets defending champion Katella and then most likely 
top-seeded La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
KEY PLAYERS -- Leslie Ferguson and Ana and Zrinka Kristich (La Habra), Amy 
Jalewalia and Heather Brannon (La Quinta), Sommer McLain (Fullerton), Rosa 
Olloque (West Torrance), Tisa Read and Brenda Joyce (Palm Desert) and Valerie 
Ruiz (Kennedy). 
</P>
<P>
NOTEWORTHY -- There are 12 at-large teams in the division, all but one has a 
losing records.

LATEST UNLUCKY DRAW COULD SPELL DOUBLE TROUBLE FOR MARINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All the coaches at the Southern Section office smiled at Marina High School 
Coach Pete Bonny when he walked in to pick up his playoff pairings Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'What are you smiling at?' " Bonny said. "They said, 'Go look at your 
draw.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bonny wasn't surprised. It was the typical bad luck of the draw the Marina 
girls' basketball team has experienced over the years. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings are matched against Canyon Springs (16-9), the second-place team 
from the Mountain View League. If the Vikings win, they most likely will meet 
second-seeded Ontario (26-0) at Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"Marina has never gotten good draws in basketball," first-year coach Bonny 
said. "You can't cry about it. It is just the way we are perceived. We were 
never ranked in the 5-A top 10 all season." That, despite the fact that Marina 
placed second in the tough Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings will need all that experience to offset their lack of height. 
Marina's tallest starter is 5-foot-10 junior Paula Meyers. Much of Marina's 
success will depend on the long shot. Guard Melisa Sortino has made 62 
three-point shots, and averages 20.6 points and 5.2 assists a game. The team 
averages 62 points, the most in Marina history. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings will also have to do quite a bit of running to keep pace with some 
quality teams. Three of the 5-A's seeded teams -- Buena, Ontario and Hart -- 
were in last year's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Buena (23-0) of Ventura is no stranger to success; it has won the 
Channel League title 13 of the past 14 years. Center Nicole Ellis (5-11) leads 
the Bulldogs with a 13-point average. Junior point guard Mia Palkie (5-8) 
averages 10.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (24-2) is the county team with the best chance of reaching the 
final. The fourth-seeded Seahawks, who start five seniors, are quick, big and 
fluid. 
</P>
<P>
Three starters average in double figures, led by 6-2, 185-pound Jennifer 
Sullivan (17.4 points, 14.6 rebounds), last year's Sunset League most valuable 
player. Tracy Wolfe, a 5-11 senior, averages 13 points and almost 10 rebounds a 
game and guard Fabiola Nunez averages 10 points and about eight rebounds. Point 
guard Alli Takido averages seven assists and 6.5 points and is part of a solid 
core of three-point shooters. 
</P>
<P>
Seven other county teams made the playoffs. One of them, El Toro (22-5), will 
have to get past Ocean View to reach the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The two teams, which have alternated at the No. 2 spot in the county girls' 
basketball poll, conceivably could meet in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro Coach Greg Yeck likes his team's draw and the possibility of meeting 
Ocean View. "It should be good going up against somebody really tough, and it's 
not like we're going up against the unknown," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers are led by point guard Karie Yoshioka (16 points, eight assists) 
and 6-0 center Sara Bone (18 points, 10 rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
Orange (16-6) and standout center Nicole Champion play host to Diamond Bar 
(12-11). Esperanza (20-4), led by guard Jennifer Harney, plays host to Corona 
del Mar (8-13). Capistrano Valley (16-9) plays host to Inglewood (12-6). 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach (9-15) and Dana Hills (13-11) earned at-large berths and will 
be on the road for the first round. Aside from those schools, Mater Dei (10-12) 
is the only Orange County team in the division that has to travel. The Monarchs 
open at Cerritos (17-6). 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded team in 5-AA is Morningside (23-3), led by 6-5 Lisa Leslie, who 
won the Dial Award as the top high school female athlete in the nation, and 6-4 
Janet Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs, the division's defending champion, won their eighth Ocean League 
title as Leslie averaged 23 points and 15 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley (18-7) and Santa Ana Valley (14-8) are the only county teams in 
the division and neither is ranked. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDING CHAMPION -- Hart 
</P>
<P>
TOP TEAMS -- Buena (23-0), Ontario (26-0), Hart (21-4), Ocean View (24-2). 
</P>
<P>
DARK HORSES -- El Toro (22-5) and Santa Barbara (22-5). 
</P>
<P>
BEST DRAW -- El Toro (22-5) opens at home against at-large Moreno Valley (8-12) 
and could face Mater Dei (10-12) or Cerritos (17-6) before taking on Ocean View 
in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
WORST DRAW -- Marina (18-7) takes on Canyon Springs, which until the last of 
week of the season had led its league. Then the short Vikings could face 
undefeated Ontario, a tall, walk-it-up-pound-it-in style team. 
</P>
<P>
KEY PLAYERS -- Sara Wilson and Anjanette Dionne (Hart), Mia Palkie (Buena), 
Kristin Knapp (Santa Barbara), Jennifer Sullivan (Ocean View), Karie Yoshioka 
and Sara Bone (El Toro), Jennifer Harney (Esperanza), Melisa Sortino (Marina) 
and Nicole Champion (Orange). 
</P>
<P>
NOTEWORTHY -- Three seeded teams this season -- Hart, Ontario and Buena -- 
advanced to the semifinals last year.

ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL, COUNTY TEAMS FACE UPHILL ROAD

<TEXT>
<P>
The nine Orange County teams in the Southern Section girls' 4-AA basketball 
playoffs differ in many ways, but nearly all share one attribute: Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it will take more than hope to knock off Muir, the top-seeded team. 
Muir (22-5) is led by Rose Jung, an all-Southern Section point guard who's 
extremely quick, and 5-foot 10-inch forward Karen Banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Muir probably has as much talent as anyone," Woodbridge Coach Eric Bangs said. 
"They're loaded with talent. But they seemed to play up and down this season 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge (20-4), the second-seeded team, and Tustin (21-5) are generally 
regarded as the county's best hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Rathbun, a 5-7 guard, leads Woodbridge, the county's 10th-ranked team, 
with 13.5 points and 5.7 steals a game. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have a first-round bye, then play the winner of Loara (13-10) and 
California(16-6) in Saturday's second round. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin, the Sea View League champion, is young, with junior point guard Wanda 
Sequeira (12 points, eight assists), 5-11 sophomore forward Christine Garner 
(16 points, 11 rebounds), and 5-10 sophomore forward Sheri Needham as the core 
of an offense-oriented team. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't play a lot of defense," Coach Rick Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
That could certainly hurt the Tillers if they make it to their probable 
second-round matchup against Mission Viejo. The Diablos (18-8) feature 6-3 
center Jennifer Rohrig, who leads the county with 19.5 rebounds and 19.9 points 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
Edison, an at-large team at 15-8, is considered a dark horse favorite. 
Especially with 5-6 guard Debbie Fischer, who last week scored a school-record 
49 points that included 10 three-pointers, tying her own Southern Section 
record for three-pointers in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Although Edison, which plays at Arlington (16-7) in tonight's first round, 
suffered from streaky play through the season, most of that could be attributed 
to a knee injury to Fischer, who is now healthy. 
</P>
<P>
And although the Chargers might still be without 5-8 junior forward Laura Vinch 
-- she cut her finger while working at a sandwich shop and has missed the past 
two games -- Edison has been gaining momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming out of the Sunset League, I feel that's a strength in itself," 
first-year coach Philip Abraham said. "It's like playing a tournament every 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Valencia (14-10), the defending champion, might not be as strong as last 
season, but most coaches say the Tigers always improve at playoff time. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best first-round games tonight should be San Clemente (15-10) at 
University (18-5). The two teams met in a scrimmage last summer, and then again 
in the final of the Santa Ana Valley tournament. University, which is led by 
5-8 senior forward Denise Gandara, won both games by close scores. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDING CHAMPION -- Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
TOP TEAMS -- Muir (22-5), Westlake (20-4), Woodbridge (21-4). 
</P>
<P>
DARK HORSES -- Tustin (21-5), Edison (15-8), Valencia (14-10). 
</P>
<P>
BEST DRAW -- Tustin, will open with at-large Torrance (15-10), then the winner 
of Claremont (9-11)/Mission Viejo (18-8). 
</P>
<P>
WORST DRAW -- University (17-5) must meet San Clemente (15-10), a team that it 
narrowly beat in a summer scrimmage and as well as in the Santa Ana Valley 
tournament. A game later, it probably will meet top-seeded Muir. 
</P>
<P>
KEY PLAYERS -- Karen Banks (Muir), Tracy Titus (Loara), Alisa Stevenson (J.W. 
North) and Debbie Fischer (Edison). 
</P>
<P>
NOTEWORTHY -- Of the 27 teams, only four have records under .500, making it one 
of the strongest divisions in the playoffs.

Sophomore Jason Register hit a jump shot at the buzzer to give Saddleback a 
62-60, double-overtime victory over Nogales Tuesday night in the first round of 
the Southern Section 5-AA playoffs at the Nogales gym in La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback (17-11) will play Long Beach Millikan in Friday night's second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Nogales finished the season 21-6. 
</P>
<P>
Register's shot overshadowed a 29-point performance by Nogales' Matt Schuler, 
who had tied the score at 50-50 at the end of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Each team scored eight points in the first overtime, which ended when 
Saddleback's Elton Moore rebounded a shot by teammate Marco Gomez and put it in 
at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
In the second overtime, the Roadrunners outscored Nogales, 4-2, on a basket by 
Gomez with 1:56 remaining and Register's shot. Caine Wilson scored for Nogales. 
</P>
<P>
Register helped the Roadrunners equal their biggest lead of the game -- 13 
points -- with a jumper with 3 minutes one second left in the first half. He 
finished with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Nogales made only six of 35 shots in the first half as the Roadrunners led, 
32-21, at halftime. Saddleback made 15 of 29 shots in the first half. DENNIS

<P>
Federal, state and local law enforcement officials Tuesday raided the offices 
of Innovative Holding Co., an Irvine company specializing in precious metals 
investment partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with search warrants, officials from the FBI, the state Department of 
Corporations and the Irvine Police Department seized documents, records and 
other material. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
According to Irvine police, the search was for "any and all records relating to 
limited partnership investments in the processing of precious metals . . . that 
Innovative Holding Co. Inc. has claim to in the Mojave Desert."

Glenn R. Hammond, Innovative Holding's president, said his company's operation 
"is honest. We are mining gold." Hammond, who sat inside his office during the 
raid, declined further comment, saying: "I want to find out what's happening. 
There's no need talking until I do."

According to a police statement, the Irvine firm sold investments in a dozen 
limited partnerships set up to develop a gold recovery process. The company's 
recovery plant is in a section of the Mojave Desert known as "Robber's Roost," 
police said. The partnerships were supposed to profit equally in the recovery 
operation, police said, adding that the minimum investment was $30,000 for a 1% 
ownership in a partnership. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the Mojave Desert recovery plant is operated by Oro Ltd., 
a company believed to be owned by Innovative Holding. Federal agents also 
searched the offices of the recovery plant on Tuesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"There appears to be reasonable cause (to believe) that there has been some . . 
. fraudulent involvement," said Irvine Police Lt. Mike White. "I assume 
somebody complained." 
</P>
<P>
FBI and other officials declined further comment.

The Postal Service, which ended half a century of banking in 1966, will soon 
begin providing automated teller machines in post office lobbies. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Postmaster General Gordon C. Morison will explain the plan to a 
convention of community bankers this weekend, postal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The program has been tested in Seattle since November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for local banks across the country to locate the cash-dispensing 
machines in post office lobbies. Banks will be selected by competitive bidding 
for the right to place their machines, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 6 million people visit postal lobbies daily and the presence of banking 
machines there should provide a one-stop location to do business, postal 
officials anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
However, they declined to speculate on the income that the program would 
generate for the Postal Service, saying it will take time for people to get 
used to having the banking machines available at post offices.

STATE HEARINGS OPEN ON PLAN TO SELL FARMERS TO FRENCH; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: REGULATORS MUST DETERMINE WHETHER AXA-MIDI IS "FIT" TO OWN FARMERS 
GROUP, WHICH WOULD BE SOLD IF ITS PARENT, BAT, IS ACQUIRED.

<P>
California insurance regulators opened a crucial hearing Tuesday into the 
suitability of Axa-Midi Assurances, a French insurance firm, to own Los 
Angeles-based Farmers Group. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers' current parent, BAT Industries of London, is being pursued by Hoylake 
Investments, headed by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith. Hoylake has 
agreed to sell Farmers to Axa-Midi if it succeeds in acquiring BAT. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Britt, a Department of Insurance administrative law judge, has scheduled 
eight days of hearings in Los Angeles. Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie 
is expected to announce her decision on Axa-Midi's "fitness" by April 9. 
</P>
<P>
Britt presided over a similar hearing on BAT's fitness to acquire Farmers in 
1988 before BAT's hostile bid was sweetened to $5.3 billion, acceptable to 
Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
A similar hearing has been under way for several weeks in Illinois, another of 
the nine states in which Farmers' subsidiaries have headquarters. Hoylake and 
Axa-Midi must obtain approvals in each state -- a process Axa Chairman Claude 
Bebear said will take until June. 
</P>
<P>
Only then could Goldsmith refile Hoylake's bid for BAT with the panel that 
regulates takeovers in Britain. That panel allowed Goldsmith to withdraw his 
original offer, valued at about $21 billion, after it became clear that the 
transaction could not be completed within the 60 days allowed under British 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Bebear maintains that BAT is trying to use Farmers as a "poison pill" to thwart 
Hoylake's hostile bid. On Tuesday, Axa-Midi filed documents that it says show 
that BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy ordered a management group to explore just 
such a strategy. Moreover, Bebear told reporters, one of the options BAT 
explored was "cutting a deal with Axa-Midi and cutting out Hoylake." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, in its opening argument, urged Britt to assess Hoylake's suitability 
to own an insurance company, as well as Axa-Midi's, in case delays should 
develop in the plan for Hoylake to sell Farmers. It also maintained that 
Axa-Midi's plan to pay Hoylake $4.5 billion for Farmers not only undervalued 
the insurance holding company but would jeopardize insurance reserves in case 
of default on the loans, since Farmers would be Axa-Midi's only substantial 
asset in the United States.

2 OWNERS OF FAILED S&amp;L GET STIFF SENTENCES

<P>
Two Orange County businessmen convicted of causing the collapse of Ramona 
Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana received severe prison sentences Tuesday in 
federal court in Los Angeles and were ordered to pay millions of dollars in 
restitution to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Donald P. Mangano Sr., 53, of Huntington Beach, was sentenced to 15 years in 
prison, and John L. Molinaro, 49, of San Jose, received a 12-year sentence on 
charges of fraud and conspiracy that led to the thrift's 1986 collapse. They 
were also ordered to pay $6.8 million in restitution to the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were convicted in October on more than 30 counts of bank fraud and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an element in this whole thing of cynicism and ruthlessness and 
deceit," said U.S. District Court Judge David V. Kenyon in announcing the 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Neither man showed any reaction as Kenyon read the sentences. Molinaro, dressed 
in a wrinkled blue work shirt and prison fatigues, leaned back in his chair. 
Mangano looked down at a note pad. The men will be eligible for parole in four 
to five years. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said it was pleased with Kenyon's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We regard this as a significant victory for the government in its efforts to 
punish those responsible for the savings and loan crisis," said Asst. U.S. 
Attorney Steven E. Zipperstein. "The sentence will send a message to other 
savings and loan owners that white-collar crime doesn't pay." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys expressed little surprise at the length of the sentences, 
claiming that Kenyon was under pressure from regulators to set an example. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon had received letters from the nation's top banking regulators, including 
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, appealing for long prison terms for both men. 
</P>
<P>
The Ramona case has attracted a great deal of attention because Molinaro and 
Mangano were the first owners of a failed thrift in Southern California to face 
criminal charges since the nation's thrift debacle began to unfold in the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-hour sentencing proceeding became rather delicate when the subject 
became Mangano's deteriorating health. He is a quadriplegic -- the victim of a 
bout with polio more than 30 years ago -- and his attorneys have claimed that 
any kind of incarceration could result in his death. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano's attorneys pleaded with Kenyon on Tuesday to place him on probation.

OPERA: ALTHOUGH NOT BILLED AS AN ADVICE-TO-THE-LOVELORN PIECE, 'TURANDOT,' 
WHICH OPENS FRIDAY AT THE PERFORMING ARTS CENTER, CONTAINS A STRONG MESSAGE 
ABOUT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SEXES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Opera generally isn't regarded as a place to turn for Advice to the Lovelorn. 
But it's long been a pet theory of this writer that Puccini's "Turandot" has 
something vital to say about power relations between the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, "Turandot," which opens Friday at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in Costa Mesa, might not appear to offer contemporary audiences 
much in the way of serious commentary on love relationships. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the work is based on a fairy tale about a beautiful-but-cruel 
princess who kills those who would love her. 
</P>
<P>
But as with all enduring myths, beneath the entertainment-oriented particulars 
of the story lie some universal truths. 
</P>
<P>
Other composers had tackled this subject before Puccini began composing it in 
1921. Antonio Bazzini, Puccini's professor at the Milan Conservatory, wrote a 
"Turanda" in 1867, and Ferruccio Busoni wrote a "Turandot" in 1917. (Elements 
of the Busoni opera reappear in Puccini's, but greatly transformed.) 
</P>
<P>
Puccini had been hunting for new material and new heroines who were not in the 
passive Butterfly or Mimi mold. Turandot, the icy princess, fit the bill. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the work would be the composer's swan song. In fact, he did 
not live to finish it. But more of that later. 
</P>
<P>
The story has basically a mystery plot: 
</P>
<P>
Wooers for the Princess's hand must submit to a trial in which she poses three 
Sphinxian riddles. If they can answer them, they win her hand and the throne of 
China. If they fail, they must accept the penalty, which is beheading. 
</P>
<P>
Turandot is so beautiful that there is no end of suitors. But all fail the 
test. Then, one day, an Unknown Prince arrives; his encounter with Turandot is 
the subject of Puccini's opera. 
</P>
<P>
But the real mystery extends beyond the answers to the riddles or the name of 
the Unknown Prince. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the point, some background information is provided in Turandot's 
cruelly demanding Act II aria, "In questa Reggia." She explains that thousands 
of years ago, one of her ancestors -- the Princess Lou-Ling -- was carried off, 
ravished and murdered by an invading warlord. In revenge, Turandot, who now 
embodies the spirit of Lou-Ling, will take the life of any man who desires her. 
</P>
<P>
One must accept the legitimacy of her claim. There has been a terrible crime of 
aggression and misused power against a woman by a man. The question is: How can 
such a brutal crime be expiated? 
</P>
<P>
The opera will propose various solutions, rejecting each one until posing the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
First is Turandot's solution: blood for blood, revenge through more murders. 
But how many will it take to pay for the original crime? An endless series of 
executions have turned China into a charnel house, as the three court 
ministers, Ping, Pang and Pong, lament. Revenge, obviously, is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Nor, interestingly, is turning the tables on Turandot by solving the riddles. 
</P>
<P>
The Unknown Prince gives the right answers, thereby winning power over 
Turandot. But he wants more than that, and the opera proposes that trading one 
kind of power for another is not the solution. 
</P>
<P>
When Turandot protests that no man will take her willingly, the Unknown Prince 
rejects the path of repeating the original rape. He wants her to love him. 
</P>
<P>
He proposes a new riddle: If she can find out his name before dawn, she may 
kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Turandot agrees and orders that no one in Peking is to sleep until his name is 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
In desperation, the three ministers and the people seek out the prince and 
offer him bribes, threats and entreaties to flee. Ping conjures up horrifying 
images of soldiers roving through the streets, banging at doors, demanding the 
prince's name and killing those who cannot give it. Of course, no one can. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the prince refuses to reveal his identity. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, soldiers drag in the prince's father and the servant Liu who 
secretly loves the prince. Sizing up the situation quickly, she swears that 
only she knows his name. 
</P>
<P>
Turandot orders the girl tortured until she reveals it. 
</P>
<P>
After great agony, Liu stabs herself to death to keep the secret but not before 
predicting that Turandot will love the prince as much as she does. 
</P>
<P>
Here Puccini and his librettists, Giuseppi Adami and Renato Simoni, take an 
enormous gamble and -- for many people -- lose it. Liu is sacrificed for 
Turandot and quite frankly many don't feel that the icy princess is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
But her death serves as the turning point. 
</P>
<P>
Liu is as innocent as Lou-Ling was. Her act of self-sacrifice at long last 
calms the bloodthirsty, superstitious people, transforms the three cynical 
ministers and even prompts Turandot to realize that she loves the prince. When 
she declares her love for the prince, he, in a transport of emotion, reveals 
his name: Calaf the son of Timur. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Turandot is intoxicated with the knowledge and summons everyone to 
announce her triumph. But she quickly abjures the power, the two are united and 
the kingdom rejoices in the promise of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Both have rejected the solution of power over one another by willingly giving 
the power of life and death to the other. 
</P>
<P>
At this point in the opera, one longs to hear the crowning love duet between 
the two. But it will never come, at least not as Puccini would have written it. 
</P>
<P>
Puccini died after composing the music for the scene of Liu's death. Conductor 
Arturo Toscanini, Puccini's longtime friend, assigned opera composer Franco 
Alfano the unenviable task of completing the opera from Puccini's sketches. 
</P>
<P>
For the climactic love duet, Puccini had indicated what he wanted: "Find here 
the characteristic, lovely, unusual melody." 
</P>
<P>
He did not live to find it. Alfano also did not find it. Alfano has been 
criticized for not being a Puccini. But then, who else was? 
</P>
<P>
Conducting the premiere at La Scala, Milan, on April 25, 1926, Toscanini went 
so far as to put down the baton after the last measures that Puccini wrote, 
turn to the audience and declare that the opera was over. In subsequent 
performances, he conducted the rest of the act as completed by Alfano. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the melody could never be found, and perhaps this adds even more to the 
mystique of "Turandot." It remains a dream as is, for many, the ideal 
relationship between the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera Pacific will present Puccini's "Turandot," Friday through March 4, at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, in Costa Mesa. 
Tickets: $20 to $55. Information: (714) 546-7372.

CASEY PICKS USC AS 4 TOP PLAYERS COMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four of the area's top high school football players chose colleges on the eve 
of national letter-of-intent day when Sylmar's Jerome Casey (USC), Cleveland's 
Pat Bryant (Hawaii), Grant's Marlowe Lewis (Hawaii) and Canyon's Chris Peery 
(Cal State Fullerton) announced their commitments Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The four join a group of 16 area players who are expected to sign today, the 
first day high school seniors can sign letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jones, a Parade All-American who rushed for 1,743 yards at Montclair 
Prep, said that he will announce his decision at an on-campus press conference 
today at noon. He has narrowed his choices to USC, Miami and Colorado, 
rejecting Georgia Tech and Louisiana State, the other two schools he has 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
If Jones signs with the Trojans, he will become the fourth area player to 
choose USC, which has received commitments from Casey; Jason Keiderling, an 
offensive lineman from Reseda; and Errol Small, a defensive back from Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Keiderling and Small, Casey will sign a letter that carries an 
asterisk: The Times' All-Valley running back will lose his scholarship if he 
fails to score at least 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test as required by the 
NCAA under the guidelines of Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
Casey has taken the test twice and has yet to receive the results from his 
second attempt. School policy prevents USC from accepting student-athletes who 
fail to meet Prop. 48 requirements. 
</P>
<P>
USC spokesman Tim Tessalone would not comment on the particulars of Casey's 
situation, but he pointed out that the school made a similar arrangement last 
year with Curtis Conway. The former Hawthorne High quarterback committed to USC 
but failed to reach 700 on the SAT in time to enroll last fall. USC held a 
scholarship for him and accepted him when he made the grade in December. 
</P>
<P>
Casey (5-10, 180 pounds) also visited Washington, Washington State and 
Nebraska, schools that he said would have offered him a scholarship regardless 
of his SAT score. But Casey's first choice always has been the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so exciting," he said. "I always imagined myself running on the field at 
the Coliseum. I grew up loving SC." 
</P>
<P>
Casey rushed for 1,447 yards and scored 26 touchdowns last fall and led Sylmar 
in tackles with 75 from his free-safety position. USC recruited the three-time 
All-City Section selection as a running back, which also suits him. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had all those great running backs there," he said. "Charles White, O. 
J. (Simpson), Anthony Davis." 
</P>
<P>
Peery, Cal-Hi Sports' state Player of the Year as a sophomore and a two-time 
All-Valley selection by The Times, also has failed to meet Prop. 48 
requirements and will continue to take the SAT. Still, Fullerton will accept 
him and provide financial aid under the guidelines of Prop. 42, an amendment to 
Prop. 48 that forbids schools from granting scholarships to student-athletes 
who fail to score either a 700 on the SAT or achieve a 2.0 grade-point average 
in core curriculum classes. 
</P>
<P>
Peery, 6-foot-1, 215 pounds, powered Canyon to the semifinal round of the 
Southern Section playoffs last year, rushing for 1,220 yards despite missing 
three games because of a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, 5-foot-11, 185 pounds, was a standout receiver as a junior at 
Cleveland, then was converted to running back before his senior year. After 
visits to San Diego State, Fullerton and Arizona, Bryant orally committed to 
Hawaii after taking a trip there last weekend. Bryant, an All-City and Times 
All-Valley outfielder as a junior, said he also will play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, who expects to play slotback-receiver at Hawaii, rushed for 388 yards 
in six games after suffering a midseason hand injury. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 5-foot-10, 165 pounds, shared the East Valley League MVP award with 
Casey and led Grant to the league title as quarterback and defensive back. He 
passed for 805 yards, rushed for 759 and accounted for 22 touchdowns. He chose 
Hawaii, which recruited him as a wide receiver, over Cal State Long Beach and 
Oregon because the Rainbows wanted him as an offensive player. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park lineman Joe Smigiel (6-5, 255) also may commit today when New 
Mexico officials meet with him today at school. 
</P>
<P>
"New Mexico indicated all along that they were interested in Joe," Panther 
Coach George Hurley said. "I think they were worried he might go to Arizona 
State and waited to see if they would make an offer."

JUNK BONDS STILL REELING FROM DREXEL FALLOUT; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: DREXEL'S BANKRUPTCY PLANS HIT THE MARKET HARD, BUT AFTERNOON 
BARGAIN HUNTERS CUSHION SOME OF THE LOSSES.

<P>
The bloodied junk bond arena -- hardly a market because of a lack of buyers -- 
continued in disarray Tuesday as Drexel Burnham Lambert's parent firm prepared 
to file for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in the high-yield, high-risk bonds was light simply because a glut of 
sellers could not pair off with buyers. As badly as some investors wanted to 
sell, they couldn't because no one wanted to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no liquidity. Nobody forces you to give a bid," said Bruce Eliot, 
portfolio manager with Houlihan, Lokey, Howard &amp; Zukin, an investment 
management firm in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel, which almost single-handedly developed the junk bond market, in the 
past was critical in providing liquidity by purchasing bonds from sellers even 
if it had no buyers lined up in advance. But lately it and other firms have 
declined to do that as the market has softened. 
</P>
<P>
News that Drexel's parent was headed for bankruptcy court hit the market hard 
early in the day, as did a bankruptcy filing by Integrated Resources, a major 
junk bond issuer and Drexel client. Traders said junk bonds dropped initially 
as much as 3 points, which means their value fell by $30 for each $1,000 in 
face value. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said some bonds recovered part of their losses in the afternoon as 
bargain hunters moved in, making for overall drops of about 1 1/2 to 2 points, 
or $15 to $20 for every $1,000 in face value. Leading the comeback was RJR 
Nabisco, the tobacco and food company whose bonds are among the strongest 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds are issued by companies with low credit ratings and pay holders a 
high interest rate to compensate for the added risk of default. They have 
fallen the past six months because of financial problems at some major issuers 
and general fears of a recession. One variation, called payment-in-kind bonds 
because they pay interest in the form of more bonds instead of cash, have been 
particularly weak lately. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said a few insurance firms bought Tuesday, as well as companies trying 
to take advantage of the soft market by buying back their own bonds. Traders 
said firms that appeared to be buying back their bonds included Caesars World, 
Revlon Group and National Gypsum. 
</P>
<P>
The sagging market presents companies an opportunity to buy their bonds back at 
bargain prices, much as a falling stock market sparks companies to buy back 
their own shares. But buying back junk bonds is limited because many of the 
bonds carry conditions that prevent companies from buying a large number 
without making similar offers to all bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the market will recover soon is increasingly doubtful, and buyers 
remain scarce. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been really tough. I have a lot of nervous clients," said James C. 
Spirrison, senior vice president in charge of high-yield securities at the 
brokerage house of Rodman &amp; Renshaw in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is the huge portfolio of bonds held by insurance companies, savings 
and loans, mutual funds and Drexel itself. 
</P>
<P>
Traders shudder when they think of what may happen to the market if Drexel has 
to liquidate its bond holdings. Mutual funds could come under increased 
pressure to sell their bonds if more people move their money out of junk bond 
funds. Insurance firms may come under pressure stemming from concern by 
regulators about the safety of some companies. And S&amp;Ls, under a federal 
law effective last summer, must sell their junk bonds by 1994; many sold early 
as the market plunged last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if its back is broken, but it certainly is bowed," said Gregory 
M. Scott, executive vice president with the Alliance for Capital Access, a 
Washington lobbying group for companies that issue junk bonds.

Strong programming on the three major networks Sunday night brought 
substantially more viewers to the set than usual, with the first part of NBC's 
miniseries "Blind Faith" winning the movie race between 9 and 11 p.m. to rank 
eighth for the week. That helped give NBC its 85th win in the past 86 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's telecast of "RoboCop" placed second during the two-hour time period while 
CBS' "Miracle Landing" was third. While the three networks usually have a 
combined 69% share of the TV audience during that time period, they drew 78% 
Sunday. The full list of ratings is on Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Bradys" are back and people are watching. The two-hour premiere Friday 
night on CBS was viewed in 11.9 million homes to place a strong second behind 
ABC for the time period and far ahead of NBC's programs. But the real story is 
in the hour-by-hour ratings. While the Bradys were viewed in 10.6 million homes 
during their first hour, the audience grew to 13.2 million homes during the 
second half of the show to place first for that hour.

TROOP AGREEMENT REMOVES ARMS PACT OBSTACLE -- BUSH

<P>
President Bush today called Soviet acceptance of his troop cut proposal for 
Europe "an important breakthrough" that removes a major obstacle to a 
conventional arms treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, before signing a Panama aid bill, praised Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev for accepting his plan to allow the U.S. and Soviet armies to keep 
195,000 troops each in Central Europe, with the United States allowed to 
station 30,000 more troops in Britain, Italy, Turkey, Greece and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important breakthrough which removes a major obstacle to the early 
conclusion of a CFE (conventional forces in Europe) treaty, and it also 
established the principle that U.S. forces in Europe are not to be treated as 
equivalent to Soviet forces in Eastern Europe," said Bush. 
</P>
<P>
He also hailed a separate agreement to speed German reunification. The four 
powers that defeated Hitler in World War II have agreed to meet with leaders of 
the two Germanys to lay the groundwork for unification. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who had said Monday that it was too early for a four powers' meeting on 
the future of Germany, acknowledged he was caught by surprise at the speed at 
which the German unification question has moved forward. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who helped negotiate the latest 
breakthroughs in meetings in Ottawa with foreign secretaries from both NATO and 
Warsaw Pact nations, was at the President's side. 
</P>
<P>
"We and our German allies are in full accord," Bush said. "Things move quite 
fast there." 
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the two German states will meet with the foreign 
ministers of the four powers -- the United States, Great Britain, France and 
the Soviet Union -- "to discuss the external aspects of the establishment of 
German unity," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"This brings us a step closer to realizing the longstanding goal of German 
unity," said Bush, who has insisted that a united Germany must belong to NATO.

REMAINING OIL BLOWN ONTO BEACHES; 
</P>
<P>
CLEANUP: WORKERS BATTLE HIGH WINDS WHEN OPERATIONS ARE CONSOLIDATED ON SHORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Howling winds from the north tossed more than 60,000 gallons of Alaskan crude 
onto Orange County beaches this morning, bringing virtually all the remaining 
oil from last week's spill onto land and creating an enormous cleanup job for 
1,300 wind-swept workers. 
</P>
<P>
The slick, caused when the tanker American Trader ran over its own anchor while 
trying to moor off the coast of Huntington Beach last Wednesday, has moved up 
and down the coastline all week, coming ashore in waves and then retreating. 
</P>
<P>
Last night and this morning, however, the delicate balance of wind and tides 
that had held the slick in abeyance broke down completely. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has hit the shoreline," Coast Guard Petty Officer Dennis Hall said 
this morning. "All the oil that was in the water is now on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the American Trader dumped 394,000 gallons of crude 
into the ocean a week ago, the Coast Guard this morning found no oil floating 
in the water. 
</P>
<P>
A few splotches of thin oil sheen remained off the coast, local officials said 
later, but all agreed that virtually all of the spill has landed. Between the 
Santa Ana River and the Newport Harbor entrance, where last night's onslaught 
was heaviest, globs of oil as thick and heavy as lava stood in ribbons six 
inches thick. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup operations, which had been divided between ocean skimming and onshore 
swabbing, were consolidated. "Most of the oil that's left was pushed ashore 
last night," Coast Guard Capt. James C. Card said at a morning press 
conference. "It's now pretty much a beach cleanup operation." 
</P>
<P>
The oil broke into two distinct slicks yesterday afternoon and began sweeping 
onto the beach but it skirted wetland areas that had been of concern all week. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Moore, a spokesman for the state Department of Fish and Game, said that 157 
birds have died as a result of the spill and that 314 are being cared for at a 
treatment center on Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the mounting bird totals, booms protecting the wetlands held firm, 
staving off what could have been a devastating blow to several species of 
waterfowl. "This could have been a whole lot worse," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials said they estimate that about 36% of the spilled oil was 
skimmed off the water's surface before it landed on the beach and that 46% 
either evaporated or naturally dispersed in ocean currents, they added. 
</P>
<P>
That left at least 63,000 gallons to wash ashore last night and today, and 
cleaning it up could take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
This morning's cleanup was hampered by the winds, which forced suspension of 
the beach operations at 10:45 p.m. and allowed oil to build up on the shore. 
Although cleanup resumed at 6 a.m. today, crews continued to battle high winds. 
</P>
<P>
Some workers donned goggles and protective masks to shield themselves from the 
winds, which gusted to more than 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
At Huntington Beach, workers huddled behind a makeshift windbreak built from 
the absorbent pads used to swab the beach. The morning's main challenge was 
staying warm, said Dave Mickey, a field engineer helping to oversee beach 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday . . . it was heat prostration," he added. "Never a dull moment."

Two "Star Wars" satellites rocketed into space today to test a plan to destroy 
enemy missiles by bouncing deadly laser beams off orbiting mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
A mirror on one of the satellites was designed to reflect laser beams fired 
from a mountaintop in Hawaii back to a ground target to assess the accuracy of 
a system for intercepting ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Sensors on the second payload were to measure laser strikes in a test aimed at 
correcting laser distortions caused by dust, moisture and gases as the beam 
shoots through the atmosphere.

A private jet owned by Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate Clayton 
Williams exploded in north Texas this morning, killing a pilot and four 
business associates of Williams, officials said. Williams was not on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said the plane 
was "virtually obliterated in the explosion" and there were no survivors. The 
Mitsubishi MU2 was en route from Midland, Tex., to Dallas/Ft. Worth and crashed 
about halfway between the cities. 
</P>
<P>
"The aircraft requested a lower altitude from 15,000 feet to 14,000 feet," said 
Ray Wall, a spokesman with the National Transportation Safety Board in Ft. 
Worth. "The aircraft descended off radar at 8:00 a.m. at 14,800 feet with no 
acknowledgment." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Williams said the four businessmen were "very dear friends of 
Mr. Williams" but were not involved in his campaign for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a Midland businessman who made a fortune in oil, is widely viewed as 
the front-runner in the Republican Party, with his emphasis on law and order 
and stiff penalties for drug abusers.

A Beirut newspaper published a Valentine's Day message today to American 
hostage Thomas Sutherland from his family. 
</P>
<P>
The message, carried by the As Safir daily in English and Arabic, was 
accompanied by a picture showing Sutherland's wife, Jean, and family. 
</P>
<P>
It read: 
</P>
<P>
"We send ourselves with special Valentine love and a prayer that it finds you 
in heart and health. 
</P>
<P>
"May the warmth and mutuality of our caring prevail, 
</P>
<P>
"As ever and for aye, 
</P>
<P>
"Joan, Ann, Simone, Jean and Kit." 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland, 58, of Ft. Collins, Colo., was acting dean of agriculture at the 
American University of Beirut when he was kidnaped June 9, 1985, on the Beirut 
airport highway. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Sutherland, 17 other Westerners are missing in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for 
the Associated Press. He was kidnaped March 16, 1985.

Vassar College students, angry over an alleged racial remark by Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), today took over the administration building to 
protest a perceived pattern of racial intolerance on campus. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 students were in the protest, including about 75 inside the 
administration building housing the offices of President Frances Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters called for a boycott of classes. They also called for the school 
to hire a rabbi and provide more facilities for handicapped students. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover followed accusations Tuesday by a black local government official 
that Moynihan used a racial comment to try to intimidate her at a campus 
reception Jan. 29. Folami Gray, a Jamaican who is executive director of the 
Dutchess County Youth Bureau, said Moynihan flushed with anger and insulted her 
when she disagreed with his contention that America is a model of ethnic 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"He responded to me by saying I can pack my bags and return to where I came 
from," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Moynihan said the senator does not recall making the remark. 
</P>
<P>
Students were demanding that Moynihan be stripped of the prestigious Eleanor 
Roosevelt Chair, which was set up in the spirit of the former First Lady to 
bring to Vassar individuals who have made a difference advancing the field of 
civil rights and other disciplines.

INDIAN AIRLINES AIRBUS 320 CRASHES APPROACHING RUNWAY, KILLING 91

An Indian Airlines jet with 146 people aboard crashed and burst into flames 
while attempting to land at a southern Indian airport today and 91 people were 
killed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Airbus 320 crashed at 1 p.m. (11:30 p.m. Tuesday PST) while on final 
approach to the runway at Bangalore airport, airline and airport officials 
said. The plane apparently grazed a grove of trees and crashed about 50 yards 
from the runway, they said. 
</P>
<P>
State-run television showed shots of the crash site, a grassy plain on a golf 
course adjacent to the airport. The craft's tail was intact, but its fuselage 
was shattered and charred and the nose smashed. 
</P>
<P>
"The crash occurred before the plane touched the runway, and it caught fire as 
soon as it crashed," said P. S. Shetty, airport manager in Bombay, where the 
hourlong flight originated. 
</P>
<P>
The crash was the first by the sophisticated Airbus 320 on a commercial flight. 
One of the planes crashed during a demonstration flight at an air show in 
eastern France in 1988, killing three people and injuring 50. 
</P>
<P>
Airline officials said the plane, which was an hour behind schedule, carried 
139 passengers and a crew of seven. 
</P>
<P>
One airline official said 17 foreigners were believed to be on the flight. The 
foreigners included two Americans, a Frenchman, two Canadians, three Japanese 
and a Hong Kong resident, all of whom survived, said the spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband's presence of mind helped me to get out of the aircraft through the 
back door," said Marook Sadhwa, a 29-year-old Canadian who was being treated 
for burns. "As soon as we came out, we ran for a few yards and there were two 
or three minor explosions." 
</P>
<P>
Local villagers rushed out of their huts and across the field littered with 
baggage and debris toward the flaming wreckage. Local police were called to try 
to keep them away. 
</P>
<P>
Airline officials did not know what caused the crash, but they said weather was 
not a factor. The jet was acquired by the nation's government-run domestic 
carrier about three months ago for $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
After Indian Airlines announced it was adding 31 Airbus 320s to its aging fleet 
of Boeing, Fokker and Avro planes, news reports criticized the airline for 
failing to adequately train pilots to fly the sophisticated aircraft, the first 
civilian airliner with a fully computerized flight control system. 
</P>
<P>
Developed at a cost of nearly $2 billion, the A320 was certified for flight on 
Feb. 26, 1988, and went into service in April, 1988.

The Boston School Committee found itself in another racial controversy today 
after it voted to oust Laval Wilson, the system's first black superintendent, 
in a move one supporter likened to a "lynching." 
</P>
<P>
In a stormy meeting Tuesday night, the School Committee, which fought 
court-imposed busing in the 1970s, voted 7 to 1 to negotiate to buy out the 
remainder of Wilson's contract. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's four black members and one white committee member walked out of 
the meeting and refused to participate in the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain members who cannot deal with a strong black man as the 
leader of the Boston public schools," said John O'Bryant, a senior black 
committee member. 
</P>
<P>
Several committee members who voted to buy out Wilson's contract said their 
decision was based on the superintendent's job performance and failure to 
communicate with various groups within the school system.

JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS DOWN 90%

Surging imports pushed Japan's trade surplus down 90% in January, its sharpest 
decline in five years, but the gap with the United States showed less dramatic 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
January's customs-cleared trade surplus fell to just $340 million from $3.25 
billion a year ago, the Finance Ministry reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The decline marks the ninth straight monthly narrowing of the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably an exaggeration of the trend but it shows the progress Japan 
is making in cutting the surplus," said Hidehiro Iwaki, economist at Nomura 
Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Exports shrank 3.8% -- the fourth consecutive monthly decline -- largely due to 
weak domestic demand in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Imports climbed 13.4% mainly on the back of hefty increases in crude oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
The improvement in the surplus with the United States was less impressive than 
the overall figure. The gap with the United States fell 25.9% to $2.20 billion 
from $2.97 billion a year earlier.

Exxon Corp. and the Justice Department are conducting plea negotiations over 
possible criminal charges stemming from last year's massive Exxon Valdez oil 
tanker spill, government sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between government and Exxon lawyers are focusing on a possible 
plea bargain to settle environmental criminal charges that could be brought, 
said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade confirmed discussions 
between department lawyers and Exxon but she declined to say if they involve 
negotiations over possible criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said prosecutors from the environmental crimes section of the 
department's Land and Natural Resources Division are participating in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's worst oil spill occurred last March when the 987-foot tanker Exxon 
Valdez ran aground on a reef along Alaska's southern coast, spilling more than 
10 million gallons of North Slope crude.

DREXEL PAPERS SHOW $25 MILLION OWED TO CALIF. PENSION PLAN

Wall Street started picking up the pieces today in the wake of Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Group Inc.'s filing for bankruptcy protection. Court papers revealed 
today that the state of California retirement system is owed $25 million as one 
of the larger creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel was expected to lay off at least 3,500 of its 5,300 employees in the 
most dramatic Wall Street downscaling to date. 
</P>
<P>
Employees scrambled to look for jobs in an industry that has been shrinking 
steadily since the October, 1987, stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Guards inspected boxes of personal belongings as employees left the downtown 
headquarters Tuesday night. Resumes and phone calls from Drexel workers flooded 
other Wall Street firms. 
</P>
<P>
While no formal layoffs were announced, employees considered their departure a 
foregone conclusion. Drexel brokers roamed the floor of the New York Stock 
Exchange openly soliciting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Employees were told they will get paid Thursday but there were no guarantees 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
"People were told the firm at some point is going to wind down," a Drexel 
executive said on condition of anonymity. "You don't need to draw a picture." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel President Frederick Joseph filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code late Tuesday in federal bankruptcy court in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
"DBL Group currently faces a liquidity crisis and does not have the financial 
resources to weather this storm without court protection," Drexel Chief 
Executive Frederick H. Joseph said in bankruptcy court papers obtained today. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph blamed the firm's demise largely on "a downturn in the financial 
markets." He said a slump in the market for commercial paper -- short-term IOUs 
issued to raise cash -- contracted in 1989 and Drexel was forced to repay $575 
million without selling new paper to replenish the supply. 
</P>
<P>
"The burden of meeting these obligations effectively wiped out DBL Group's 
liquidity, rendering it incapable of meeting other obligations as they 
matured," Joseph said in the papers. 
</P>
<P>
In its petition for bankruptcy court reorganization, the firm listed 
liabilities exceeding $3 billion and assets exceeding $3.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The largest creditor listed is Taiyo Mutual Life of Tokyo, owed $69.7 million. 
It is followed by Home Capital Services Inc., New York, $42.7 million; Banque 
Indosuez, Paris, $30.5 million; Sumitomo Life Insurance Com., Tokyo, and the 
state of California's retirement system, $25 million. Fourteen of the top 20 
creditors are foreign-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
The filing affects only the parent company, not the securities subsidiary. 
Broker-dealers are ineligible for Chapter 11 reorganization under federal 
bankruptcy law.

Imprisoned soul singer James Brown has been approved to participate in a 
work-release program, but details still must be worked out, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Several radio stations and the Benedict College music department are interested 
in the singer's talents. 
</P>
<P>
But the "Godfather of Soul" is leaning toward educating young people about the 
evils of drugs, said his attorney, Richard Crane of Nashville, Tenn., who was 
busy fielding numerous job offers for Brown on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Radio stations in Columbia, Charleston and North Augusta are interested in him 
as a disc jockey," Crane said, and Benedict College "has expressed interest in 
James working in the music department." 
</P>
<P>
Corrections Department spokesman Bennish Brown confirmed Tuesday that Brown's 
application for work release has been granted. 
</P>
<P>
Crane said, "Now all he needs is a bed and a job." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there are waiting lists for beds at the department's seven 
work-release centers, including those in Richland and Aiken counties, where 
Brown has expressed a preference. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is serving a six-year sentence in State Park Correctional Center in 
Columbia for failing to stop for police, aggravated assault and weapons 
violations in connection with a 1988 two-state car chase that began in Georgia.

FILMMAKERS RUSH TO CASH IN ON NOMINATIONS

<P>
Now that Academy Award nominations are out, filmmakers are scrambling to cash 
in on the honor. This year, there'll be a clamber for tickets to the Oscar show 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Before today's announcement of the nominations for the 62nd Academy Awards, 
filmmakers waged their high-priced advertisement campaigns for those who decide 
the nominations. 
</P>
<P>
But the announcements will be followed by a different kind of ad -- urging 
moviegoers to go see films considered by Hollywood to be among the best. 
</P>
<P>
"Driving Miss Daisy," "Born on the Fourth of July" and "Glory" are among the 
films favored to reap nomination benefits this year, along with leading 
performers Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy for "Daisy" and Tom Cruise in 
"Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
Television, radio and print ads for this year's nominees should start running 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But last year, a newspaper advertisement heralding Oscar nominations for "Rain 
Man" appeared the day the nominations were announced, meaning the ad was placed 
the night before nominees were revealed. 
</P>
<P>
The film's makers, MGM-UA, said the overzealous "Rain Man" spread was a 
mistake. But from a business perspective, the move made sense. Analysts figure 
that nominations can boost a film's gross by $10 million, while a best-picture 
Oscar can mean $20 million and more in extra revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The awards will be presented March 26 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the 
Music Center after two traffic-plagued years at the Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The move poses a big problem for the Academy, however, because the Shrine 
accommodated 5,800 people while the Music Center holds only 2,850. 
</P>
<P>
"Tickets are at a great premium," Academy spokesman Bob Werden said. "A lot of 
feelings are going to be hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Oscar tickets priced at $50 to $200 are sold to Academy members only on a 
first-come, first-served basis. In addition, the Academy gives blocks of 
tickets to preferred parties such as studios; the ABC network, which is 
broadcasting the show; TV sponsors; media executives and government officials.

The man credited with bringing football to Florida State University and helping 
the school grow into a major university from a small women's college is dead at 
89. 
</P>
<P>
Coyle E. Moore, known as "Mr. Florida State" for his service and contributions 
to the school for more than 60 years, died Tuesday at his home, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"He had more bearing on FSU athletics than any other individual anywhere, any 
time," football Coach Bobby Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore arrived at Florida State College for Women in 1928 and founded the 
Florida State School for Social Welfare. When the university began 
intercollegiate football in 1947, he was instrumental in persuading the 
University of Florida to play in Tallahassee, beginning in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Florida-Florida State games began, Moore said, "our image picked up . 
. . and we moved from inferior salaries and appropriations to something 
approaching par." 
</P>
<P>
Moore is survived by his wife of 62 years, Mabel, and a niece, Janet Poole 
Hicks of Wilmington, N.C.

JUDGE DECLARES MAPLE LEAFS BALLARD TO BE INCOMPETENT

<P>
Harold Ballard, the ailing owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs and once one of the 
key figures in the NHL, was ruled to be mentally incompetent by a district 
court judge today. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Donna Haley made her decision after reviewing reports from two doctors 
and two psychiatrists who examined the 86-year-old Ballard in his hospital room 
in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Harold Ballard should be declared 
incompetent," she said of the multimillionaire, who also owns Maple Leaf 
Gardens, his team's home arena. 
</P>
<P>
The judge backed an application by his three children, Bill, Harold and Mary 
Elizabeth Flynn, that a guardian be appointed to manage his personal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The Flynns' lawyer, Charles Scott, recommended in court that Ballard's longtime 
companion, Yolanda Ballard, should not have any control over him. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs owner checked in to a hospital in the Cayman Islands last month 
and was later transferred to Miami Baptist Hospital suffering from kidney 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
A Florida court appointed a guardian last month to handle Ballard's affairs 
until he is well enough to return to Toronto.

KEY PREP STARS CHOOSE TO PLAY FOR NEBRASKA U.

<P>
Calvin Jones, one of the nation's top-rated running backs, signed a national 
letter of intent to play football at Nebraska on the first day high school 
seniors can commit themselves in writing. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, from Omaha Central High School, was rated as the nation's fourth-best 
high school running back by SuperPrep Magazine in California. Jones is 6 feet 
tall and weighs 190 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Among Nebraska's other recruits was another prep All-American, Derek Brown of 
Anaheim. He was among the most highly publicized recruits in 1989, but he 
failed to meet academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
Others committing to Nebraska today were quarterback Todd Gragnano, 6-1, 185, 
of Los Alamitos; Brian Havens, 6-3, 240, also of Los Alamitos, and Brenden 
Stai, 6-4, 260, of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Although Notre Dame and Miami are expected to have two of the nation's top 
recruiting classes, the top quarterback in the country, Chris Weinke, is 
expected to sign today with Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State had a verbal commitment from Weinke, of St. Paul, Minn. At 6-5 
and 205 pounds, Weinke also captained his school's hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
Another highly rated quarterback, Cale Gundy of Midwest City, Okla., announced 
his intention of signing with Oklahoma, even though the Sooners are on NCAA 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a chance to fulfill my dreams," said Gundy, adding that he has wanted 
to play for Oklahoma since he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
Gundy, rated the No. 2 quarterback in the nation, isn't expected to sign a 
letter of intent until late today. He passed for more than 2,300 yards in his 
high school career. 
</P>
<P>
Gundy said baseball was a big factor in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel really good about attending the University of Oklahoma to play football 
and baseball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Sooners signed Aubrey Beavers of Houston, rated the No. 
1 defensive lineman in the country. Beavers bypassed national champion Miami to 
sign with the Sooners. 
</P>
<P>
Texas signed the nation's fourth-rated quarterback, Steve Clements of 
Huntsville, Tex., whose father is a coach and former Longhorn quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Clements said he may be asked to redshirt as a freshman. "If I did redshirt, it 
probably would be better for me," he said. "I only weigh 180. I need to get 
some meat on these bones." 
</P>
<P>
In Tuscaloosa, Alabama announced that it has signed South Miami High School 
linebacker Joey Veargis, rated 16th in the nation. Veargis said he also had 
offers from Florida State, Miami, Michigan and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at signing 23 players," said Gene Stallings, Alabama's new 
coach. "There might be a case where we'll sign 24 or 25, but we may hold back 
one or two scholarships."

FRANKLIN COLLBOHM DIES; FOUNDER OF RAND CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Franklin R. Collbohm, aerospace pioneer and founder of the prototype Santa 
Monica-based think tank called the RAND Corp., has died at his Palm Desert 
home. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
Collbohm died in his sleep Monday evening following a stroke three weeks ago, 
his daughter-in-law, Vera Collbohm, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"For two decades as he worked to found and build the RAND Corp., Frank Collbohm 
made signal contributions to the quality and integrity of the nation's security 
policies in general and to the Air Force in particular," Air Force Secretary 
Donald B. Rice, a former RAND president, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
An engineer and test pilot for Douglas Aircraft Co., Collbohm agreed to 
organize the research group in 1946, then called "Project RAND," at the 
suggestion of Army Air Corps Gen. Henry H. (Hap) Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
"RAND" had been the acronym for how the innovative group of Douglas scientists, 
statisticians and engineers referred to themselves -- the "research and 
development" department or "R and D." 
</P>
<P>
The name stuck when Collbohm separated the research group from Douglas in 1948 
to form the independent RAND Corp. He served as its director and president 
until his retirement in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"The standing joke around here about the name has always been that we do 
research and no development," said RAND spokesman Jess Cook. 
</P>
<P>
What RAND did do from its inception was research that launched the computer 
revolution, American Soviet studies at many universities, and the U.S. space 
program. Its first study, Cook said, was to demonstrate the engineering 
feasibility and policy desirability of Earth satellites. 
</P>
<P>
"During its early years under Collbohm," said Cook, "it is not an exaggeration 
to say that RAND was one of the intellectual centers of the Western World." 
</P>
<P>
The think tank perhaps became best known for its defense studies in areas such 
as nuclear strategy, aerial refueling and arms control. 
</P>
<P>
Originally set up as a research arm for the Air Force, RAND still receives more 
than 80% of its funding from the federal government. Over the years, its 
research has broadened to include civilian problem-solving techniques and 
social issues as well as strategic military and defense planning. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Collbohm became one of only 10 people given a Pioneer of Space Award 
from the National Space Club, an association of academic, government and 
aviation organizations. He promptly sent the plaque to RAND, saying the whole 
corporation had earned it. 
</P>
<P>
He also earned the Defense Department's Distinguished Public Service Medal and 
the U.S. Air Force's Exceptional Service Award. From 1960 to 1962, Collbohm 
served on the Defense Science Board. 
</P>
<P>
Collbohm was always careful to point out that tools developed on the basis of 
RAND research were only as good as the people who used them. 
</P>
<P>
Computers could be wonderful analytical tools for business, he told the 
American Management Assn. in 1957, adding: "In modern scientific analyses, the 
solutions are only as good and as sensible as the people who define the 
problem, state the objectives and choose the criteria. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York City, Collbohm studied engineering at the University of 
Wisconsin before moving west to work for Douglas in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
Collbohm soon became an aide to the company's founder, Donald Douglas, and 
served as a special consultant to the secretary of war during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Involved in designing and testing the DC-1, 2 and 3, he delighted fans of the 
DC-3 at its 50th anniversary celebration in 1985 by admitting candidly that he 
couldn't even remember the plane's first flight, even though he had been the 
co-pilot. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so routine," he said. "We'd been flying the (DC-1s) a lot and then the 
DC-2 and so the 3 was just another airplane in the line. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Frank Collbohm set the highest of standards for research for both the RAND 
Corp. and for all who follow in his footsteps," RAND senior fellow Gustave H. 
Shubert, a longtime friend of Collbohm, said after learning of Collbohm's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw one of RAND's primary functions as being a hair-shirt organization that 
could objectively assess what the Air Force and Defense Department were doing 
or proposed to do, whether or not officials in Washington would like it," 
Shubert said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Collbohm and his wife, Katherine, who died in 1980, had moved to the desert 
after his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by two sons, Robert of Santa Monica and Carl of Middleburg, 
Fla., two sisters and a brother, and one granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Collbohm said his father had asked that he be cremated with no memorial 
service. The family asked that any donations be made to the Make-a-Wish 
Foundation, an organization that tries to fulfill what often are the final 
wishes of the critically ill.
