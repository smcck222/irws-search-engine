Attorneys for Robert Alton Harris formally asked the state Supreme Court to put 
off their client's execution, set for April 3, while the court considers a new 
appeal. In seeking a postponement, the lawyers said they wanted the court to be 
able to consider the appeal without feeling time pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Without a delay, they said they feared that the court, which set a March 12 
deadline for the filing of legal papers, would produce a "rushed decision." 
Harris, 37, convicted in 1978 of the murders of two teen-age San Diego boys, is 
in line to become the first person executed in California in 23 years. Last 
month, the U.S. Supreme Court flatly rejected a broad challenge to Harris' 
death sentence.

The Santa Clara City Council has decided to wait until November, rather than 
June, to test voter opinion on whether the city should become the new home of 
baseball's San Francisco Giants. Council members voted 5 to 2 against a June 
ballot issue on whether to go ahead with plans for a new baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants and Santa Clara Mayor Everett Souza wanted a June vote, but those 
who favor November said the extra time is needed so specific plans can be 
developed. Last November, San Francisco voters rejected by a slim margin a 
measure calling for construction of a downtown ballpark for the National League 
team, which lost to the Oakland A's in last year's World Series. Team owner Bob 
Lurie has said he would commit himself to playing only one more season at 
Candlestick Park.

Presiding Justice Harmon G. Scoville of the Santa Ana division of the state's 
4th District Court of Appeal announced his retirement to accept the job of 
special master of the Buck Trust in Marin County. Scoville, 67, was appointed 
to the special master position by former Santa Clara County Judge Homer B. 
Thompson, who was placed in charge of the trust by the California Supreme Court 
more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The trust, worth more than $250 million, was left by the late Beryl Buck for 
the care of the needy and other charities in Marin County. When the San 
Francisco Foundation, which controlled the trust, tried to modify the terms to 
allow distribution of its funds to other counties, Marin County officials 
challenged it in court. Thompson presided over the trial in 1986 and ruled that 
the trust's funds must remain in Marin County.

ABE GOLDSTEIN, 94; CLOWN AND KEYSTONE KOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abe (Korkey) Goldstein, a professional clown and one of the last of that tiny 
band of mischievous madmen who once were the Keystone Kops in the silent film 
comedies of 75 years ago, has died at age 94, it was learned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He died at Hollywood Community Hospital last Friday, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Known as Korkey the Komic Kop, Goldstein had appeared most frequently before 
circus audiences as the keeper and tormentor of a series of "Teddys" -- canines 
of dubious breeding that would fall dead as Goldstein emptied a toy gun at them 
and then arise Lazarus-like to bite him on the gluteus maximus. 
</P>
<P>
Although not a Keystone regular ("I was an extra," he said in a 1986 interview. 
"I did 'bumps' (pratfalls) for the others"), Goldstein had a treasure trove of 
memories from those days of misadventure. 
</P>
<P>
He earned $2.50 a day, plus a box lunch and 10 cents carfare as he waited to 
perform his "bumps" on the old Mack Sennett lot. 
</P>
<P>
There the Kops vied with Sennett's Bathing Beauties in the fabled single-reel 
shorts that brought a new definition to slapstick, while stars such as Roscoe 
(Fatty) Arbuckle, Charlie Chase, Edgar Kennedy and Charlie Chaplin created the 
Sennett features on an adjacent set. 
</P>
<P>
He kept the traditional Keystone ensemble in his circus act, which he perfected 
over 70 years -- the baggy and shabby coat with its brass buttons, gaudy 
constable's helmet and flexible baton. In addition to the long departed Teddys, 
he had other animals that would prey on his posterior -- a hippopotamus and a 
chicken ("from Peru, Indiana") were but two. 
</P>
<P>
But as the circuses dwindled, so did Goldstein's income, until in his later 
years he appeared before small gatherings for only laughs and lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein told The Times in 1986 that he had begun his comic capers at age 10 
on Cincinnati street corners, improvising stunts while selling papers. He not 
only sold papers but got generous tips as well, and he soon abandoned 
journalism for jocularity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go in front of a theater after the show was over and say: 'Ladies and 
gentlemen! You're going to have a free show!' Afterward, I'd pass the hat. It 
was called 'buskin.' " 
</P>
<P>
Such other long-ago phrases as "Bozo," "First of May" and "Gilliper" (all 
turn-of-the-century terms for a rookie clown) passed often from his lips in 
that interview. 
</P>
<P>
As did his derision for his modern-day counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"I still got (my) timin'," he said. "Some of these clowns today, they just 
dress funny and can't do anything else." 
</P>
<P>
His wife of 44 years died in 1985, and Goldstein spent most of his later years 
in a small house in Hollywood, hoping for another offer. He performed for free 
at hospitals and children's clubs and even traveled to Dallas for a senior 
citizens commercial -- but "all I got was a round-trip plane ticket." 
</P>
<P>
He lamented that he was no longer able to put his feet on his shoulders or take 
his lumps with the "bumps." 
</P>
<P>
But it was still a good life, and he remained optimistic to his death. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a little dry spell," Goldstein said three years ago.

TALLY OF CONS PAROLED TO COUNTY UP 20% IN YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of murderers, sex offenders, drug dealers and convicted felons 
paroled to San Diego County increased 20% last year, according to statistics 
released this week by the state Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 2,224 inmates were released last year from state prisons to San Diego 
County, which ranks second behind Los Angeles County as a destination for those 
who have served in state prison, statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
That is 20% more than the 1,856 inmates released to the county in 1988 and 
nearly twice the number of parolees sent to the San Diego area just five years 
ago, according to the figures compiled by the department at the request of The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
The surge of parolees in San Diego County is part of a statewide trend. Experts 
say it is the inevitable consequence of the 1977 mandatory prison laws that 
have sent an unprecedented tide of criminals to prison. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us would lock them up for a long time, forever," said Linda Miller, 
spokeswoman for the San Diego district attorney's office. "But, what are you 
going to do? The more people you put in, it certainly makes sense that someday 
their sentences are going to be up and they are going to come back. 
</P>
<P>
"Which is not to say we're happy to have convicted criminals back in our 
midst," she said. "It is scary. Most of us know that people go into prison, and 
they come out much more hardened and sophisticated than when they go in." 
</P>
<P>
The mandatory sentencing laws took the decisions about prison terms away from 
judges and set the terms for automatic incarceration for those convicted of 
serious crimes, such as murder, rape, kidnaping, burglary and dealing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The champion for this get-tough approach has been Gov. George Deukmejian, who 
as a legislator wrote the "use a gun, go to jail" statutes as well as the 
state's death penalty law. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a rising tide of criminals sent off to state prisons, which 
held a record 87,863 inmates as of Jan. 28, say corrections officials. To keep 
pace with the booming population, the state has built seven major prison 
additions and seven new prisons, including the Richard J. Donovan prison on 
Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
But the same laws also call for an inmate to be automatically paroled to his 
home county, a feature that is now triggering a rising tide of parolees back to 
the streets. Inmates are paroled to the county, where they have established 
legal residence. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of these automatic paroles are given scant public attention, two 
highly publicized cases recently created such a furor that state corrections 
officials had to abort their routine of returning the criminals to their 
hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 release of Lawrence Singleton, convicted of raping a San Diego girl 
and then hacking off her arms, caused such a backlash in San Diego County and 
throughout the state that he had to be paroled to a trailer on state grounds at 
the San Quentin prison for a year. He was finally released unconditionally on 
April 25, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Orange County residents and other Californians protested the 
release of Charles David Rothenberg, who was convicted of attempted murder, 
arson and other crimes for setting his then 6-year-old son on fire in a Buena 
Park hotel room on March 3, 1983. The protests were led by Rothenberg's son, 
David, who told reporters he never wanted to see his father. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg was subsequently released to Northern California, some believe. 
Corrections officials on Tuesday declined to discuss his whereabouts, but say 
he is under 24-hour electronic and physical surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Such cases, however, are rare and parolees are routinely sent back to the 
county of legal residence when their time is up. Department studies show that 
about half of those former inmates wind up back in jail within two years, 
either for violating parole conditions or committing another crime. 
</P>
<P>
"The result of the Deukmejian get-tough-on-crime approach is now coming home to 
roost; it's now coming back to haunt us," said John Hagar, staff attorney for 
the American Civil Liberties Union. Hagar has represented inmates in lawsuits 
against the Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
"These same prosecutors told the public if we put people away for longer 
sentences in our clean, modern safe prisons that you -- the public -- will be 
safe," Hagar said, referring to the high recidivism of parolees. "And that 
wasn't true, because to put people away for longer periods of time in 
overcrowded institutions . . . made those people worse." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's statistics show that, statewide, the number of parolees has increased 
dramatically in the last five years. There were 18,861 criminals paroled in 
California in 1984, contrasted with 37,879 in 1989 -- a 101% increase. The 
increase between 1988 and 1989 was 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County received 14,593 parolees last year, a 10% increase over 
1988. As the state's most populous county, it receives the largest number of 
parolees, corrections officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of inmates paroled to San Diego County has increased 97% 
during the past five years, from 1,129 in 1984 to 2,224 in 1989. The increase 
in parolees in the last year, at 20%, was slightly higher than the state 
average. 
</P>
<P>
The increase was caused by a surge of paroled drug dealers and drug users, the 
statistics show. There were 460 drug-related inmates sent to San Diego county 
in 1989, contrasted with 349 in 1988 -- an increase of 32%. 
</P>
<P>
Other one-year increases, although slighter, include people convicted of first- 
and second-degree burglary (3%) and sex offenders, including rapists (17%). 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County and "all other county courts are just committing more and more 
people to prison, and that's what's driving the increasing inmate population 
and their release," said Robert Bowman, regional parole administrator. Bowman's 
office oversees parole offices in Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, 
Imperial and portions of Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the 1989 releases, there are about 18,000 prison parolees living in 
the 5 1/2-county area, with each parole officer responsible for an average of 
55 inmates, said Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County parolees are required to report to one of five offices. Two 
are downtown on India Street and two others are in El Cajon on North Magnolia 
Avenue. The fifth is a new office in Vista on Oceanside Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said the high-risk parolees are required to contact their parole officer 
with a personal visit or by telephone at least four times a month. In many 
cases, parolees are sent back to prison because routine urine tests show they 
have been using drugs, which is a violation of their parole guidelines.

MISSING GIRL SPOTTED IN NORTHERN FLORIDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A segment about the disappearance of 7-year-old Leticia Hernandez on a national 
broadcast of "America's Most Wanted" has resulted in a confirmed sighting of 
the little girl with her two abductors, police reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But, because the sighting occurred two days before the Feb. 4 broadcast, the 
witness, a gas station attendant, took no action at the time -- another 
frustrating twist in a case that has had investigators looking all across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The latest sighting of the Oceanside girl was on Feb. 2 at a service station in 
Panama City, Fla., off State Highway 98 and was confirmed Monday by FBI agents, 
said Bob George, spokesman for the Oceanside Police Department. In addition, he 
said, investigators still are checking out several other sightings in the 
Panama City area that also were called in as a result of the TV broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything fits right down the line," George said of the descriptions given by 
the gas station attendant. He said that the car also matched one seen at 
previous sightings -- a mid-size, faded maroon Buick with a tan interior. The 
car is believed to be a 1975 Buick Skylark. Based on the previous sightings, 
the license plates may be KK960, KK966 or KR966, or a combination of those 
numbers and letters. 
</P>
<P>
The little girl the attendant saw was missing her two front teeth, like 
Leticia, George said, but her hair was braided into two pigtails instead of 
one, he said. She was wearing a T-shirt with a design printed on the front. He 
did not know what kind of design. 
</P>
<P>
Seven-year-old Leticia has been missing from her family's Bush Street apartment 
since Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to think," said her mother, also named Leticia Hernandez, of 
the latest sighting. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's her. It's very strange that people see her, and see her, 
and see her, and no one stops them," she said. "Some of them (the sightings) 
must be false alarms." 
</P>
<P>
But in this case, police said, the man did not realize who the little girl or 
the adults were until he saw the television segment two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Since her disappearance, Leticia has been seen mostly at highway rest stops in 
California, near the Arizona-New Mexico border and in Texas. The last two 
reported sightings were in a shopping center in Mobile, Ala., on Jan. 19 and at 
a convenience store in Durango, Colo., on Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The Colorado sighting was the only one that failed to fit into a pattern of 
eastward travel through the southern United States. But Bill Krunglevich, 
spokesman for the Oceanside Police Department, said police are not discounting 
the validity of the Colorado sighting. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the information we had at the time, we have nothing to dispute, (the 
Durango sighting)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We could conjecture that they drove from Colorado to Florida. . . . It's not 
an astronomical distance," he said. "What they've been doing hasn't made any 
sense. They've been dropping in and out of sight since she disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, after law enforcement work was moved for the most part to the 
Colorado area, the efforts now are being concentrated in the northern Florida 
and southern Georgia area, Krunglevich said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still behind the people by about two weeks," he said. "We're hoping to 
get fresher leads." 
</P>
<P>
Leticia has been seen with a white man who is between 30 and 35 years old. He 
is about 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighs about 230 pounds. He is clean-shaven, 
with shoulder-length blond hair that is thinning at the top. The woman is also 
white, and may be in her mid-30s. She is 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs 
about 130 pounds. Her hair is bleached blond and collar-length. 
</P>
<P>
Leticia has brown eyes and brown hair. She is about 4 feet tall and weighs 
about 60 pounds.

SIBERIAN CHILL DELIVERS SNOWY SHOCK TO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Damaging freezes were predicted by early today for San Diego County strawberry 
and avocado growers as near-record low temperatures swept through Southern 
California in the wake of a bitter-cold Siberian air mass that sprinkled 
coastal areas with brief snow flurries Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The cold air accompanied a weather front that brought gusty winds and unusual 
flakes of snow to normally balmy coastal and inland valley areas across the 
county. Traces of snow were officially recorded at Poway, Ramona, Santee and 
Alpine, and brief flurries even surprised early-morning commuters in Encinitas 
and Del Mar. San Diego reported a trace of rain. 
</P>
<P>
Some agricultural damage would be inevitable from the cold predicted for both 
overnight and for early Thursday morning, Wilbur Shigehara, 
meteorologist-in-charge of the National Weather Service in San Diego, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara predicted that inland temperatures would plummet to 21 degrees or 
lower at Bonsall early today, where much of the county's $21-million annual 
strawberry crop is now grown. Wednesday night would be the coldest of the year, 
Shigehara said, with the temperatures hovering at the point where he issued a 
rare freeze warning Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
County agricultural officials predicted "only a light sleep" for most growers 
because frost alarms would probably sound by midnight as temperatures dipped 
below the freezing mark, along with clearing skies and calm winds. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency shelters for the homeless opened Wednesday night at National Guard 
armories in Vista and El Cajon because overnight temperatures in inland 
suburban locations were forecast to be in the low 30s or upper 20s. Donna 
Palmer of County Disaster Preparedness Office said the shelters would remain 
open until 7 a.m. today, then probably reopen at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego's emergency shelter at the Balboa Park Municipal Gym was 
not opened Wednesday night because forecasters predicted the overnight low in 
the city proper would dip to 37. That is 2 degrees above what city Office of 
Emergency Management officer Pat Sutton said is the threshold for declaring a 
cold emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Existing homeless shelters throughout downtown, including the Salvation Army 
and St. Vincent de Paul, did agree to take in more homeless than usual 
overnight because of the cold, Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
The cold Wednesday came as no surprise to Shigehara and his colleagues, who had 
been tracking the Siberian cold air mass since Friday, when it began to move 
southeast across Alaska and into the Western United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We actually began putting out warnings to growers over the weekend," Shigehara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The only measurable snow was at Mt. Laguna, where 4 inches fell as the 
temperature reached a high of only 34 degrees, after a low Wednesday morning of 
16, with a wind chill of minus 25 degrees because of 25 m.p.h. winds gusting in 
the Cuyamaca area. (The National Weather Service computes wind-chill 
temperatures when the air temperature is below 35 degrees and accompanied by 
measurable wind.) 
</P>
<P>
The official high at San Diego's Lindbergh Field was 52 degrees, only a degree 
above the record low high temperature of 51 set in 1903. Other highs included 
40 in Campo, 47 in Poway, 49 degrees on Point Loma, 51 at Fallbrook, 50 at San 
Diego State University and 57 at Oceanside. Coronado was the warmest spot at 60 
degrees. Today's predicted high in San Diego is 54 degrees, with near-record 
cold again tonight, followed by gradually warming days through Saturday, with a 
chance of light rain by late Friday as a new but milder front approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara explained that the weather front brought little precipitation because 
the accompanying air mass below the moisture was extremely dry. 
</P>
<P>
"We actually had rain with a humidity of 60%," Shigehara said. The coastal snow 
flurries resulted from the cold air mass keeping precipitation from turning 
into rain as it fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very unusual, since normally we don't get the cold coming from Siberia," 
Shigehara said. "Normally, we get the Yukon Express from the Arctic Circle or 
Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Shigehara said that such cold snaps usually bear down on Southern 
California in January. 
</P>
<P>
Growers were bracing overnight for the inevitable damage that comes with these 
air masses, particularly when temperatures in the low 20s last for several 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant County Agricultural Commissioner William Snodgrass said any major 
damage to strawberries would be costly for growers, since their crop now 
commands a premium price -- $2 a small basket. The berries are the only ones 
now being harvested in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Snodgrass said severe frost, in which temperatures in the low 20s last several 
hours, could damage not only ripened fruit but berries still developing in the 
ground. With such damage, plants would require up to 1 1/2 months to recover, 
by which time growers in Ventura and Monterey will be harvesting, bringing 
prices down to $1 for two or three baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is damage to the crops now, but the fruit can bounce back next week, 
then we're OK," Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
Snodgrass said that both berry and avocado growers would irrigate their plants 
overnight, because water -- at a temperature of about 50 degrees -- helps 
insulate crops -- even as the water freezes -- much in the way an igloo 
insulates. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the cold does not penetrate inside the fruit, the fruit is OK, 
although ice on citrus would result in some scarring" of the skin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the lack of wind and clearing skies could hurt some growers' efforts, 
Snodgrass warned, because wind creates friction as it moves over fields and 
groves and produces heat, and clouds radiate heat back to the ground. Without 
the wind and cloud cover, cold air will develop in a grove or basin, and 
becomes even colder as it settles undisturbed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although avocados are harvested at various times throughout the year, the 
predicted cold would have consequences as well for the $100-million a year 
crop. More avocados are grown in San Diego County than anywhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not that heavy a harvesting going on right now, but immature fruit 
could be hurt if the temperature went down, for example, to 23 degrees for four 
hours," Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit production could be affected for a season or more, depending on severity 
of the freeze to an avocado tree, he said. 
</P>
<P>

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN YSIDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Customs Service and the California Department of Motor Vehicles 
conducted their third joint inspection Wednesday morning at the San Ysidro port 
of entry to halt vehicles that fail to meet federal and state emission 
standards, said Bobbie Cassidy, United States Customs spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
From 6 a.m. to 11 a.m., DMV and California Highway Patrol officers issued about 
100 citations to drivers without licenses, registrations, or insurance, and to 
drivers whose vehicles released excessive exhaust fumes, said Curtis Booher, 
senior investigator for the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic reportedly flowed as usual, and routine customs and immigration 
inspections were conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Similar operations were held in October and December. A total of 221 citations 
were issued for violations. 
</P>
<P>
Recent federal studies have shown that air pollution has reached a serious 
state at the San Ysidro Port-of-Entry, Cassidy said. The problem is caused by 
incoming vehicles that do not meet federal emissions standards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy said inspectors suffer from coughing spells, nausea, dizziness, 
headaches, watering eyes and runny noses because of the fumes. Because of the 
problem, inspectors rotate job duties each day.

AL MARTINEZ: LIFE AT THE MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I was pumping gasoline at a self-service station in Arleta when a primate on a 
Harley-Davidson roared up in a cloud of exhaust and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
We were side by side at the pumps, me in my knitted mauve sweater and he at a 
stage of evolution rooted somewhere in the Lower Pleistocene. 
</P>
<P>
He began putting fuel in his chopper, and after a few moments I noticed he 
seemed to be staring at me in a manner not unlike that of a white shark 
observing a sea lion. 
</P>
<P>
I finally said, "How's it goin', man?" It was an effort to establish some form 
of primitive communication, which is difficult when you're wearing mauve. 
</P>
<P>
He remained silent for a moment, no doubt waiting for the message to reach his 
brain, and then said, "Who do you like?" 
</P>
<P>
I had no idea what he meant, but I wanted desperately to like what he liked, 
whether it was gang sex or simple mayhem in a beer bar. Then it hit me. The 
Fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," I said, "you mean Mike or Buster?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said, capping his gas tank, "I mean Jessica or Michelle." 
</P>
<P>
My mind raced as my face went blank. Hookers? Nude dancers? Motorcycle mamas 
from Bruno's Dead Dog Saloon? 
</P>
<P>
The biker shook his head, kicked his Harley to life and said, "For best 
actress, stupid." 
</P>
<P>
I almost clapped with joy. "Michelle!" I said instantly, knowing exactly what a 
biker would chose. 
</P>
<P>
He nodded, scratched, spit and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
The choice, of course, was between Michelle Pfeiffer or Jessica Lange, both of 
whom are up for an Academy Award, and both of whom possess the kinds of appeal 
that would stir a primate's most basic instincts. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two, however, I knew he would choose Michelle. 
</P>
<P>
The primate wasn't interested in the refinement of cinematic artistry, but in 
who could slither best across a piano top. Michelle can do that, all right. 
</P>
<P>
I mention the incident only to illustrate the degree of interest L.A. takes in 
the Oscars. We may not be able to name the prime minister of East Germany, but 
we can recite from memory the names of those up for Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
One possible exception to that is Leonid Kinskey, a stylish, Russian-born 
character actor of 87, who doesn't know who's up for what and doesn't really 
seem to care. 
</P>
<P>
The last movie he saw was "Prancer" and would probably vote for the reindeer if 
there were a category for best animal. 
</P>
<P>
You'd recognize Kinskey if you saw him but wouldn't know why. I'll tell you 
why. He was the bartender Sascha in the movie "Casablanca" who kissed Bogie 
(Rick) on both cheeks and said, "Boss, you did a wonderful thing!" 
</P>
<P>
Bogie replied, "Get away from me." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember what wonderful thing he did or why I kissed him on both 
cheeks," Kinskey said with a slight frown, "but at 87 does it matter?" 
</P>
<P>
Kinskey is one the few actors still alive who were in what some consider the 
greatest movie of all time. 
</P>
<P>
I met him in a Venice restaurant called, appropriately, Casablanca. Owner 
Carlos Haro held an evening in honor of Kinskey and Dan Seymour, a robust 75, 
who played Abdul, the Arab who guarded the door to the casino at Rick's. 
</P>
<P>
A third Casablanca survivor, Gregory Gay, wasn't able to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"Gregory doesn't even remember being in the movie," Kinskey confided later. "I 
had to remind him. He said, 'What did I do?' I said, 'You were the German 
ambassador.' He said, 'Are you sure?' I said, 'Of course!' " 
</P>
<P>
(Actually, he was a German banker in the movie, but what the hell.) 
</P>
<P>
Kinskey's pinched face, Pinocchio nose and Russian accent were familiar to 
movie audiences from 1932 to about 1956. Today, he lives in a North Hollywood 
home surrounded by mementos of the 100 or so films in which he was featured. 
</P>
<P>
A pathetic old man, alone and wallowing in the past? Au contraire. 
</P>
<P>
Trim, alert and modishly attired in blazer and slacks, Kinskey has outlived two 
wives and is presently married to a beautiful, talented 39-year-old artist 
named Tina York with studios in New York and Nuremberg. 
</P>
<P>
"She supports me," Kinskey said with a wave and a smile. "I'm an 87-year-old 
gigolo." 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding a taste for beauty, he has no idea who Michelle Pfeiffer is or 
why she slithered across a piano while singing "Making Whoopee." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean she isn't wonderful, Kinskey added quickly, just that even if 
he knew who she was he wouldn't bet on her chance of winning an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
"When Humphrey Bogart first came to Hollywood," he said, "I predicted he'd 
never make it because he was short, homely and lisped." Kinskey shrugged. "What 
do I know?" 
</P>
<P>
About as much as anyone.

ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
It turns out that the identical Paul Bunyans standing guard in front of a golf 
course in Carson, a gas station in East L.A. and a tire store in Van Nuys have 
hundreds of clones around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention a few big sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Dashew, whose fiberglass company gave birth to the 20-foot creatures 
between 1964 and 1974, recalled that the family of giants began when a Phoenix 
restaurateur wanted a large Paul Bunyan built to advertise his business. 
</P>
<P>
Dashew wisely kept the mold. 
</P>
<P>
A Nevada gas station dealer reported that his business doubled after he bought 
one of the statues. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Dashew's company was bombarded with requests for Bunyan varieties -- 
spacemen, pirates, cowboys and Indians (for Mohawk gasoline). A Bunyan-esque 
gal, Miss Uniroyal, wore a plastic bikini. 
</P>
<P>
"We were constantly making axes," recalled Dashew, who now writes books on 
sailing. "Wherever we had a lumberjack, college kids would steal his ax." 
</P>
<P>
Stricter sign standards around the country doomed the next generation of 
Bunyans. But other originals remain in this area, including a King Midas at a 
Whittier muffler shop and a Frosty Man-turned-Sombrero Man at a Foster's 
Freeze-turned-La Salsa restaurant in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
And where were all the oddball giants created? 
</P>
<P>
Why, in Venice, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Remember when those Oscars were being auctioned off in Hollywood last year? 
</P>
<P>
Such probably won't be the case with the statuette unveiled at the Carnegie

It really was chopped liver.

While we're on the subject, Sylvester Stallone dominated the nominations 
released by the Golden Raspberry Foundation, which honors Hollywood's biggest 
turkeys. Sly is up for Worst Actor of the Decade for a series of epics, 
including "Over the Top," in which he portrayed a sensitive arm wrestler.

There was Perry Como, the barber turned singing star. Then came Jon Peters, the 
hairdresser turned movie mogul. 
</P>
<P>
And, now, Vidal Sassoon, the one-man hairstyling industry turned . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mayor of L.A.? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Sassoon recently told the Boston Globe that he wants to be the successor 
to Tom Bradley. Perhaps he stands a chance, since there's no hair apparent 
(particularly not on the pate of city Councilman Nate Holden, who last 
challenged the mayor). 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica City College recently instituted a unique weekly break for all 
non-teaching employees, which is why anyone calling the school at mid-morning 
on Wednesdays hears this somewhat startling recorded message: 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for calling Santa Monica College. On Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 
10:30 a.m. all college departments are involved in a campus-wide reading 
program. It is requested that you call back after 10:30 a.m. However, if this 
is an emergency, please call the campus police. . . . Thank you for calling."

<P>
Now, shhhh. 
</P>
<P>
Barely half the seats were filled Wednesday for the noontime rally of the 
county Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility 
in the County Mall. 
</P>
<P>
The speakers included county Supervisor Mike Antonovich and state Assemblyman 
John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara). 
</P>
<P>
The weather was cold and windy. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was held outside. 
</P>
<P>
You could call the poor turnout evidence of a lack of self-esteem among 
downtown workers. 
</P>
<P>
Or of sound judgement.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OTAY MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Otay Mesa border crossing was closed for nearly an hour Wednesday by a 
small spill of paint solvent, a county health department official said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Hazardous Materials Management Team and the Fire Department's 
hazardous unit were called to the port of entry at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said traces of paint solvent were found but presented no danger. 
</P>
<P>
A truck, carrying 164, 55-gallon drums was parked at the U.S. Customs 
checkpoint when inspectors discovered the leak, fire officials said. Three 
drums were about one-third full, but only one leaked, said Gary Stephany, 
director of environmental health. 
</P>
<P>
He said that an environmental crime task force will meet to determine if 
charges should be filed against the company for violating federal and state 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Stephany said the materials were improperly stored, and the truck did not 
display a sign identifying the contents. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, who thought the drums were empty, works for a Mexican trucking 
company, Stephany said.

SANTA CLARITA COUNCIL VOTES AGAINST DUMP; 
</P>
<P>
CONFRONTATION: ARMED WITH NEW LEGAL ADVICE, THE CITY TAKES A STAND BEFORE 
COMPLETION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF THE ELSMERE CANYON LANDFILL PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Breaking sharply from its earlier wait-and-see stance, the Santa Clarita City 
Council has voted unanimously to oppose a plan by the city and county of Los 
Angeles to open a landfill at nearby Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Council members previously said they would remain neutral on the issue until 
the landfill's environmental review was completed. But revised advice from the 
Santa Clarita city attorney and increasing community pressure prompted the 
council to take a stand against the dump at Tuesday night's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not know that was going to happen last night, and we were pretty 
surprised," Marsha McLean, chairwoman of the Elsmere Canyon Preservation 
Committee, said Wednesday. "We've been pushing for this for some time." 
</P>
<P>
Council members had been advised previously that taking a position against the 
dump before completion of the environmental review would undermine their case 
if they were to file a subsequent legal challenge to the review's findings. 
</P>
<P>
"We received a new legal opinion," Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon said of 
Tuesday's vote to oppose the dump. "Our attorney felt we could do that and not 
prejudice our position if we do have to take legal action." 
</P>
<P>
Citing the confidential relationship between attorneys and their clients, Santa 
Clarita City Attorney Carl K. Newton declined to discuss what advice he had 
given the council regarding Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon said prior to Tuesday's meeting that council members, as individuals, 
had opposed the plan to place a garbage dump just outside the Santa Clarita 
city limits, about two miles northeast of the interchange of the Antelope 
Valley and Golden State freeways. "Now it's an official position," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the proposed landfill have charged that it will create traffic jams 
and lead to local air and water pollution. The 2,000-acre dump site is at a 
higher altitude than the city, and Santa Clarita residents say drainage from 
the dump could foul their underground water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The council did not allocate any money Tuesday for a court battle against the 
dump, but City Manager George Caravalho said he will use city reserve funds to 
work with local water agencies to study the dump's impact on ground water and 
to organize community opponents of the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the catalyst that starts the forward march to protect this city 
against what we perceive as an environmental threat," Mayor Jo Anne Darcy said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, a key proponent of new landfills, 
said the county will proceed with the Elsmere Canyon project despite the Santa 
Clarita City Council's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed, but the county will continue to move ahead with 
preparations" for the dump, Dana said through a spokesman. "The needs of the 
county as a whole dictate that additional landfill capacity be developed, and 
Elsmere is regarded as an outstanding location. We would, of course, have liked 
to have the city of Santa Clarita's participation." 
</P>
<P>
County and city officials have negotiated a tentative agreement to open the 
landfill, possibly as early as 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Deaton, a Los Angeles city legislative analyst who has been involved in the 
landfill talks, declined to comment on Santa Clarita's opposition to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city of Los Angeles has not given final approval to the project. 
"The decision whether to proceed or not is dependent on the outcome of the 
environmental review," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita Councilwoman Jan Heidt, who proposed Tuesday's landfill vote, 
complained that Los Angeles city and county officials have not involved Santa 
Clarita leaders in their planning for the Elsmere dump. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't let us in on what they're doing," she said. "This is something that 
is not good for the Santa Clarita Valley. I think the community expects us to 
keep it out of here." 
</P>
<P>
At a public forum in January that drew more than 200 residents, Santa Clarita 
council members heard overwhelming community opposition to the proposed 
landfill. With Tuesday's vote, the council rejected a tentative county proposal 
that called for Santa Clarita to refrain from opposing the landfill in exchange 
for various concessions, including a $1-million annual share of dump fees.

METRO RAIL EXTENSION ENDORSED; 
</P>
<P>
MASS TRANSIT: A COUNTY PANEL ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR A SUBWAY EXTENSION, BRUSHING 
ASIDE LIGHT RAIL AND LEAVING DISCUSSION OF A MONORAIL TO THE FULL 
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A county transit committee reviewing three rival San Fernando Valley rail plans 
Wednesday endorsed an extension of the Metro Rail subway, rejected a light-rail 
line and left open the question of whether a monorail should be built along the 
Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Although the committee recommendations to the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission did not appear to be a clear indication of the feelings of the full 
11-member commission, it represented the first public stance taken by several 
commission members on the volatile Valley rail issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any other need to fool around with the other alternatives," said 
committee member Christine E. Reed, voicing her support of the subway. "As much 
as I like light rail, it does not appear to be an alternative worth pursuing in 
the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, mass transit planners released a long-awaited report recommending 
three Valley rail alternatives: an extension of the Metro Rail subway from 
North Hollywood to the San Diego Freeway, a light rail in a shallow trench from 
North Hollywood to Warner Center and an elevated monorail line along the 
Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The three committee members in attendance directed transit staff to prepare 
final environmental reports to present to the full commission only on the 
subway plan, brushing aside the light-rail option. 
</P>
<P>
The committee members backed away from making any recommendations to the 
commission regarding the Ventura Freeway monorail proposal, the brainchild of 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
"We will make no comments or decision on the rest of the staff report," said 
Reed. "We will leave it to be fought out at the commission." 
</P>
<P>
Reed echoed the sentiments of members Jacki Bacharach and Bill Koreck, who 
represented Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
The committee serves as an advisory panel to the commission, which will 
ultimately decide the volatile Valley rail issue. The commission is building a 
countywide system of rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meeting was the first public discussion of the staff report. The 
majority of the 18 speakers at the meeting favored the 5.6-mile Metro Rail 
extension, which has the greatest support from homeowners and business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The subway route travels along the Southern Pacific freight right of way that 
parallels Chandler and Victory boulevards. It was proposed by state Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude as a 
compromise agreement to quell most complaints from homeowners who do not want 
any rail line disturbing their neighborhoods and business leaders who pushed 
for a rail line that would reach Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Nikolas Patsaouras, a member of the board of directors of the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District, spoke in favor of the subway alternative but 
injected his own proposal that the subway route run along Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Although the committee did not act on the suggestion, several members said that 
if the full commission ultimately selects the subway option, lengthy studies of 
alternative routes could be needed. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to put a subway in the Valley, where are we going to put it?" 
asked Bacharach. "We've never looked thoroughly at all the subway 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
Transit planners conducted a preliminary study of subway routes in 1983, but at 
the time the commission opted to pursue studies of light-rail alternatives, 
said commission spokesman Stephen H. Lantz. 
</P>
<P>
Koreck, Antonovich's representative, did not dissent from the vote in support 
of the subway. Instead, he said the commission has a "responsibility and 
obligation" to further study the monorail, an option for which Antonovich has 
heavily lobbied. 
</P>
<P>
Transit planners said Wednesday that it could take between three and six months 
for monorail studies and public hearings to be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has anticipated that between $600 million and $800 million will 
be available from local transit funds to build a rail line. The Valley is 
competing with two popular and non-controversial light-rail proposals for the 
same funds -- a line from El Segundo to Marina del Rey and another from 
downtown Los Angeles to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The full commission is expected to take up the Valley rail issue on Feb. 28.

MURDER TRIAL WITNESS SAYS HE LIED TO GET PLEA DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A key prosecution witness in the trial of a man charged with killing his 
grandfather testified Wednesday that he had fabricated stories he told police 
about the murder in hopes of obtaining favorable treatment after a 1988 
burglary arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Berkowitz was testifying in the murder trial of Noel P. Scott, 27, a 
struggling actor and musician, who was arrested last February and charged with 
killing Louis Fox, his 70-year-old grandfather. The murder allegedly occurred 
during a bungled October, 1983, robbery of Fox's Studio City house. 
</P>
<P>
The case was unsolved until five years after the slaying, when Berkowitz, who 
had been arrested on suspicion of five counts of commercial burglary, told the 
police he would "give them some information if they could cut me a deal." 
Berkowitz is serving a three-year state prison sentence for the burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz, 26, testified Wednesday that although he received no special 
treatment, he told police that he and Scott, a friend, met in a park several 
days after the murder. Berkowitz alleged that Scott asked him at the time how 
to alter fingerprints and how to beat a lie detector test. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz said he told authorities the truth about that incident. But, he 
testified, he also made up another story about Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Neither defense attorney Sherwin Edelberg nor Deputy Dist. Atty. Sidney D. 
Trapp Jr. would comment on the story that Berkowitz said he fabricated. 
</P>
<P>
However, the week of Scott's 1989 arrest, police detectives said Berkowitz had 
told them that Scott had confessed to the crime. Scott has denied killing his 
grandfather and said he was at a Hollywood club that night. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz testified that when a police investigator contacted him again in 
prison, several months after Scott had been arrested, he admitted that part of 
his earlier statement to police had been false. 
</P>
<P>
Edelberg said he believes authorities were unwilling to drop the case against 
Scott even after they found out that Berkowitz was lying. 
</P>
<P>
Trapp refused to comment on Berkowitz's testimony or the events leading up to 
or following Scott's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
On the witness stand, Berkowitz stood by his account of Scott's comments 
several days after the killing. Berkowitz testified that he and Scott were at 
the park when he noticed that all of Scott's fingers had been slashed, as if 
with a razor blade. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz said Scott told him he had cut his hands while repairing his car, but 
later asked him how to alter fingerprints and how to beat a polygraph test. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz's testimony is expected to continue today.

DRIVER DIES AFTER CROSSING MEDIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pickup traveling about 75 m.p.h. crossed a freeway median and collided 
head-on with a tractor-trailer truck near Palmdale Wednesday, killing the 
pickup's driver, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the dead man, a 46-year-old Palmdale resident, was not released 
because relatives had not been notified. The pickup was traveling north on the 
Antelope Valley Freeway when it drifted into the dirt median, became airborne 
and struck the southbound tractor-trailer, Officer Miguel Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the tractor-trailer, Aydalina Morales, 33, of Los Angeles, was 
treated at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center for minor injuries, Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred about 1:50 p.m. near Lake Palmdale, south of Palmdale, 
Siordia said.

BRODERICK SENDS AN UNWELCOME MESSAGE TO PROSECUTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elisabeth A. Broderick confirmed Wednesday that she sent a letter to the 
prosecutor in her murder case, in what she said was an attempt to show how 
unpleasant she finds her life in jail. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with The Times, Broderick said she recently received a 
card from a former jail inmate that she called "the most obscene thing you've 
ever seen in your whole life." So she sent the card to Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry 
Wells, the lead prosecutor in her case, along with a note that said, "Look what 
you're subjecting me to." 
</P>
<P>
"I figured if I had to be subjected to this, she should, too," said Broderick, 
who said the card depicted a pair of sunglasses resting on a man's genitals. 
She said the front of the card said "something like, 'To the coolest dude I 
know.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be friends with these people," Broderick said of her fellow 
inmates, many of whom treat her like "a celebrity. . . . But am I dumb? I'm 
going to be nice to these people. I want to get out alive." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick is accused of murdering her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick III, and 
his new wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick, last November in the master bedroom of 
their Hillcrest home. The district attorney's office contends that Elisabeth 
Broderick, angry that she had been shut out by her ex-husband and unable to win 
custody of their children, shot the couple in an act of vengeance. She has 
pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Wells acknowledged receiving the letter when she appeared in 
court to argue the merits of her subpoena for Elisabeth Broderick's bank 
records. Before she began her arguments, however, she told the judge that she 
had received "a letter from the defendant written to me." 
</P>
<P>
Later, outside the courtroom, Wells said: "It was not a letter I wanted to 
receive. It was vulgar." When pressed for details, she said: "I don't want to 
talk about the letter. It might be duly inflammatory, and I'm still concerned 
about having the trial in this community. You could say it was not a love 
letter." 
</P>
<P>
Jack M. Earley, Broderick's attorney, said his client had told him about the 
letter, but he had not seen it. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect that the letter was sent with a sense of humor," he said. "She 
has a tremendous sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick concurred that the letter had been sent in the comic spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful. You cannot suppress my sense of humor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge E. Mac Amos Jr. ruled in Wells' favor on two issues Wednesday: 
He denied Earley's motion to quash Wells' subpoena for the bank records, and, 
despite Earley's attempt to win a second bail review for his client, he 
confirmed bail as presently set -- none.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Register Voters 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 289 to 132, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2190) 
requiring states to make it easier for citizens to register to vote in federal 
elections. The bill enables eligible individuals to automatically register as 
part of getting a driver's license, authorizes registration by mail and sets up 
sign-up desks at some government offices in communities. It takes effect in 
1993. It combats fraud by requiring states to regularly purge voter rolls of 
the names of those no longer eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Martin Frost (D-Tex.) complained that "turnout in our elections is at 
an embarrassingly low level." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent William L. (Bill) Dickinson (R-Ala.) said the bill usurps the right of 
states to regulate voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes favored the bill.

Double-Hull Tankers 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 376 to 37, the House restated its position that oil tankers and 
barges using U.S. ports have double hulls. The standard would apply immediately 
to new vessels and within 15years to old ones, under terms of a pending bill 
(HR 1465) inspired by the Exxon Valdez oil spill last March in Alaska's Prince 
William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The House approved the double-hull requirement last year. The Senate included a 
softer requirement in its version of HR 1465. This vote instructed House 
conferees to insist on the tougher language when they negotiate final wording 
of the bill with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Dean A. Gallo (R-N.J.) said the Exxon Valdez spill "would not have 
occurred if the ship had been double hulled." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (D-La.) said that even if doubled hulled the 
tanker "would still have lost 200,000 gallons of oil in Prince William Sound." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes want double hulls for oil tankers.

To Register Voters 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 289 to 132, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2190) 
requiring states to make it easier for citizens to register to vote in federal 
elections. The bill enables eligible individuals to automatically register as 
part of getting a driver's license, authorizes registration by mail and sets up 
sign-up desks at some government offices in communities. It takes effect in 
1993. It combats fraud by requiring states to regularly purge voter rolls of 
the names of those no longer eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Martin Frost (D-Tex.) complained that "turnout in our elections is at 
an embarrassingly low level." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent William L. (Bill) Dickinson (R-Ala.) said the bill usurps the right of 
states to regulate voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes favored the bill.

Double-Hull Tankers 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 376 to 37, the House restated its position that oil tankers and 
barges using U.S. ports have double hulls. The standard would apply immediately 
to new vessels and within 15years to old ones, under terms of a pending bill 
(HR 1465) inspired by the Exxon Valdez oil spill last March in Alaska's Prince 
William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The House approved the double-hull requirement last year. The Senate included a 
softer requirement in its version of HR 1465. This vote instructed House 
conferees to insist on the tougher language when they negotiate final wording 
of the bill with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Dean A. Gallo (R-N.J.) said the Exxon Valdez spill "would not have 
occurred if the ship had been double hulled." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (D-La.) said that even if doubled hulled the 
tanker "would still have lost 200,000 gallons of oil in Prince William Sound." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes want double hulls for oil tankers.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MINISTERS OPPOSING GAMBLING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal by former Hawthorne Mayor Guy Hocker to legalize gambling in the 
city generated strong opposition this week when two Hawthorne ministers urged 
the City Council to reject the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor Bruce Chamberlain of Hope Chapel, Hawthorne, and the Rev. Earl Thornton 
of Del Aire Assembly of God Church told the council Monday that they oppose 
gambling because it can lead to other problems, such as higher crime rates, 
lower property values, and increases in gangs and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Chamberlain said the Ministerial Assn. of Hawthorne and Lawndale 
voted unanimously to oppose Hocker's plan. 
</P>
<P>
At a council meeting last month, Hocker said gambling revenues could help the 
city pay for a proposal by Police Chief Stephen Port to hire 40 police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
After the two ministers spoke Monday night, Hocker urged the council to place a 
measure on the ballot and allow voters to decide whether they want to legalize 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council took no action on Hocker's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In 1938, the city passed three anti-gambling ordinances specifically 
prohibiting draw poker and other forms of gambling.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED FOR FIRING AT TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Rancho Palos Verdes man has been placed on three years' probation after 
pleading no contest to a charge of firing a handgun into a carload of 
teen-agers on a scavenger hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Superior Court Judge John Shook also ordered Carl Faulkner, a 
44-year-contractor, to pay a $500 fine and to turn over his gun to authorities 
to be destroyed, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Geltz. 
</P>
<P>
Faulkner was charged with shooting into an occupied vehicle last June after he 
allegedly fired one shot into a car carrying three Rolling Hills High School 
students, slightly injuring a 16-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
The May 28 shooting occurred after the students had gone to the home of the 
school's varsity baseball coach, Gary Poe, to take Poe's license plate as a 
prank. 
</P>
<P>
Poe, alerted by his daughter that someone was outside their house, aborted the 
prank, sheriff's investigators said. As the youths sped off, Faulkner, a 
neighbor of Poe's, fired a shot at the vehicle, investigators said. Faulkner's 
home had recently been burglarized. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Faulkner pleaded no contest to a felony charge, Shook reduced it to 
a misdemeanor, which carries less severe probation violation penalties, Geltz 
said.

YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS IN L.A.

<TEXT>
<P>
If year-round school without air conditioning will be comfortable for Valley 
students, why doesn't the school district turn off the air conditioning in 
schools where it now exists and, especially, in the area offices and the board 
of education building. Think of the money that could be saved.

REP. HAWKINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is truly regrettable that Rep. Gus Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) has decided to 
resign after 28 years of fine representation. Hawkins has been a strong and 
powerful advocate for education, health and housing -- the most important 
issues of our times. 
</P>
<P>
His tenure has been unblemished, in contrast to mounting evidence of the 
decline of ethics in government. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of a school board, I am especially sorry to see him go. As chair of 
the House Education &amp; Labor Committee, Hawkins has fought hard to obtain 
more funding and support of educational programs and schools. Just last month, 
he proposed substantial funding in the new federal budget that would have 
nearly doubled federal spending in education. Perhaps the Administration will 
listen, particularly since new studies have shown how effective Head Start, one 
of Hawkins' favorite projects, can be. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Hawkins will long be known for his efforts to improve the lives of all 
citizens. His shoes are big, but I have no doubt that Assemblywoman Maxine 
Waters (D-Los Angeles), whom you identify as his "heir apparent," will continue 
his tradition. 
</P>
<P>
I'll miss you, Gus.

YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent media coverage, certain members of the Los Angeles School Board have 
stated, or at least implied, that white parents' opposition to year-round 
schools is racist. As one who has opposed many aspects of the district's 
year-round proposals, I deplore such accusations and feel they will only impede 
the achievement of a quality educational system. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic increase in the district's school-age population has caused 
logistical problems that even the most creative, well-financed school district 
would be hard-pressed to resolve. Sure, this increase has been made up almost 
exclusively of racial minorities, but the issue is clearly one of demographics, 
not race. The LAUSD has never been known for its creativity, and like other 
districts in California, is horribly under-funded. 
</P>
<P>
I personally opposed the district's proposals to the extent that they provided 
totally inadequate lead time and implemented the year-round calendar in a 
piecemeal, random fashion. However, I am also aware that the true, underlying 
problem is an entrenched bureaucracy which is being forced to work in the 
perennial crisis state which invariably results from a lack of resources. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, one effect of inadequate funding has been to divert much of our time and 
energy to the inherently destructive process of competing among ourselves for 
the limited slices of the educational pie. The need to fight for adequate 
funding and to work for creative solutions to educational issues are things on 
which we can all agree. Let's not get sidetracked by emotional and unproductive 
issues of race.

CENSORSHIP AND RAP SONG WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to Danny Goldberg's Op-Ed column "A Song's Just a 
Song; Censorship Is Wrong" (Feb. 7). Perhaps his perceptions of anti-Semitism 
have been blurred by his place in the world of music publishing; I find the 
lyrics quoted by him completely unambiguous and thoroughly, offensively, 
anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
He asks, "Why should Jewish sensitivity be more important (than those of women, 
gays, blacks, Catholics, etc.)?" 
</P>
<P>
He seems to have forgotten that 6 million of us died in the Nazi camps, a mass 
murder made possible, in part, by anti-Semitic propaganda. The German people 
were bombarded by Jew-hating speeches, newspapers, books, magazine articles, 
and yes, even songs. 
</P>
<P>
No, I am not advocating censorship of the recordings of Public Enemy, whose 
name, I think, speaks for itself. But a song is not always just a song, when it 
incites to hate -- and I will certainly exert my public opinion to express 
distaste for the publishing company which has chosen to record it. I had never 
heard of this record before Goldberg's column; I do not find anything amusing 
in rap music doggerel. 
</P>
<P>
I will now make time to write a letter to CBS, urging its officials to drop 
this group.

DECISION TO ALLOW BOOKS IS PRAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redondo Beach school board is to be commended for unanimously rejecting 
efforts to ban a series of grade-school readers at its meeting on Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
As a parent and a former elementary school teacher, I am aware of the process 
involved in choosing books for our children. 
</P>
<P>
I am also aware of the difficulties experienced today when we try to instill a 
love and excitement of reading in people of all ages. I would urge the parents 
who formed the Coalition of Concerned Parents to read to their children. If 
there are areas of conflict in any reading material, they have a perfect 
opportunity then to help their children as they form opinions and explore other 
points of view. What better way to increase exposure to an understanding and 
tolerance of the myriad of ideas available to us as we grow and mature? If we 
raise our children with only one, narrow view of life, what chance does the 
world have? How much better to trust them to choose their own beliefs as a 
result of having been excited and stimulated by the choices we are privileged 
to have available to us. 
</P>
<P>
Parents have the right to request alternative reading texts and, of course, to 
enroll their children in schools that reflect their views. I hope those who 
fear open communication of ideas and creativity will do just that. I will 
always want our public schools to reflect as much diversity as possible. 
</P>
<P>
I, too, will remember the decision of the Redondo Beach school trustees when 
election time rolls around.

NEW RULE HAS JET SKIERS GOING IN CIRCLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Personal watercraft -- commonly called Jet Skis -- will should have to travel 
counter-clockwise in two designated parts of Mission Bay, the City Council's 
Public Facilities and Recreation Committee decided Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The change had been recommended by George Loveland, park and recreation 
director. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for users of the small craft objected to the new rule, telling 
the committee that going in circles would prove so boring that people would 
wander into the general-use areas of the bay, creating worse dangers. The craft 
still are allowed in the general-use areas under the new rules, with no 
restrictions on their patterns of travel. 
</P>
<P>
"Jet Skis were designed . . . to be operated, safely, by making many course 
changes. It's very boring to ride a Jet Ski around in a big circle," said 
William E. Jacobs, an attorney for the San Diego Personal Watercraft Assn. "If 
you impose that obligation on people in that personal watercraft area, a large 
proportion of those users are going to go around that area a couple of times 
and they are going to shoot right out on the bay." 
</P>
<P>
If they do that, Jacobs said, they will get into more severe accidents with 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
(Personal watercraft is the generic name for the small, fast-moving vehicles 
marketed by Kawasaki as the Jet Ski and by Yamaha as the Wave Runner.) 
</P>
<P>
Although the committee approved the new safety measure anyway, it also required 
the park director to report on the measure's effects in the fall. Committee 
members Bob Filner, J. Bruce Henderson and Abbe Wolfsheimer voted for the 
measure; Judy McCarty and John Hartley voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
The measure will become effective when the new rules are posted, said Chris 
Brewster, captain of the city's lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-year-old boy died in September, 1988 while riding a Jet Ski, focusing 
public attention on the dangers of the watercraft. Thomas M. Ready broke his 
neck when he cut between a water skier and the tow-boat. 
</P>
<P>
City lifeguards held public hearings that fall with groups such as boat clubs 
and boat rental businesses and devised measures to increase safety in the bay, 
which went into effect last summer. Among them: all boats within 100 feet of 
the shore must travel at 5 m.p.h. or less and only water-ski boats are 
permitted within 200 feet of water-ski loading and take-off areas. 
Additionally, boating rules were posted at all boat launch ramps, and a second 
area north of the entrance to Fiesta Island was designated for the exclusive 
use of personal watercraft. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of boating accidents remained about the same, 
serious-injury accidents -- cases in which people went to the hospital -- 
dropped from 25 in 1888 to 11 in 1989, Brewster said. 
</P>
<P>
Brewster said after the meeting that 48 accidents were reported in Mission Bay 
in 1989. Of these, personal watercraft were involved in 19.

When 394,000 gallons of Alaskan crude oil flowed from a ruptured tanker into 
the ocean off Huntington Beach last week, the public response was dramatic. 
Orange County, known for its conservatism and lack of political activism, 
suddenly had local residents marching and carrying placards. Hundreds turned 
out to help with the cleanup. Many worked around the clock in caring for the 
stricken wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
The accident could not have come at a more politically significant time and 
place. Orange County is home to 1.2 million registered voters, more than 
650,000 of them Republican, which makes it the largest conservative voting bloc 
in the state. Indeed, a key to Republican victories throughout the past decade 
has been winning big in Orange County, where Republicans are loyal and 
Democratic swing voters are numerous. The victory margins of more than 300,000 
votes the county gave to Ronald Reagan, George Bush, George Deukmejian and Pete 
Wilson helped make possible Republican successes in a state with a Democratic 
majority. Thus, in 1990 the road to the governor's mansion runs through Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
There is increasing evidence that the spill, along with other recent 
environmental events, has turned county residents away from their typical 
pocketbook orientation and matured their views on ecological issues. In a 
county with a rate of volunteerism well below the national average, according 
to our most recent survey, people have been more than generous with their time 
during the cleanup. And residents who showed little concern about conservation 
in our earlier polls are now mounting large efforts to safeguard endangered 
wildlife. In this climate, concerns about taxes and the economy are likely to 
take on less importance. 
</P>
<P>
The local oil spill made real the bad news about the environment that residents 
had 
</P>
<P>
been hearing for more than a year. Reports about global problems such as the 
"greenhouse effect," atmospheric ozone depletion and deforestation have become 
increasingly dire. The Alaskan oil spill had devastating effects on fish, plant 
and wildlife. Closer to home, residents heard that a regional plan to reduce 
air pollution will require major changes in their lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
And now, with the governor's election nine months away, the environment 
promises to take on new importance in the minds of Orange County voters who 
watched helplessly as an oil slick approached their shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the oil spill is not the fault of the Republican Party. But a 
man-made disaster often spells trouble for those in power and opportunity for 
those who are not. Just as the Democrats were held responsible for the state's 
and the nation's economic woes, Republican administrations may now be 
vulnerable on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic candidates for governor, who had seized the environmental issue 
before the oil spill, will try to take advantage of the recent events. John Van 
de Kamp and his "Big Green" initiative have proposed to establish tanker safety 
standards and create a $500-million oil spill cleanup superfund, ban 
chlorofluorocarbons, phase out dangerous pesticides and institute 
tree-planting. Dianne Feinstein has proposed a growth commission to regulate 
environmental problems and a department of ocean resources to manage coastal 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Republican candidate Pete Wilson already had called for a California 
Environmental Protection Agency to direct the state's environmental policy and 
asked for restoration of funds to the state's Coastal Commission. After the oil 
spill, he called for double hulls on tankers and banning offshore oil drilling. 
With such efforts, Wilson is trying to establish an agenda separate from his 
party's stands on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's ability to distance himself from Republican leaders will be critical 
to his chances. Both Bush and Deukmejian had been accused earlier of waffling 
on the environment. Just two days before the oil spill, Bush angered 
environmentalists by refusing to institute an action plan for the 
global-warming issue. And on Monday, he rejected a ban on offshore drilling. 
Deukmejian also has voiced his continued support for offshore development. 
</P>
<P>
The spill off the coast of Orange County means that the environment will play a 
dominant role in the governor's race. Republicans can no longer avoid the 
issue. And Democrats will try to amplify it. The November election may, indeed, 
turn into a referendum on which party is to be trusted with the environment in 
the 1990s.

deputy director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and a longtime 
adviser on national security matters.

<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union appear to be moving in a timely manner 
toward significant reductions in strategic nuclear forces. Indeed, the 
successful meeting of Presidents Bush and Gorbachev at Malta opened prospects 
for broadening the network of cooperation between our two countries in economic 
as well as security and arms-control matters. Perhaps we should now explore 
possibilities for arms reductions that combine immediate and direct security 
benefits with cooperative economic gains for both countries. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, one country or the other has frequently been in the position of 
spending money to expand or modernize its forces in order to strengthen its 
bargaining position at the negotiating table. It would save a lot of time and 
money to negotiate a force reduction that both countries desire before 
investing in such a build-up. 
</P>
<P>
In order to make such an agreement more balanced and attractive, the money 
saved by the country that was no longer obliged to complete an expensive 
missile modernization program could then be applied to the benefit of both 
countries. For example, we could negotiate to remove land-based ICBMs that are 
both mobile and armed with multiple warheads. Many analysts have endorsed a ban 
on such systems, which are destabilizing as well as difficult to verify. 
However, the United States has just started to convert our existing MX 
multiple-warhead missiles to a mobile force that will match a similar one 
already deployed by the Soviet Union. Instead of waiting until that conversion 
has been completed, we should cut a deal now for their removal, applying the 
money we save to balance the benefits for both parties. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, it would have been impractical to propose economic cooperation 
in order to balance asymmetries in the reduction of military forces. But the 
extraordinary progress in East-West relations has given us hope that, moving 
beyond the Cold War, we might now succeed in achieving a balance. An excellent 
opportunity presents itself in the matter of land-based mobile ICBMs. 
</P>
<P>
The fixed, silo-based ICBM forces of both the United States and the Soviet 
Union are perceived as growing increasingly vulnerable to destruction. This 
vulnerability arises from two developments: Intercontinental missiles are now 
MIRVed -- armed with multiple warheads that can be independently delivered at 
one or more targets. And these warheads have achieved a high degree of 
accuracy. This combination leads to the possibility -- and threat -- that an 
attacker might have to use only one of his warheads (perhaps two) to destroy 
the warheads (as many as 10) on one MIRV-augmented missile housed in a single 
hardened underground silo. 
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce this threat, both countries have initiated very costly 
modernization programs for their ICBM forces. These programs have two 
components. One is to develop small, single-warhead ICBMs, identified as the 
Soviet SS-25 already in deployment, and the U.S. Midgetman currently under 
development. Thus both forces would be mobile. Also, the United States has 
undertaken a program to remove its 50 MIRVed MX missiles from their individual 
silos and deploy them as a rail-mobile force, as the Soviet Union has done with 
its MIRVed SS-24s. 
</P>
<P>
Putting aside operational complexities and added costs, mobile basing of these 
missiles raises serious concern about the ability to verify compliance with 
negotiated limits on the number deployed. The verification challenge for mobile 
basing is more difficult than simply counting silos; the means are annoyingly 
more intrusive and considerably more expensive. Concerns about accuracy in the 
count are intensified by the fact that, whatever the uncertainty on numbers of 
missiles, the uncertainty on numbers of threatening warheads is, for the SS-24 
and the MX, 10 times larger. 
</P>
<P>
This latter concern has led a broad spectrum of strategic analysts from both 
countries to urge a ban on deployment of these ICBMs in future negotiations on 
strategic arms. Such a ban is likely to be one of the goals in the next round 
of START. At that time, however, there will still be a large asymmetry between 
the two ICBM forces. Numerically they will be comparable, but Soviet SS-24s are 
already deployed -- at considerable expense -- as a rail-mobile, highly 
survivable force. In 1991, the United States will still be in the very early 
stages of constructing a rail-mobile system for its 50 MXs, which are now based 
in highly vulnerable underground silos. 
</P>
<P>
Will the United States be compelled to spend many billions of dollars and 
complete a rail-mobile deployment in order to establish symmetry before we can 
negotiate a draw-down (or return to silo basing)? Or can we negotiate a cut in 
the existing forces and, at the same time, establish an overall quid pro quo 
with the Soviets by putting the money saved to our mutual economic benefit? The 
reduction in numbers of missiles and warheads would be identical for both 
countries. The asymmetry would lie only in what the Soviets have already spent 
to deploy a more survivable mobile-basing scheme. It is these costs that would 
be compensated by a mutually beneficial economic deal. 
</P>
<P>
Many possibilities for establishing such a quid pro quo suggest themselves. One 
might involve funding for a joint technology program to develop and build 
"inherently safe" nuclear reactors for clean power. Three-Mile Island and 
Chernobyl are grim reminders that both countries have serious needs in this 
area; and the ominously looming problems of environmental damage, including 
global warming, caution us that safe, clean and economical power for the 
developed and developing nations is a very high priority issue for all. 
</P>
<P>
There are many other areas of economic collaboration that may be more 
practical, such as industrial modernization, improvement of the very 
inefficient system for food distribution in the Soviet Union and expanded job 
retraining programs in non-defense industries for both countries. 
</P>
<P>
The attractiveness of this simple scheme is that both countries reduce their 
forces equally in order to achieve a mutually desirable goal. Time, effort and 
money are all saved by implementing these reductions before both systems are 
fully converted to a more survivable basing, and any asymmetric financial 
advantages realized thereby can be applied to the economic advantage of both 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
The economic cooperation that this calls for no longer seems so visionary as to 
be dismissed as impractical.

KINGS BLOW 5-2 LEAD, LOSE AT DETROIT;

<P>
HOCKEY: THEY SUFFER THIRD CONSECUTIVE LOSS ON TRIP, WHICH ENDS TONIGHT IN 
MINNESOTA.

<TEXT>
<P>
You say your hockey club is going through rough times? 
</P>
<P>
You can't buy a victory? 
</P>
<P>
What do you do? 
</P>
<P>
Call the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
They went to Detroit Wednesday night, where they did wonders for a Red Wing 
club languishing at the bottom of the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Kings, Detroit (21-30-7) looked like a Stanley Cup champion. The 
Red Wings scored three third-period goals, the last completing a hat trick by 
Steve Yzerman, to beat the Kings, 6-5, before a sellout crowd of 19,875 at Joe 
Louis Arena . 
</P>
<P>
It was the Kings' fourth consecutive loss, third on this trip. In the last 
three, they have been unable to hold a lead in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
In Pittsburgh, they gave up four third-period goals. In Toronto, it was three. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past four games, they have been outscored, 12-2, in the final period 
and have given up a total of 23 goals. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a choice," said co-interim coach Cap Raeder. "You can sit and feel 
sorry for yourself, or you can get up off your rear end and say, 'Let's go.' 
This is no time to feel sorry for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The winning goal came with 37 seconds to play after King defenseman Larry 
Robinson lost the puck to Daniel Shank. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up," Robinson said, "and one of their players pinched down and took 
the puck away from me. Maybe I shouldn't have been going down, but that's all 
we've been doing, second-guessing ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Shank slid the puck to Yzerman, who took one stride and shot from about 15 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
"No one had swept the puck out," Yzerman said. "I was behind the play." He 
scored by punching the puck through on the short side, past goalie Ron Scott. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really aiming there," Yzerman said. "I just sort of shot it." 
</P>
<P>
It was his 45th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Yzerman's first goal, coming on a power play, tied the score in the first 
period after the Kings' Tomas Sandstrom scored his 24th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, 4-13-2 in 1990, looked as if they would finally have an easy night 
against a club they had beaten six consecutive times, outscoring them, 36-13, 
in the last five. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' Wayne Gretzky scored twice, ending a slump that had seen him score 
one goal in six games. 
</P>
<P>
His 30th of the season gave the Kings a 2-1 lead. Lee Norwood tied the score 
with his eighth goal to close out the first period, but then Dave Taylor (11th 
goal), Steve Duchesne (16th) and Gretzky again pushed the Kings into a 5-2 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been more. The Kings were zero of five on the power play, making 
them zero of 10 in their past two games. 
</P>
<P>
And they failed to score on a two-man advantage that lasted 1:03. 
</P>
<P>
They were still ahead, 5-2, with a minute left in the second period, but 
Gretzky lost the puck. Yzerman got two shots, the second going in. 
</P>
<P>
Then came another third-period collapse. Shawn Burr scored his 19th goal at 
5:39 to make the score 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Sheldon Kennedy picked off Robinson's attempt to clear the puck from the 
side of the net. Kennedy passed to Gerard Gallant in the slot. Gallant 
responded with his 28th goal at 9:12 to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom had two assists and Gretzky one to give them each three points, but 
both players were more concerned with other numbers, namely 24-28-6, the Kings' 
record. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had the answers," Robinson said. "It's just very discouraging. Guys 
are working their rear ends off, but everything that can and will go wrong 
has." 
</P>
<P>
The good news is, the Kings have only one game left on their trip, tonight in 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is, they will be playing three periods. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
When informed the point-scoring streak of Pittsburgh Penguin Mario Lemieux had 
ended at 46, five shy of his record, Wayne Gretzky said, "It would have been no 
problem if he had broken it." When informed Lemieux had left the ice because of 
pain in his back from a herniated disk, Gretzky added, "If he lost the streak 
because of an injury, that's really frustrating. Being able to play physically, 
that's what you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
A decision is expected Tuesday on the availability of Coach Tom Webster. He has 
an inner-ear injury, suffered when he fell in the shower in Edmonton Jan. 26. 
It's the same type of injury that forced him to resign as coach of the New York 
Rangers in 1986. Surgery corrected the original problem. Should surgery again 
be required, Webster would probably be unable to return this season. Would 
owner Bruce McNall continue the present setup, with assistant coaches Cap 
Raeder and Rick Wilson running the club? "That would probably be the best thing 
to do," McNall said. "But I have to talk to Rogie (Vachon, general manager) and 
to the two assistants to see if they feel comfortable with this setup." McNall 
ruled out the possibility of replacing Webster. "We'll hear what the doctors 
have to say and go from there, but in any and all cases, firing him is not an 
option" 
</P>
<P>
The NHL summoned Winnipeg Jet center Laurie Boschman to a hearing today because 
of a high-sticking incident in a game Feb. 8 at the Forum. "I'm not surprised 
they're having one," Boschman said. "I guess it looks pretty bad in the films." 
Boschman was ejected after coming up behind Tomas Sandstrom in the third period 
and running his stick over Sandstrom's helmet shield and into his face. . . . 
Both Mikael Lindholm and rookie goalie Robb Stauber have been sent to the 
team's minor league team in New Haven.

Hottest rumor in town is that Al Davis soon will announce that the Raiders are 
moving to Oakland. . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, a public hearing on Oakland's tentative offer to Davis isn't scheduled 
until March 7. As for Sacramento, that city's offer of a $50-million franchise 
relocation fee to Davis expires Feb. 28. . . .

It's time for Clipper owner Donald Sterling to give Coach Don Casey a contract 
extension. Forget the rest of the season. This is a crippled team. But Casey is 
the man who can bring the Clippers into the playoffs as early as next season. .

Ignored in the preseason ratings, UCLA's baseball team has advanced to No. 15 
in the Baseball America rankings and will be tested for class in a three-game

</P>
<P>
The considerable difference in talent between Missouri and Kansas was apparent 
the other night when the Tigers won handily in Lawrence. Roy Williams of the 
Jayhawks deserves to be coach of the year. . . .

<P>
That game between the nation's first- and second-ranked teams was worked

Interest in the Julio Cesar Chavez-Meldrick Taylor junior-welterweight title

TCU'S STRICKLAND SHOOTS DOWN ARKANSAS FROM LONG DISTANCE

<P>
Michael Strickland hit nine of 12 three-point shots as Texas Christian upset 
eighth-ranked Arkansas, 81-79, Wednesday night in a Southwest Conference game 
at Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland tied the SWC three-point record set by Texas' Travis Mays last year 
against Rice. All 27 of his points came on three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a couple of shots early, and that kept my confidence level up," 
Strickland said. "I wanted to keep my head up because I hadn't been shooting 
well lately." 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas' Lee Mayberry had five three-point shots in the second half and scored 
24 points for the Hogs, but it wasn't enough to overcome a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas dropped to 20-4 in losing its second consecutive SWC game after 11 
victories. TCU is 13-10 and 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Razorbacks lost Saturday, 82-77, to Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Duke 84, East Carolina 51 -- Freshman Billy McCaffrey, starting in place 
of injured Phil Henderson, scored 21 points to lead the Blue Devils at Durham, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Duke (21-4) beat East Carolina (12-15) for the 18th consecutive time. The 
Pirates of the Colonial Athletic Assn. have never beaten an Atlantic Coast 
Conference team, losing 45 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
No. 11 Oklahoma 85, Kansas State 69 -- Skeeter Henry and Smokey McCovery scored 
16 points apiece to lead the Sooners in a Big Eight Conference game at Norman, 
Okla. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 42nd consecutive home victory for Oklahoma (18-3, 6-2). Steve Henson 
scored 21 points to lead Kansas State (14-13, 4-5). 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Illinois 88, Northwestern 75 -- Kendall Gill scored 25 points at 
Champaign, Ill., as the Illini handed the Wildcats their 35th consecutive Big 
Ten road defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The Illini (18-5, 8-5) were in control most of the game, but had to hold off a 
Wildcat rally in the final minutes. Northwestern (8-14, 1-11) pulled within 
74-67 on a three-point shot by Rex Walters with 3:40 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But a basket and free throw by Ervin Small and two free throws by Stephen Bardo 
put Illinois ahead, 79-67, with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 St. John's 90, Seton Hall 81 -- Boo Harvey hit a three-point shot at the 
buzzer to force overtime and then scored 13 of his career-high 40 points in the 
extra session to lead the Redmen in a Big East Conference game at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the third in a row for the Redmen (20-6, 8-4) after a 
three-game losing streak and gave Coach Lou Carnesecca his 17th season of at 
least 20 victories in 22 years at St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
The win also moved the Redmen into a tie with Syracuse for third place in the 
conference. Seton Hall (10-12, 3-8) lost its fifth consecutive game, its 
longest streak since dropping eight in a row during the 1985-86 season. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 81, North Carolina 80 -- John Crotty scored 21 of his 27 points from 
three-point range to lead the Cavaliers in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at 
Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Crotty made seven of 13 three-point shot attempts as Virginia (15-7, 4-6) 
defeated North Carolina for only the fourth time in 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (17-9, 6-4) had a chance to win, but Scott Williams was long on 
a 15-foot jump shot as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn 75, Florida 55 -- Derrick Dennison scored 22 points, hitting nine of 10 
shots, as the Tigers handed the Gators their 10th consecutive loss in a 
Southeastern Conference game at Auburn, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn (10-14, 6-7) is the last team to lose to Florida. Since then, two 
veteran starters have left the Gators (6-15, 2-11). 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 79, Marquette 76 -- Joe Fredrick hit four free throws in the final 
two minutes and scored a season-high 22 points to lead the Fighting Irish at 
South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Marquette (11-10) was led by Trevor Powell's game-high 29 points. Notre Dame is 
13-8. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 81, Tennessee 80 -- David Midlick's three-point basket with 2:20 
left broke a 77-77 tie and the Rebels held off the Volunteers in a Southeastern 
Conference game at Oxford, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Houston had a game-high 37 points for Tennessee (12-10, 7-6). Gerald 
Glass had 30 for Mississippi (9-13, 6-7). 
</P>
<P>
Texas 79, Southern Methodist 68 -- Travis Mays scored 25 points to lead the 
Longhorns in a Southwest Conference game at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Texas is 17-6 and 10-3, a game behind Arkansas for the conference lead. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 74, Texas Tech 71 -- Carl Herrera scored a layup with 10 seconds 
remaining in overtime to lead the Cougars in a Southwest Conference game at 
Lubbock, Tex.

MARINA PLAYS GAME COACH'S WAY, ROLLS PAST CANYON SPRINGS, 61-49

<TEXT>
<P>
Marina High School did everything Coach Pete Bonny figured it would Wednesday 
night against Canyon Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings forced some early turnovers and steered the ball away from the 
Cougars' leading scorer, Vanessa Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Vikings built a 10-point lead in the second quarter and held on for a 
61-49 victory over Canyon Springs in the first round of the Southern Section 
5-A playoffs at the Marina gym. 
</P>
<P>
Bonny said he wanted the Vikings to pressure Canyon Springs' guards and keep 
the ball from Harris, who averages 16 points and 11 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
No problem. The Vikings forced 27 Cougar turnovers, including 17 in the first 
half, and held Harris to eight points on four-of-10 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy with our press," Bonny said. "It caused them problems the entire 
game. I watched the film of their game against Edison and I noticed they had 
problems with the press." 
</P>
<P>
Marina forced eight early turnovers, but led by only 13-11 at the end of the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a lot of turnovers and the game should have been over," Bonny said. "We 
didn't get rattled though. We took a lot of good shots." 
</P>
<P>
Those good shots started to fall in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 16-16, Melisa Sortino made two consecutive three-pointers 
to spark a 16-6 run and give Marina a 32-22 halftime lead. Sortino finished 
with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big run for us," Bonny said. "Those three-pointers are momentum 
starters. That's what got us going." 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings scored the first six points of the third quarter to push the lead 
to 38-22. They led by as many as 19 in the fourth quarter and Canyon Springs 
came no closer than 11 the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Tina DeMarsh scored a game-high 19 points for Canyon Springs (16-10). Christa 
Yorke had 14 points and Gillian Bean added 10 for Marina. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings (19-7) advanced to the second round Saturday night against Ontario 
(26-0), which had a first-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
And that meant one more scouting report for Bonny. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been making some calls about them," he said. "I know they know about us, 
because they've been here to scout us. I heard they walk it downcourt and pound 
it in. Scouting them will be my job for the next couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
In other 5-A games: 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 71, Corona 39 -- Host Esperanza (19-4) led, 26-4, in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Kordik had 22 points and Jennifer Harney added 15 points and eight assists 
to lead Esperanza. Andrea Warmus had 11 points for Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
Orange 53, Diamond Bar 29 -- Orange led, 21-19, at halftime, but outscored 
Diamond Bar 19-6 in the third quarter and 13-4 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Nichole Champion scored 14 of her game-high 28 points in the third quarter. She 
also made 10 of 10 free throws and had 13 rebounds in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Sallinger had six assist for the Panthers (17-6). 
</P>
<P>
Amy Fu scored 10 points, eight in the first half for Diamond Bar (12-12). 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 71, Moreno Valley 39 -- El Toro used a full-court press to build a 23-8 
lead in the first quarter and led, 43-19, at halftime. The Chargers cleared 
their bench in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Karie Yoshioka had 16 points, six assists and seven steals for El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Bone added 19 points and nine rebounds and Danielle Silva had 15 points 
for the Chargers (23-5). 
</P>
<P>
Natanya White had 25 points for Moreno Valley (8-13). 
</P>
<P>
Rubidoux 52, Huntington Beach 48 -- Darlene Wilson, Rubidoux's 6-foot-5 
forward, scored 17 points at Rubidoux. 
</P>
<P>
Jana Davis and Dana Jahr each had 15 points for Huntington Beach (9-16), which 
made its first playoff appearance since 1982.

fourth quarter, leading Torrance High School to a 55-52 upset over Tustin in 
the first round of the Southern Section 4-AA girls' playoffs Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (21-6 overall and unbeaten in the Sea View League) led by as many as 10 
points in the first half.

<P>
Torrance (16-10) took its first lead, 31-29, with 2:01 left in the third

three-point basket to cut Torrance's advantage to 53-52 with 52 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
But Tiffany Fujimoto then made two free throws to put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance, an at-large entry in the playoffs, was led by Misipeka, who had 15 
points and seven rebounds, and Fujimoto, who led all scorers with 20.

added 10, and Needham had nine. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin's Christine Garner, who entered the game averaging 16 points a game, 
scored eight points in the first half. But Torrance held her scoreless after 
that. STUART MATTHEWS

million.

Revenue totaled a record $11.2 billion, up 2%. In the fourth quarter, the 
Detroit firm posted record earnings of $183 million, a gain of 8%. Revenue 
totaled $2.9 billion, off 6%. The results were attributed to a one-time charge 
for costs associated with an employee separation and early retirement plan at 
Hughes Aircraft Co. that reduced its total employment by 12%.

Fremont General Corp: The Santa Monica-based insurance and financial services 
company said its 1989 income rose 16% from 1988 to $17.6 million on revenue of 
$466.5 million, up 18%. Fourth-quarter net income soared to $9.49 million from 
$465,000 a year ago, as revenue climbed 30% to $127.2 million. The firm singled 
out a strong performance by its workers' compensation insurance companies and 
its $1-billion investment portfolio. 1989 earnings would have been 
significantly higher except for a second-quarter provision of $11.3 million to 
cover potential losses on loans in the Fremont Financial Corp. subsidiary.

COMPUTER FILE: TWO COMPUTERS THAT SHINE IN DIFFERENT JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently I had the opportunity to use two portable computers from opposite ends 
of the price and power scale. Each serves a very different purpose, and each 
does so delightfully well. 
</P>
<P>
One, the Goupil Golf 386 SX, is a fast, sleek and innovative French-built 
beauty aimed at users who want a single computer that has all the power and 
features of a desktop machine yet is easy to take on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The other, Tandy's 1100FD, is designed to be a low-priced second computer 
mainly for use away from the office. It is light, runs about four hours on a 
battery charge and comes loaded with plenty of software. It is a recent 
introduction to fill the low end of Tandy's MS-DOS-compatible line of 
portables. 
</P>
<P>
The 1100FD, selling for $999 at any Radio Shack store, is a 6.4-pound machine 
with a single floppy drive, a reflective screen that achieves good contrast 
with blue characters against a greenish-yellow background and 640 kilobytes of 
operating memory. 
</P>
<P>
Goupil's Golf 386 SX, imported by Computer Peripherals of Newbury Park, is a 
fully equipped 386-class computer with 1 megabyte of operating memory, a 
high-resolution black and white screen, detached keyboard, internal expansion 
slots and either 40 or 100 megabytes of hard disk storage. 
</P>
<P>
It weighs 16.4 pounds and has a suggested retail price of $6,495 for the 
40-megabyte model or $7,140 for the 100-megabyte unit. Substantial discounts 
should reduce the street price of the Goupil Golf, while Tandy models are 
seldom discounted. 
</P>
<P>
With 100 megabytes of storage, a 16-megahertz Intel 80386 SX microprocessor for 
operating power and up to 9 megabytes of on-board memory, the Golf is able to 
handle any software application likely to be required of a desktop machine. 
Whether the operating system is MS-DOS, which is shipped with the computer, or 
OS/2 or even UNIX, the power to handle it is there. 
</P>
<P>
Provision inside the low, satin-black case for two standard three-quarters-size 
PC/XT-type expansion cards makes it easy to install both a modem and a network 
card inside the machine. The inside of this machine is impressive. The case is 
hinged, and just five screws hold everything in place. 
</P>
<P>
The flat, "cold cathode backlit super-twist LCD" screen with eight shades of 
gray graphics folds snugly against the top of the system unit when not in use, 
or hinges upright. A panel of six buttons below the screen also allows you to 
quickly adjust its appearance, so you can reverse black for white, control the 
gray scales and set brightness and contrast. 
</P>
<P>
The screen is the same size and aspect ratio as a standard computer monitor, so 
there is no loss of definition or any deformation of the image. At the office, 
it would be very simple to substitute a color monitor by simply leaving the 
monochrome unit folded down and attaching the color monitor's cable to a 
connector on the back of the computer. 
</P>
<P>
The Golf's keyboard is unusual among portables because it is separate from the 
computer unit. Its 101 keys are fully compatible with those of a standard PC 
keyboard, but the layout is a little different because the keyboard is not as 
wide. It does retain the separate cursor, editing keys and numerical keypad of 
the standard unit. A 7-foot coiled cord attaches it to the back of the 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the computer are connectors for parallel and serial printers or other 
devices, a mouse and an external 5 1/4-inch disk drive. A high-density, 
1.44-megabyte 3 1/2-inch floppy drive is built in. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than try to package the computer, screen and keyboard so that it folds 
up into one unit for transport, Computer Peripherals' Goupil Golf relies on a 
well-engineered carrying case to haul the separate computer and keyboard units. 
The entire package has won design awards in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting its continental heritage, the Golf is a globe-trotting machine with 
built-in ability to sense the electrical strength of the power source it is 
connected to and adjust itself accordingly. There's no need to set switches. Of 
course, with a computer of this magnitude, battery power is not practical, so 
you'll have to wait until you get to an office or hotel room to use it while 
you are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Tandy 1100FD, on the other hand, is very practical to use with battery 
power. It's just about ideal for working on your lap in a crowded conference 
room or on the tray of an airline seat without disturbing your neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
I got a little more than four hours out of its fully charged, sealed lead-acid 
battery. 
</P>
<P>
The Tandy keyboard is built in and the 4.75-by-7.69-inch screen folds flat to 
cover the keys when not in use. The display technology is called "super-twisted 
nematic LCD." There are 84 keys, and it is possible to use them in combination 
to mimic all of the keys available on standard IBM and compatible keyboards. 
But it isn't as convenient.

One thing that sets the Tandy apart from many other low-priced portables is the 
built-in software, called DeskMate. It's really all you need on the road. 
Included are the mainstay business applications: word processing, database, 
spreadsheet and telecommunications. There also is a drawing program, a game 
called "Hangman" and software to connect with an optional on-line electronic 
information and entertainment service known as "PC-Link." 
</P>
<P>
There is a collection of "desk accessories," too, including a calculator, a 
spelling checker, a phone list, a place to store notes called "corkboard," a 
calendar and scheduler with alarms and a to-do list. 
</P>
<P>
Tandy keeps the 1100FD light in weight by equipping it with only a single 3 
1/2-inch, 720-kilobyte floppy disk. A portion of the DeskMate software, along 
with the basic functions of the MS-DOS operating system, are built into the 
computer in what is known as "read-only memory," or ROM, where it can be used 
but never altered or erased. 
</P>
<P>
One of the DeskMate functions that is embedded in ROM is the word processing 
software. Thus you can use the entire disk in the floppy drive for text 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
If Tandy had not built DeskMate and MS-DOS into the computer, it wouldn't be 
very useful with just one floppy drive because most of the disk would be used 
to store the operating system and program software, leaving little room for 
data.

ART BUCHWALD: THAT'LL SURE MAKE 'EM THINK TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been a tough time for people involved with Irangate. Gen. Richard Secord 
was sentenced to two years' probation for his role as one of the architects of 
the infamous arms plot. 
</P>
<P>
Most people were shaken by the harsh sentence. The next one was even tougher. 
Albert Hakim, another conspirator, was given two years' probation and a fine of 
$5,000. He was punished further by being told that the only money he could keep 
from the plot was the $1.7 million he had deposited in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
"Why the cruel and unusual punishment?" civil libertarians wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to teach a lesson to everyone who flouts the law," the Lord High 
Chief Plea-Bargainer in the Justice Department informed me. "When people see 
what Ollie North, Secord and Hakim got they will think twice about diddling 
with the law of the land." 
</P>
<P>
"Be honest. Didn't you roll over and make a deal with Secord and Hakim so that 
they would testify against Poindexter? Isn't he the last link in the chain that 
leads straight to the Oval Office?" 
</P>
<P>
"If we had made a deal with both of them, why would we insist on such harsh 
probation? The Justice Department doesn't make deals with people who plead 
guilty to high crimes and misdemeanors." 
</P>
<P>
"The rumor on the street is that you're always willing to make deals -- no 
matter what the felon does. There is a story out that you will drop charges 
against Noriega if he turns state's evidence and testifies against Fidel Castro 
and Manuel Ortega." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no truth to that at all," he assured me. "We do not plea-bargain with 
prisoners of war. Noriega will be given all his rights according to the Geneva 
Convention, where, incidentally, he has all his money. He will then receive the 
sentence he is entitled to, depending on his name, rank and serial number." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe you," I said. "Suppose Noriega ratted on Imelda Marcos, would that 
get him tickets to the Super Bowl?" 
</P>
<P>
"We only make deals if a person can lead us to other people. Now, if Noriega 
wanted to tell us what he knew about Leona Helmsley, we might start talking 
about putting him in a minimum-security lockup. But he's going to have to give 
us more than her old IRS 1040 returns. It'll be hard for Noriega to 
plea-bargain with us when we've told the whole world that he's Mr. Big." 
</P>
<P>
"Suppose Noriega demands that every American secret be produced at his trial? 
Will you plea-bargain with him just to shut him up?" 
</P>
<P>
"We will never be reasonable with anyone who puts the government in an 
embarrassing position. The Justice Department must prosecute those who resort 
to lawless behavior, whether they take money from the Iranians, the Contras or 
a savings and loan bank in Albuquerque. If we're going to be tough on North, 
Secord and Hakim, then we have to be just as tough on Noriega. After all, we 
started a war to get him." 
</P>
<P>
"Speaking of war," I said, "has it ever occurred to you that since Noriega is a 
prisoner of war, he is entitled to a ticker-tape parade?" 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to get one. We didn't give one to North or Secord or Hakim, and 
Poindexter won't get one either, even if he blows the whistle on Ronald 
Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because ticker tapes could give people the wrong idea when it comes to 
violating the law."

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: GERMAN ANCESTOR'S ENGLISH NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA V. GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My ancestor, William Felton, was born in the lowlands of Germany 
about 1770 and arrived in America in 1776 with his parents and two older 
brothers, John and Robert. The parents supposedly died shortly thereafter, 
probably in Pennsylvania. What puzzles me is that Felton is not a German name, 
and I have been unable to find this family on ship passenger lists from 
Germany. My ancestor was bound to a man who raised him in the Presbyterian 
faith. Is it possible he took another name? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Anything is possible in genealogy. Felton is an English location name; 
from Old English meaning feld (pasture or open country) plus tun (enclosure). 
It also is spelled Felten, and to add to the confusion, there is a German 
surname spelled Felten or Feldten. 
</P>
<P>
However, with sons named John, Robert and William, I suspect your family is of 
English origins even though your ancestor supposedly was born in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
You need to make a thorough check in the probate and orphans' court records in 
the county where your immigrant ancestors died. Therein may be additional 
information on this line's origins. 
</P>
<P>
Ship passenger records are not complete for this time period. Examine the 1790 
Census for Felton and Feltin families. There were 53 heads of households with 
this surname -- most of them in New England, but four were in Pennsylvania at 
that time. The older brothers probably were heads of household when the 1790 
Census was taken, and it may be necessary to research them to learn more about 
your ancestor. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My maiden name was Musick, which my father says may have been of Czech 
origin. I have seen it spelled Muzik also. Great-grandpa was born in Missouri 
about 1856 in St. Joseph or Jefferson City. Do you have any clues to this 
name's origins? 
</P>
<P>
A: Musick or Music is Polish for peasant or vassal. However, Muzik is Czech -- 
an affectionate nickname for a man of short stature. 
</P>
<P>
These names would have sounded alike to American record-keepers, so your family 
tradition of being Czech is most likely correct. Since your family settled in 
Missouri in the mid-1800s, they probably came during the time of mass 
immigration of Czechs -- who came due to the drought and crop failures in the 
1840s and a revolution in 1848. Possibly your family left from the ports of 
Hamburg or Bremen in Germany and sailed either to New York or Galveston, Tex. 
Many Czechs settled in small towns and villages in Missouri. Examine the 1850 
and 1860 census records of Missouri for more clues; and check for 
naturalization papers. Look for all spellings of your name. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you tell me the origins of the surname Hendricks? 
</P>
<P>
A: Hendricks, also found spelled Hendrick, Hendrich and Hendrix, is of German 
origins, meaning a descendant of Heinrich, the German form of Henry, which 
literally means "home, rule." German surnames were originally formed from two 
roots that often have unrelated meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My surname is Fant, which I seldom find. My folks were Swedes, but this name 
does not sound Swedish. Is it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Fant has some English roots, as a nickname, meaning an immature person, one 
with the characteristics of a child. However, the name could have been derived 
from "Infante" of Italian and Spanish origins. 
</P>
<P>
How your father's Swedish family came to acquire this name will require a 
fascinating research into genealogical records.

ERMA BOMBECK: MOM 'DOESN'T WORK'? HA! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She described herself as a "rare breed who made a conscious decision to stop 
work, stay at home and raise our child." 
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that she's discovered it was a heck of a lot simpler to 
manage an office of 20 employees (10 with PMS) than to be a full-time 
homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem, she writes, is, "How do you explain to people who ask, 'What 
do you do with yourself all day?' " 
</P>
<P>
It's the oldest question in the world. People never wait around for the answer. 
They probably won't read to the end of this column, but here are some of the 
answers shared by my readers through the years: 
</P>
<P>
Thaw hamburger in the dry cycle of the dishwasher. Worm the dog, play cards 
with a sick child who cheats, dress naked dolls, take phone messages for people 
with a social life, make Christmas ornaments out of lint. Nurse a dead fern 
that cost $20. 
</P>
<P>
* "I spent an entire morning at the hospital when one of my kids swallowed a 
rock," wrote one mother. "When I asked her why, she said she wasn't allowed to 
eat any food before dinner and she was hungry. Surgery is scheduled for 
Monday." 
</P>
<P>
* "We looked everywhere for Marlene's sock. It turned up on the inside of her 
brother's shirt during a social studies test." 
</P>
<P>
* "It took a whole day to clean the stove, but it was worth all the chipping, 
scrubbing and asphyxiation. My husband looked at it and said, 'You missed a 
spot.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cook 2,000 meals a year. Find everything that is lost. Wait for repairmen. Get 
sitters who won't do for minimum what you do for free. Change toilet tissue 
spindle. 
</P>
<P>
* "The policeman pulled me over and said, 'I'm giving you a ticket for no plate 
on your car.' I couldn't believe it until I looked at my son and his friend in 
back. They had been playing gas station with it and didn't put the screws on 
tight." 
</P>
<P>
* "My sons belonged to Little League, and I spent my springs on a lawn chair in 
a field. We ate supper at 4 p.m. and again at 8. I did my Girl Scout work while 
I waited for my sons to be in left field for the one inning they played to miss 
all the balls." 
</P>
<P>
* "I fed the dog a new dog food and he threw up on the new beige carpet and it 
left a hot-pink stain. It took a folder full of correspondence from me to get 
the product off the market." 
</P>
<P>
Make a meat loaf shaped like a heart for Valentine's Day, keep children from 
killing one another, check food daily to see what expired as I slept. Teach 
morality, respect, cleanliness, goodness, and how to say thank you. Drive. 
Drive. Drive. 
</P>
<P>
What do we do all day? Even if people stopped to listen, they wouldn't believe 
it.

LEGAL VIEW: DEBATE OVER LIVING TRUSTS GOES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN, Klein is an attorney and assistant to the publisher of The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The debate as to whether to use wills or living trusts continues. 
</P>
<P>
This week I received a letter from Julia Nissley, a paralegal and the author of 
"How to Probate an Estate," an excellent self-help book that guides the 
uninitiated through the probate process. 
</P>
<P>
Nissley is frustrated by ads for living trusts that describe probate as "an 
ugly, expensive legal nightmare that takes two to five years to complete." 
</P>
<P>
That is simply not true, she says. "A stream of major probate law changes in 
California in recent years has simplified probate procedures considerably," she 
writes. "Court involvement has been cut to a minimum, or eliminated completely 
in many cases, and standardized one-page printed forms are used almost 
exclusively." 
</P>
<P>
She is correct in stating that in recent years there have been substantial 
changes in the probate code. Summary (relatively simple probate) procedures are 
now available, especially for small estates and estates of married couples in 
which the assets pass to a surviving spouse. For instance, estates valued under 
$60,000 can easily be passed to beneficiaries after a waiting period of from 40 
days to six months. 
</P>
<P>
One possible catch is that, in some cases, this process considers the fair 
market value of property in the estate before allowing for any liens or 
mortgages. For example, if you owned a California home worth $100,000 in your 
name only, you could not use the summary procedure, even if your mortgage was 
$75,000. The value considered would be the full $100,000, no matter how much 
you owed on the property. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if you owned that same home as community property together 
with your spouse, you might be able to use the summary procedure. That's 
because joint-tenancy property, community property, real property outside 
California and certain other properties are not counted in the computation to 
determine whether you meet the $60,000 eligibility cutoff. You might be able to 
use this summary procedure even if your house is worth $500,000 -- if it is 
held in joint tenancy or community property -- as long as your other assets are 
worth less than $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
There are also summary procedures in probate that allow a person to pass his or 
her estate to the surviving spouse. Nissley explains: "Although the probate 
code allows the surviving spouse to receive such property free of probate, in 
most cases it is necessary to have an official document to remove the deceased 
spouse's name from stock certificates and deeds or other documents. To do this, 
the surviving spouse can file a Spousal Property Petition and obtain a court 
order declaring that the surviving spouse is the sole owner of the property." 
</P>
<P>
Deciding whether to use a will and endure the probate process or use a living 
trust and thereby avoid probate is a personal decision, based on many 
individual factors -- your net worth, your marital status, your desire for 
privacy, your health, even your debts, among others. There are advantages and 
disadvantages to each option, many of which I have described in previous 
columns. (Remember that, generally speaking, a living trust is not a 
tax-avoidance device; you can obtain similar tax benefits from a testamentary 
trust that is established in a will and takes practical effect only during 
probate.) 
</P>
<P>
Before you decide, find out as much as you can about each option. Consult a 
lawyer, talk to a financial adviser, attend seminars, and read the various 
books and other publications available on the whole issue.

HEART ATTACK TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My son-in-law is a real jock who is now in training for a triathlon. 
But he never works out in the morning because he says that most heart attacks 
happen at that time, and he doesn't want to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
My question has to do with what he says about the timing of heart attacks. What 
logical reason can there be for heart attacks to happen more in the morning 
than at any other time of day? If anything, I would expect that more attacks 
would take place at night, after a hard day's work. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There is substantial evidence that more heart attacks occur between 6 
a.m. and noon than at any other period of time during the day. Furthermore, the 
initial symptoms have been reported to appear usually within the first four 
hours after the person awakens in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Why heart attacks occur so often in the morning is still to be explained. One 
physician who has been studying this phenomenon suggests that the incidence of 
heart attacks is related to the time after awakening, but the specific 
association has yet to be determined.

Searching the Heart: Women, Men and Romantic Love in Nineteenth-Century America 
by Karen Lystra (Oxford University Press: $24.95, 336 pages.) 
</P>
<P>
My own heart ached with envy when I learned that Karen Lystra conducted the 
research for her book, "Searching the Heart," by poring over hundreds of 
antique love letters in the Huntington Library in San Marino. I have a vision 
of Lystra wandering through the elegant galleries and magnificent gardens, a 
packet of scented and beribboned letters clutched to her breast, whiling away 
the hours in a reverie of ardent words and urgent longings. 
</P>
<P>
The reality was probably less lyrical, and Lystra's book turns out to be a 
graceful but utterly earnest work of scholarship. Still, the raw material of 
Lystra's study -- the intimate words of men and women who lived long ago but 
whose passions are still very much alive in their love letters -- infuses her 
book with a full measure of romantic and sexual love. 
</P>
<P>
Lystra, professor of American Studies at Cal State Fullerton, set herself the 
task of finding out how Victorian-era Americans actually felt about love by 
studying two kinds of source material -- the love letters that they exchanged 
with one another, and the "medical and moral advice books" that tutored them in 
the proprieties of courtship and marriage. 
</P>
<P>
What Lystra discovered is that the Victorian era was not so sexually repressed 
as we are taught in the approved texts. "The erotic intensity of the 
middle-class men and women in this study, as well as their passion for sexual 
expression, may take some readers by surprise," she warns. "Nineteenth-Century 
middle-class Americans actually held an extremely high estimation of, indeed 
almost reverence for, sexual expression as the ultimate symbol of love and 
personal sharing." 
</P>
<P>
Lystra has pondered these topics deeply and with great and insight. She is 
always sensitive to both the inner meanings and larger social implications of 
the rituals of love and courtship, and she calls our attention to the 
significance of romantic love in the sexual politics of men and women, the 
distinctions between the public and private realms of experience, and the 
mounting importance of individualism in middle-class society in the Victorian 
era. 
</P>
<P>
"In America," she observes, "romantic love was an active agent, not only a 
passive index, of the crucial social change that brought modern -- meaning 
romantic -- selfhood to a large group of men and women." 
</P>
<P>
The love letters that are the proof text of Lystra's study are quoted 
generously but selectively; we are rarely given love letters in their entirety. 
But these fragments of superheated Victorian prose, whether found in the 
letters of a literary celebrity such as Nathaniel Hawthorne ("Oh I shiver again 
to think how much I love thee!") or some otherwise obscure Victorian widow ("As 
the flowers open out and give fresh perfume and beauty in the sun -- so does 
the heart warm and expand to love"), give "Searching the Heart" a sparkle and a 
glow that one does not often find in an academic monograph. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the examples are hilarious. The growing ardor of one pair of lovers 
is revealed by the escalation of rhetoric in the closing lines of their love 
letters. At first, the gentleman signed his letters "Very truly yours," but 
later he could hardly contain his frenzied sexual hunger: "Darling, darling, 
darling, Oh! how I love you!! I want to maul you. Good bye, sweetie, Yours 
Forever." 
</P>
<P>
Only rarely are the letters openly erotic or explicit, but the sexual tension 
and titillation are unmistakable. "Pray write as often as you can," urged one 
yearning husband, "and when you write put on your open black dress and 
beautiful white under dress." And "a respectable army wife" taunted her absent 
husband, who was campaigning against the Indians on the frontier, in the 
steamiest of prose: "How are you this hot day? I am most roasted and my chemise 
sticks to me and the sweat runs down my legs and I suppose I smell very sweet, 
don't you wish you could be around just now." 
</P>
<P>
Lystra concludes that men and women of the Victorian era were far less timid on 
matters of the heart than we are led to believe by the approved texts. " 'Lie 
still and think of the Empire,' is the wedding-night advice Queen Victoria was 
supposed to have given her daughter, thus representing the quintessential in 
Victorian repression and prudery," Lystra writes. In fact, she insists, the 
Victorians regarded sexuality as a wholesome and even noble element of the 
relationship between man and woman: "Imbued with romantic love, sex was seen as 
an act of self-disclosure, not so much in the sense of revealing one's body as 
one's essential identity. Sex was identified with the inner life and was 
perceived as part of the privileged revelation of an "authentic self." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, as Lystra points out, Victorian morality imposed strict restraints 
on public expressions of sexuality -- and that's precisely why the love letters 
of the era are such potent stuff. "Forbidding sexual expression in public 
helped to create and also to explain a veritable explosion of private sexual 
expression whose pleasure was partially enhanced by the thought that speaking 
of sex was forbidden," Lystra explains. "Victorians gleefully censored their 
own private correspondence and worried about being found out. But the idea of 
someone reading their letters hovered like a ghost of lasciviousness over 
correspondence, making their missives almost a secret erotic art." 
</P>
<P>
Lystra is no "ghost of lasciviousness." She treats these most private of 
letters -- and the men and women who wrote them for each other alone -- with 
respect and dignity. "The mail of lovers was sacred," she writes. "In both the 
act of reading and writing love letters, Victorians displayed an intimacy that 
affords the historian a remarkable opportunity to cross once forbidden 
boundaries. . . . " And yet, in "Searching the Heart," Lystra invites us to 
join her as she explores these once-sacrosanct enclaves of our history. The 
journey is intriguing and surprising.

MORNING REPORT: HOME AUDIENCE GOES FOR 'TURNER AND HOOCH'

Red-hot "Turner and Hooch," starring Tom Hanks and that slobbering pooch, may 
outfight some strong competition and be the next No. 1 rental on the Billboard 
chart. It has already proved it has the muscle -- bolting to No. 2 in just two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But strong Valentine's Day business may keep "When Harry Met Sally . . . " -- 
the most popular romantic comedy since "Moonstruck" -- on top for another week 
or two. So far, "Uncle Buck," the comedy starring John Candy, isn't performing 
like a movie that raked in $63 million. In its second week, "Buck" waddled up 
only two rungs -- to No. 11. "The Karate Kid Part III" (No. 10) is doing good 
rental business. Jean-Claude Van Damme -- the John Wayne of martial arts flicks 
-- has another smash with "Kickboxer," which grossed an impressive $14 million 
at the box office. On the rental chart, "Kickboxer" bounded up to No. 12 in 
just two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
* "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" -- a box-office smash ($195 million) -- 
debuted at No. 8 and appears destined to claim the No. 1 spot on the rental 
chart -- maybe even next week.

Noble will assume his post April 1 as artistic director-elect. He takes over

STAGE WATCH: TAPER TO PRODUCE 'ALL THE KING'S MEN'; FOUR PAIRS OF LOVE BIRDS 
FOR 'LOVE LETTERS'

Forget Humpty Dumpty. Can Gordon Davidson put "All the King's Men" back 
together again? 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Hall's adaptation of the Robert Penn Warren novel will receive a Mark 
Taper Forum production "sometime in the next year -- I don't know when," said 
Taper artistic director Davidson. The process will begin today, when Hall 
conducts a Taper workshop using actors from Kenneth Branagh's Renaissance 
Theatre Company, some American actors and the "King's Men" text. 
</P>
<P>
But still to be decided are the dates for the production and whether it will be 
complete -- running over two nights -- or just a single fragment. 
</P>
<P>
Asked specifically whether a version of "All the King's Men" might replace 
Arthur Kopit's "The Discovery of America" in the last slot of this season's 
schedule, July 8-Sept. 2, Davidson declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
But Kopit independently confirmed that "America" may go undiscovered this 
summer. "We're not going to be ready, I don't think," said Kopit from Houston, 
where he is working on his "Road to Nirvana" at the Alley Theatre. "I don't 
know when I can commit the full time to go into production on it. My schedule 
has been in such flux. . . . It's possible it could be this summer, or next 
winter, or next spring, or a year from this summer." 
</P>
<P>
The thornier question may be whether "All the King's Men" will be done in one 
or in two parts. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's adaptation opened in 1986 at Dallas Theatre Center. After the first 
preview, which ran nearly five hours, Hall eliminated what he calls "the 
prologue," which is essentially an adaptation of the book's Chapter 4, a 
"digression back to the pre-Civil War era," said Hall. This brought the show's 
length down to a more manageable three hours, and it ran in this form in Dallas 
and in 1987 productions at Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., and 
Arena Stage in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But Hall didn't forget the prologue, and he brought it to a workshop he 
conducted in Dallas last fall. Davidson attended the workshop, at Hall's 
invitation, and then agreed to put a production together. 
</P>
<P>
That production could consist of just the prologue -- or it might be a two-show 
package: the prologue and the already-seen three-hour "King's Men," performed 
in repertory. It will depend "on whether I can figure out the logistics of it 
all," said Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be that if we did just the prologue, we might go as soon as this 
summer," said Hall. Chances of getting the entire project launched by this 
summer are slimmer. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier three-hour production included music by Randy Newman. Davidson said 
he hoped that Newman would be involved with the Taper production. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is the workshop to be held today. Hall believes that Branagh's 
Renaissance actors will be able to contribute advice on playing in repertory. 
"In this country," he said, "we've had trouble playing in rep." Yet he 
discouraged the idea that the Renaissance company's involvement would extend 
beyond the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
"If I wanted to cast Louisiana in the 1930s," said Hall, "I probably wouldn't 
shop around in London." Warren's 1946 novel was modeled on the story of 
Louisiana Gov. Huey Long. The book has been adapted for other stage 
productions, the first of which also originated in Dallas, where Erwin Piscator 
directed an adaptation in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
VALENTINE NEWS: A star-studded list of Hollywood names, including a few married 
couples, will be among the frequently changing casts of A.R. Gurney's "Love 
Letters," opening Feb. 25 in the Pasadena Playhouse Balcony Theatre. The 
actors: 
</P>
<P>
David Dukes and Pamela Reed (Feb. 25-26), Ken Olin and Patricia Wettig (March 
4-5), Sandy Duncan and Perry King (March 11-12), Meredith Baxter Birney and 
David Ogden Stiers (March 18-19), Donna Mills and Perry King (March 25-26), 
Jill Eikenberry and Michael Tucker (April 1), Ed Harris and Amy Madigan (April 
2), Richard Benjamin and Paula Prentiss (April 8-9), author Gurney and Holland 
Taylor (April 15-16). 
</P>
<P>
The marrieds: Olin and Wettig, Eikenberry and Tucker, Harris and Madigan, 
Benjamin and Prentiss. 
</P>
<P>
PARKING: Cancel last week's word on parking at Los Angeles Theatre Center 
during the next seven months (while a new parking garage is being built behind 
the theater). This week's news is that two new lots have opened up on 6th 
Street, south of the theater. The underground garage at the First Interstate 
Bank building, 6th and Spring, charges $5; an outdoor lot near the southwest 
corner of 6th and Main charges $3. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the parking brouhaha on the side streets off Melrose Avenue, near 
the Zephyr and Groundlings theaters, has been cleared up with the announcement 
of a compromise between the area's merchants and homeowners. As soon as signs 
can be installed, post-8 p.m. parking will be available on west sides of the 
streets, but not on the east sides, which will be reserved for permit parking 
by residents. 
</P>
<P>
"TUNA" RETURNS: "Greater Tuna," the two-man production about the denizens of a 
small Texas town, will open at the Westwood Playhouse March 21 for a four-week 
run with the show's creators and original cast members, Joe Sears and Jaston 
Williams. The two appeared in "Tuna" at the Las Palmas Theatre in Hollywood in 
1984 and at the Lyceum in San Diego last year. 
</P>
<P>
"WOOLF" RETURNS: In case you missed Edward Albee's staging of his "Who's Afraid 
of Virginia Woolf?" at the Doolittle last fall, you'll have another chance this 
spring -- though this time it will be with the understudies. 
</P>
<P>
Albee mounted a production with the Los Angeles understudies at Houston's Alley 
Theater. It closed there Sunday and went on a tour that will arrive at Cuesta 
College in San Luis Obispo March 30, the Norris Theater in Rolling Hills 
Estates March 31, the Lobero Theater in Santa Barbara April 1 -- and the Soviet 
Union on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
"DIARY" RETURNS: "Diary of Black Men . . . How Do You Love a Black Woman?" 
returns to the Orpheum Theatre in downtown Los Angeles for performances Friday 
and Saturday. Three sold-out performances there in January were the first 
"legit" shows at the former vaudeville palace since the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
BIG WEEKEND: "Art in Chaos: The Political Struggle" will be the subject of a 
symposium at Los Angeles Theatre Center's annual Big Weekend, March 1-4. Also 
on the agenda are staged readings of four new plays, presentations by six of 
LATC's labs, and four 20-minute performances on the theme of censorship. 
</P>
<P>
One day after the Big Weekend, on March 5, Allen Ginsberg will read poetry as 
part of LATC's poetry/literary series. Information: (213) 627-6500.

STAGE REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
A STYLISH 'LA NIK A WET' BY BELGIAN ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stage is set with metal washtubs, twisted pipe, dented trash cans, funnels 
and stray bits of gutter. This gray universe of discards is artfully arranged, 
implying purposeful if deliberate neglect. 
</P>
<P>
In the penumbra, human arms begin a slow percussive tapping from behind one 
heap. Slowly, the tapping drums into a roar and a voice like a demented 
muezzin, explodes in a wordless chant of clear, arresting tones. 
</P>
<P>
That's the start of the Belgian Theatre de Banlieue's latest two-character 
piece, "La Nik a Wet," a Pipeline presentation at the Odyssey Theatre. Loosely 
translated, the title is "Nik and Wet," as in Vladimir and Estragon. Or Winnie 
and Willy. Once again, we're plunged into the Beckett post-Apocalypse of "Happy 
Days" or "Waiting for Godot." 
</P>
<P>
Isabelle Lamouline is Nik. Alain Mebirouk is Wet. (Some may remember them from 
"Aqui No Se Rinde," the last Theatre de Banlieue show presented in Los Angeles 
by Pipeline in 1988.) The twilight zone they seem to be stranded in here is a 
copper and rust and galvanized metal no-man's-land, an aural and visual 
sculpture that moves, makes sounds, shatters, recombines, breaks apart, 
reveals, congeals. 
</P>
<P>
La Nik is a handsome woman in immediate danger of becoming the Tin Woman, 
weighted down as she is by assorted receptacles. Wet enters the playing area 
draped in black and burdened by metal detritus. He looks like some formidable 
reject or refugee from Genghis Khan's army. "It is forbidden to place garbage 
on a public thoroughfare" is the first coherent line out of his mouth, as he 
raids the jolly junkyard to skillfully rearrange it. 
</P>
<P>
From this point on the Theatre's 70-minute piece becomes at once engaging and 
predictable. Wet and la Nik, like some desperate Boesman and Lena, give voice 
if not language to their failed communication. (They are, says Mebirouk in some 
press notes, "lives in a growing state of decomposition.") 
</P>
<P>
Props become saxophones; props become costume. Macabre quasi-dances look like 
the final spasms of retarded children. Intelligible sentences fly from their 
lips now and then, but suspended in the air, addressed to no one (if not, from 
time to time, to us, the audience) and rarely in a sequence that illuminates 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
They are people on parallel inarticulate tracks, missing each other at every 
turn, relying on utterred or percussive sound more than on words, on action and 
facial expression. What they do for this pain-driven hour is rummage around the 
junkyard of their souls as much as in this depository of human manufacture that 
has grown useless and redundant in the dying world. 
</P>
<P>
The message is not new and was, we are told, wrought by Lamouline and Mebirouk 
in improvisations during daily nine-hour rehearsals for five months -- before 
the world decided upon healing itself, which makes it more possible to receive 
this show at half an arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
Overworked as it may be, however, it doesn't diminish the physical size and 
caliber of this pair's achievement. These astonishing artists have devised an 
urgent and eloquent theatrical semaphore with which to remind us, like 
tortured, spastic mutants, that post-nuclear winters are still only one 
malevolent breath or accident away. 
</P>
<P>
Finer points of interpretation will of necessity remain mysterious and 
subjective -- up to each individual -- but the collective consciousness cannot 
escape the doomsday warning that even the new climate of optimism cannot 
nullify. 
</P>
<P>
For sheer mastery of craft, these artists are not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Odyssey Theatre, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd. in West Los Angeles, Thursday 
and Friday, 8 p.m., Saturday 10:30 p.m., with a final performance Sunday at 3 
p.m. Tickets: $12; (213) 477-2055.

RULES FOR CHOLESTEROL CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following is advice from the American Dietetic Assn. for those interested 
in reducing dietary intake of cholesterol and maintaining an overall healthful 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cholesterol is found only in foods of animal origin. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eat five or more servings of a combination of fruits and vegetables -- 
especially green and yellow vegetables and citrus fruits -- per day. An average 
serving is equal to one-half cup for most fresh or cooked vegetables or one 
piece of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increase starches and other complex carbohydrates by eating six or more 
daily servings of a combination of breads, cereals and legumes. An average 
serving is equal to one slice of bread, one roll or muffin or one-half cup dry 
or cooked cereal or legumes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eat moderate amounts of lean meat, skinless poultry, fish and nonfat or 
low-fat dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eat fewer foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol by reading package 
labels for content. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be aware that lean, light or 95% fat-free food labels can be misleading and 
that these foods can be loaded with calories from just fat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eat more unsaturated fats, such as those found in most vegetable oils and 
nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Exercise regularly; it helps lower blood cholesterol levels and can protect 
against osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bake, broil, microwave or poach meat, poultry and fish instead of frying. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trim visible fat from meat and poultry and drain meats after browning. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Defat cooked soups, stews and gravies by cooling, then skimming off 
hardened fat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use nonstick pans and vegetables sprays when sauteing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Substitute seasoned tomato juice, broth or wine for gravy; low-fat or 
nonfat yogurt for sour cream; skim milk for whole milk in recipes, and ice milk 
or low-fat frozen yogurt for ice cream at dessert time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never assume that low cholesterol means low in fat. Liquid nondairy 
creamers, for example, have no cholesterol but they have up to 90% fat 
calories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Watch out for sugar hidden in juice drinks, cereals, spaghetti sauce and 
luncheon meats. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Leave some food on the plate or request a doggie bag when dining out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Split an entree with a friend and share the calories in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Substitute fruit or small green salads for French fries. TONI TIPTON

VEGETABLES, INSTEAD OF BUTTER, ADD SAUCY FLAVOR TO PAIR OF SEAFOOD DISHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seafood plays a leading role in two main dishes that are deceptively rich in 
flavor. The sauce for Crab Gratin is prepared without butter or oil and 
contains only two tablespoons of cream. Linguine adds substance to the dish, 
and mushrooms and tomatoes add fresh contrast. 
</P>
<P>
Like the crab dish, Oyster-Zucchini Chowder appears rich and creamy, but the 
texture is produced by pureed vegetables. Some of the oysters are pureed with 
the vegetables, and the remainder join zucchini cubes as a garnish. 
</P>
<P>
CRAB GRATIN 
</P>
<P>
6 ounces dry linguine 
</P>
<P>
1/4 pound mushrooms, sliced 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup water 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
2 cups clam juice 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup white wine 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon, crumbled 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup parsley, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
3/4 pound crab meat, cartilage removed 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons unseasoned bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
Cook linguine according to package directions until firm-tender. Drain at once, 
Rinse with cold water and drain thoroughly. Place in large bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Place mushrooms in small saucepan. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 
add water. Place foil sheet directly over mushrooms. Cover pot and cook over 
high heat about 1 minute, just until steam begins to escape from saucepan. 
Drain mushrooms, reserving juices and place in dish. 
</P>
<P>
Place flour in 1-quart saucepan and stir in enough clam juice to make smooth 
paste. Stir in remaining clam juice, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, white wine and 
reserved mushroom juice. Season with coriander, tarragon, pepper and soy sauce. 
Place over medium heat and bring to simmer, stirring constantly. Cook and stir 
until mixture thickens, about 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in cream, then parsley and 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Add mushrooms to pasta in bowl and pour 1/2 of sauce over pasta. Mix well and 
place in lightly oiled 6-cup gratin dish. Pat into smooth layer. Gently mix 
remaining sauce with crab meat and spoon over linguine. Sprinkle bread crumbs 
over top. Bake at 375 degrees 15 minutes, or until heated through. If top has 
not browned, place under broiler just long enough to brown. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
OYSTER-ZUCCHINI CHOWDER 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 pounds zucchini 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound potato, cut into chunks 
</P>
<P>
1/4 pound carrot, cut into chunks 
</P>
<P>
3 green onions, sliced 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup parsley leaves, chopped 
</P>
<P>
Pepper 
</P>
<P>
2 cups fish or chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
1 pint shucked oysters 
</P>
<P>
Juice of 1/2 lemon 
</P>
<P>
Few drops hot pepper sauce 
</P>
<P>
Cut 1 pound zucchini into large chunks. Cut remainder into small cubes for 
garnish and reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Combine zucchini, potato and carrot chunks in 3-quart saucepan. Add onions, 
garlic, parsley and season to taste with pepper. Pour in stock. Bring to simmer 
and cook 20 minutes, until potatoes are very tender. 
</P>
<P>
Place 1/2 of oysters and their liquor in small saucepan. Add lemon juice and 
hot pepper sauce and bring slowly to boil over low heat. As soon as mixture 
simmers, stir oysters. Cook until edges begin to curl. Remove from heat. Cover 
and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Cook zucchini cubes in boiling water 1 to 2 minutes, just until tender. Drain 
and rinse with cold water. Drain well and reserve. 
</P>
<P>
When chowder vegetables are cooked, puree in food processor or blender, 
dividing into batches if necessary. Add reserved raw oysters and their liquor 
and puree again. 
</P>
<P>
Rinse out pot in which chowder was cooked. Return chowder to pot. If too thick, 
thin with liquid from poached oysters or little water. Gently reheat to simmer 
and simmer until heated through. Ladle about 1 1/2 cups chowder into each bowl. 
Garnish with poached oysters and zucchini cubes. Makes 4 main dish servings. 
</P>

<P>
Photo, Although they appear to be calorie-laden, Oyster-Zucchini Chowder, top, 
and Crab Gratin achieve surprisingly rich flavors by making use of a variety of 
vegetables instead of traditional heavy fats.

INDUSTRY TRIES TO LURE BUYERS BACK TO FISH; 
</P>
<P>
SEAFOOD: INSPECTION IS HAPHAZARD, CRITICS CLAIM, AND SHOPPERS ARE WARY. 
INDUSTRY OFFICIALS SAY FEARS ARE EXAGGERATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The seafood industry has launched a counterattack against those consumer groups 
that charge that fish and shellfish may pose unacceptable health risks to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The effort was particularly evident at Sea Fare International 1990, a trade 
show held last week at the Long Beach Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
The event's sponsor, Seafood Leader magazine, devoted an entire seminar during 
the three-day conference to how wholesalers, retailers and restaurateurs can 
respond when the wholesomeness of fishery products comes under question. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have claimed that because the federal inspection program for seafood is 
haphazard, contaminated product can reach consumer channels more readily than 
is the case with other protein foods such as meat or poultry. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to emphasize how important this issue is," said Peter Redmayne, editor 
of Seafood Leader. "The consumer needs to be better educated (on this 
controversy.)" 
</P>
<P>
The lead group in addressing the seafood safety issue is the National Fisheries 
Institute, an Arlington, Va.,-based trade association. The institute has 
budgeted $1 million for a 24-month education program that targets the media, 
seafood marketers and the public. The plan is separate from the $6.5 million 
advertising campaign by the National Fish and Seafood Promotional Council that 
urges consumers to "Eat Fish and Seafood Twice a Week." 
</P>
<P>
"The criticism of seafood has effected sales in some areas of the United 
States," said Clare Vanderbeek, National Fisheries vice president. "In some 
areas, there is a perception that seafood is not safe. We need to turn that 
around." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the industry experienced its first drop in per capita consumption in a 
decade. The decline, from 15.5 pounds per person to 15 pounds, can be 
attributed to several factors, Vanderbeek said. These include negative press 
accounts of seafood and a record number of U.S. exports fueled by greater 
oversees demand for segments of the domestic catch. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbeek told processors at the seminar that they first must guarantee that 
they are selling a good product and then need to educate the public on how to 
handle it properly in terms of storage, preparation and cooking. 
</P>
<P>
A federal official also told the gathering that more is being done to ensure a 
safe seafood supply than is readily known by the public. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Throm, a seafood specialist with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 
said that his agency annually inspects between 1,000 and 1,400 domestic 
processors. In addition to the inspections, the agency conducts 20,000 
laboratory analyses of fish and shellfish for decomposition, bacteria, 
parasites and viruses each year. 
</P>
<P>
"What are the hazards from seafood to the public? Well, a very small percentage 
of the food-borne disease cases in this country can be attributed to seafood," 
Throm said. "Seafood products are safe to eat; there is no question about it." 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be different interpretations as to the actual risk posed to the 
public from contaminated seafood. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant to the fisheries institute, Anne M. Fletcher, said that only 5% of 
all food poisoning cases, from 1973 through 1987, can be attributed to seafood. 
</P>
<P>
"The impression is that a lot of people are getting sick from seafood. That is 
just not true," Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Throm quoted federal statistics that indicated that the risk of 
illness from eating raw mollusks, such as clams or oysters, is one person out 
of every 250 consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The risk posed by all seafood products, however, is much less than that for raw 
or undercooked mollusks. Yet these commodities have been responsible for much 
of the controversy that has swirled around the industry. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the convention was abuzz over last Friday's broadcast on ABC-TV's 
20/20 news magazine show dealing with the health risk posed by eating raw 
oysters, particularly those caught in the Gulf of Mexico. As many as 40% of the 
Gulf oysters can be contaminated with Vibrio vulnificus, a potentially severe 
infection, during the warm weather months. The contamination can be acute if 
the oysters are mishandled, or improperly refrigerated, once leaving the water. 
</P>
<P>
West Coast oyster growers, who rely on aquaculture or farming methods to 
produce their catch, were particularly concerned about the fall-out from the 
television report. They do not suffer from the same contamination problems as 
Gulf or East Coast oyster producers and are better equipped to monitor for 
problems when they do arise. 
</P>
<P>
"The West Coast oyster interests have the most to lose in the shellfish safety 
debate because many of the problems (with the species) are regional," said Tim 
Smith, executive director of the Pacific Coast Oyster Growers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Smith said, is water quality and not necessarily the oysters. 
</P>
<P>
"Mollusks are filter feeders and the oyster will eat whatever the water is 
serving that particular day. And, yes, that could include fecal matter, 
chemical contaminants and oil residues. But there are no bad oysters, just bad 
water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that Washington state alone spends $1.25 million on its shellfish 
monitoring program. A staff of 18 tests water quality on a continuous basis and 
in the past year analyzed 15,000 samples. This effort is indicative of some of 
the differences between West Coast oysters and their Gulf Coast counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"Our responsibility in this business should be to provide a safe and quality 
product," Smith said. "Consumer safety is more important to us than consumer 
confidence. That's because people are fickle and they'll believe the last thing 
they hear. But maintaining water quality is the determining issue that will 
effect consumer safety."

MICROWAVE: USE CAUTION IN MAKING HOT DRINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's good to know that when the children drag home from school, tired, hungry 
and chilled, you can revive them with steaming cups of cocoa or old-fashioned 
chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Making hot beverages the microwave way is a snap, as many of you may already 
have discovered. But no matter how experienced you are, you should bear these 
points in mind whenever you microwave hot drinks: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never heat drinks in foam cups (they may melt), mugs with glued-on handles 
(the glue may melt) or in those with decorative metal trim, which can cause 
arcing (dangerous sparking inside the microwave oven). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never heat milk-based beverages on HIGH (100% power) -- they'll boil over. 
And always use a container at least twice the volume of the ingredients put 
into it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To further minimize the risk of boil-overs, microwave milk-based drinks for 
the minimum recommended time. Also watch them closely. Water-based drinks can 
be microwaved on HIGH -- they're less likely to boil over. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use an automatic temperature probe, if you have one, for microwave 
beverages. Following manufacturer's directions, set the desired temperature and 
the probe will turn the oven off before the drink boils over. The probe's hold 
setting (150 to 160 degrees) will keep drinks properly hot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When cooking four or more milk-based drinks at once, arrange them in a 
circle and rearrange once or twice during microwaving. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stir all beverages before serving to distribute heat uniformly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To reheat cooled beverages, microwave each cup, uncovered, on HIGH, in 
30-second increments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With an automatic temperature probe set at 150 degrees (20 degrees lower 
for children), you can heat milk right in the glass or mug -- provided it's 
microwave-safe. 
</P>
<P>
HOT BUTTERSCOTCH MILK 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons light or dark brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Microwave milk in uncovered microwave-safe 2 cup measure on MEDIUM-HIGH (70% 
power) 2 1/2 to 3 minutes until hot. Add sugar and vanilla and stir until sugar 
dissolves. Serve in 12-ounce heat-resistant glass or mug. Makes 1 serving. 
</P>
<P>
Variations: 
</P>
<P>
Hot Vanilla Milk: Prepare as directed, substituting 2 to 3 teaspoons superfine 
sugar for brown sugar and increasing vanilla to 1 teaspoon. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Honey-Molasses Milk: Prepare as directed substituting 1 tablespoon honey 
and 1 tablespoon molasses for brown sugar and omitting vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
Because this milk mixture contains water, it can be microwaved on HIGH (100% 
power) with little danger of boiling over. 
</P>
<P>
HOT COCOA 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup sugar

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: VERY STRICT MEDICAL GUIDELINES ARE APPLIED TO 
VERY-LOW-CALORIE DIETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mention the name Oprah Winfrey, and the conversation is as likely to turn to 
diet as it is to her popular talk show. Details of the celebrity's prior 
failures and success (a 67-pound weight loss in just four months in 1988) 
offered new hope to scores of overweight individuals yearning to shed fat. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, demand for very-low-calorie diets soared, and companies producing 
diet formulas stepped up their zealous marketing to physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent surge of interest, very-low-calorie diets (VLCD) are not 
new. In the 1970s they were all the rage -- until reports of 58 deaths from one 
diet and six from another made front-page news. Today's products are a lot 
safer, but that doesn't mean they should be used across-the-board by anyone 
with any amount of excess weight. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about overuse of these diets led three noted obesity experts -- Thomas 
Wadden (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine), Theodore Van Itallie 
(Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons) and George Blackburn 
(New England Deaconess Hospital) -- to spell out ground rules in a recent issue 
of the Journal of the American Medical Assn. If you're considering following a 
VLCD for quick weight loss, you'd do well to heed the doctors' advice. Such 
diets, they point out, should be used only by people at least 30% and at least 
40 pounds overweight. Candidates should get a checkup. Their medical slate 
should show no recent heart attack, history of cardiovascular, kidney or liver 
disease, cancer, juvenile onset diabetes or significant psychiatric problems. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there's the diet itself. Whether in the form of powder derived from egg 
or milk, or from lean meat, fish or fowl, it should provide as much as 1.2 to 
1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of desirable body weight. That's at least 
one-third more than the normal adult Recommended Dietary Allowance. The diets 
must be supplemented with vitamins and minerals, particularly potassium, and 
the patient must consume over two quarts of calorie-free fluid daily. 
</P>
<P>
So far, so good: It's all fairly straightforward. And while following these 
diets, patients typically lose from 2 1/2 to three pounds weekly -- sometimes 
even more. Over 12 to 16 weeks, that adds up to a loss of at least 30 pounds. 
At that point, according to these experts, it's time for something else. 
</P>
<P>
For the next three to six weeks, that something else is refeeding, a period in 
which conventional foods gradually are reintroduced. The entire process, from A 
to Z, must be done under strict medical supervision, meaning a weekly physical 
exam with biweekly lab tests, including electrolyte measurements. It may be 
possible to achieve satisfactory results with lighter medical surveillance, but 
close monitoring protects those few patients who might react adversely to the 
program. Less-frequent monitoring is usually needed as the rate of weight loss 
decreases. 
</P>
<P>
The experts' guidelines seem clear enough. It's when you start bending the 
rules that problems arise. The greatest potential risk of complications is 
linked to self-help initiatives as overzealous dieters select their own plans, 
consuming too little food or misusing one of the commercial formulas. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals can experience a spectrum of short-term complications that are 
easily managed by a doctor who understands how the diet affects the body. 
Without supervision, however, problems can escalate. Long-term complications 
can endanger the heart, gallbladder and pancreas. Too rapid refeeding carries 
special risks. 
</P>
<P>
Very-low-calorie diets are ill-advised for those who are just mildly 
overweight. Studies of VLCD safety have been conducted only in individuals who 
are severely obese. There's no evidence that the diets are safe for people who 
need to shed a few pounds. Mildly obese individuals lose more lean body mass 
than do heavier ones. This can disturb heart function and damage other organs 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Also, lean tissue is more active metabolically and burns more calories. If you 
diet too stringently, your energy requirement goes down, actually making losing 
weight harder than it should be. 
</P>
<P>
The long and short of it is that dabbling in these diets is playing with 
nutritional fire. They should be prescribed only by physicians trained in their 
use, as part of an overall treatment package that includes a behavioral 
psychologist and a dietitian. After weight is lost, patients can benefit from 
three to four months of programs focusing on eating, exercise and other 
lifestyle factors, and six months to a year of instruction in weight 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
If this supervision sounds too intense to you, consider that most patients 
treated exclusively by VLCD regain the weight almost as quickly as they lose 
it. With more comprehensive programs, the success rate significantly improves. 
</P>
<P>
So, to Oprah -- all the best. But the rest of us need to think carefully before 
embarking on a regimen that could be inappropriate, unsuccessful and, at worst, 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Prudent Diet, Saturated Fat in Coffee Holds Less Significance 
</P>
<P>
Question: My husband was a scoffer: He always said serum cholesterol was for 
others to worry about, not him. Then, two weeks ago, he went for a routine 
checkup and learned his cholesterol level was in the high-risk range. Now he's 
a changed man -- and doing well on the new regimen. But we argue about the 
whole milk he still puts in his coffee. I say he should use low-fat milk, and 
he says forget it -- it's not important. Who's right? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: We applaud your concern for your husband's well-being. But if, as you 
describe, he's sticking to a prudent diet, then the amount of saturated fat 
he's getting in his morning coffee is of little consequence. It's true that a 
cup of whole milk contains eight grams of fat, half of it saturated, while a 
cup of low-fat milk (containing 1% fat) contains only two grams of fat, of 
which less than a single gram is saturated. But even if he uses a rather 
generous three tablespoons of milk, he'd be getting only about a gram of 
saturated fat in his coffee. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the story changes if he chain-drinks coffee throughout the 
day. If he does drink numerous cups, all containing the same amount of milk, we 
recommend he consider using a cream substitute made with unsaturated fat. 
Alternatively, he may prefer to wean himself gradually from whole to low-fat 
milk by mixing the two together. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is alcohol consumption declining in this country? I've read conflicting 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
A: The data suggest that it is declining. Consumption rose from 1977 to 1980, 
but in 1981 the trend reversed itself. By 1986 (the year most recently 
reported), it was down 2.3%. The decline was all in hard liquor. Beer and wine 
intake actually increased a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Across the 50 states, consumption has risen in some and fallen in others. Also, 
data on per-capita consumption are difficult to interpret. Everyone 14 years or 
older is included. Sadly too many children and young adolescents do drink very 
early. But a 1983 national survey found that fewer than 7% began drinking when 
they were 14 or younger. 
</P>
<P>
Another glitch is that most estimates of per-capita consumption are obtained by 
taking total alcohol sold and then dividing it by the population -- including 
those who abstain. Eliminating teetotalers can change the picture entirely. In 
West Virginia, per-capita consumption of ethanol (hard liquor, beer and wine 
converted to estimate pure alcohol) is 1.6 gallons. But in that state, 65% of 
residents report that they abstain. When only drinkers are counted, average use 
jumps to 4.7 gallons per year. 
</P>
<P>
A closer look at who does the drinking provides the real shock. Estimates show 
that while two-thirds of the adult population use some alcohol, 10% of the 
population accounts for half of all the alcohol consumed. Setting aside the 
terrible cost of human life from drunk drivers, the toll on lives is weighty. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, over 26,000 Americans died of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. In 
more than 40% of those cases, the disease was linked to alcohol. Nearly half 
the deaths from chronic liver disease occur in individuals under 60. Let 
drinkers beware. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently read that the bacteria E. coli can cause serious illness. I 
recall learning in college that E. coli were harmless residents of the 
intestinal tract. Is that no longer thought to be true? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are several types of E. coli. This is a case of the good, the bad and 
the ugly. The ones that normally inhabit the GI tract are harmless and can even 
produce B vitamins for our use. 
</P>
<P>
Other strains are associated with both traveler's diarrhea and diarrhea in 
young children, especially in developing countries. But the one to which you 
probably refer, known as E. coli 0157:H7, was first identified in the early 
1980s as the cause of bloody stools in individuals who had eaten undercooked 
hamburger in a restaurant. Since then, it's been linked to other symptoms, 
ranging from the acute discomfort typical of many food-borne infections 
(cramps, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and low fever) to kidney failure and, in 
the extreme, death. 
</P>
<P>
As with most unfriendly bacteria, it is children, the elderly and those with 
weakened immune systems who are most vulnerable. If the bacteria are present, 
anywhere from 30 to 60% of people exposed will become ill. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, as with other bacterial infections, this one is easily 
preventable. Most cases are associated with either undercooked ground beef or 
unpasteurized milk. So, for safety's sake, avoid raw milk and undercooked meat. 
Beyond that, the same safe practices that prevent other food-borne infections 
apply to these nasty bacteria too.

COOK IT LIGHT: LOWER-FAT SOUR CREAM COFFEE CAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR JEANNE: I am on a low-fat diet due to high cholesterol and high 
triglycerides and miss making this coffee cake. I would appreciate your 
attention to this recipe. Thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS. L., New Port Richey, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
SOUR CREAM COFFEE CAKE 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sour cream 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
</P>
<P>
1 cup chopped walnuts 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
Cream margarine and 1 cup sugar until fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at time. 
</P>
<P>
Combine sour cream and baking soda in separate bowl. Add to creamed mixture. 
Add vanilla, then flour and baking powder. 
</P>
<P>
Combine walnuts, remaining 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon, mixing well. Add 1/2 
topping to cake batter and pour into 9-inch square pan. Sprinkle remaining 1/2 
topping over top and bake at 350 degrees 50 minutes. Makes 9 (3-inch square) 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ALICE: I served both your recipe and my revision to guests on New Year's 
Day and they all agreed that if the two cakes were not side by side you would 
never be able to tell the difference. I was able to reduce the margarine and 
sugar by half and replaced the eggs with egg substitute. The only cholesterol 
now in this scrumptious cake is from the light sour cream, which I substituted 
for the regular sour cream in your original recipe. 
</P>
<P>
By toasting the walnuts first, I enhanced their flavor enough to reduce them by 
half, and increasing the amount of cinnamon also increases the level of 
perceived sweetness to compensate for the reduced sugar in the topping mixture. 
I hope you like my Light Sour Cream Coffee Cake as much as my guests did.

YOU ASKED ABOUT: DISTINCTIVE ROSIN-COVERED POTATOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I came across a recipe in "Joy of Cooking" (Bobbs-Merrill: 1986) 
called Potatoes Cooked in Resin. Can you tell me what kind of resin they are 
referring to and where I can purchase it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Others must have had the same question because in the newest edition of 
this cookbook authors Irma S. Rombauer and Marion Rombauer Becker change the 
spelling to rosin and include the following information: 
</P>
<P>
". . . no other method turns out a potato so distinctively flaky. Allow a 
minimum of three hours for this recipe; because of the fumes, never try it 
indoors. Rosin can be purchased at athletic and dance supply stores." 
</P>
<P>
However, in researching the safety of this recipe, we discovered that neither 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture nor the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
were aware of the exact identity of the rosin used or its function in this 
recipe. Perhaps readers familiar with this cooking technique will share their 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
For those who don't have a copy of the cookbook, we provide the recipe: 
</P>
<P>
Place 15 to 25 pounds rock rosin in a three-gallon iron kettle or galvanized 
bucket. The rosin may be used repeatedly. Heat it to 275 degrees over a grill 
or hot plate. Carefully lower into it on a large slotted wooden-handled spoon, 
one at a time, six large baking potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
After about 45 minutes in the simmering rosin they will float to the surface. 
Simmer them 30 minutes longer. Remove one potato and wrap in heavy brown paper, 
twisting the ends tightly. Let cool 10 minutes and serve. If the texture is not 
exceptional, cook the remaining potatoes 10 minutes more before testing. 
</P>
<P>
Serve with butter, salt and freshly ground pepper. Avoid eating the 
rosin-covered skins. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Would you please give the vital statistics -- calories, vitamins, minerals, 
etc. -- for jicama, kiwi, chayote and sunchokes? I can't find them in any table 
of food composition. 
</P>
<P>
A: We were able to find the following information for kiwi and sunchokes in 
"Nutritive Value of Foods," U.S. Department of Agriculture Home &amp; Garden 
Bulletin Number 72: 
</P>
<P>
Kiwi -- 1 (about 5 per pound with skin), raw, without skin contains 45 
calories, 1 gram protein, a trace of fat, 0 milligrams cholesterol, 11 grams 
carbohydrate, 20 milligrams calcium, 30 milligrams phosphorus, 0.3 milligrams 
iron, 252 milligrams potassium, 4 milligrams sodium, 130 international units 
Vitamin A, 0.02 milligrams thiamine, 0.04 milligrams riboflavin, 0.4 milligrams 
niacin and 74 milligrams ascorbic acid. 
</P>
<P>
Sunchoke (Jerusalem-artichoke) -- 1 cup raw, sliced contains 115 calories, 3 
grams protein, a trace of fat, 0 milligrams cholesterol, 26 grams carbohydrate, 
21 milligrams calcium, 117 milligrams phosphorus, 5.1 milligrams iron, 644 
milligrams potassium, 6 milligrams sodium, 30 international units Vitamin A, 
0.30 milligrams thiamine, 0.09 milligrams riboflavin, 2.0 milligrams niacin and 
6 milligrams ascorbic acid. 
</P>
<P>
Although we could not find a complete breakdown for chayote and jicama, in 
"Fresh Produce A to Z" (Lane Publishing: 1987) the editors of Sunset books and 
magazine say "Chayote provides some Vitamin A and potassium. A 3 1/2-ounce 
portion of raw chayote has 28 calories" and "Jicama is high in potassium and a 
fair source of Vitamin C. One cup of shredded raw jicama contains about 50 
calories." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Schneider, author of "Uncommon Fruits and Vegetables -- A Commonsense 
Guide" (Harper &amp; Row, 1986) adds that both chayote and jicama are low in 
sodium.

GUN CONTROL FOE SWITCHES HIS VOTE ON WAITING PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Newton R. Russell, citing a rising tide of violence, reversed himself last 
week and voted in favor of a bill that would require purchasers of sporting 
rifles and shotguns to wait 15 days before taking possession of their firearms. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Republican called himself a longtime foe of gun control but said 
he was prompted to rethink his position on at least this one measure because 
"of what seemed to be an increasingly violent society" in which "people in a 
fit of rage buy a gun and use it on someone." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Russell said Monday in an interview, he supported the bill by 
Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento) as a compromise even though last 
September he had opposed an earlier version of the proposal. The state already 
has a similar "cooling-off period" for handguns. 
</P>
<P>
Russell was among just four of the Senate's 13 Republicans to support 
Connelly's bill. It was approved last Thursday by the 40-member upper house on 
a 23-10 vote, two more than the simple majority required. The bill now goes 
back to the Assembly for concurrence in amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Elected to the Senate in 1974, Russell has a reputation as a low-profile 
lawmaker who usually sides with conservatives. His district includes Arcadia, 
Monrovia, Sierra Madre, San Marino, Temple City and part of Pasadena, as well 
as Glendale and La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always been a supporter of the aims and goals of the National Rifle 
Assn., and my voting record will attest to the fact that I am a strong opponent 
of gun control," Russell said in a statement. "However, I believe this 
legislation will prevent a person from the sort of tragedy we read about with 
increasing frequency, that is, the purchase of any type of weapon in a fit of 
rage which is then immediately used to shoot someone." 
</P>
<P>
Although not a member of the NRA, which opposed the bill, Russell said he owns 
two guns: a .22-caliber rifle his father gave him and a .38-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Russell described his decision as "tough" and said he made up his mind after 
some soul-searching, prayers for guidance, and conversations with friends who 
own guns and with Connelly. 
</P>
<P>
"He's (Connelly) made significant changes in the bill, and that caused me to 
rethink my position," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
A provision was added to the latest proposal that requires the attorney 
general's office to study the feasibility of establishing a computerized hot 
line. It would allow gun dealers to determine whether a prospective gun buyer 
has a criminal record. Russell said he supports the hot line concept but 
acknowledged that the "technology is not yet in place." 
</P>
<P>
Russell also said that unlike the earlier proposal, the revised bill protects 
privacy by requiring the attorney general's office to destroy applications 
after 30 days, except if a person is deemed ineligible to purchase a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Votes by other area legislators were more in keeping with their earlier stands 
on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents argued that waiting periods for gun purchases are not effective 
because background checks are often incomplete and inaccurate. But Russell said 
the NRA's lobbying effort against the bill was "almost non-existent."

SANTA MONICA TENTATIVELY OKS HIGHER TENANT RELOCATION FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica City Council voted Tuesday night to increase relocation fees 
that landlords are required to pay tenants who are evicted from apartments 
covered under the city's rent control laws. 
</P>
<P>
The new fees increase the minimum from $2,000 to $3,000, and the maximum from 
$3,000 to $5,500. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords had been required to pay relocation fees to tenants evicted because 
the landlord wanted the unit for himself or a family member, or if the landlord 
was planning to go out of business and demolish the building. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new ordinance, relocation fees also would be given to tenants who 
vacate their units after the lengthy eviction process has been started, but 
before they receive a formal eviction notice. 
</P>
<P>
The fee increases come as a response to the growing number of evictions by 
landlords using the state Ellis Act, passed in 1986. It allows landlords to 
legally evict all tenants, get out of the rental business, and put the land to 
other uses allowed under existing zoning. Nearly 1,000 units have been or are 
scheduled to be removed from the city's housing stock. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is scheduled for a second reading in two weeks and, if approved 
then, would become effective 30 days later. The new ordinance also has a 
provision that would impose the higher fees for any tenants who may have 
received an eviction notice prior to the effective date, but not yet vacated 
the unit. 
</P>
<P>
That provision is expected to apply to the tenants of the 178-unit Sea Castle 
Apart ments, whose owner notified the rent board on Jan. 25 that he intends to 
evict the 212 tenants under the Ellis Act. 
</P>
<P>
John Rodriguez, president of a landlords group called Action, described the 
fees in an interview as a form of "extortion" not imposed on any other 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine anyone feeling comfortable knowing that if he were a doctor 
that he would have to pay his patients if he wants to retire," Rodriguez said. 
"Why are we being singled out to pay to go out of business?" 
</P>
<P>
But supporters defended the relocation fee and the increase. 
</P>
<P>
"The adjustment is absolutely necessary . . . as part of the effort to maintain 
affordable housing," said Brad Jones, co-chair of Santa Monicans for Renters' 
Rights, the tenants group whose members make up the majority on both the City 
Council and the Rent Control Board. "Affordable housing must be protected by 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Only Councilman Herb Katz voted against the increases, saying he felt that 
there had not been sufficient notification to get adequate public comment. 
Councilwoman Christine Reed was absent. 
</P>
<P>
The relocation fees for a bachelor or single apartment will increase from 
$2,000 to $3,000; a one-bedroom from $2,500 to $3,750; a two-bedroom from 
$3,000 to $4,250; a three-bedroom from $3,000 to $5,250, and four or more 
bedrooms from $3,000 to $5,500. 
</P>
<P>
The existing requirement for an additional $1,000 in fees remains for displaced 
tenants who are 62 or older, disabled or any tenant living with minor children. 
</P>
<P>
A staff report prepared by the city attorney's office said the increase in fees 
reflects the growing difference between the average maximum rent allowed in 
rent-controlled units in Santa Monica and the average for unregulated 
apartments in Santa Monica and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment 
under rent control is $416. The same size apartment in the open market in Santa 
Monica and West Los Angeles would rent for $1,186. A two-bedroom under rent 
control averages $558, and in the open market it rents for $1,357. 
</P>
<P>
The new $3,750 relocation fee for a one-bedroom apartment, for example, 
includes $770 representing the additional cost of rent for one month; $2,372, 
the equivalent of two months' rent as a security deposit; $360 for moving 
costs, and $178 to hook up utilities. The total of $3,680 is rounded up to 
$3,750. 
</P>
<P>
But apartment owner James Baker questioned whether the market rates used in the 
formula were appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Baker contended that the figures cited by the city attorney's office were not a 
fair average for unregulated nearby apartments but rather an average for newly 
constructed luxury apartments. He estimated that more realistic averages would 
be $900 for a one-bedroom apartment and $1,150 for a two-bedroom apartment.

GROWTH AGAIN ELECTION ISSUE IN CULVER CITY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: MAYOR JOZELLE SMITH IS ONE OF THREE CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR TWO CITY 
COUNCIL SEATS. COMPETING MEASURES THAT WOULD SET BUILDING LIMITS WILL ALSO BE 
ON THE BALLOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, growth was the major issue in a campaign that saw nine 
candidates run for three City Council seats in Culver City. This year, voters 
will get a replay of the issue as three candidates vie for two seats. 
</P>
<P>
Also competing against each other are two ballot measures, one to limit 
building height and the other to impose density controls on buildings over a 
certain height. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates are Mayor Jozelle Smith and newcomers Mike Balkman and Tom 
Hammons. Richard Alexander, a four-term councilman, decided not to run for 
reelection, citing personal reasons, including a desire to travel. He said he 
endorses Balkman and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Although slow-growth forces consider Balkman as pro-development and 
pro-business, he likes to talk in terms of "balanced . . . renewal." 
</P>
<P>
 "Growth means that you've got land and can expand on it. We don't have a lot 
of that in Culver City," said Balkman, the 36-year-old president of an 
electrical contracting company and a member of the Culver City Chamber of 
Commerce board of directors. Instead, he said, "you take an area that's older, 
and renew it by putting new things on it. That has to be balanced between 
residential and commercial." 
</P>
<P>
Hammons, 51, is a district manager for Thrifty Drug Stores. He is backed by 
Councilmen Steven Gourley and Jim Boulgarides, who trumpeted slow-growth when 
they defeated incumbents in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she is running on her record of the past four years, which includes 
"promoting our responsible growth, even though Los Angeles is going wild with 
free-wheeling developments all around us" and "cooperation with the business 
community." Smith, 50, is an insurance agent and a columnist for a local 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in the April 10 election will also decide on the two competing measures, 
one proposed by the City Council and the other the result of a citizens' 
petition drive. Should both measures pass, the one that gets the most votes 
will take effect. 
</P>
<P>
The voters' initiative specifies only a limit on height -- 56 feet (about four 
stories) -- in certain commercial zones. Slow-growth advocates collected nearly 
3,000 signatures in 1988 to qualify it for the ballot. The vote would have been 
taken sooner if more signatures had been gathered. 
</P>
<P>
An interim ordinance that expires on Election Day limits the height of 
buildings to 58 1/2 feet, with an additional 13 1/2 feet allowed for 
architectural features and mechanical or electrical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The council's measure would impose a limit on how much of a lot could be 
covered by a structure and create traffic-mitigation requirements for any 
non-residential buildings taller than 43 feet. Such buildings would also be 
prohibited from blocking views or causing "significant detriment" by their 
shade, shadows or glare. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney has said that if the council proposal wins, the height limit 
would revert to that in the Zoning Code: 167 feet (12 stories). 
</P>
<P>
Robin Turner, a sponsor of the citizens' measure, attacks the council version 
as having no built-in height limit, saying it leaves too much up to the 
council. "It's at all their own discretion what's going to give shadow (and 
block) views." 
</P>
<P>
She said the council put its proposal on the ballot only to "discredit ours. . 
. . It's a total disregard of what the citizens' wishes are." 
</P>
<P>
Hammons agreed, saying the council version would allow "three people only (on 
the five-member council) . . . to approve a building (167 feet) tall, . . . 
regardless of the public's sentiments." 
</P>
<P>
But Smith said this was unlikely. "I can never envision 167 feet in my lifetime 
because we don't have that kind of open space." A building that tall must still 
meet setback and other requirements, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She and Balkman said the citizens' initiative lacks flexibility. "It's 
impossible to project what kinds of land uses might come before us down the 
road, where we may want to go higher than 56 feet," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's measure, she said, is more comprehensive because it includes 
criteria besides height. But Turner and Hammons argue that those considerations 
are handled by strict setback, parking and other requirements that the city 
already has. 
</P>
<P>
All the council candidates agree that downtown, where Washington and Culver 
boulevards cross, needs some sort of master plan. Smith and Hammons speak of a 
"pedestrian-friendly" area with shops and restaurants. Balkman called the 
downtown a "run-down" mishmash. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got Filmland (Corporate Center)," a modern glass edifice, "and virtually 
across the street, (the Spanish-style) Meralta Plaza," he said. "Those 
buildings don't fit at all with each other." 
</P>
<P>
The three candidates also pledge to fight traffic gridlock. "This is one of the 
worst laid out cities in terms of traffic and roads," Balkman said, saying the 
streets are too narrow and complaining about the Los Angeles traffic that cuts 
across Culver City's main arteries. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City's relationship with surrounding Los Angeles came to the fore again 
recently with the Culver City's Planning Commission's approval of Marina Place, 
a proposed regional mall at the western edge Culver City. Los Angeles officials 
are objecting to the project because of anticipated problems with traffic, 
noise and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The approval came despite findings that the mall, similar in size to the 
Westside Pavilion, would burden nearby intersections, hamper access to the 
beach and lead to unhealthful levels of air pollution. Culver City will net an 
estimated $2.5 million a year in taxes and business license fees should the 
mall be built. The City Council is expected to consider the mall's plans by 
early March. 
</P>
<P>
Balkman and Smith said they support the project as is, with Balkman saying that 
"any project is going to have some negative." 
</P>
<P>
"We've honestly tried to mitigate it the best we can," Smith said. "I don't 
think we're thumbing our nose at L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Hammons, however, said the project should be scaled down, saying, "I think of 
it as if I were living there." Cutting its size by 25% would still produce 
plenty of revenue for the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hammons said his candidacy stems from three years ago when the council 
"(imposed) its will on my (Sunkist Park) neighborhood" and erected barricades 
to solve traffic problems there. After an outcry by residents, the council 
reversed itself, but then installed stop signs and turn restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see that we prevent the government from imposing on another 
neighborhood," said Hammons, a member of the Culver City Homeowners Assn. He 
also is a member of council-appointed committees on the Studio Drive-In site 
and on sign ordinances. He will promote the need to improve parks and 
recreational facilities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Balkman, who sent surveys to registered voters to get input on issues, agrees 
with Hammons that communication between residents and city government is 
inadequate. The city should write synopses of upcoming council and 
Redevelopment Agency agendas and have them printed in local newspapers, he 
said. The City Council, he said, has to be more fiscally responsible and ask 
common sense questions. 
</P>
<P>
Balkman is the president of the Culver City Lions Club and a member of the 
Culver City Homeowners Assn. He said the city should help the school district 
with security, maintenance and by donating equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Smith argues that City Hall has already had an open door, to the extent of 
getting criticized for "involving citizens too much, where a simple 
grab-the-bull-by-the-horns-and-council-make-a-decision would be the right or 
proper thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
She is pleased with the revamping of Studio Village shopping center but decries 
the number of mini-malls in the city. But, she added, "it's unrealistic to 
think we can only attract Beverly Hills-type shops because we're not a Beverly 
Hills neighborhood." 
</P>

City Clerk Pauline Dolce is running unopposed for another four-year term.

PLANNERS RECOMMEND 50% CUT IN DENSITY; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: IF ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL, THE ORDINANCE WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER 
OF ALLOWABLE APARTMENTS, CONDOMINIUMS AND TOWNHOUSES FROM 40,000 TO 20,000. 
</P>

<P>
Despite opposition from property owners and reservations expressed by all its 
members, the Glendale Planning Commission on Monday narrowly approved a plan to 
reduce by half the number of apartments, condominiums and townhouses allowed in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted 3 to 2 to recommend that the City Council adopt the 
sweeping density reductions covering every part of the city zoned for 
multifamily housing. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also voted in favor of a proposal to create the zoning 
designation of "transitional area" between single- and multiple-family 
neighborhoods. In transitional areas, apartments and condominiums would have to 
be set back farther, could be no more than two stories and would require 
approval by the city's Design Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
To become law, both ordinances must win the votes of four of the council's five 
members. The council will have a hearing on the proposal Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the ordinance would allow four units on a typical 50-by-150-foot 
lot in a high-density zone instead of the eight now allowed. The capacity of 
the same lot would be reduced from six units to three units in medium-density 
zones and from four units to two in the lowest multiple-density zones. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that the ordinance would reduce the number of potential 
undeveloped units from about 40,000 to 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The commission action came after four public hearings in which some residents 
supported the proposals, saying they were necessary to preserve Glendale's 
quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
But a majority of the about 250 people who attended the hearings opposed the 
proposed ordinances on grounds that they would lower their property values and 
deny them the right to develop their properties to the same degree their 
neighbors had. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council asked the planning staff to draft the growth-reduction 
ordinances after several failed attempts at growth control following a 
population surge that began in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In the past four years the city's population has grown from 155,000 to at least 
170,000. Recent surveys suggest that number might be closer to 190,000. For the 
first time school overcrowding, traffic congestion, parking shortages and gang 
activity have become chronic problems in Glendale's increasingly dense 
residential areas south of the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The council adopted a moratorium on apartment construction in September, 1988, 
but the courts generally uphold such moratoriums only up to two years, James 
Glaser, the principal planner, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said they fear that unless some kind of growth-control 
measures are in place by the end of the year, a flood of building-permit 
applications will follow the lifting of the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to forestall the potential problem, the commission endorsed a 
proposal that did not completely satisfy any of its members. All five 
commissioners said they would have preferred to implement a neighborhood 
rezoning plan, which would reduce allowed building density on a 
neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis -- a strategy that the City Council also 
supports in principle. 
</P>
<P>
But Glaser told the commissioners that such a process would take at least 18 
months, putting its implementation far past the moratorium's projected 
expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Gerald Briggs, who introduced the ordinance, said the commission's 
support of the plan was contingent on the City Council's prompt initiation of a 
community rezoning plan to allow for differences between neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Claudia Culling and Chairman Gary Tobian voted in favor of the 
ordinance. Commissioners Lloyd Boucher and Don Pearson opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said he opposed the zoning reductions because they could be modified 
soon by a neighborhood rezoning plan. "I prefer to vote on a zoning change 
once, so people don't get changed again and again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson said he opposed the measure as "too drastic a reduction" and feared it 
would unfairly penalize the single-family homeowners whose houses are already 
boxed in by large apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Even the commissioners who voted for the proposal held little hope that the 
ordinance would do much more than provide the city with an interim control 
until the neighborhood plans are completed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just buying time," Briggs said. "If we don't do it, we'll have an 
explosion of multifamily construction." 
</P>
<P>
Tobian said he would vote for the ordinance because he couldn't think of an 
alternative, given the time constraints. 
</P>
<P>
Cullen voted for the proposal after suggesting several alternatives to it that 
would have provided relief to single-family homeowners in high-density 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Glaser said the transitional zoning proposal is aimed at diminishing the 
impacts of living in a house next to large apartments -- such as increased 
traffic, parking and loss of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
It was adopted on a 3-1 vote, with Pearson voting against it because he said he 
needed more time to study the proposal. Boucher left the meeting a few minutes 
before the vote.

<P>
COMMUNITIES: THE EAST VALLEYS ORGANIZATION HAS LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN AGAINST 
DRUGS AND GANG ACTIVITY.

The East Valleys Organization, best-known for its efforts to clean up the San 
Gabriel Valley's contaminated ground water, has launched an ambitious 
anti-crime campaign aimed at cleaning up the area's gang-infested streets. 
</P>
<P>
At a rally Tuesday night at Sacred Heart Church in Pomona, nearly 400 people 
gathered to launch the "Turn the Tide" campaign. Police chiefs from Baldwin 
Park, Azusa and Pomona attended, as did Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sick and tired of gang violence, drugs and crime," said Jesse Martinez, 
secretary of Carpenters Local 309, which the East Valleys group formally 
inducted at the rally. "But it will not change until we are determined to 
change it for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
EVO, a predominantly Catholic group that claims to represent nearly 40,000 
families, mostly Latino, will continue its campaign Friday night with a 
police-escorted march to a crack house in one of Pomona's most crime-plagued 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We are frustrated seeing the lives of our youths wasted by violence and 
drugs," said the Rev. William Easterling of St. Joseph's Catholic Church, who, 
at the end of Tuesday's rally, led a candlelight prayer service for the 49 
people who have been murdered in Pomona in the last 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
"Turn the Tide" is part of a larger grass-roots effort by EVO and an alphabet 
soup of sister organizations throughout the county, which for years have 
agitated to bring about progressive social change. 
</P>
<P>
The other participants include the United Neighborhood Organization (UNO), 
which has its roots in East Los Angeles; the South Central Organizing Committee 
(SCOC), based in the South-Central part of the city, and the Valley Organized 
in Community Efforts (VOICE), which covers the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The four groups collectively represent nearly 90 churches and synagogues and 
about 250,000 families. They are all political descendants of the movement 
fathered by the late Saul Alinsky, the social reformer who got his start in the 
1930s rallying Chicago's Irish slums into a power bloc and who later wrote the 
manifesto, "Rules for Radicals." 
</P>
<P>
The groups' efforts will wind up at the Los Angeles Coliseum on March 31, when 
thousands of protesters will march through the surrounding neighborhood, in a 
demonstration aimed at cleaning up the streets of South-Central Los Angeles.

STUDENTS THROW PARTY TO SHOW THAT A SOBER EXPERIENCE CAN STILL BE FUN; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: NEARLY 1,000 WESTSIDE STUDENTS FROM 12 SCHOOLS ATTEND A 'SOBER BASH' 
THAT OFFERED A GOOD TIME FREE OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL.

<P>
High school party-goers don't need to get wasted to have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
That is the message that Kolo Inc., an organization of students from 12 public 
and private high schools, tried to send when it threw its first "sober bash" 
Saturday night in an empty airplane hangar at the Santa Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to give students an alternative," said Shane McCoy, a 17-year-old 
student at Marlborough School who helped organize the event. "Hopefully, 
everyone will consider it a night to remember, a night that, by the way, was 
also drug- and alcohol-free. We'd like them to wake up the next day (after a 
Kolo event) without the headache and say: 'Hey, I had a good time.' " 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, Saturday's party was a success, drawing nearly 1,000 
teen-agers and raising about $4,000 during an evening of wholesome fun and 
entertainment that, except for a couple of incidents late in the evening, lived 
up to its billing. 
</P>
<P>
Kolo was started about a year ago by Jasha Salter, a mother of three. She began 
organizing the group after the alcohol-related deaths of four students in an 
auto accident on San Vicente Boulevard in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Salter met with students and administrators of Beverly Hills, Palisades, Santa 
Monica and University high schools, as well as private institutions such as the 
Brentwood School, Crossroads School, Harvard School, Loyola, Marlborough, 
Marymount High School, Windward School and the Westlake School for Girls. 
</P>
<P>
"But I knew if an organization was going to be a success, it would have to be 
run by the students," said Salter, whose daughter attends Westlake. "The 
students don't want to preach; they just want to have drug- and alcohol-free 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, they rejected the idea of using an acronym for its name that 
would spell out an anti-alcohol theme. Instead they opted for Kolo, the name of 
a Serbo-Croatian dance. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of Saturday's party said that at first they had a hard time 
persuading fellow students to attend because non-alcoholic events are 
considered "nerdy." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone at Harvard High School was completely thrilled with the notion, 
said Deron Quon, 17, student body president. "I told them they should try it; 
it's something new, and they could really have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Most didn't mind that the only refreshments being served were sandwiches, 
cupcakes and soft drinks. Pepsi was a sponsor of the event and the Laker Girls 
provided entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having a great time, and it's a lot safer," said Katarina, a 17-year-old 
Beverly Hills High School student. "You can have a good time and don't have to 
worry about someone getting drunk and not being able to make it home." 
</P>
<P>
But others said the party lacked the sense of frivolity that could only come 
from booze. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to drink no matter what," said Vince, an 18-year-old Loyola 
senior. "I think it's unrealistic to think that you can have a party, say it's 
alcohol-free, and it's going to make a difference. The fact of the matter is 
that you have a better time when you've had something to drink. I know I do." 
</P>
<P>
Security at the party was provided by Santa Monica police officers and 
employees of the city's Cultural and Recreation Services Department, which was 
also a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Ybarra, a recreation supervisor, said the city anticipated that there 
might be problems. Extra security was called in and local groups that provide 
safe rides were contacted to take home those who would not follow the spirit of 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the dance, the anticipated trouble arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be no drinking inside here, but there are plenty of people drinking 
beer in the parking lot," said one high school student. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica officials nabbed one carload of teen-agers and forced them to 
empty into the street the 24 cans of beer they had in the car. But no one 
managed to catch the culprit who brazenly smoked a marijuana joint, which other 
students smelled on the crowded dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a still a success," said Akua Campanella, a Beverly Hills High School 
student. "When you compare it to other parties, this is great."

Photo, KEEPING IT DRY: Alcohol was strictly forbidden, but there was plenty to

POMONA VOTERS MAY DECIDE ON BIGGER COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: JUNE VOTERS WILL CONSIDER C. L. (CLAY) BRYANT'S RECALL AND MAY DECIDE 
WHETHER THE CITY COUNCIL SHOULD BE ENLARGED AND CITYWIDE ELECTION OF MAYOR 
SCRAPPED.

<P>
Voters will decide June 5 whether to recall Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant and 
may be asked to enlarge the City Council to seven members and eliminate the 
elected post of mayor. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Elizabeth Villeral reported Tuesday night that petitions seeking the 
recall of Bryant had enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. The council 
voted to submit the recall to voters at the June 5 state primary, saving the 
expense of a separate city election. 
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, the council instructed interim City Atty. Arnold M. 
Glasman to prepare amendments to the City Charter that would drastically change 
the city's governing board. 
</P>
<P>
The city now is governed by a mayor and four council members. All are elected 
in a citywide vote, although council members must live within district 
boundaries. Under the proposed system, seven council members would be elected 
by districts, and the mayor's post would be rotated among them. 
</P>
<P>
The council plans to hire a consultant to help draw district boundaries. The 
boundaries must be considered by the Planning Commission and then be approved 
again by the council before the proposal qualifies for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Glasman said the city has only until March 8 to complete the steps to put a 
measure on the June ballot. If approved, the system would go into effect at 
municipal elections in March, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the city spent more than $1 million successfully defending the 
current system against a suit that charged citywide council elections 
discriminated against minorities. Since then, however, the composition of the 
council has changed, and one of the plaintiffs in the suit, Tomas Ursua, was 
elected to the council last year. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Nell Soto said population growth mandates an increased number of 
council members. Pomona, which had 92,742 residents in 1980, now has 120,000 or 
more, Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer agreed, saying, "I think the 1990 census will 
tell us there are 135,000 people in this town, and it's important to have seven 
districts." 
</P>
<P>
Soto said the city could increase harmony on the council by scrapping the 
system of electing a mayor directly. She said some council friction comes from 
jockeying for advantage in mayoral elections. By rotating the mayor's position, 
she said, "everyone would know they would have a chance to be mayor sooner or 
later if they stayed on the council long enough." 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Donna Smith said that if all seven council members elected to 
four-year terms were given a chance to be mayor, the post would rotate every 6 
1/2 months. She said such a short stint as mayor would be confusing to 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Soto said the post would not have to be rotated that frequently. There is no 
reason why every council member should serve as mayor, she said, adding that 
she would be glad to forgo the honor herself. She added that the post of mayor 
carries no more real power than a seat on the council. 
</P>
<P>
After the council meeting, Bryant said he believes placing the district 
election issue on the ballot with the recall will help his efforts to retain 
his seat by bringing out a heavy vote among minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, who is white, has championed minority causes. After the council meeting 
Tuesday night, Bryant said, "That's my secret weapon -- the minority vote in 
this town." 
</P>
<P>
But Melody Peterson, who chairs the committee that has been working since last 
summer to recall Bryant, said: "Clay Bryant does not have the minorities in his 
back pocket. In every neighborhood, we walked to get signatures (on recall 
petitions), we got signatures. You cannot say the recall of Clay Bryant is a 
black, brown or white issue." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, a 70-year-old retired engineer, has been elected to the council three 
times, was voted off the council once and has waged four unsuccessful campaigns 
for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The petitions circulated to recall Bryant list his alleged "vindictive, 
intimidating and contemptuous attitude toward this city, its citizens and 
employees," his alleged description of opponents as idiots, nobodies and liars, 
and his "distortion and misrepresentation of the facts." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant has said Smith and others who have lost political power as a result of a 
realignment of the council are behind the recall. On major issues before the 
council, Bryant is usually in the majority, and Smith is often in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said 250 to 300 people collected 11,361 signatures to recall Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
The city clerk turned the recall petitions over to the office of the county 
registrar of voters to determine if they had been signed by the required 8,304 
persons, representing 20% of the city's registered voters. The clerk said the 
county checked 9,605 signatures and determined that 8,485 of them were valid, 
qualifying the recall for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Voters will be asked to decide whether to recall Bryant, and if he is recalled, 
whether he should be replaced by appointment or by a special election. If a 
special election is approved, it would be held about three or four months after 
the June 5 vote.

PAYMENTS HELD IN SCHOOL BID VIOLATION

Three contractors that are owed almost $95,000 by the Compton Unified School 
District cannot be paid because the district violated public bidding laws, 
county education officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Office of Education, which must approve all bills paid 
by school districts, has concluded after a six-month review that the district 
should have solicited bids when it decided to renovate part of its 
administrative offices. 
</P>
<P>
The Compton school official who approved the work was warned that the district 
should solicit bids, according to a report ordered by the county. But the 
official, Associate Supt. James H. Turner, reportedly replied: "I have a way 
around that." 
</P>
<P>
Turner did not return several calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Supt. Elisa L. Sanchez insists that the district acted properly. The 
school district's attorney, Melanie E. Lomax, contends that the renovation work 
was an emergency -- which allowed the district to waive bidding requirements -- 
because there was asbestos in the building walls. The attorney says the work, 
which began in December, 1988, might have been delayed as much as two months if 
district officials had solicited bids. 
</P>
<P>
"The central dispute," Lomax said, "is that there are three vendors who 
performed a service for the district and they have not been paid." 
</P>
<P>
However, county officials disputed the district's explanation. The county found 
no evidence that the district paid a contractor to remove or seal asbestos, 
officials said. And district employees told The Times that the area under 
renovation was not sealed off and that construction went on around them as they 
worked at their desks. The employees asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
County school officials notified Compton district officials in a Jan. 23 letter 
that the payments would not be allowed to the three contractors on the 
renovation project, which involved tearing out walls and ceiling tiles, 
installing new lighting and completing duct work for the heating and 
air-conditioning system on a wing of the administration building at 604 S. 
Tamarind Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The state Education Code requires that districts solicit bids for work in 
excess of $15,000 and equipment exceeding $21,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders Engineering of La Habra, for example, did $48,894 worth of work on the 
renovation project, but four different payment orders -- each under the $15,000 
limit -- were issued to the firm. Three of the orders were written on the same 
day, according to the county report. 
</P>
<P>
Carrier Air Conditioning Corp., located in the City of Industry, supplied five 
air-conditioning units worth a total of $30,885, which is over the $21,000 
limit for equipment. But the district split the amount it owed Carrier into two 
payment orders. One was for $15,975, another for $14,910. 
</P>
<P>
A payment of $14,913 also has been withheld from Construction Dynamics of 
Palmdale. Some payments were made to contractors on the $163,000 renovation job 
before the county began raising questions. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce N. Zentil, county school financial services director, said the county is 
not accusing Compton officials of bid-splitting, which could be a criminal 
violation. "Bid-splitting gets into intention, and that's more difficult to 
handle," Zentil said. "We are formally disapproving payments due to failure to 
advertise and bid." 
</P>
<P>
Zentil added, however, that "it is difficult to accept that this is all 
oversight and omission when you have three (payment orders) issued on the same 
day." The county first spotted the split payment orders in May or June, Zentil 
said, and sought an explanation. The county oversees all payments for school 
districts and actually writes their checks, although the money comes from the 
school districts' accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The county asked that the district's auditor review the contracts. When 
officials received no report last fall, they renewed their request in a letter 
to then-Supt. Ted D. Kimbrough. County officials received a report in December, 
the same month that Kimbrough left to become superintendent of Chicago public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Zentil said his office is being sued by two of the contractors on the Compton 
project in an effort to obtain their money. The two contractors also are suing 
the Compton district. Zentil said he and the county legal staff believe the 
courts will uphold the county because Compton school officials failed to comply 
with bidding laws. 
</P>
<P>
Compton school board President Mary B. Henry was out of the country last week 
and could not be contacted for comment. Board member Sam Littleton said he did 
not want to comment. Board member Kelvin D. Filer said the board will discuss 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Board member John Steward said the county's action was an "indictment" of the 
school board. "From the outset, I felt that the project was handled 
improperly," Steward said. "It should have gone to bid." Steward said he 
complained early on about the project. 
</P>
<P>
Steward said disciplinary action should be taken against employees responsible 
for hiring the contractors. Acting Supt. Sanchez said, however, that she will 
not recommend that disciplinary action be taken against Turner. 
</P>
<P>
The district auditor's report said that the renovation was discussed at a 
November, 1988, meeting attended by Gene Parks, the district's business 
services manager at the time; William Howell, district architect; Craig 
Jackson, president of Sanders Engineering, and Turner, who was purchasing 
director and now is an associate superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Parks said he and Howell told Turner that the district should solicit bids, 
according to the report. Parks said Turner responded: "I have a way around 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Howell did not return calls to his office. Jackson declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez dismissed Parks' statement, saying he was a "disgruntled" former 
employee whose job was eliminated by the district. 
</P>
<P>
But Parks said in an interview last week that he made his statement to the 
auditor before the district eliminated his job. The auditor, Parks said, came 
to his office last June when the county first noticed the series of vouchers 
for the contractors. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go and solicit him," Parks said. Parks' last day of work in the 
district was July 26. He said he was told in June that he might lose his job. 
</P>
<P>
Parks said he had told Kimbrough previously that he believed bid-splitting was 
occurring on the project, according to the auditor's report.

SOVIET LAWYER HOLDS NO BRIEF FOR HER COUNTRY'S JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Painting a far from flattering picture of her homeland, a Soviet lawyer 
visiting Ventura County this week blasted Soviet economic reforms, charged that 
her country's judges are corrupt and called her fellow countrymen rude. 
</P>
<P>
Irina Mashlenko, touring Ventura at the invitation of Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury, showed no qualms about stating her views on conditions in her 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The self-possessed 29-year-old, who is not a member of the Communist Party, 
said the trip, part of a unique six-month internship, would have been 
impossible without recent changes in her country. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in history that this has been done and it's really 
remarkable to be involved in this program without interference of a 
governmental organization," Mashlenko said after touring the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury met Mashlenko at a law conference she was attending in November as 
part of her internship with a Maryland legal firm. Bradbury said he was 
surprised by Mashlenko's outspokenness. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was her willingness to share information about the Soviet Union that 
made it worthwhile to sponsor the six-day trip to California, where she studied 
the district attorney's office and told lawyers about conditions and changes in 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it would be a mutually enriching experience for the local lawyers in 
light of what is going on in the world today," Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would not have been as beneficial if we had had someone come out who was 
not as forthcoming," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Mashlenko is one of 17 Soviet lawyers chosen from 167 candidates in a program 
sponsored by the American Bar Assn. and the Soros Foundation, a New York agency 
that funds different educational and social programs in the United States and 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The program allows the lawyers -- who must speak English, have a legal 
education and be younger than 35 -- to work with private attorneys, public 
defenders, state prosecutors and legal researchers in offices stretching from 
Maine to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"The belief was that the Soviet lawyers could profit from the long-term 
practical exposure to the way law firms work," said Anthony Richter, program 
director of the Soros Foundation. "They could see the roles of lawyers in the 
United States and even possible things they could avoid as they go about 
shaping their own society's laws in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Mashlenko said she did not know when many of the changes recently suggested to 
rectify the Soviet justice system would be enacted and doubted whether some 
would work. Hesitating once or twice and stressing that she does not speak for 
her country, Mashlenko sharply criticized the traditional Soviet justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
She said defendants are beaten into making confessions, prisoners are 
prohibited from taking showers and corrupt judges are easily bribed. 
</P>
<P>
Many Soviet judges are swayed toward certain decisions under threat of recall 
by the government bodies that elect them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knew that the judge was not independent in his decision because it's 
easy to bribe the judge," Mashlenko said, adding that Soviet judges 
traditionally have received low pay and are not accorded much respect. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, prison conditions in the Soviet Union are dismal. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet prisoners live in outdated facilities and are banned from using the 
television, telephone or showers. They are severely limited in the 
opportunities they have for seeing their families and are only allowed about 
three letters per year, she said. She said the most important difference 
between the legal systems in the Soviet Union and United States is the jury 
trial. Trial by jury was recently approved in theory in the Soviet Union but 
has yet to be implemented, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, she said, juries will only be used in cases in which the defendant has 
committed a crime that carries the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mashlenko said, she believes the American justice system has its own 
problems, notably the length of time many condemned prisoners spend on Death 
Row as they await rulings on their appeals for a change of sentence. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, she said, the appellate process is much quicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it's terrible when a person lives and lives and is still 
waiting," she said. "In Russia, the death penalty is executed." 
</P>
<P>
Keenly interested in her surroundings, Mashlenko has observed more than the 
legal system, noting especially the clean restaurants and restrooms in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
She said she also was pleased by Americans' volunteer efforts to donate money 
and clothing to those less fortunate. And she has enjoyed the friendliness of 
those she has met. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of all the difficulties in our country, people are so involved in 
their own problems that they're more aggressive and ruder," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While she has enjoyed her experiences here, Mashlenko said, she is preoccupied 
by the rapid changes now occurring in her country. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are so excited, but, excuse me, I really can't believe it," she 
said. "I'm a little more skeptical." 
</P>
<P>
Mashlenko said she believes that despite Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's 
success in foreign policy he has absolutely failed in economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
"Those economic difficulties can destroy political changes," she said. "The 
people's patience is exhausted. They don't want to wait anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Mashlenko said she has long had an interest in the American justice system. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that she has "never liked the work of the prosecutor," she said she 
wants to become a defense lawyer when she returns to the Soviet Union in April. 
</P>
<P>
She said she has been more inspired to pursue her goals after watching defense 
work by the lawyer she is interning with in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
During one case she observed, a doctor charged with fraudulent possession of 
controlled substances was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a great victory," Mashlenko said. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a demure maroon dress with a white collar and cuffs, Mashlenko paid 
close attention during her Ventura County visit, even expressing wide-eyed 
interest in a disaster-training session for county employees. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Mashlenko said, her most vivid memory will be of Disneyland, which 
she visited with Bradbury on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the strongest impression and experience I got in my stay here," 
Mashlenko said. "I almost forgot about the reason I'm here and the political 
problems and everything."

TINY CITY HAS BIG PROBLEM WITH CAR THEFTS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: HUNTINGTON PARK RANKS NINTH AMONG CITIES NATIONWIDE IN PER CAPITA 
VEHICLE THEFTS. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS ONE DETECTIVE ASSIGNED TO HANDLE THE 
CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Felicia Jones parked her 1979 Toyota one afternoon last month on Pacific 
Boulevard in Huntington Park's busy shopping district. The 23-year-old Los 
Angeles housewife returned shortly to find her car missing. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't believe it was gone," Jones said. "I wasn't gone for more than 
about 30 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
But bold, daylight car thefts are typical in Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The auto theft in this city is unbelievable," said Lt. Paul J. Catani, chief 
of the Huntington Park Police Department's detective bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The city had the ninth highest per-capita rate of motor vehicle thefts in the 
nation in 1988, the last year for which a national ranking was available, 
according to the National Automobile Theft Bureau. That year, Huntington Park 
reported 1,505 thefts, or 26.2 vehicles per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Newark, N.J., topped the list in 1988 with 14,559 thefts, or 45.6 car thefts 
per 1,000 residents. Los Angeles was 37th with 57,331, or 16.9 car thefts per 
1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers were even worse for Huntington Park in 1989, when 1,662 vehicles 
were stolen, a ratio of 27.9 thefts per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Poverty in Huntington Park, which is one of the nation's poorest cities, a 
steady stream of cars on Pacific Boulevard and a bare-bones Police Department 
contribute to the problem, police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The median household income in Huntington Park was estimated to be $15,481 in 
1985. The countywide figure was $23,905. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Ronald Farris, the city's only auto theft investigator, said there 
apparently are no well-organized auto theft rings operating in Huntington Park, 
a city of about 59,000. The majority of thefts are committed by youths who take 
a stereo or other parts before dumping a car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Farris said one juvenile was carrying a shopping list when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a list of who he sold to, how much and who wanted what," Farris said. 
Occasionally, stolen cars are tracked to an area "chop shop," where cars are 
cut into pieces and sold. 
</P>
<P>
The thefts run in cycles. Chevy Luv trucks from the late '70s and early '80s 
may be the choice of thieves for several months, and then another model is 
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Nissans and Toyotas are preferred. Toyotas have been vulnerable in 
recent years, ever since a clever car thief discovered that a shaved-down key 
from one Toyota could open others, Farris. 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of the cars stolen in Huntington Park are recovered within 10 to 15 
days, Farris said. The majority of those cars are recovered in South Los 
Angeles or East Los Angeles, but occasionally a car will turn up in Long Beach, 
San Pedro or San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, the housewife who lost her Toyota while she shopped, said officers 
recovered it in eight days. The car was damaged on one side and a $200 engine 
part had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Boulevard, a strip of shops, restaurants and movie theaters, is a key 
reason so many cars are stolen in Huntington Park, Farris said. Shoppers 
provide a steady stream of cars, and they often park in unguarded lots behind 
the stores that front the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A four-square-block area bounded by Zoe, Florence, Rita and Rugby avenues is 
particularly vulnerable. Pacific Boulevard runs down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the bulk of cars are taken, and they're taken from noon to 5 
o'clock," Farris said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's many alleys, where residents often park, also are attractive to car 
thieves. 
</P>
<P>
Catani said the Police Department has been unable to reduce the auto theft rate 
because it has too few officers. "Our main problem is manpower," Catani said. 
"High visibility is a high deterrent to auto theft." 
</P>
<P>
Police officials will ask the city to hire a sergeant and four motorcycle 
officers next year to attack the problem of auto thefts, Catani said. The 
request probably will be turned down. Last October, financial problems forced 
the city to lay off 25 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park is an extreme example of a statewide trend, according to a 
California Highway Patrol spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, 267,229 vehicles were taken in 1988, a 15.5% increase over the 
previous year. There were 114,785 motor vehicles stolen in Los Angeles County 
in 1988, up 6.9% from 1987. Nine out of 10 of those vehicles were cars, pickup 
trucks and vans, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of 11 Southeast area cities revealed increases in auto theft in all 
but one. 
</P>
<P>
During 1984-85, thieves took 473 vehicles in Lakewood, compared to 1,002 in 
1988-89. Similarly, vehicle thefts for Downey jumped from 605 in 1985 to 1,211 
last year. Detectives in several of the cities said they cannot pinpoint any 
one reason for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
Several Southeast area cities have been moving recently to curb auto thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Lakewood started its Auto Watch program, which is patterned 
after a program in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who participate in the voluntary program are given stickers to place 
on their cars. The stickers tell officers they have the right to stop the car 
between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., a period of time when the owner usually would not be 
driving his car. Lakewood spokesman Donald J. Waldie said about 400 residents 
have signed up since the program was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
"It's designed to give an extra measure of security to people who park their 
cars in their driveways and streets at night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Downey police officials are considering a similar program. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakewood sheriff's substation has started a new warning program for 
residents in the six Southeast cities it serves: Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, 
Hawaiian Gardens, Lakewood and Paramount. Deputies place notices on unlocked 
cars that state: "Your car could have become a statistic." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 Southeast cities surveyed, Compton was the only one to report 
declining numbers of auto thefts. The number of motor vehicle thefts in Compton 
has been decreasing from 1,773 thefts in 1985 to 1,478 last year, according to 
a Compton Police Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The downward trend is difficult to explain, Cmdr. Thomas Armstrong said. "We 
haven't put any special enforcement effort on it," Armstrong said. "It's just 
one of those phenomena."

200 VENTURA UNIFIED TEACHERS PROTEST LENGTHY CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200 Ventura Unified School District teachers crowded into the 
district boardroom Tuesday night to protest unresolved contract negotiations 
that are now in their 10th month. 
</P>
<P>
Bearing signs reading "We Want a Fair Contract" and "We Can't Go On Meeting 
Like This," the teachers stood quietly while union representative Jerry 
Mittelholtz accused the district of turning a "cold shoulder" to the district's 
650 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't feel important," said Barbara Schmidt, a reading specialist at 
Montalvo Elementary School. "I think that the trust between teachers and the 
school board is not strong . . . Our teachers are excellent, but the morale is 
low." 
</P>
<P>
District teachers have been working without a contract since June, unable to 
reach agreement on items ranging from salary to retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the state Public Employees Relations Board appointed a mediator in 
hopes of concluding an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Under the expired contract, Ventura Unified teachers earn between $22,902 and 
$44,772. 
</P>
<P>
One district official told The Times on Wednesday that the entire union salary 
and benefits package represents a 14.8% pay and benefits increase. A union 
official said the district's latest pay offer is a 1.5% salary increase, but 
would not say what the union is demanding. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's protest came less than 24 hours after an informal meeting, an 
eight-hour meeting district negotiator Richard Averett described as "very 
productive." 
</P>
<P>
Both district officials and teacher representatives declined to discuss the 
specifics of the meeting. However, they indicated that little has changed since 
contract meetings began in April of last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The main issues are still a fair contract monetarily, fair fringe benefits and 
fair treatment and equality for all our teachers," said Mittelholtz, president 
of the Ventura Unified Education Assn., which is representing the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Mittelholtz, who attended Monday's informal meeting, was guardedly optimistic. 
Negotiations were scheduled to continue today. 
</P>
<P>
While teacher contracts remain unresolved, efforts to convert two Ventura 
elementary schools to year-round education appear close to completion. 
</P>
<P>
Citing parent surveys that appear to indicate overwhelming support, parents and 
educators from E.P. Foster and Sheridan Way elementary schools urged board 
members Tuesday to approve a year-round schedule for the two Ventura 
Avenue-area schools. Under the plan, the two elementary schools would move to a 
year-round schedule by July. The board is expected to make a final decision 
Feb. 27.

About 500 students at Whittier College found themselves eating meals on the 
grassy campus lawn and in the faculty lounge this week after a blaze late 
Sunday night destroyed the campus cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
College officials were expected to hire a catering service to set up a 
temporary cafeteria on a corner of the campus. In the meantime, college cooks 
have been using an outdoor barbecue to prepare food for the students. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Sarr, a spokeswoman for the college, said fire investigators determined 
that the blaze, which caused about $500,000 damage, was sparked by an 
electrical short in a kitchen refrigerator.

CITY ALTERS WORK SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Hall will close every other Friday to help meet anti-pollution standards 
by reducing the number of vehicle trips by city employees, the City Council 
decided Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The new schedule, to start April 2, will affect about a third of the city's 
employees but will not affect services, such as police, fire and maintenance 
crews, according to personnel director Gordon Youngs. 
</P>
<P>
City Hall will open 30 minutes earlier, at 7:30 a.m., and close 30 minutes 
later, at 5:30 p.m., on days of operation. The affected employees will 
therefore still be working 80 hours during each two-week period. 
</P>
<P>
By closing every 10th day, Culver City will almost reach the goal of 1 1/2 city 
employees per vehicle arriving to work set by the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District, Youngs said. Failure to reach this goal could result in 
heavy fines for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 to approve the new hours, with Councilmen Jim 
Boulgarides and Steven Gourley dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
The majority felt that sacrificing one Friday of public access to city offices 
is necessary to avoid the fines and help clean the air. Boulgarides and 
Gourley, however, said City Hall should be open five days a week and that the 
city could meet the anti-pollution standards through other means. 
</P>
<P>
April 6 is the first Friday City Hall will close due to the new hours, Youngs 
said.

EX-OFFICIALS TO GET SUBSIDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted 3 to 2 to subsidize health insurance costs for former 
council members who do not qualify for retirement coverage under the city's 
health benefit policy. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidy, prompted by a letter from former Mayor Dick Brundo, will be equal 
to the amount paid retirees who qualify for continued coverage under the Public 
Employees Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
This amount is now about $130 a month, according to personnel director Gordon 
Youngs. 
</P>
<P>
Brundo, who does not qualify for retirement coverage because he was under age 
50 when he left office, now pays about $350 per month for private insurance 
coverage, Youngs said. 
</P>
<P>
"After 12 years of service, anyone who's put that amount of time on the council 
has earned some benefit," said Councilman Jim Boulgarides, who made the motion 
to subsidize his former political opponent. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Paul Jacobs, who voted against the subsidy along with Councilman 
Steven Gourley, said that if the city were going to subsidize former council 
members, it should similarly subsidize city employees who don't qualify under 
the current system.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: MARINA DEL REY; 
</P>
<P>
TOURIST PROMOTIONS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Small Craft Harbor Commission agreed Wednesday to support an increase in 
the county's hotel room tax from 10% to 12%, but only if the increased revenue 
is used to promote tourism at Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory commission acted after Marina del Rey's largest leaseholder, 
Abraham M. Lurie, urged the panel to establish a three-year pilot program to 
promote the county-owned marina. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie told the commission last month that his Marina Beach, Marina del Rey and 
Marina International hotels continue to suffer substantial losses because of 
low occupancy rates and a lack of promotion of the marina as a destination for 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's recommendation will be forwarded to the county Board of 
Supervisors, which has already approved the hotel tax increase for all 
unincorporated areas, including Marina del Rey. It is uncertain whether the 
supervisors will agree to allocate the additional revenue raised at the marina 
to promote tourism there. 
</P>
<P>
The tax increase is expected to generate an additional $600,000 a year once the 
new Ritz Carlton Hotel opens for business. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie asked commissioners to support efforts to devote some of the existing 
hotel tax to advertise the marina. He complained that $600,000 would not be 
adequate. "It's going to take a lot of money" to change "the image or lack of 
image of the marina," Lurie said. 
</P>
<P>
He argued that the county would benefit from an increase in rents on marina 
businesses and sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But David Naftalin, attorney for the Marina Tenants Assn., objected to the 
plan, calling it a gift of public funds that will benefit private businesses. 
"We seem to have lost sight of the fact that the lessees are agents of the 
County of Los Angeles, operating as concessionaries on public property," 
Naftalin wrote in a letter.

BUILDING CONTROLS EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has unanimously approved a one-year extension of 
temporary controls on development in the Westchester Bluffs area. 
</P>
<P>
The extension through March, 1991, will give city planners a chance to complete 
a permanent plan to regulate building on the scenic bluffs in Westchester and 
Playa del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said the extension "will give us the time we need to 
carefully draft a law giving permanent protection to the area." 
</P>
<P>
A draft of the permanent plan is expected to be available in two to three 
months with final action anticipated by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary controls, imposed in September, 1988, are intended to limit the 
construction of large homes while planners determine how best to protect the 
scenic resources and natural features of the bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
The interim control ordinance imposes limits on the height of buildings, the 
distance between structures, the type of landscaping and the amount of land 
coverage that can occur on a lot in the bluff area. 
</P>
<P>
Landowners seeking a building permit will be required to conduct a survey of 
their property to determine the maximum height of a proposed building.

Tuesday approved the idea and directed the city engineer to seek bids. 
</P>
<P>
The wisteria-draped pergola, or arbor, was erected 10 years ago outside City 
Hall at 232 W. Sierra Madre Blvd. The vines' dampness eventually weakened the 
structure's wood crossbeams. 
</P>
<P>
After one section of the pergola collapsed last year, the rest of the structure 
was examined and found to be unsafe. For most of last year, only the base of 
the arbor remained outside City Hall, its block posts topped with bits of steel 
wire and plates stretching upward into the empty air where the vine-covered 
pergola once arched.

MCDONALD'S HEARINGS SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Altadena residents will have a chance to speak out about plans for a new 
McDonald's restaurant under an ordinance adopted Tuesday by the county Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, proposed by Supervisor Mike Antonovich, requires the creation of 
a commercial development plan for the site and the scheduling of public 
hearings before the Regional Planning Commission and the board. 
</P>
<P>
The board hearing will be March 29; no date has been set for the planning 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The new restaurant, proposed for the northwest corner of Altadena Drive and 
Lake Avenue, has drawn stiff opposition from residents who say the restaurant 
will be incompatible with the surrounding residential neighborhood and will 
bring increased traffic and cooking fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerns prompted a review last week by the traffic and lighting division 
of the county Public Works Department, which determined that it meets state 
traffic safety codes. Because the new McDonald's also follows zoning 
requirements for the site and complies with the community and county general 
plans, no public hearing would have been required without the new ordinance.

AMENDMENT OKD FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors on Tuesday approved an amendment to the city's 
Growth Management Initiative for placement on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by voters, the amendment would exempt, in the Civic Center Master 
Plan area, building projects that received approval before Nov. 7, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
It would also allow a simple majority vote -- instead of the two-thirds now 
required -- for board passage of certain exceptions to the ordinance. Finally, 
it would clarify the initiative's language regarding construction in the city's 
Northwest Enterprise Zone. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year initiative, passed in March, limits annual residential construction 
to 250 units and major commercial construction to 25,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, the board also approved a pre-application process in 
which new building applications will be accepted from Feb. 20 through March 30. 
City staff members had stopped accepting applications while officials worked 
out plans to handle applications submitted before the initiative was passed.

CHARGES FILED IN THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Bernardino County district attorney's office has filed felony grand 
theft and misdemeanor charges against three San Gabriel Valley men and one 
Rancho Cucamonga resident who allegedly stole about $150,000 worth of equipment 
from an Ontario computer warehouse where they worked. 
</P>
<P>
The employees admitted to undercover investigators at Tech Data Corp. that they 
took personal computers, software and other accessories over a period of 
several months last year, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Balderrama said Friday. They allegedly sold the equipment to friends or 
wholesalers, he added. During a sting operation, one was videotaped selling 
equipment to a United Parcel Service driver, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were selling to anybody and everybody who would buy a computer," 
Balderrama said. "If they wanted a computer, they'd hide it in the trash 
outside and come back later and pick it up." Some employees also admitted using 
a variety of drugs while on the job, including cocaine, but no evidence of drug 
use was found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The four people charged last Wednesday are: Greg Jack Aragon, 23, of San Dimas; 
Marciano Cuellar, 29, of Hacienda Heights; Ignacio Flores, 23, of West Covina, 
and Lawrence Odum, 36, of Rancho Cucamonga. They are to be arraigned in Rancho 
Cucamonga Municipal Court on Feb. 26.

WATER SUPPLIES DROP; DISTRICT STUDIES OPTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: VENTURA BUYS 40% OF THE AGENCY'S WATER. ALLOCATION CUTBACKS WOULD 
INCREASE PRESSURE ON THE CITY TO RATION. 
</P>

<P>
With water supplies in Lake Casitas nearing dangerously low levels, Casitas 
Municipal Water District officials this week began planning emergency measures 
that could force customers in Ventura and Ojai to conserve. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas officials held the first of three hearings Tuesday to review possible 
mandatory and voluntary water cutbacks for the district's 2,700 customers. 
</P>
<P>
The district's largest customer is the city of Ventura, which buys 40% of 
Casitas' water. The city's water department, in turn, sells water to its 25,000 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
A cutback from Casitas would further reduce the city of Ventura's water supply 
and increase the pressure on the city to impose water-rationing measures on 
homeowners and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's water supply comes from Lake Casitas, the Ventura River and wells 
that are primarily in the East Ventura area. 
</P>
<P>
Among the five options being considered by the Casitas district are measures to 
raise water rates, limit allocations, impose a moratorium on new customers and 
develop new supplies of water, said John Johnson, district manager. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas officials said they are considering the restrictions because demand for 
water at a time of drought is outstripping supplies. If water drops below a 
critical level, Lake Casitas could run dry, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the worst that I've seen in the past 18 years that I've been 
on the board," said Marion Walker, Casitas director. The Casitas district 
covers nearly half of the city, spilling into the western part of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the water agency cannot afford to gamble on when the dry spell 
will end. If no measures are taken to restrict demand, available water that can 
be drawn from Lake Casitas could drop below the danger level in July, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like going to Las Vegas and rolling the dice," Johnson said. "If you dip 
below, then you can anticipate that when you hit your maximum dry spell, you 
could run out of water." 
</P>
<P>
Casitas officials will hold a hearing Feb. 27 to review the proposals with the 
city of Ventura before a decision is made in early March, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Casitas district is not alone in its concern about lack of rainfall. 
Residents filled Ventura City Hall Monday night hoping to kill a mandatory 
conservation plan proposed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
During a five-hour debate punctuated by jeers and clapping, Ventura City 
Manager John Baker told about 150 audience members that mandatory water 
conservation is the toughest decision the city will have to make. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most difficult issue that's faced this city in probably the last 
decade," Baker said. "We don't like to cry wolf unless the wolf is at the door. 
We're saying the wolf is at the door." 
</P>
<P>
It was the third council meeting at which the water-conservation plan has drawn 
opposition. The debate will likely be replayed at another hearing Feb. 26 
before the council takes a final vote March 5 on imposing the emergency 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
In its two-pronged attack on the water shortage, the Ventura City Council is 
reviewing a proposal to halt new water hookups temporarily while imposing a 
severe cutback on water users. If passed, the measure would take effect April 
6. 
</P>
<P>
A new provision was introduced banning all new water-service hookups until the 
city solves its water shortage. Five options were presented to the City Council 
for the first time this week, some of which could halt the building of hundreds 
of housing units planned for construction this year. 
</P>
<P>
The most stringent of the options would prevent 1,435 units from being built 
until the shortage ends. The least stringent affects no dwelling units. 
</P>
<P>
Single-family households would be restricted to using 294 gallons of water 
daily, which in some cases would be a reduction of up to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of apartments, condominiums and mobile homes have a smaller 
allocation of 196 gallons of water per day. Those who consistently violate the 
proposed ordinance would face stiff fines. 
</P>
<P>
For businesses and government offices there are no daily allocations proposed. 
They are being asked to cut back by only 15%. 
</P>
<P>
The plan drew almost universal opposition from homeowners, small and large 
business owners alike. Council members fielded questions from residents and 
business owners worried about how much their water bills would increase, while 
others argued it would mean their financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
"If Laundromats are fined four times their water bill, that would wipe me out," 
said Laundromat owner Susan A. Huff. "Where do the people who can't afford a 
washer and dryer go?" 
</P>
<P>
As council members attempted to amend the measure even in the early morning 
hours of the hearing, Mayor Richard Francis predicted that the final version 
may still anger many. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice to have an ordinance that was perfectly fair to individuals 
and was fair to every individual consideration, but it's not practical," 
Francis said.

HOPE DWINDLES IN FINDING GIRLS' PARENTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Police and child welfare officials have given up almost all hope of finding the 
parents of two baby girls abandoned in Oxnard two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
A passing stranger found the two toddlers wet and crying Dec. 14 in the women's 
restroom at Colonia Park in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Police Detective Mike Palmieri said that by all appearances the parents 
or guardians do not want to be found. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one of those baffling cases," Palmieri said. "We just don't know 
where to go from here." 
</P>
<P>
A witness told police that she saw two men and a woman visit the park carrying 
the two girls. She said they left in a black pickup truck without the. 
</P>
<P>
Later, a man passing the park restroom told police that he heard the sound of 
crying inside the building and asked a woman to check. The woman found the 
girls lying in a pool of water and urine bundled in a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
Police have ruled out kidnaping, Palmieri said. No one has reported missing 
children matching their descriptions. The girls may have been left at the 
restroom by parents who wanted them to be discovered by workers at a nearby 
day-care center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Children's Services, an agency that handles abused and abandoned 
children, has had no luck in tracking down the children's parents. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Ferratta, a program manager at the agency that oversees about 900 
children who are dependents of the court, said only one or two babies are 
abandoned each year in Ventura County, usually by parents who cannot afford to 
care for them. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 17 years of doing this work, I have not encountered such complete 
mystery," Ferratta said. "We don't have very many of these situations." 
</P>
<P>
If no one comes forward to claim the two girls, a Ventura County Superior Court 
judge in June will decide their fate, Ferratta said, adding that the agency 
will recommend that parental rights be legally terminated so that the girls can 
be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time we're in a holding pattern. We have to, by law, do all our effort 
in locating the parents," Ferratta said. Ferratta said the search will be 
extended in the next few weeks into Los Angeles and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have not determined whether the two girls are related. 
</P>
<P>
The two girls have been placed temporarily with foster parents and have become 
accustomed to the elderly Ventura couple, Ferratta said. In turn, the foster 
parents have nicknamed the two Susie and Connie. 
</P>
<P>
Susie, the eldest, may be as old as 18 months, and Connie is between 6 and 9 
months old, said Laura Ayala-Clark, a county social worker assigned to monitor 
the two girls. Neither shows signs of physical or emotional abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw Susie she looked like she was a baby that had been well 
cared for," Ayala-Clark said. "She came right up to me, she was in my lap." 
</P>
<P>
The girls' parents are believed to be Latino because of Susie's responsiveness 
to Spanish words, but she has begun to learn English, Ayala-Clark said.

PLANNER CHOSEN TO OVERSEE HOLLYWOOD REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A transportation planning expert who headed Los Angeles' downtown 
revitalization effort has been assigned to oversee the city's billion-dollar 
Hollywood redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
Donald R. Spivack, one of three operations directors for the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency, said Monday that he will supervise all aspects of the 
Hollywood project. His duties will include overseeing work done by city project 
managers, planners, engineers, and real estate and financial experts, and 
consulting with City Council offices and public interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Spivack's appointment comes at a critical juncture for Hollywood, according to 
redevelopment agency spokesman Marc Littman, because city planners are working 
with Councilman Michael Woo's staff to establish Hollywood's first 
comprehensive transportation management plan and urban design guidelines for 
Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood redevelopment project, the agency's second-largest after the 
1,500-acre central business revitalization plan, will encompass a 1,100-acre 
area bounded by Santa Monica Boulevard on the south, Franklin Avenue on the 
north, La Brea Avenue on the west and Western Avenue on the east. 
</P>
<P>
Spivack said in an interview this week that he will try to balance the wishes 
of the business community and development-sensitive community members. 
</P>
<P>
"In overseeing the project, I want to make sure that steady and good progress 
is being made in carrying out the project with a clear understanding of the 
sensitivity and needs of the community," Spivack said. "We are trying to put 
Hollywood forward on its best foot -- it's not only a world renowned place but 
home to a number of people." 
</P>
<P>
Historic preservation, improving traffic flow, remedying social needs and 
protecting neighborhoods will be top priorities in the project, which is 
formally known as the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan, Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke Sunoo, the redevelopment agency's current on-site Hollywood project 
manager, will report to Spivack but his duties will not be affected, Littman 
said. Sunoo's former supervisor, Diana Webb, was recently promoted to deputy 
chief of operations at the agency, prompting the reshuffling of assignments 
among other directors, Littman said. 
</P>
<P>
Spivack will also oversee agency redevelopment projects in North Hollywood, the 
Crenshaw District, Chinatown and Monterey Hills, Littman said. 
</P>
<P>
Spivack joined the redevelopment agency as transportation manager in December, 
1982, coordinating transportation planning in downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood 
and North Hollywood. For the last seven years, he has managed the agency's 
Central Business District Redevelopment Project. 
</P>
<P>
Before working for the agency, Spivack worked on the expansion of the 
Washington, Metro Rapid Transit System into the Maryland suburbs.

PARTNERSHIP'S GOAL IS COLLEGE FOR EVERYONE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: BRENTWOOD, PALISADES SCHOOLS JOIN UCLA IN AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM TO 
MAKE ALL STUDENTS UNIVERSITY-READY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the goal of sending every student to college, parents and public schools 
in Brentwood and Pacific Palisades have formed an educational partnership with 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Under the open-ended agreement, UCLA will try to fulfill a wish list school 
officials and parents are drafting. Some of the items the group would like to 
see included are high-tech instructional methods, role modeling, and advice on 
teacher training and student affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to prepare kids to be college-ready," said Pam Bruns, co-chairwoman of 
the Palisades Complex, a group of parents who approached UCLA with the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot partnership includes nine schools of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District: Palisades High School, Temescal Canyon (Continuation) High School, 
and the six neighborhood elementary schools and one junior high that feed into 
them. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of representatives from the Palisades Complex, UCLA and the schools 
will first tackle the needs of the high schools, said Gayle Byock, director of 
post-secondary programs at UCLA and a Palisades parent who helped set up the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades High School has its eye on a UCLA computer program that helps 
students improve their writing, Principal Gerald Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful we could initiate it with our own hardware and their software," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd said he is also interested in having the university open its libraries and 
language laboratory to his students. 
</P>
<P>
Byock said she hopes contact between students will develop. "Some kids might 
benefit from tutoring or role modeling (by) college students -- especially 
(kids) who are not thinking of college, or not (thinking of it) as their first 
option," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As yet there is no budget for the arrangement, Byock said. Instead, UCLA hopes 
to encourage staff and students to donate time and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
That, university officials said, should not be a problem. Professors who have 
reared children, like other parents, are "prepared to be involved in the 
schools on a limited basis. We're not asking the faculty to go in (to the 
schools) every day," Byock said. 
</P>
<P>
And because public service is one consideration for promotion in the University 
of California system, many professors already volunteer at community colleges 
or other outside organizations, said Edward A. Alpers, dean of honors and 
undergraduate programs for the College of Letters and Science. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has tutors and student teachers working in the public schools, offers 
seminars for teachers and has other ad-hoc ties with various schools. The 
Palisades partnership, though, is more formal and structured, participants say. 
</P>
<P>
When the Palisades Complex proposed the plan to UCLA last fall, the university 
was attracted by the strong parental support and the chance to work with 
students from kindergarten through high school, Byock said. "Children have to 
start thinking of college in elementary grades. Junior high and high school is 
too late," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership is not just helping wealthy parents get their kids into the Ivy 
League, Alpers said. About 60% of the students in the Palisades schools do not 
live on the Westside but are bused in from crowded areas of the city, he said; 
many are minorities and are not from rich homes. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades parents are concerned about "all the students" and think that UCLA's 
experiences with its ethnically, racially and economically mixed student body 
may be useful experiences to Palisades schools, he said. UCLA has changed 
curricula, hired faculty and launched programs to help students get into 
graduate school in response to its changing student population. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not intended to serve just some of the students in the schools," Alpers 
said of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership will be reviewed in November, Byock said. If it is working, 
UCLA may forge similar arrangements with other groups of schools, Alpers said.

PASADENA BOARD MAY TRY AGAIN FOR PAY HIKE, ELECTED MAYOR

The Board of Directors may revive for the ballot two proposals rejected by 
voters in 1988 -- increasing salaries for city directors and allowing voters to 
elect the mayor directly. 
</P>
<P>
City Director Jess Hughston last week proposed a second try for both measures, 
saying he still believes public sentiment is behind the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Charter commission came up with such a complicated thing (in 1988) 
that it was turned down," Hughston said. "But 58% of the voters approved the 
idea in an advisory vote two years before." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Hughston found support among other city directors who indicated 
their willingness to place both ideas on the ballot. Although they delayed 
until Feb. 27 a decision on whether to create a seven-member citizens' 
committee to study the citywide elected mayor idea, they took immediate action 
on the salary increase. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Victor Kaleta was directed to prepare three versions of a salary 
increase measure, one of which could be approved by the board Feb. 27 and 
placed on the June ballot. The options are a simple across-the-board increase, 
an increase to be indexed to the cost of living, or an increase 2 1/2 times the 
average salary received by council members in certain other cities in 
California -- the complicated proposal turned down by voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Director Rick Cole, who supported the idea of a salary increase, pointed out 
that the current payment of $50 per meeting, or up to $250 a month, was set in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said half-jokingly that some Pasadena residents are convinced that the 
board must be receiving bribes to compensate for the meager salary. 
</P>
<P>
"They think it's nuts to send people with baby-sitter salaries to guard over a 
quarter-of-a-billion-dollar corporation," he said, referring to the city 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Cole asked city staff members to translate the 1968 salary into 1990 dollars, 
an amount he estimated would be between $900 to $1,000 monthly. The board also 
asked for a survey of council salaries in cities of comparable size, such as 
Anaheim, Glendale, Burbank, Riverside and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
In reviving the pay increase proposal, Hughston noted that directors usually 
spend 30 to 50 hours a week on city business, including Tuesday board meetings 
that last seven to 10 hours. The low pay and long hours mean that only the 
wealthy, the retired or the financially self-sacrificing can serve as city 
directors, Hughston said. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't have to be a financial burden to be a city council member," 
Hughston said. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the board appeared ready to take on the salary increase proposal 
immediately, it hesitated over how to approach the citywide elected mayor 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena has seven political districts. The board's seven members are elected 
in district-only races to serve four-year terms. The mayor is selected by the 
entire board and usually is the most senior member. If a citywide elected mayor 
proposal were adopted, city voters would chose the mayor directly. 
</P>
<P>
In reviving the idea, Hughston said that under the current system, board 
members concentrate mainly on district concerns, not on overseeing the entire 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"It all boils down to accountability," Hughston said. "Someone needs to be 
accountable for the whole city." 
</P>
<P>
Under the present system, only the city manager, not an elected official, 
carries responsibility for the entire city. City Manager Don McIntyre said a 
change to a citywide elected mayor would attract more experienced and capable 
candidates for the city manager's job because larger, more urban cities tend to 
have citywide elected mayors. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed reform is especially appropriate now, Hughston said, because the 
1990 census will require city districts to be geographically redesigned. 
However, Cole noted, results from the census will not be available until 1991, 
which would mean that November, 1991, would be the earliest opportunity to 
place the citywide elected mayor proposal before the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The board said a citizens' committee could tackle related issues, such as 
whether an eighth district would be needed to avoid tie votes under the 
proposed system, and whether the mayor would serve a two-year or four-year 
term. Also to be decided would be the time of year in which the mayoral race 
would be run, either at the same time as board member elections, or during 
state elections in November -- either of which could have significant impact on 
political power in the city, Cole noted. 
</P>
<P>
Only City Director Chris Holden and Mayor William Thomson seemed unenthusiastic 
about the plans for a citywide elected mayor and creation of an eighth 
district. Thomson said he had no opinion on the proposals; Holden said Pasadena 
is too small for such a system to succeed. He pointed out that eight city 
districts may make sense in a city like Long Beach, which has a population of 
414,289, but not in Pasadena, with only 130,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Given Pasadena's typically low voter turnout, creating an eighth district -- 
and reducing the size of the original seven to do so -- could allow relatively 
small numbers of voters to influence election results. "A hundred people can 
decide who sits here," Holden said. "I'm not supportive of it, but it seems the 
majority may be." 
</P>
<P>
The previous proposal to reorganize city government came in January, 1988, 
after nearly three years of study by a city-appointed Charter Study Committee. 
The plan would have added an eighth member to the Board of Directors and an 
at-large elected mayor in order to avoid tie votes. Monthly salaries of $1,200 
for city directors and $2,400 for the mayor were also proposed, as well 
changing the Board of Directors' name to "Pasadena City Council." The idea was 
defeated by voters in June, 1988.

COUNCIL OKS WATER SAVINGS ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a water conservation 
ordinance that would reduce water consumption during a drought and change water 
rates to reward low-volume users and penalize high-volume users. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, the monthly bill for the typical residential customer's 
2,000 cubic feet of water would go up to $45.80, an increase of 72 cents. 
</P>
<P>
But customers who, for example, use 1,000 cubic feet would see their bills 
reduced by $2.10 to $24.50, Public Service Director W.E. Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
In times of drought, the council would be empowered to activate a five-step 
plan that would call for customers to reduce their water use by up to 25%. Any 
excess use would be penalized by a surcharge of twice the basic water rate. 
</P>
<P>
The council excluded treated water from the ordinance after Forest Lawn 
Memorial Park officials requested an exemption last week. Glendale is building 
a pipeline from its sewage treatment plant to the cemetery, which will purchase 
treated water.

ANOTHER SHORTFALL FORCES OXNARD TO CUT BUDGET AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oxnard City Council made more budget cuts this week after disclosing a 
shortfall of almost $350,000 in its estimate of revenue for the 1989-90 fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The official announcement of the revenue shortage came Tuesday in a midyear 
financial report that adjusts revenue according, in part, to receipts from the 
first six months of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what we do, we get all these shortfalls that keep coming in to us," 
Councilwoman Ann Johs said. "It's very discouraging." 
</P>
<P>
After re-evaluating estimates of other revenue, the Oxnard budget department 
calculated that the net effect is a $346,960 decrease in revenue expected 
during the current year, said Bill Mayer, management and budget director. 
</P>
<P>
After much discussion, the City Council cut $317,000, including $51,000 in 
travel and training funds for city employees. 
</P>
<P>
With those savings added to money saved from cutbacks in the fall, the city 
again balanced this year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
The budget decrease is primarily the result of a change in the revenue expected 
from a franchise tax the city receives from the Southern California Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
The gas company has advised the city that revenue is down from one of its major 
gas customers, Southern California Edison, because that company has begun 
buying gas from gas companies elsewhere to avoid paying the Oxnard franchise 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, city officials are trying to determine whether they can impose the 
tax on Southern California Edison anyway because the gas, while bought outside 
of city limits, is delivered to the electric company by way of lines in the 
city right of way. 
</P>
<P>
This week's shortfall comes just months after the City Council discovered that 
estimates of revenue for the 1988-89 fiscal year were $2 million too high.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OCCIDENTAL TO HOST COLD WAR CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cold War and recent political upheaval in Europe will be the focus of a 
two-day gathering of political commentators and students beginning Friday at 
Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Is the Cold War Over?: The International System into the Nineties," the 
first Occidental Public Affairs Conference will feature a series of workshops 
and panel discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the speakers will be Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colorado); William 
Maynes, editor of Foreign Policy magazine; Washington Post journalist Jay 
Matthews; Sergei Plekhanov, deputy director of the Institute of U.S. and 
Canadian Studies of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, Moscow; and Robert 
Kuttner, author of "The Economic Illusion" and a contributing editor of the New 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Funded by the Ford Foundation, the conference was conceived and organized by 
two senior public policy majors at the college. The planners hope it will 
become an annual event, spurring greater student involvement in current issues.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AGENCY SEEKS PROPOSALS TO REDEVELOP BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday initiated plans to develop another 
major office, retail and plaza complex in the high-rise business district on 
North Brand Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few days, the agency will send notices to owners of all property on 
the east side of the 400 block of North Brand Boulevard, inviting suggestions 
and proposals for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
All property owners within the block are eligible to participate, provided 
their proposals meet requirements adopted by the agency Tuesday, said Jeanne 
Armstrong, redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
A single project should be proposed for the entire block, bounded by Brand, 
Milford Street, Maryland Avenue and Lexington Drive. Use of the existing 
structures or construction of an entirely new complex will be considered. 
</P>
<P>
The block includes the main office of Valley National Bank, one of the first 
medium-rise structures built several decades ago to replace the original 
Midwest-style brick storefronts that then lined the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's design consultants have recommended that the development 
incorporate high-rise office towers at the corners of the block with retail 
stores, a public plaza and at least one major restaurant. A multilevel parking 
garage also would be included. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners have until the end of March to submit proposals.

<P>
OLYMPIC SWIMMING: THIRTY-PLUS SANDY NEILSON-BELL SEEKS ANOTHER OLYMPIC MEDAL, 
CASH PURSES FOR SWIMMERS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a joyous interlude in an otherwise tragic event. The Munich Olympics, 
forever remembered for the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes, also were the Games 
that brought swimmer Sandy Neilson's tears to millions of living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
After upsetting world record-holder Shane Gould of Australia in the 100-meter 
freestyle, Neilson, then a 16-year-old student at El Monte High, climbed to the 
top step of the medal platform and waited for Avery Brundage, president of the 
International Olympic Committee, to hang the gold medal around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
And as she waited, she cried. 
</P>
<P>
Half her lifetime later, Sandy Neilson-Bell is often reminded of that day. But 
now, the reminders are likely to be colored by a different kind of irony 
because Neilson-Bell has dedicated herself to erasing the last vestiges of the 
anachronistic amateurism the late Brundage had so long personified. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimmers have always had to choose between swimming and making a living," 
Neilson-Bell says. "I want to help pave the way for other athletes to make a 
living from swimming; to help swimmers catch up with other sports." 
</P>
<P>
It's an imposing task. When tennis players fought to turn professional, the 
battle divided the sport. When a maverick pack of distance runners challenged 
the amateur rules governing their sport, it took years of legal arguments to 
solve the issue. Toward their goal, Neilson-Bell and her husband have studied 
the processes by which such sports as track and field have permitted cash 
prizes. 
</P>
<P>
"Sandy would like to see swimmers coming right out of college and getting paid. 
And she's got a point," says Ingrid Daland, director of the Daland Swim Center 
in Thousand Oaks and a former West German national swim champion. "The top West 
Germans are getting 1,200-1,600 marks (about $715-$950) a month. Even swimmers 
at just the national level get free transportation to events, free sweats. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"Amateurism is out the door in Europe. Why should we have amateurism?" 
</P>
<P>
The fact that a new era of athletic perestroika has taken root in Europe, 
dragging even the Olympic movement itself into the 20th Century, has convinced 
Neilson-Bell it's only a matter of time before U.S. swimming is forced to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Time is another concept Neilson-Bell has decided to challenge. Rather than 
trying to champion the idea of diving for dollars from afar, she is testing the 
waters herself as part of a comeback she hopes will lead to a berth on the 1992 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
She'll be 36 then, and while thirtysomething might be a trendy age for 
television, for swimmers it conjures up images of rocking chairs and denture 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* The 1984 U. S. women's swimming team was the oldest ever -- with an average 
age of only 18 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* No U. S. swimmer older than 27 has ever won a gold medal, and that swimmer, 
Frances Schroth, got hers on a relay team in the 1920 Games, when the Olympics 
were little more than a dual meet between the United States and Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
* Before Neilson-Bell, no woman older than 30 had ever ranked among the top six 
in the world in any event. 
</P>
<P>
Neilson-Bell isn't the only old-timer working toward a berth on the Olympic 
team. Mark Spitz, 39, who set seven world records in Munich, made a splash when 
he announced his comeback plans last fall. 
</P>
<P>
But while Spitz's "grab" start once made him the quickest swimmer off the 
blocks, he hit the water second this time. 
</P>
<P>
"Sandy came first," protests her husband, Keith Bell, a sports psychologist. "I 
don't know whether Mark noticed it or not, but Sandy paved the way." 
</P>
<P>
It was Bell, a former Division III All-American swimmer at Kenyon (Ohio) 
College, who first convinced Neilson-Bell she wasn't washed up. The pair first 
met at a coaches' convention nearly eight years ago, where Bell had come to 
deliver a motivational talk. Later, they talked before a national Masters meet, 
where Bell brought up the idea of a serious comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"He encouraged me to get back into it again," remembers Neilson-Bell, who lives 
in Ventura. "He said, 'I think you should go for '88.' Actually, he said he 
thought I could win (the Olympic Trials)." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Bell was off by an Olympiad because if Neilson-Bell's comeback 
continues apace, she could enter the 1992 Trials as the favorite in the 
50-meter freestyle. In 1984, she just missed qualifying for the Trials and four 
years later, she was a Trials finalist, finishing seventh in 26.04. 
</P>
<P>
And although she missed the team to Seoul by .54 seconds, Neilson-Bell's time 
at the Trials was faster than some of the Olympic finalists'. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody in the world is as efficient in the water," Bell says. "She's got a 
perfect stroke." And while a perfect stroke might be bad news to some senior 
citizens, it's a priceless plus to a senior swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Experience, though, not form, could be Neilson-Bell's biggest asset. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally believe you have an advantage in that you are training smarter," 
Daland says of older competitors. "You don't make excuses. You just do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we know we aren't going downhill physically. At least not until age 
35. We're at our physical peak. There's no reason why we shouldn't be swimming 
at that age." 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe one reason. Money. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimming's always been a young person's sport," Bell says, "but I always 
thought that was for financial and sociological reasons. It's hard to support 
yourself and continue swimming when you get out of school." 
</P>
<P>
As evidence that age is not the ultimate factor, Neilson-Bell continues to 
improve on personal bests set 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
She shattered the Olympic 100-meter record of 58.59 -- and came within .09 
seconds of the world record -- in her Munich win before retiring at age 16. But 
since starting her comeback, she has lowered her 100 best to 57.3, and has 
clocked 26.0 in the 50 free, an event that made its Olympic debut in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so much stronger now than I did when I was 16," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons Neilson-Bell left competitive swimming in the first place were more 
mental than physical. Which is why her husband has been so important to her 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"After '72, I had trouble setting goals," she said. "So many people were 
saying, 'What can you possibly do after three gold medals?' It seemed like 
whatever I would do, I had to top that. And that was a lot of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating in the top 5% of her class at El Monte High, Neilson-Bell 
enrolled at UC Santa Barbara as a physical education major with plans to swim 
for enjoyment rather than medals. When the coach there pressured her to return 
to serious competition, she responded by taking up the least serious sport she 
could find -- inner-tube water polo. 
</P>
<P>
But she was never far from competitive shape. In 1977, she won national 
collegiate championships in the 50- and 100-yard freestyles. And in 1981, the 
first year she was eligible for Masters competition, she won three national 
age-group titles. Next came the meeting with Bell, which really set the 
comeback in motion. 
</P>
<P>
"I see my role with Sandy as convincing her how good she is," says Bell, 41, 
who has written six books and more than 75 articles for professional journals 
on sports psychology. "A lot of it is just keeping her head in the water." 
</P>
<P>
One way Bell does that is by making swimming seem like fun instead of work. 
</P>
<P>
"We never talk about 'working out,' " says Bell. "We talk about 'playing' 
swimming." 
</P>
<P>
The word "pain" is strictly prohibited around the pool, where workouts have 
been replaced by practice. Obstacles and roadblocks are referred to as 
"challenges," and one doesn't make sacrifices for sport, but "choices." 
</P>
<P>
"Swimmers train harder than any other athletes in the world," Bell says. "The 
training is so intense it tends to be viewed as the dues people have to pay; as 
a necessary evil. And it doesn't have to be that way." 
</P>
<P>
In one of their first training sessions together, Neilson-Bell took a look at 
the workout. . . er, practice Bell had planned for her and flinched. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I can do all that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of the pool," Bell snapped back. "The practice is over." 
</P>
<P>
"No, wait, I'll swim," she said. "I'll try it." 
</P>
<P>
"Then try it tomorrow when you can do it with a positive attitude."

WATER METER FOR EACH APARTMENT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to promote water conservation, the Santa Monica City Council 
approved an ordinance requiring all new apartment units to have individual 
water meters -- which will mean individual water bills. 
</P>
<P>
"The object of this measure is to create individual accountability," said Mayor 
Dennis Zane. 
</P>
<P>
The individual meters will add about $800 per unit to the cost of building an 
average apartment structure, officials estimate. Affordable-housing 
developments will be exempt from the ordinance.

SORTING OF CURBSIDE TRASH RECOMMENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beverly Hills residents would sort their trash for curbside collection under a 
recycling program recommended by a citizens' committee to the City Council at 
its regular meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also called for a program to recycle grass cuttings and other 
garden trash. 
</P>
<P>
The report was the first step toward drawing up a solid-waste management plan 
required under state law. 
</P>
<P>
The city is obligated to submit its plan and have it approved by the county no 
later than July, 1991.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

To Register Voters 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 289 to 132, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2190) 
requiring states to make it easier for citizens to register to vote in federal 
elections. The bill enables eligible individuals to automatically register as 
part of getting a driver's license, authorizes registration by mail and sets up 
sign-up desks at some government offices in communities. It takes effect in 
1993. It combats fraud by requiring states to regularly purge voter rolls of 
the names of those no longer eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Martin Frost (D-Tex.) complained that "turnout in our elections is at 
an embarrassingly low level." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent William L. (Bill) Dickinson (R-Ala.) said the bill usurps the right of 
states to regulate voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes favored the bill.

The Invasion of Panama

By a vote of 389 to 26, the House approved of the American invasion of Panama 
last December. The advisory measure (HCR 262) commended the U.S. military's

"President Bush and America's fighting men and women stayed the course" in

Double-Hull Tankers 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 376 to 37, the House restated its position that oil tankers and 
barges using U.S. ports have double hulls. The standard would apply immediately 
to new vessels and within 15 years to old ones, under terms of a pending bill 
(HR 1465) inspired by the Exxon Valdez oil spill last March in Alaska's Prince 
William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The House approved the double-hull requirement last year. The Senate included a 
softer requirement in its version of HR 1465. This vote instructed House 
conferees to insist on the tougher language when they negotiate final wording 
of the bill with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Dean A. Gallo (R-N.J.) said the Exxon Valdez spill "would not have 
occurred if the ship had been double hulled." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (D-La.) said that even if doubled hulled the 
tanker "would still have lost 200,000 gallons of oil in Prince William Sound." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes want double hulls for oil tankers.

POINT GUARD MAKES THEM 3 AT A TIME; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: PEPPERDINE'S RICK WELCH GOES ABOUT HIS WORK ON THE COURT IN 
HIS OWN QUIET, DEPENDABLE WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Welch, a sophomore reserve point guard on the Pepperdine basketball team, 
is not the type of person who would stand out at a party. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't wear loud clothes, blow noisemakers, cut in on other guys and their 
dates, or beguile party guests by telling one funny story after another. 
</P>
<P>
To say that Welch is unobtrusive is a little like saying that Winston Churchill 
was English. About the only thing obvious about Welch is his obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
He is only 6-feet tall, hard to find among his tall-timber teammates. He hasn't 
played much at Pepperdine and seldom scores in double figures. He doesn't gripe 
to the referee when he is called for a foul. He doesn't give his coaches any 
lip. 
</P>
<P>
He hardly does any of the things that get you noticed on a basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
But when Welch does get in a game, he's like a dependable driver for a pizza 
parlor. He delivers -- and in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
He's like a plumber you have managed to locate after calling countless others 
when your drain has backed up on a Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Welch comes in and gets the job done. 
</P>
<P>
As a redshirt freshman last year Welch averaged less than 10 minutes of playing 
time a game. Yet he was Pepperdine's most accurate shooter from three-point 
range, having averaged 56.8% (21 of 37). 
</P>
<P>
When mighty North Carolina came to Malibu last year and routed the Waves, all 
eyes were on the Tarheel players with national reputations: J. R. Reid, Jeff 
Lebo, Steve Bucknall. 
</P>
<P>
But Reid took his eyes off the ball once, and the Pepperdine guard stole it 
from the towering All-American, giving Welch what he says was his biggest 
thrill in college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988-89 season, he committed just 20 turnovers in 328 minutes on the 
court. This year he has not done quite as well, but he still has only 19 
turnovers in 294 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the Waves convincingly defeated highly favored Loyola Marymount, 
104-79, in Malibu, and the glory went to Dexter Howard, who scored 27 points 
and had 12 rebounds, and Tom Lewis, who had 25 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Welch went unnoticed in that resounding win over the Lions, but he made all 
four of his shots from the field, including two three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round of last year's West Coast Conference tournament, Welch made 
both ends of a one-and-one free throw opportunity, sealing his team's victory 
with 12 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
He has continued to be Johnny-on-the-spot this season, making three-point shots 
that halt the other team's momentum or whipping passes to open teammates for 
important baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago the University of San Francisco had closed to 81-76 after 
Pepperdine scorers hit a cold spell. Welch nailed a three-pointer, and the 
Waves went on to a 100-91 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Welch, a Westlake High School graduate who plays behind senior Shann Ferch, 
said he enjoys making three-point shots that take the heart out of the other 
team. He said he prefers trying for triples when his feet are set and he 
doesn't have a defender in his face. "I don't look to create shots when someone 
is on me. But if someone leaves me open, I'm glad to take the shot." 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury also is usually glad when Welch attempts a shot 
because they usually go in the basket. Welch's shots, whether for two or three 
points, are mostly from the outside. This year he is shooting nearly 53% from 
the field (18 of 34) and 47.8% (11 of 23) on three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
So if Welch is that good, why isn't he starting? For one reason, Ferch is a 
senior who has a lot more experience. For another, Ferch is also an excellent 
three-point shooter (45 of 100), whose streak shooting can stop another team 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming off the bench is always frustrating," said Welch. "I look at Ferch and 
myself, and he's a great shooter and scorer. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to shoot the open shot, but I tend to look for open players and run the 
offense more. You use different players at different times in ball games. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things I do well at times and things that Ferch does well at times. 
But lately my playing time has gone up." 
</P>
<P>
Welch hopes his playing time will go all the way up next year, that he will be 
the team's starting point guard. But he will get a lot of competition from 5-9 
freshman Damin Lopez. Lopez was supposed to back up Ferch this year but was 
redshirted early in the season after he injured a hand in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that Welch "is a solid, heady point guard. He is really the only 
true point guard we've got playing. Shann is more of a No. 2 guard." 
</P>
<P>
Welch's future is also at point guard, Asbury said, adding that his "choices 
(of playing another position, possibly off-guard) are limited by his size. 
We've got an awfully good (point guard in Lopez) waiting in the wings. If Rick 
can't hold him off, he'll back him up. 
</P>
<P>
"Both are going to battle for it starting Oct. 15," the coach said, adding that 
Welch may have gotten an edge on Lopez because Lopez hardly played this season. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, he said, neither player may have an advantage. "Players create 
their own edge. Coaches don't determine playing time, the players do. Rick may 
have an advantage because he has played a lot more, but Lopez has an advantage 
because he beat out Welch. I'd call it a wash, and we start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
Welch does know the main function of a point guard, Asbury said, and that is 
getting "the ball to the guys who can score. We've got enough guys who can 
score." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez will be tough competition for him, said Welch, but the competition will 
be good for the team no matter who is the starter. It gives the team depth at 
the position, he said. "When one guy is not performing you can rely on the next 
guy coming in and doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Being a point guard may be grunt work that doesn't earn headlines, but that's 
all right with Welch. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the leadership role as a point guard. I like trying to get the ball in 
the right man's hands at the right time. I try to set a spark, to (provide the 
team) some intensity on defense."

PEPPERDINE AND LOYOLA WILL SLUG IT OUT IN 3-GAME SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount baseball teams, preseason favorites in the 
West Coast Conference, will meet in a three-game series this weekend at George 
C. Page Stadium in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will play a single game at 2 p.m. Friday and a double header at 11 
a.m. Saturday . 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine is 4-4 overall and 2-1 in conference. The Lions are 6-4, 2-1. The 
Waves are ranked 23rd nationally by Baseball America and 29th by Collegiate 
Baseball. The Lions are ranked 13th by Baseball America and are unranked in the

play host to Cal State Los Angeles at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday at Eddy D. Field 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Andy Lopez is pleased with his team's .327 batting average but 
displeased with his relief pitching. "We have lost a few late-inning leads 
because we cannot find someone to take charge on the mound," he said. "Right 
now I am searching for a pitcher who can be a stopper for us." 
</P>
<P>
Top hitters for the Waves are Mike Truschke, batting .458; freshman Dan 
Melendez at .444, freshman Steve Rodriguez at .379 and Chris Martin at .364 
with a team-high 13 runs batted in.

Friday and Arizona at 1 p.m. Saturday at the Los Angeles Tennis Center on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins will play at Pepperdine at 1:30 p.m. Monday . 
</P>
<P>
At last week's ITCA championships, the Bruin doubles team of Bill Barber and 
Mark Quinney were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Luis Ruette and Sandon 
Stolle of Texas Christian, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
The No. 16 Pepperdine men's tennis team (3-1 as the week began) will play host 
to Rice at 1:30 p.m. Saturday and to No. 3 UCLA at 1:30 p.m. Monday .

</P>
<P>

night at Brigham Young (2-3, 0-2) and entertain No. 9 Pepperdine (5-1, 3-1) at 
7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Bruins won the championship of the George Mason University 
tournament, defeating the host school in the finals in four games. In the first 
round, UCLA posted a four-game victory over Ball State. 
</P>
<P>
Against Ball State, middle blockers Mike Whitcomb and Trevor Schirman combined 
for 33 kills and 11 blocks. In the George Mason match, Whitcomb had 20 kills 
without an error, and Schirman had a season-high 15 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Schirman was named the tournament's most valuable player, and Whitcomb and UCLA 
freshman Rich Bland were selected on the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 9 Pepperdine men's volleyball team (5-1 overall, 3-1 in the WIVA as the 
week began) will play at No. 6 San Diego State (6-5, 0-3) at 7:30 p.m. Friday 
and at No. 1 UCLA (9-0, 4-0) at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>

EXOTICS HITTING HOOKS IN BUNCHES AT SAN CLEMENTE

<TEXT>
<P>
San Clemente Island is providing anglers with the wildest exotics bite of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Substantial numbers of yellowtail were found this past weekend by two L.A. 
Harbor Sportfishing boats, the Outerlimits and the Shogun. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gary Norby, captain of the Outerlimits, "these yellows have been 
here all winter on every trip. We have observed them while fishing for bass and 
rock cod. Now the fish are feeding and with perfect water conditions and a good 
supply of squid we can catch them on a day-to-day basis." 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one were caught over the weekend and another 14 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Freckles Upan of Carson was the top fisherman, catching six. Connie Conklin of 
Long Beach hooked several and lost them. But not giving in to the fighting 
fish, she hooked two more and landed the jackpot with a 21-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
A drastic change was noted inside L.A. Harbor at the Annie B barge. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing at night Friday and Saturday, 48 anglers were witness to tons of 
anchovies coming up to the barge's lights, followed by schools of Spanish jack. 
</P>
<P>
Barge master Paul Berube called the jacks' appearance unusual. "This is the 
first time we have had these fish invade the barge, either day or night." 
</P>
<P>
Anglers were hooking up with these fighters and bouncing three-to-six-pounders 
onto the deck. 
</P>
<P>
Berube said it's possible these fish moved into the harbor after the oil spill 
off Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Stassi Vellonakis of Redondo Beach returned from an 18-day, long-range trip 
fishing Alijos Rocks in Mexico and caught a 213-pound yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hori of Manhattan Beach returned from a recent trip to Cabo San Lucas, 
where the King Harbor Marlin Club member, using six-pound test line, landed a 
25-pound dorado after a 30-minute fight. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Felipe Burton of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Happyman 
at Venice Beach, caught the whopper of the week, a 32-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Herrera of Hawthorne, fishing aboard the Amigo, won the jackpot with a 
23-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Moe Cohen of Westchester, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at Rocky Point, used 
live squid and caught a 22 1/2-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Fuginami of Gardena, fishing aboard the Shogun at San Clemente Island, 
won the jackpot with a 20-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Tex Lucas of Wilmington, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Southern Cal, 
won the jackpot with a 17-pound cow cod.

PADRES' SANTIAGO GETS HIS MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Padre catcher Benito Santiago, who always told himself while growing up that 
one day he'd escape the poverty of Jauca, Puerto Rico, fulfilled his wildest 
fantasy Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He became a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago was awarded a one-year contract for $1.25 million Wednesday by 
arbitrator Tom Roberts, the largest arbitration award in Padre history. 
Santiago, who earned a base salary of $310,000 and $35,000 in incentives in 
1989, had been offered $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, one day, I dreamed of this day," Santiago said. "It's a very special 
day in my life. It means I've come a long way. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, a long way." 
</P>
<P>
This is guy who was handed away by his mother at the age of 3 months, worked in 
the fields picking tomatoes and watermelons as a youngster, struggled every day 
just to survive the streets and signed with the Padres after just two years of 
high school at the age of 17. 
</P>
<P>
Now, just a month shy of his 25th birthday, Santiago is incredulous that the 
game of baseball has provided him with wealth that he never knew existed. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the money was not so much the big issue with Benny," agent Scott 
Boras said, "as was the ability to demonstrate to a veteran arbitrator that you 
are the best at your position. 
</P>
<P>
"Benny found out he's not only one of the best in his position, but among the 
best in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Boras demonstrated Santiago's value Tuesday in a four-hour hearing in front of 
Roberts. He pointed out that Santiago and Hall of Famer Johnny Bench were the 
only catchers in the past 25 years to win two Gold Gloves in their first three 
years of service. He talked about how Santiago, Don Mattingly and Kirby Puckett 
are the only players in he past 10 years to win two Silver Slugger awards and 
two Gold Gloves. And just for special effect, he showed a videotape of Santiago 
throwing out Vince Coleman and Tim Raines. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who were represented by Minneapolis attorney Clark Griffith, argued 
that Santiago's career is in decline and that perhaps his rookie season, in 
which he hit .300 with 18 homers and 79 RBIs in 1987, was a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
Boras admitted that Santiago, who batted .236 this past season, is not about to 
challenge Padre teammate Tony Gwynn for the batting title, but no catcher could 
top Santiago's 16 homers, 62 RBIs and 50 runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
It took Roberts 24 hours to make his decision, and at about 2:45 p.m. 
Wednesday, Santiago became the first player since Andy Hawkins in 1987 to 
defeat the Padres in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago also becomes the eighth Padre player who'll earn an average salary of 
at least $1 million this season, joining the growing list of players who'll 
exceed four-time batting champion Tony Gwynn's $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"As good as I feel now," Santiago said, "I know I'm still young, and I'll have 
better years. 
</P>
<P>
"How do they say, oh yeah, you ain't seen nothin' yet. 
</P>
<P>
"You just watch and see."

ILL WINDS BLOW AT TORREY PINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Winter, or at least what passes for one in this usually temperate zone, has 
arrived just in time for today's start of the $900,000 Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
And one trip around Torrey Pines Golf Course during Wednesday's pro-am showed 
that, despite sunny skies, the change in weather could mean trouble for the 156 
golfers who usually turn this annual tournament into one of the easiest scoring 
stops on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
As blustery winds -- close to 35 m.p.h. with a temperature that barely got over 
50 -- blew off the Pacific Ocean, spectators huddled in small groups, trying to 
fend off the gusts. The golfers dressed in layers: long johns, bulky sweaters 
and rain suits. A few donned wooly pullover caps more suited to the slopes than 
the links. 
</P>
<P>
This was the kind of a day that helped put the eastward lean into the 
indigenous torrey pines that dot the seaside course. 
</P>
<P>
"Something hot feels good," said Payne Stewart as he entered the interview 
room, spooning into a bowl of soup. "It's a bit brisk out there." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't so biting that Stewart abandoned his trademark knickers but windy 
enough that it could influence the way the tournament will be played. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind is affecting the tee shots," Fred Couples said. "I was hitting a lot 
more one-irons and three-woods to the green. If it stays windy like this and 
the greens dry up, it is going to be very tough." 
</P>
<P>
That would be a major departure. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's winner, Greg Twiggs, shot a four-round total of 271, 17 under par, 
as the first 38 finishers were within eight strokes of each other. Couples said 
he is not expecting that kind of scoring if the weather continues as it has. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that someone isn't going to shoot a 64 or 65," said Couples, 
who finished in a four-way tie for 12th last year at 276. "But he will have a 
big lead instead of being one shot ahead like usual here." 
</P>
<P>
The field also might have something to do with that. It is not the strongest 
that has contested the tournament in its 23 years at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the 10 leading money winners from the 1989 PGA Tour -- No. 2 
Stewart and No. 6 Tim Simpson -- are entered. And arguably its biggest draw, 
two-time champion Tom Watson, withdrew late last week for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
But in this golfing era of spreading the wealth, there are plenty of other 
winners to go around. Twenty five champions of tour events in 1989 and 1990 are 
entered, including Twiggs and three -- rookie Robert Gamez (Tucson), Tommy 
Armour III (Phoenix) and Mark O'Meara of Escondido (Pebble Beach) -- from the 
first six tour events this year. 
</P>
<P>
Twiggs, the former San Diego State player, is the most recent of a group of 10 
returning former champions at Torrey Pines, including the past seven winners. 
Twiggs' victory was his first on the tour and worth $126,000, more than he had 
made in his first four years on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
And if a recent trend holds, chances are reasonable for another first-time 
winner. Three of the first six tour events this year were won by first-timers 
-- Gamez, Armour and David Ishii Sunday at the Hawaiian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most stops on the tour, the field is split over two courses for the 
first two days as the players alternate rounds between the North and South 
courses. The final two days are played exclusively on the South. 
</P>
<P>
One of the keys to the title has been a low score on the North Course. Both 
courses are par 72, but the North at 6,659 yards is 362 yards shorter than the 
South. Couples said, however, that the weather also could play havoc with that 
traditional strategy, although winds are expected to diminish somewhat today. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually you have to shoot a 68 on the North Course or you lose ground, but it 
won't be that way this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another key for players is to not let the general condition of the course 
disturb their often-fragile psyches. Having grown finicky from a steady stream 
of tournaments played mostly on exclusive country-club courses, the pros wince 
a bit when it comes time to play Torrey Pines, one of two municipal courses on 
the 44-stop PGA Tour (the other is En-Joie Golf Course in Endicott, N.Y., site 
of the B.C. Open). 
</P>
<P>
The greens are not as smooth, the rough not as lush and the fairways not as 
well groomed as most tour courses. It's one of those things the pros like to 
talk about when they come to Torrey Pines, and maybe one of the reasons several 
of the bigger names skip it each year. 
</P>
<P>
Even given that, some players are finding conditions better than what they have 
been used to here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not country-club plush," Couples said. "You miss the fairway, and you'll 
get some nasty lies. But there is a lot of grass on the greens, and that is 
what the players like." 
</P>
<P>
Tournament Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mark O'Meara withdrew from the pro-am because of a stiff neck, one of his 
partners said. But tournament officials said Wednesday night that O'Meara 
remained in the field for today's start and that no changes have been reported 
in the field since Monday. . . . The pro-am events were won by the teams of 
Mark Wiebe with a 53 on the North Course and Mark Lye with a 55 on the South 
Course. Lye's team included San Diego residents Richard Keyser and Charlie 
Lyon. Gary Koch had the low score on the North Course with a 66. David Ogrin 
and Buddy Gardner shared low on the South with 69s.

SOCKERS AGAIN IN DOUBLE TROUBLE, LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It started out like a bad television sitcom, with enough laughable play, 
pitiful passing and missed coverage to offend even the heartiest soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
It evolved into a rerun, yet another chapter in the MISL history between the 
Sockers and the Baltimore Blast, who have three times met to decide the MISL 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
But before it ended, Wednesday night's game had dragged on into a mini-series, 
an unwelcome turn of events for the Sockers. Little-used Glenn Carbonara beat 
Sockers goalkeeper Victor Nogueira to the short side with a 35-foot shot from 
the right wing to give the Blast (21-11) a 7-6 victory 7:06 into the second 
sudden-death overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The game lasted 82:06, making it the third longest game in Socker history. Only 
three days before, they had lost another double-overtime game, 5-4, in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Their fourth loss in a row dropped the Sockers (13-18) into fourth place in the 
Western Division. They trail the Tacoma Stars (14-19), 6-2 winners in St. Louis 
Wednesday, by percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go on the road, you don't look for those things (double-overtime 
games) to happen, much less two times in a row," said Ron Newman, the Sockers' 
coach. "I don't think our lads could have played any better. In the end, it was 
a lack of stamina; we're just not that fit yet." 
</P>
<P>
True, the Sockers played well. They outshot the Blast, 51-35, and Nogueira made 
a handful of incredible saves among his 19. The looked to be anything but a 
last-place team. 
</P>
<P>
But their own ineptitude -- or was it bad luck -- eventually did them in. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Blast's goals caromed in off defender Kevin Crow, something Newman 
said he had never before seen. Four others came when Sockers defenders missed 
their marking assignments in or around the penalty area. It was enough to turn 
Nogueira's stomach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so frustrating, but that's the way they always seem to score on us," he 
said. "Balls bounce off the boards or someone, and their players get goals." 
</P>
<P>
But the game-winner was not among the evening's flukes. Carbonara merely wound 
up and let it fly after accepting a cross-field feed from Mike Stankovic. 
</P>
<P>
It was Carbonara's second goal of the season, the third of his two-year MISL 
career. Both goals this year have been game-winners, and both have come in the 
past five days. 
</P>
<P>
Nogueira said he was not screened but that a Blast player bumped him, impeding 
his ability to pick up the shot until it was too late. He stretched out his 
right arm, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone bumped into me on my right," Nogueira said. "He set a pick. I didn't 
see the shot. I only saw the ball at the last second." 
</P>
<P>
Said Carbonara: "At that point in the game, we just wanted it to be over. You 
just hope someone scores to win the game, and you hope it's your team." 
</P>
<P>
Carbonara was left open because the Sockers fell for a ploy by Blast Coach 
Kenny Cooper, designed after regulation to force Socker defenders to 
double-team a Baltimore forward. 
</P>
<P>
In the first overtime, Cooper moved Stankovic up front with Carl Valentine and 
Peter Ward, with Carbonara taking Stankovic's place on the red line. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured they'd have to double-team somebody," Cooper said, "either Stankovic 
or Valentine or Ward. It's such a tactical game at that point. You're looking 
for different matchups." 
</P>
<P>
Zoran Karic, object of some rough treatment from Blast defenders, forced 
overtime with his second goal with 3:25 left in regulation. The Sockers were on 
a power play and had Brian Quinn on as a sixth attacker, giving them a two-man 
advantage. Blast defender Bruce Savage was out for dumping Karic in the 
midfield.

CARDINALS' ZEILE MAKES MAJOR ADJUSTMENT IN LIFE STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poised now on the verge of what many predict will be a long and remarkable 
major league career, Todd Zeile has spent the winter making the mental 
transition from the dirty and dusty minors to the shiny and dazzling big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Even his vocabulary has undergone massive change. Gone are words such as 
"cockroach" and statements like, "Gawd, I think those socks have a pulse!" 
</P>
<P>
Replacing them are words such as "arbitration" and statements like, "The 
players' union simply wants to preserve the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
Zeile, 24, of Valencia, was a standout catcher at Hart High and UCLA before 
signing with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1986. In 3 1/2 minor league seasons he 
excelled at every level. Last August he got The Call, leaving the Cardinals' 
triple-A affiliate in Louisville in August to join the major league club. 
</P>
<P>
In the off-season, the Cardinals allowed five-time All-Star Tony Pena to leave 
as a free agent, clearing the way for Zeile to establish full-time residency 
behind the plate in Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
And as he looks back on his rapid-but-not-uneventful sprint through the minors, 
Zeile realizes that it wasn't all bad. He had heard all the horror stories and 
had steeled himself for horrible sights. 
</P>
<P>
And there are worse things in life, he knows, than spending a weekend wearing 
uncomfortable clothes and equipment that makes you itch in strange places while 
standing under a frying sun in El Paso, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Riding 18 hours on a smelly bus to get to El Paso, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"That was maybe the one trip I'll always remember," Zeile said. "From Little 
Rock (Ark.) to El Paso. We left after a night game, rode all that night and all 
the next day. That was pretty horrible." 
</P>
<P>
Zeile was drafted by the Cardinals in the third round in June, 1986, after two 
seasons at UCLA. He was an instant success in pro ball, earning co-MVP honors 
in the Class-A Midwest League for Springfield, Ill., in 1987. He led the league 
with 106 runs batted in and was second with 25 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
And he also met The Voodoo Man. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a kid from Bermuda named Kenny Jackson, playing for Appleton (Wis.), 
and everyone said he knew voodoo and black magic," Zeile said. "Every time he 
came to bat he would stand there for a minute, roll his eyes back in his head, 
stick out his tongue and go into a little trance." 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, according to Zeile, other players thought this guy was weird. They 
made fun of him and played practical jokes on him. Two of his teammates, both 
pitchers, put a bloody chicken in his locker one night, and Jackson responded 
by chanting at them and saying he had put a curse on them. 
</P>
<P>
And the two pitchers began to lose . . . and lose. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither of them won a game for weeks," Zeile said. "Every time we'd go to 
Appleton we'd get the update, and they were both losing every time out. Then 
one of them went on the disabled list with arm trouble and was released. The 
other guy began begging Jackson to take the curse off of him. He offered to pay 
him. He was desperate. Finally, Kenny Jackson took the curse off of him. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the story was exaggerated. Maybe not. But all I know is that from then 
on, whenever Kenny Jackson came up to bat when I was catching, I was real nice 
to him. Sort of, 'Good evening, Mr. Jackson. Would you like fastballs or 
curveballs tonight?' " 
</P>
<P>
The next season Zeile moved to the Cardinals' double-A team in Arkansas of the 
Texas League. After a slow start because of a thumb that he had broken the 
previous winter while playing in the Dominican Republic, Zeile came on strongly 
and finished with 75 RBIs, despite the often-grueling bus rides across the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
Early in that season, while he struggled at the plate and behind it, he began 
for the first time to wonder if he was headed for a lifetime in the minor 
leagues, if he was to be just another of the thousands of young men whose 
dreams of playing in the major leagues had died a slow death on the back roads 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when I doubted I'd ever make it," he said. "One night we 
stayed in some small town somewhere and the motel was right next to a prison. 
It was a very bad town and a very bad part of that town. And we had lost a game 
and I remember being in bed that night thinking just how far away I was from 
the major leagues." 
</P>
<P>
He married former Olympic gymnast Julianne McNamara of Encino that winter and 
was invited to the Cardinals' spring training camp in St. Petersburg, Fla., in 
1989. He was, as expected, sent back to the minor leagues, but with a boost: He 
would play for the triple-A club in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Zeile excelled. He tore up the American Assn. with 85 RBIs in 118 
games, second highest in the league and fourth best among all triple-A players. 
He also had 19 homers and batted .289. 
</P>
<P>
And then, at a team picnic on Aug. 16, he got the news: His life in the minor 
leagues likely was over. 
</P>
<P>
In 28 games with the Cardinals at the end of the season Zeile batted .256 with 
one homer and eight RBIs. He proved he could hit major league pitching. More 
importantly, he proved he already was one of the best catchers in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
A national magazine has picked Zeile as the top candidate for the 1990 Rookie 
of the Year award. And he has roamed the Midwest with teammates this winter on 
the Cardinal Caravan, a frenzied good-will tour of small towns that enables 
fans who live far from a major league city to meet some players. 
</P>
<P>
The towns were of the same type that Zeile remembered so well from his minor 
league days. But the transportation and accommodations were decidedly not. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a first-class tour," he said. "We visited places like Bloomington, 
Iowa and Peru (Ill.) and Oklahoma City and some real small towns in Texas." 
</P>
<P>
And, often, there were the baseball card shows and autograph sessions, which 
now cost a fan bundles of American currency. 
</P>
<P>
That, Zeile said, has been perhaps the most bizarre part of his rapid 
transformation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a strange, strange feeling," he said. "All these people lined up, 
sometimes 300 and 400 of them, to get my autograph. I always hoped to play in 
the major leagues and hoped people would someday know who I was, but I never 
envisioned this." 
</P>
<P>
The tours left Zeile exhausted. He and his wife, who now live in Palm Desert, 
made many trips back to the Valley area during the winter to see friends and 
family. 
</P>
<P>
And, with an owners' lockout of spring training appearing more likely, Zeile 
also was looking for a place to work out. 
</P>
<P>
He found one that sent waves of emotion sweeping over him: Hart High in 
Newhall, the place where his baseball life began to mature. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways it seemed like it was just yesterday that I was playing there," 
he said. "And in other ways it seemed like a million years ago. I walked around 
the school and the students seemed like such little kids. They all seemed so 
young. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought a lot about all that has happened to me since then. Mostly, it felt 
like I've been gone from there forever."

Kennedy High scored early and then controlled the ball for the rest of the 
match Wednesday, defeating visiting Manual Arts, 1-0, in a first-round City 
Section contest. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Sandoval gave the Golden Cougars the only goal they would need, heading in 
a corner kick from Brian Singer less than five minutes into the match. 
</P>
<P>
The Toilers' quickness gave Kennedy trouble at times but the Golden Cougars 
managed to stay in control, outshooting Manual Arts, 19-6. 
</P>
<P>
Blustery winds hampered play but Kennedy proved more adept at passing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering the wind, I thought we played really well," Kennedy Coach Fred 
Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts' scoring opportunities were limited and the Kennedy defense stopped 
any serious threats. 
</P>
<P>
Defender Ruben Rios came up with a big play late in the first half, clearing 
out a Manual Arts shot after goalkeeper Salvador Aragon had left the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Aragon had replaced starting goalkeeper Chris Hines, who is sidelined because 
of a collapsed lung. DANNY SCHUMACHER

CHRISTIAN CELEBRATES CLARK MARK; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOLS: THE NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE FUZZY, BUT IF BILL WALTON'S SEASON 
SCORING RECORD ISN'T OFFICIALLY GONE YET, IT ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL BE FRIDAY.

With 10 seconds remaining in the Christian High boys' basketball game at 
Coronado Wednesday night, Christian's Tony Clark was taken out of the game, 
given a standing ovation and congratulated for breaking Bill Walton's 
20-year-old section season scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
Clark had made two free throws with 24 seconds left to bring his game total to 
36 points, which by most accounts had taken him past Walton's 960 for a season. 
</P>
<P>
Following Christian's 66-50 victory, which tied Coronado for first place (at 
5-2) in the Harbor League with a game to play, the celebration of Clark's 
accomplishment continued. 
</P>
<P>
Kids were asking him to sign their tennis shoes, pictures were being taken, and 
people were chanting "Tony, Tony." 
</P>
<P>
There's a slight catch, but one Clark should take care of easily in his final 
regular-season game against Clairemont Friday. In the statistics kept by 
Christian, Clark had 925 entering the game, needing 36 to break Walton's 
record. Statistics kept by The Times had him needing just 35 to break. But one 
other statistical source had him needing 37, saying that Christian had wrongly 
credited him with a basket not included in the home scorebook for a game at 
Santana way back on Dec. 13; the home book is official for record purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever. Christian (12-10 overall) decided to celebrate Clark's accomplishment 
Wednesday, and the first few minutes of Friday's game will almost certainly 
eliminate any doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who is averaging 44.1 points a game, had only scored 22 points in the 
first three quarters but added 14 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"Coronado had to give up something," Christian Coach Randy Wright said. "When 
the score got spread out eight to 10 points, they had to play more straight up. 
When people play straight up, the worst he's done is 49 points." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado used a box-and-one defense, but when Adam Smith collected his fourth 
foul in the third quarter, Clark was able to take avantage of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids did a good job on defense but then kept thowing the ball away," 
Coronado Coach Bob Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said his main concern was winning the game, not Walton's record. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had any idea how many points I had," Clark said. "If I did it, I did 
it. It didn't make any difference. I was more interested in the 'W' " 
</P>
<P>
Christian took a 20-14 lead after a quarter and never trailed. Coronado fell to 
15-8, 5-2 in the league.

LABOR: MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYERS ASSN. DOESN'T HAVE MUCH IN COMMON WITH OTHER 
UNIONS, AND SALARIES ARE THE MOST OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, the average American labor union negotiated a contract that gave its 
members a 4% annual raise. 
</P>
<P>
This winter, nine baseball players signed multiyear contracts paying annual 
salaries of $3 million or better. One of them, Will Clark, now makes roughly 
170 times the median salary of a full-time American worker. 
</P>
<P>
That's merely the most obvious difference between the Major League Baseball 
Players Assn. and the rest of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's often-amended labor framework -- which the owners are now trying to 
change again with their threat of a spring training lockout -- is a world apart 
from traditionalAmerican industrial relations. 
</P>
<P>
Money is not the only reason that an $8-an-hour member of the United Food and 
Commercial Workers or the Service Employes International Union may feel less 
than complete solidarity with a fellow unionist such as pitcher Pascual Perez, 
who recently signed a $5.7-million, three-year contract with the New York 
Yankees after a 9-13 season with the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
The very issues that consume most unions are different. Health benefits, not 
wages, is the most volatile subject in American labor. The number of strikes 
over management cutbacks in health benefits has tripled in the last three 
years, while unions have grudgingly grown used to pay increases that fall a bit 
below the pace of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"As a good union man, I should say we feel a lot of kinship, but personally I 
don't," says George Blunt, a teamster from Whittier who hasn't worked in five 
months after going on strike at a Los Angeles food warehouse. "For a guy making 
$2 million a year, a little medical bill isn't the problem it is to the average 
working man." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the prime responsibility of a union is to negotiate a master pay 
scale. In baseball, as well as the entire sports-entertainment segment of 
labor, the union negotiates only the minimum wage -- $68,000 a year in major 
league baseball. Above that floor, the player is worth whatever he and his 
agent can get from the club's owner. 
</P>
<P>
The logic behind this difference is that, unlike the typical worker, the 
athlete is not just an employee. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the product that's being sold," said Dick Moss, a baseball players' agent 
who was formerly general counsel to the players' union as well as associate 
general counsel to the United Steelworkers of America in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The determination of these salaries is another example of the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Salaries for most unionized workers are "uniform by job categories because, for 
the most part, the job skills the workers in these jobs have are on par with 
one another," said Lionel Sobel, a Loyola Law School professor who wrote a book 
about sports law. "The variations are hard for an employer to determine." 
</P>
<P>
As anyone who's ever participated in a rotisserie league can testify, employee 
variables in baseball are rampant, if not mind-boggling. They make job 
categories impossible, but they also make performance analysis much easier than 
trying to rate the work of, say, two dozen nurses. 
</P>
<P>
The increased use of computers in the workplace now allows employers to more 
easily quantify worker performance, from the number of calls an operator 
handles each hour to the number of minutes a warehouseman needs to fill a 
certain stock stock order. But unions, fearing that this data will be used 
punitively, have generally resisted basing wages on such individual 
measurements. 
</P>
<P>
And what of the notion of seniority, so prized in the union shop, where 
gradations in pay are based on the belief that the longer you've been around, 
the more valuable you are? At Boeing, for example, machinists move up through 
121 labor grades and steps, ranging from $8.88 an hour to $18.42. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball stands such an idea on its head. Ask any 37-year-old utility infielder 
who took a pay cut after hitting .193. Or ask Steve Garvey, who at 38 wasn't 
offered a contract by the San Diego Padres after he had hit .211 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The workaday world certainly has its share of that kind of coldness. Unions 
complain increasingly that employers are pressuring workers in their 40s and 
50s into retirement to save medical and other fringe-benefit costs, and turning 
increasingly to younger or part-time workers. But sports -- particularly 
baseball, with its wealth of statistics -- makes such judgments even less 
forgivingly. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Mitchell, director of UCLA's Institute of Industrial Relations, said 
that even the fundamental question of market value changes when ballplayers and 
workers are compared. 
</P>
<P>
"In routine collective bargaining, individuals are trying to get more than they 
would be worth (individually) in a free market," using the union's traditional 
implicit threat of a strike as leverage, Mitchell said. "In sports, players are 
trying to get what they're worth in the free market." 
</P>
<P>
Historically, baseball players have been regarded as a breed apart from other 
workers because their bosses -- the team owners -- were exempt from antitrust 
laws. This occurred because of what sports-law expert Sobel calls an accident 
of history. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled in the 1920s that baseball was exempt because it did 
not meet the definition of interstate commerce -- a definition that in 
subsequent decades has been substantially widened to include not merely 
manufactured goods but services as well. businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But the control owners enjoyed over players -- restricting them to a certain 
team, robbing them of all bargaining rights -- began to evaporate in the 1970s 
with court rulings that created salary arbitration and free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Those changes have made the antitrust exemption largely irrelevant, according 
to Sobel and Jack Getman, another sports-law authority who teaches at the 
University of Texas law school. The current battle between the players and the 
owners, as well as the future ones, will be played out under the same federal 
labor laws that govern the rest of America's unions.

CLOSE TO NEW AGREEMENT AS SPRING TRAINING LOCKOUT LOOMS.

The players union dismissed Commissioner Fay Vincent's proposal at the stalled 
baseball talks as a step backward Wednesday, ruining hopes of a breakthrough on 
the eve of a spring training lockout by owners. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not progress," said Phil Bradley, one of the players attending a strategy 
session at the union office. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, camps will not open as scheduled today, when pitchers, catchers and 
injured players were to start reporting in Florida and Arizona. Negotiations 
resume this morning in New York, but the two sides say they aren't close to a 
new collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Union chief Donald Fehr spoke negatively of Vincent's proposal, which had 
raised hopes the day before. Fehr, who did not reject the plan outright, said 
it had three components: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A system of minimum salaries for players with less than three years in the 
majors and a 75% cap on increases in salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A two-year study committee on revenue sharing and a provision that the 
four-year labor agreement could be reopened by management after two years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No increase in the benefit plan covering health care costs and player 
pensions. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent presented his plan during meetings Monday and Tuesday as a replacement 
for the owners' revenue sharing and pay-for-performance proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a change of approach, but not something we would seriously consider," 
Paul Molitor of Milwaukee said. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr, using the phrase of union lawyer Gene Orza, said Vincent's proposal was 
progress only because "we're now talking in the same ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Under Vincent's plan, players with less than one year in the majors would have 
a $75,000 minimum salary, players with less than two years a $125,000 minimum, 
and players with less than three years a $200,000 minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said he believed the minimums would become club-imposed standards. If that 
were true, three-plus players would have a $350,000 limit, four-plus players a 
$612,500 limit and five-plus players a top of $1,071,875. 
</P>
<P>
"We have fought the battle on salary caps before," said Fehr, who called the 
new proposal a request for givebacks. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980 and 1985, owners proposed 100% caps on raises for players in salary 
arbitration and each time withdrew the proposal after stiff opposition from the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the average increase for players who filed for arbitration was 70%. 
Some players receive increases way above the average. San Diego catcher Benito 
Santiago got a 262% increase Wednesday and Angel pitcher Bob McClure last month 
settled his case with a 313% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said that he preferred not to talk about his plan other than at the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me I am better off talking at the table," he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Orza attacked the proposal as "regressive." Orza said he interpreted it as 
management saying, "We're making more so we will give you less." 
</P>
<P>
Management negotiator Chuck O'Connor, speaking later at baseball's executive 
offices, declined to get into the specifics of the proposal. But he said the 
option to terminate after two years was meant to protect teams from an economic 
downturn in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"(It) is an attempt to insulate the clubs from problems that will come to pass 
before four years," O'Connor said. "In other words, to give them an out." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, who had a conference call Wednesday with the six owners on the Player 
Relations Committee, said that while the revenue-sharing proposal was being put 
aside for now, owners still saw it as the future of baseball's labor-management 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to very much get into that mode," he said.

Julius (Slick) Johnson, 41, critically injured in a crash Sunday at Daytona 
International Speedway, died Wednesday night at Halifax Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital spokesman said Johnson, of Florence, S.C., was declared brain dead 
at 6:50 p.m. PST. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson suffered a broken skull and chest injuries in the multi-car crash late 
in the Daytona ARCA 200 stock car race, an annual event sanctioned by the 
Automobile Racing Club of America. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had been on a respirator since Sunday night and was being given 
medication to maintain his blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's death is the 23rd fatality resulting from accidents at Daytona 
International Speedway, including Dale Robertson, a go-kart driver killed in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was the first stock-car driver to die from injuries sustained on the 
2.5-mile oval since Joe Young was killed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The list of fatalities includes 12 stock car drivers, two championship car 
drivers, a powerboat driver -- on the infield's Lake Lloyd -- a test car 
driver, one sports car driver, three motorcycle riders, two go-kart drivers and 
one spectator. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Staley, a track safety worker injured in the Johnson accident, was 
reported in serious but stable condition with a broken and burned left forearm 
and a broken left leg.

AFTER POOR SEASON, UCLA RECRUITING HITS HOMER IN TEXAS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: RETURN OF SMITH HELPS BRUINS SIGN SEVEN PLAYERS FROM LONE 
STAR STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With many high school football seniors honoring earlier oral commitments, there 
were not many surprises Wednesday, the first day for signing letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its worst season in 18 years, UCLA brought in a blue-chip recruiting 
class headed by seven prep players from Texas and a pair of outstanding local 
linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who benefited from the return of Homer Smith as offensive 
coordinator, saw their efforts in the Lone Star State pay off. They signed 
three prep All-Americans, defensive back Othello Henderson and tailback Daron 
Washington of Killeen Ellison, and defensive lineman Paul Kennedy of Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Other UCLA recruits from Texas are defensive back Carl Greenwood of Corpus 
Christi, tight end Bobby Gray of Arlington, fullback Shane Jasper of Troup and 
linebacker Brian Tighe of Pflugerville. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins also landed linebackers Bruce Walker of Compton Dominguez and Nkosi 
Littleton of Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that this group has the potential to be a fine class two or three 
years down the road," said UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, whose team finished 3-7-1 
last season in only his second losing season. 
</P>
<P>
Other Bruin signees included linebackers Randy Cole of Santa Monica College, 
Rod Smalley of Santa Ynez, London Woodfin of Sylmar, and Andrew McClave of 
Portland, Ore.; linemen Ryan Motherway of Santa Ana Mater Dei, Sale Isia of 
Oceanside, and Eric Banducci of Santa Monica; receivers Mike Nguyen of 
Portland, Ore., Kevin Jordan of Beltsville, Md., Bryan Adams of Bakersfield, 
and J. J. Stokes of San Diego Pt. Loma; tight end Jason Green of La Puente 
Bishop Amat; defensive back Marvin Goodwin of Camden, N.J., and Chris Alexander 
of Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
USC TROJANS 
</P>
<P>
USC, the three-time defending Pacific 10 Conference champion, signed 18 prep 
players and one junior college player, offensive lineman Derrick Deese of El 
Camino College, who has already enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased with our class of recruits," USC Coach Larry Smith said. "It's an 
outstanding class with a lot of great athletes. We've filled a lot of our 
needs. There are players who help us at every position and some who have a 
chance to play as freshmen." 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Curtis Conway of Hawthorne, who signed with USC last year but 
failed to qualify academically. Conway, a prep All-American quarterback and the 
state 100-meter champion in track in 1989, will enroll this fall. He attended 
El Camino College as a part-time student this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans, who will graduate four offensive and two defensive linemen from 
last season's Rose Bowl championship team, signed eight other line recruits.The 
prep signers are Andre Abrams of Perris, Chris Andresen of Downey Warren, Tony 
Boselli of Boulder, Colo.; Joe Cajic of Phoenix; Norberto Garrido of La Puente 
Workman, Jason Keiderling of Reseda and Kris Pollack of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
USC also signed running backs Michael Jones of Van Nuys Montclair Prep and 
Jerome Casey of Sylmar; wide receivers John Herpin of La Porte, Tex., and Ryan 
Lenderman of Grand Junction, Colo.; defensive backs Jason Oliver of 
Bakersfield, Errol Small of Sherman Oaks Notre Dame and Deon Strother of 
Oakland Skyline; and tight end Elic Mahone of Pasadena Muir. 
</P>
<P>
In Herpin and Lenderman, USC signed two of the most sought-after receivers in 
the country. Although he broke his arm in his fourth game and was sidelined for 
the rest of 1989 season, Herpin was rated as the top receiver in Texas by many. 
Lenderman, who is the cousin of former USC quarterback Sean Salisbury, caught 
251 passes in his prep career, one shy of the national record. 
</P>
<P>
USC signed a pair of outstanding linebackers in Willie McGinest of Long Beach 
Poly and Jeff Kopp of Danville San Ramon. 
</P>
<P>
McGinest, a 6-6 outside linebacker, was a consensus All-American last season in 
making 107 tackles with 18 sacks. Kopp, 6-3 and 230, is another consensus 
All-American who made 172 tackles with seven sacks and four fumble recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHLAND 
</P>
<P>
Colorado signed four Southland players -- wingback Erik Mitchell of Los 
Alamitos, wide receiver Charles Johnson of San Bernardino Cajon, defensive back 
Blake Anderson of Palos Verdes and tight end Christian Fauria Encino Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
Highly touted Glendora 6-4 quarterback J. J. O'Laughlin signed with Illinois, 
becoming the eighth California quarterback to play for the Illini in the past 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State signed quarterback Armin Youngblood and wide receivers Tydus 
Winans and Michael Ross of Carson; running backs Ron Rivers of San Bernardino 
San Gorgonio, James Fuller of Los Angeles Locke and Greg Greene of Pomona 
Garey. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico signed six local players -- defensive backs Vincent Bonner of 
Westchester, Fred Easter of Riverside City College and Herbert McKinley of 
Moreno Valley Canyon Springs; wide receivers Manley Woods of Gardena and Dion 
Thompson of San Bernardino San Gorgonio and running back Tony Foster of Moreno 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas signed two local players -- defensive back Bobby Perkins of 
Carson and quarterback John Ma'ae of Wilmington Banning. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton signed two Banning wide receivers, Terrance Campbell and 
Sheldon Butler, and running back Chris Peery of Canyon Country Canyon. Banning 
defensive backs Curtis Daniel and Nizam Walter signed with Michigan State and 
Vanderbilt.

arbitration and earned big raises. 
</P>

<P>
OWNERS 
</P>
<P>
 -- Revenue sharing: Have proposed giving players 48% of their revenue from 
ticket sales and from national and local radio and television rights, which 
represents 82% of their total revenue. The 48% would cover player salaries and 
the benefit plan. 
</P>
<P>
The 26 clubs would share on an equal basis the salaries for all players with 
six or fewer years of major league service. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Other issues: It's unclear whether pay-for-performance and participation 
payroll levels are still issues. The plan brought forward by Fay Vincent, while 
rejected by the players Wednesday, could lead to compromises and lessen the 
importance of ancillary issues. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
 -- Minimum salary: Have proposed an increase from $68,000 to between $100,000 
and $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Salary arbitration: Have proposed reducing eligibility requirement from 
three years in the major leagues to two. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roster size: Have proposed return to 25 player limit from 24. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free agency: Have proposed eliminating the five-year waiting period for 
repeat free agents and the compensation system by which a team signing a free 
agent has to give amateur draft choices to the team losing the free agents. 
Have also proposed offering free agency to players who are removed from 40-man 
control rosters and sent to minor leagues outright. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Benefit plan: Have proposed continuing the current formula combining 
owners' contributions with revenue from television contracts covering the 
All-Star game, league playoffs and World Series, which accounts for about 
one-third of the $1.06 billion that CBS will pay baseball over the next four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Collusion: Have proposed that the owners agree to pay treble damages if found 
guilty again of conspiring against free agents, as they did in the winters of 
1985 and '86. ROSS NEWHAN

THE LOCKOUT: DAY 1; 
</P>
<P>
A FAN'S GUIDE; 
</P>
<P>
Q &amp; A: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Why is it called a lockout? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It's seldom that an owner of a corporation locks the office doors and 
doesn't let the employees in. That's what is happening here. Baseball owners 
are refusing to let the players come to work unless a Basic Agreement 
(contract) is reached between the owners and the players' union 
representatives. The last agreement expired Dec. 31, 1989. If the players 
refused to report to spring training, it would be called a strike. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who is participating in the talks? 
</P>
<P>
A: Negotiators for the Major League Baseball Players Relation Committee (PRC), 
which represents the owners, and officials of the Major League Baseball 
Players' Assn. (MLBPA), which represents the players. Also, Baseball 
Commissioner Fay Vincent, who is hired and paid by the owners, joined the talks 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How quickly would it take players to get ready for the regular season if an 
agreement is reached? 
</P>
<P>
A: Spring training runs six weeks for pitchers, catchers and injured players 
and about five weeks for the position players. The consensus is that for 
position players, the least amount of spring-season training needed would be 
three weeks. But pitchers need almost the entire six weeks and would pitch 
fewer innings at the start of the season because of a lack of stamina. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How soon could camps open if an agreement is reached? 
</P>
<P>
A: Owner representatives say it would take about a week to prepare camps to 
open. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why can't spring training camps open while the owners and players continue 
discussion? 
</P>
<P>
A: Seemingly, the players union would allow players to report to spring 
training while it continues negotiations with the owners. However, the owners 
want an agreement before the season begins, and are trying to ensure that by 
not opening spring training camps. 
</P>
<P>
Here's why: The bulk of the money received by the owners comes from the 
telecast of postseason events. The owners receive that money toward the end of 
the season. The owners are fearful that if they start the season without a 
contract the players will wait until July or August and strike. By then, most 
of the players will have received the bulk of their annual salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The union says it will not forfeit its right to strike during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How are the players paid? 
</P>
<P>
A: The majority of players are paid their salary during the regular season. 
Some players, though, elect to have their salary paid over a 26-week pay 
period. Players do not get paid for spring training, but do receive expense 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does the entire agreement have to be in place before the owners open spring 
training? 
</P>
<P>
A: According to recent reports, no. Before Vincent joined the talks, the owners 
said that revenue sharing must be agreed to by the union before the owners will 
consider opening camps. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is revenue sharing? 
</P>
<P>
A: The owners would use 48% of their revenue from ticket sales and television 
and radio rights -- which produce 82% of their total revenue -- for players' 
salaries and benefits. The revenue would be used to pay player salaries for 
players with one to six years of major league service, and would be shared 
equally by the 26 clubs. The salaries would be determined on a statistically 
based, pay-for-performance scale. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the salary cap? 
</P>
<P>
A: A condition of revenue sharing would impose a salary cap on each team. Free 
agents, players with at least six years of major league experience, could not 
sign with teams other than their own if those teams' payrolls were above the 
specified limit. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why is revenue sharing so important to the owners? 
</P>
<P>
A: The owners want "cost certainty." They want to know how much revenue to 
budget for salaries. They say revenue sharing isn't a means to ensure 
profitability for all 26 clubs, but the best way to put stability in their 
relationship with the players. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why is the players union so opposed to revenue sharing? 
</P>
<P>
A: The owners' pay-for-performance system, as originally proposed, would 
eliminate arbitration, which is currently available to players with three years 
of major league service or more. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, for players with one to six years of experience, it would eliminate 
guaranteed contracts and multiyear contracts that are executed when a player 
nears free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Third, salaries would be determined by statistical formulas based on numbers 
from the players' previous two seasons. The union believes a players' value 
cannot be measured on statistics alone. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the revenue-sharing conditions would impose a salary cap that could 
restrict mobility for free agents. Players with six years or more would still 
be free agents, but they could not sign with teams other than their own if 
those teams' payrolls were above the specified limit. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Have the owners softened their stance? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's been reported that on Tuesday the owners modified their proposal to 
keep arbitration but place a 75% ceiling on the amount of increase a player can 
receive. The proposal would also dump the pay-for-performance system based on a 
statistical table for determining the salary of players with six or fewer years 
of major league service. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why can't the baseball commissioner stop this lockout? 
</P>
<P>
A: The commissioner, who is hired and paid by the owners, can use his influence 
to encourage a settlement. But he does not have authority over the players' 
union, and therefore cannot order an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about tickets purchased for the regular season? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you are holding a ticket to a game and the game is not played, Dodger 
officials say you will be entitled to a refund. Procedures would be announced 
at the appropriate time.

ANGELS, HOWELL STRIKE ONE-YEAR DEAL; MCCASKILL'S HEARING SET FOR MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels and Jack Howell met more than halfway Wednesday, avoiding salary 
arbitration by agreeing to a one-year contract that will pay the 28-year-old 
third baseman $650,000 and a potential of more than $100,000 in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, who led the major leagues in fielding last season at .974 with only 11 
errors, had filed for $780,000 against the Angels' figure of $525,000. 
</P>
<P>
He earned $465,000 last year plus a $5,000 bonus for making more than 530 plate 
appearances. His average slumped to .228, with 20 home runs and a 52 runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Howell's signing leaves pitcher Kirk McCaskill as the only Angel still 
scheduled for arbitration. McCaskill, who earned $400,000 last season, filed 
for $1,185,000; the Angels offered $750,000. McCaskill's hearing is set for 
Monday. HELENE ELLIOTT

ARBITRATOR AWARDS PADRES' SANTIAGO ONE-YEAR CONTRACT FOR $1.25 MILLION

Benito Santiago, the San Diego Padres' catcher who always told himself while 
growing up that one day he'd escape the poverty of Jauca, Puerto Rico, 
fulfilled his fantasy Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He became a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, who will turn 25 next month, was awarded a one-year contract for 
$1.25 million by arbitrator Tom Roberts, the largest award in Padre history. 
Santiago, who earned $310,000 plus $35,000 in incentives in 1989, had been 
offered $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, one day, I dreamed of this day," Santiago said. "It's a very special 
day in my life. It means I've come a long way." 
</P>
<P>
Agent Scott Boras demonstrated Santiago's value Tuesday in a four-hour hearing, 
pointing out that his client and Hall of Famer Johnny Bench were the only 
catchers in the past 25 years to win two Gold Gloves in their first three big 
league seasons. BOB NIGHTENGALE

SANTA ANITA;

<P>
DOWN AGAIN LAUDED AFTER VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't ever speak badly of Down Again in front of Richard Cross. 
</P>
<P>
After the 6-year-old mare had ended a 10-race losing streak, at 16-1, in 
Wednesday's $83,950 Monrovia Handicap at Santa Anita, her trainer sprang to her 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep reading she lacks the will to win, but she's now won 10 races and 
earned more than $550,000," he said after Down Again's half-length victory over 
11-1 shot Sexy Slew. "I can't find many horses that have won 10 races." 
</P>
<P>
Down Again was timed in 1:13 for about 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Cross' observations, the mare, owned by Bruce McNall, owner of the 
Kings and one of his employees, defenseman Larry Robinson, has been content to 
settle for minor prizes more often than not in this country. She won only twice 
in 15 starts last year while finishing second or third in eight others. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the key Wednesday was the return of jockey Corey Black. He was in the 
saddle for Down Again's last three victories. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't meant to be a reflection on the ability of other jockeys, but she 
runs for some and not for others," Cross said. "She had just a perfect trip. 
Some days, she would put her head in the air when she made the lead, but she 
won with it today. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why she ran so bad last time (fifth of six Jan. 31). The only 
thing I figure is that in a short field, she couldn't get as much cover and she 
went too fast, too soon. When she gets cover and they go fast up front in a big 
field, she seems to fire." 
</P>
<P>
Black was careful not to go too soon with Down Again. 
</P>
<P>
"She was cruising on the turn and I was worried she'd pull me to the lead too 
soon," he said. "She tends not to do her best if she hits the front too early. 
She only has a short run in her and she's not much for the stick. If you get 
after her, she tends to sulk. 
</P>
<P>
"When I asked her, she went. This is the most willing she's been in the races 
I've been on her." 
</P>
<P>
Sexy Slew finished a neck ahead of Hot Novel, who was a head better than a 
troubled Survive. Stormy But Valid, the 5-2 favorite, was a much-troubled 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a terrible trip," said Gary Stevens of Stormy But Valid. "I was 
sitting where the winner was at the start of the left turn. I was afraid of 
clipping heels and checked her. I moved out to go around one horse at the 
(main-track) crossing and that horse moved out at the same time and carried a 
lot of us out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was way out by the grandstand. I could have grabbed a hot dog. She had a 
right to get beat 10 lengths." 
</P>
<P>
Readying for her scheduled rematch with Bayakoa in Sunday's $300,000 Santa 
Margarita Invitational Handicap, Gorgeous worked five furlongs in 1:00 
Wednesday at Hollywood Park. The clockers termed the drill breezing for the 
4-year-old Slew o' Gold filly, who coasted in winning the La Canada Handicap 
Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous and Bayakoa's other meeting was in the Breeders' Cup Distaff and 
Bayakoa won by a length and a half. In the Santa Margarita, Bayakoa must carry 
127 pounds, two more than her younger rival. 
</P>
<P>
The other possible starters in the 1 1/8-mile Santa Margarita are Luthier's 
Launch, runner-up in the El Encino and La Canada; Kelly; Nikishka, Invited 
Guest, Dreaming Mimi and Carita Tostada. 
</P>
<P>
In his first day as a regular on the local circuit, Kent Desormeaux drew a 
blank with five mounts. 
</P>
<P>
The best the Eclipse Award-winning jockey could manage was a distant second on 
17-1 shot Strogien in the fifth race. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good," he said. "I wasn't nervous. I had good trips all day and the one 
horse was just second best." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux will be busy today and Friday. He is named on seven horses today and 
has six calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Longden turned 83 Wednesday. . . . Trainer Gregory Vartanian was fined 
$300 by the stewards after Kamakhalyn, who finished second in the first race 
Feb. 1, was found to have an excessive level of butazolidin, a painkiller. 
</P>
<P>
Despite several double-digit winners, there was one perfect ticket in the Pick 
Six and it was worth $216,061.60. . . . Lickety Splitter became the 
longest-priced winner of the meeting when she won the ninth at $150.40. Ridden 
by Luis Jauregui, the 5-year-old mare hadn't been out since finishing seventh 
at Fairplex Park Sept. 30 and hadn't won since April.

Torrance 55, Tustin 52 -- The Tartars were supposed to represent an easy draw 
for Tustin in the first round of the 4-AA Division playoffs. Instead, they gave 
Tustin an early exit. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman guard Lisa Misipeka came off the bench to score 14 points in the 
fourth quarter to lead Torrance to a dramatic 55-52 upset over host Tustin. 
"This is the best game we've ever played," Torrance Coach Rick Momohara said. 
"Our mental mistakes cost us at the beginning of the game, but once we decided 
we could really play with Tustin, our girls settled down." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance, which entered the playoffs as an at-large team, improved to 16-10. 
The Tartars will face Mission Viejo, a 60-25 winner over Claremont, in the 
second round on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin, which was unbeaten in the Sea View League, finished the season with a 
21-6 record. Tustin led by as many as 10 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Misipeka hit a 10-foot jumper to give Torrance a 51-48 lead before fouling out 
with 1:01 left in the game. She finished with 15 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance freshman Tiffany Fujimoto knocked down a pair of free throws to put 
the game away after Tustin's Shari Needham had hit a three-pointer to cut the 
Torrance lead to 53-52. Fujimoto led all scorers with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball coach Dave Yanai watched from the stands 
as his daughter, Deanne, gave Torrance its first lead of the game on a layup 
with 2:01 left in the third quarter. Yanai finished with seven points, and 
sophomore Brittany Mounger added six. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the team that we were up against a tough team that plays a lot like 
(Bay League rival) Palos Verdes," Momohara said. "So the girls looked at it 
like it was a rematch with P.V." STUART MATTHEWS

EL SEGUNDO STAR AT HOME ON THE COURT, FOOTBALL FIELD, DIAMOND; 
</P>
<P>
PREP SPORTS: EL SEGUNDO'S KEN TALANOA WILL BE PLAYING HIS COLLEGE FOOTBALL AT 
HAWAII, BUT HE'S BUSY WITH THE EAGLES IN THE BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS FOR NOW. 
</P>

<P>
El Segundo High School senior Ken Talanoa, an All-Southern Section defensive 
end, signed a letter of intent Wednesday to play football for the University of 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
But that won't distract him from the business at hand: leading the Eagles' 
basketball team into the second round of the Southern Section 2-A Division 
playoffs Friday night against Crossroads at Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
<P>
Talanoa, who is also an outfielder for El Segundo's defending 2-A champion 
baseball team, has no problem focusing on goals. Intense competition is a way 
of life in the Talanoa family. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my fifth year here," El Segundo basketball Coach Rick Sabosky said. 
"It's our fifth year going to the playoffs, and it's no coincidence that this 
is also our fifth year with a Talanoa at center." 
</P>
<P>
Talanoa's brother, Scott, was the Eagles' most valuable player in basketball as 
a senior in 1988 and is now a first baseman for Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother always went right from football to basketball to baseball," said 
Ken, who is averaging 13.5 points and 12.8 rebounds per game. "And now I guess 
I'm trying to live in his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard, but actually I'm trying to be better than he was. He's pushing me 
to be better than he was, too." 
</P>
<P>
"No matter where he is, the older brother makes a point to be at (Ken's) 
games," said the Talanoas' father, Aiulu. "Right after the game, he will 
critique his younger brother's performance. Win or lose, they always know they 
have each other to depend on, which is a good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Aiulu Talanoa said his sons have different styles but similar attitudes in 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
"They are different brands of players," he said. "Scott may have been a bit 
more physical in basketball, for example. But they both have always gone out 
there with one purpose, and that's to win." 
</P>
<P>
And the Eagles, who moved up to the basketball-tough Camino Real League from 
the relatively mild Santa Fe League for one season (they'll join the San 
Fernando Valley League next season), have done a surprising amount of winning 
this year. They finished the regular season with a 13-13 overall record and a 
7-7 league mark, good for fourth place among eight teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Camino Real League includes basketball powerhouses St. Monica, which 
entered the season rated No. 1 in the state; St. Anthony, the No. 6-ranked team 
in the Southern Section 5-AA Division, and St. Bernard, a traditional power 
that produced current Arizona freshman center Ed Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo, with an enrollment of about 650 students, is the only public high 
school in the Camino Real League. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers said the Eagles would be intimidated by the league's 
well-established Catholic schools, which draw students from a wide geographic 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The El Segundo players knew they faced a challenge, but Talanoa brought his 
teammates together for a motivational meeting before the start of league play. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about how everybody else 
</P>
<P>
thought we couldn't win," recalled Talanoa, an all-Santa Fe League pick last 
year. "But we told ourselves that if we stayed together, we would do well in 
this league and show people." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it's hard to imagine a team led by the 6-foot-5, 230-pound Talanoa 
being intimidated by anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, that's how the Eagles looked as they opened league play with 
double-digit losses to St. Bernard and St. Monica. Things changed for the 
better in a hurry, though. A 12-point El Segundo win over Pius X was followed 
by a major upset, 79-76, at St. Anthony on Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
That victory highlighted an impressive six-game league winning streak. El 
Segundo's top scorers, guard Scott Panfil (20 points per game) and forward Tate 
Seefried (16.7), each scored 24 points in the win over St. Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
"That game was a true turning point," said Talanoa, who contributed 10 points 
and 14 rebounds. "And ever since then, we've proved that we have the heart and 
the character to play anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Talanoa thinks facing stiff competition from teams in higher divisions all 
season will help in the playoffs. The Eagles drew a bye in the first round 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to help us a lot knowing that we can beat bigger schools in bigger 
divisions," he said. "It should give us an edge because we know we just have to 
beat the ones at our level." 
</P>
<P>
Talanoa helped El Segundo to the Southern Section 2-AA quarterfinals a year 
ago, and he's primed to top that accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll do whatever it takes to win," said Talanoa, who had a uncharacteristic 
12-assist game earlier this season. "I'll rebound, I'll pass. If they need me 
to score, I'll score. I'm just ready to go in there and do my business, get it 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Sabosky admires Talanoa's blood-and-guts enthusiasm, although he said it must 
be tempered at times. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows how to move bodies out there," the coach said. "But sometimes I have 
to calm him down. The first couple of weeks after football season, he was just 
killing people in practice."

TORO WOMEN STAGGER IN TRY TO BETTER 1989 RECORD IN SOFTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN LINDSEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting its second year under Coach Janis Ruetz, the Cal State Dominguez Hills 
women's softball team is looking to better last season's 35-22-1 record and 
third-place finish in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ruetz took her team to the NCAA Division II West egionals. Much of 
the Lady Toros' strength came from pitcher Denise Biller, who had a team-high 
15 wins. Overall, the pitching staff led the nation with an ERA of 0.59. 
</P>
<P>
With nine returning starters, Ruetz has a solid chance to make it back to the 
Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal for the year is, basically, to be consistent," she said. "We want to 
do as well as we did last year and get another NCAA berth." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Lady Toros dropped their first two games, 1-0 and 3-0, to UC Santa 
Barbara. But they came back Wednesday to sweep Christ College of Irvine, 1-0, 
and 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Senior pitcher Kim Park, who was 13-8-1 with an 0.58 ERA last season, is 
considered the team leader. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Jennifer Boen, a pitcher and utility infielder, was 4-1 in eight 
mound appearances last year with a 0.40 ERA. She also earned all-conference 
honors as a utility player. In CCAA play, Boen was 2-0 with two complete-game 
shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
Ruetz said she expects Boen to become the No. 2 starter on the pitching staff, 
which means she won't play so much in the infield. "(Boen) is ready to pitch 
full-time at this level," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
On offense, the Lady Toros look first to senior outfielder Maria Romero, who 
led the team last year with eight doubles, nine triples and 27 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Nicole Stelter, a 5-foot-9 sophomore infielder, was second in RBIs last year 
with 21 and hit two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
In the CCAA, the main competition for the Lady Toros will come from perennially 
talented Cal State Northridge.

INNOVATION: A CASE STUDY IN THE NEW FINANCIAL PHYSICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert's slow dissolve in the acid bath of liquidation provides 
more than just a juicy 1980s allegory of greed, hubris and excess. It offers 
crucial insights into the underlying challenges of managing innovation and how 
the most successful innovations can lead to the most spectacular disasters. 
</P>
<P>
As sleazy and felonious as many people argue that the investment bank and its 
junk bond guru, Michael Milken, were, the practical reality was that Drexel, 
for a time, was Wall Street's most brilliant innovator -- as entrepreneurially 
influential as a Sun Microsystems in computers or a Genentech in biotechnology. 
As former Undersecretary of the Treasury George Gould puts it: "The rise of 
Drexel was a reshuffling of the competitive deck in Wall Street and the 
money-raising function." 
</P>
<P>
Milken and Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph took Joseph Schumpeter's 
definition of innovation quite literally -- a form of "creative destruction." 
With its swaggering arrogance, its "highly confident" funding letters, Milken's 
X-shaped trading desk and its Byzantine networks of bond buyers and sellers, 
Drexel's junk bond machine could instantaneously raise billions in capital and 
shove previously impenetrable Fortune 500 behemoths "in play." The junk bond 
market -- cresting at more than $200 billion -- completely reshaped the ecology 
of finance. 
</P>
<P>
"Junk was the initial spark that lit the fire under Drexel," says Harvard 
Business School professor Samuel Hayes III. "It was the kernel of value at 
Drexel. Milken basically ran with that one idea. It's like the Japanese taking 
the transistor and building a whole slew of electronics products out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Junk -- excuse me, "high-yield" -- bonds were the silicon chips of finance, and 
Drexel wanted to be IBM, Apple and Microsoft all rolled into one. For the right 
fee, Drexel would cheerfully customize securities for its clients much as an 
Intel or Motorola will help customize computer chips for its valued clients. 
Drexel was both symbol and substance of a new era of financial innovation -- 
innovations that completely transformed capital markets all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a revolution in the technology of finance of which Drexel was 
only a small part," asserts Joseph Grundfest, a recently retired commissioner 
at the Securities and Exchange Commission who now teaches at Stanford Law 
School. Emergent telecommunications networks, powerful computers and new 
quantitative theories of finance all reshaped the ways capital was created, 
invested, grown and destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
For example, says Grundfest, many investment analysts believe that "options are 
the quarks of finance; they're the building blocks of all other financial 
instruments." The new financial physics helped spawn innovations like program 
trading and portfolio insurance, which are controversial in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
These revolutions in the science and technology of finance completely 
overturned more traditional notions of market value, and that completely 
redefined traditional relationships between buyers, sellers and intermediaries. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Gould asserts that "junk bonds spawned the bridge loan" -- the practice 
of investment banks actually lending money to their clients to complete a deal. 
Traditionally, investment bankers had been intermediaries and agents for their 
clients. The new generation of financial innovations like junk bonds and bridge 
loans helped turn investment bankers from agents into principals. That, Gould 
and Hayes agree, set the stage for a host of conflicts of interest ranging from 
excessive fees to insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, many of these innovations were as much driven to generate profits 
for the investment banking house as effectively serve the client base. The 
result is a bunch of investment bankers behaving like the Cape Dogs of Finance: 
growling, snarling and gnawing on the bones of offerings and acquisitions until 
every scrap of revenue has been scarfed down and digested into fees. 
</P>
<P>
This irresistible lust for revenues not only spawned conflicts of interest, it 
drove normally rational investment bankers -- particularly those at Drexel -- 
to push their innovations above and beyond the point of diminishing returns. 
These bankers were more interested in making money than making markets. 
</P>
<P>
Gould -- who as a co-founder of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, is from a 
kinder, gentler albeit less innovative era of investment banking -- points out 
that junk, payment-in-kind and zero coupon bonds are "perfectly admirable 
innovations" that were turned into financial freaks by bankers more loyal to 
their bonuses than to their clients. "The line between innovation and 
foolhardiness is probably a thin one," he ruefully notes. Nothing exceeds like 
excess. 
</P>
<P>
Other bankers believe that these "innovations" created more harm than benefit. 
"Financial innovation is not worth a damn if it fails to reduce the cost of 
capital," says Peter Rona, president of IBJ/Schroder, the U.S. subsidiary of 
the Industrial Bank of Japan. "Drexel and other innovators managed to double 
America's cost of capital over the last decade; that's why Drexel failed." 
Which puts American companies at a competitive disadvantage to their Japanese 
and European counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Like a Silicon Valley firm, Drexel became a little too enamored of its own 
technology. "Drexel began to pay more attention to the issuers of its 
securities -- and their fees -- than to the insurance companies and 
institutions that bought them," says George Anders, who is completing a book on 
leveraged buyout moguls Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. "They were producing 
securities that were out of touch with what the world needed." 
</P>
<P>
Combine that with Washington's ruling last year compelling key financial 
institutions to divest their junk bond holdings and you have a financial 
innovation that becomes the debt market's equivalent of an albatross. 
</P>
<P>
As superb an innovation as the junk bond was, the combination of conflict of 
interest, insider trading, fee-driven excess and customer insensitivity proved 
absolutely lethal. Drexel's demise should be a warning to every American 
financial institution that is counting on innovation to give them the edge 
against their better-heeled Japanese and European competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in an era where innovation is going to continue at a remarkable pace," 
insists Grundfest of Stanford and the SEC, but the challenge is to profitably 
manage that innovation process. Drexel is no doubt doomed to become a Harvard 
Business School case study in how to build and lose a multibillion-dollar 
financial franchise based on innovation. 
</P>
<P>
For all those budding young MBAs thinking of finance as a career, the lesson of 
that case study can be found in this paraphrase of an old Wall Street epigram: 
Bulls can make money, bears can make money, but pigs, no matter how clever and 
innovative, still get slaughtered.

DREXEL BEGINS DISMANTLING ONCE-POWERFUL JUNK EMPIRE 
</P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street scavengers descended on Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Wednesday after 
the investment bank's parent company filed for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before midnight New York time on Tuesday, lawyers for the parent, 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, filed a 22-page petition under Chapter 11 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, listing $3.698 billion in assets and $2.885 billion in 
liabilities. The initial filing listed only the 23 largest outside creditors, 
including the California Public Employees Retirement System, and gave few 
details of the firm's financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
After defaulting on a $100-million loan package Tuesday, Drexel said it will 
soon close down its operations, but no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the firm's 5,300 employees began a search for jobs. Drexel spokesman 
Steven Anreder said the firm told employees Wednesday that they will be given 
severance pay, although the amount hasn't been determined. Meanwhile, he said, 
employees on the trading floor and elsewhere at the firm had settled down to 
closing out the firm's affairs. "I think the shock is over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Executives from rival Wall Street firms flocked to Drexel to pick over its 
inventory of securities, hunting for bargains. Virtually all of the firm's 
government securities holdings and much of its mortgage-backed bond portfolio 
were sold by the end of the trading day. There was speculation that the firm's 
remaining massive holdings of junk bonds, valued at more than $1 billion, might 
be sold as a package to one or more buyers under a negotiated sale. Anreder 
said, however, that no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds, the high-risk, high-yield securities that Drexel pioneered and made 
the cornerstone of its fantastically profitable business in the 1980s, were 
also the firm's undoing. The firm couldn't weather the severe downturn of the 
junk market that has been under way for months. A Chapter 11 filing normally 
allows a company to continue operating while it attempts to work out an 
arrangement with its creditors. But experts in bankruptcy law said that the law 
provides less protection to brokerage firms and that Drexel really had no 
option but to liquidate. 
</P>
<P>
The fist tentative list of creditors contains many gaps and doesn't name any 
insiders or former insiders who are owed considerable sums, such as the firm's 
former junk bond chief, Michael Milken. The firm may ultimately contend that it 
owes Milken nothing. 
</P>
<P>
After Milken was forced to resign from the firm last year following his 
indictment on 98 felony counts, Drexel refused to pay his salary and bonus for 
1988 and 1989. Milken denies having violated any laws. The firm also never paid 
him for his large holdings of Drexel stock that he was required to turn in on 
leaving the firm. Some sources at Drexel say internal estimates show that the 
firm owes him no more than $100 million. But the Milken camp believes the 
figure to be around $200 million, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing also apparently means that Drexel will stop paying the 
huge legal bills run up by Milken and a dozen or more current and former 
employees. Under employment agreements, Drexel had been paying nearly all of 
the legal expenses that the employees incurred as a result of the government's 
investigation into securities fraud, stock market manipulation and insider 
trading at the firm. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Milken refused to comment Wednesday on the cutoff of legal fees 
and other money owed to him. A lawyer for a Drexel employee who is a 
cooperating witness noted that most of the people for whom Drexel was paying 
legal fees have considerable personal wealth. "These guys can afford their own 
lawyers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another direct effect of the filing is that Drexel most likely will stop 
setting aside the money it was paying into a special fund to pay off claimants 
who have civil suits pending against the firm. Drexel was still scheduled to 
set aside $150 million for the fund, which the Securities and Exchange 
Commission required after the firm pleaded guilty to six counts of securities 
fraud last year. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Corri, a lawyer at the New York law firm of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, 
the firm representing Drexel in the bankruptcy proceedings, said a more 
detailed list of creditors, assets and liabilities probably won't be filed for 
at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
In the filing made late Tuesday, the largest single creditor listed was a 
Japanese life insurance company, Taiyo Mutual Life, which is owed $69.7 million 
under a private debt placement. The California Public Employees Retirement 
System is listed among the top six creditors. Drexel owes the state pension 
fund $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Basil Schwan, assistant executive officer of the pension fund, noted that the 
Drexel loan accounts for only a minuscule portion of the fund's investments, 
which total about $57 billion. Schwan said the loan, a private debt placement, 
was made in 1986, when Drexel was "in a very strong growth posture" and had a 
high credit rating. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit filed in Bankruptcy Court, Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H. 
Joseph said the parent firm was forced to file because "DBL Group currently 
faces a liquidity crisis and does not have the financial resources to weather 
this storm without court protection." He said that, without the protection, the 
firm would soon be obligated to pay more than $3 billion in debt owed by the 
parent and its subsidiaries, payments that it couldn't meet. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph blamed the firm's predicament on a general "downturn in the financial 
markets," including the high-yield market. He noted that Drexel normally 
financed its day-to-day operations by selling commercial paper -- short-term, 
unsecured IOUs. But as the junk bond market plummeted, and the market for 
commercial paper shrank, the firm could no longer raise the operating money it 
needed. He said the firm recently had to pay off $575 million in commercial 
paper debt, without being able to issue any new IOUs. 
</P>
<P>
"The burden of meeting these obligations effectively wiped out DBL Group's 
liquidity," Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the unanswered questions about the bankruptcy filing is why senior 
officials hadn't anticipated the crisis sooner and acted more quickly to try to 
find a merger partner or investor to salvage Drexel. Both Joseph and Drexel's 
chairman, John S. R. Shad, refused again Wednesday to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Anreder confirmed that Joseph had taken nearly all of last week off because of 
a bad cough. But he denied that top officials had been unaware of the gathering 
crisis. Anreder said senior executives had a "game plan" for dealing with the 
debt that was coming due. But he said the plan was wrecked at the end of last 
week when the SEC refused to let the parent company draw off more capital from 
the brokerage unit. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Salomon Bros., First Boston Corp. and other big Wall Street firms 
said they were waiting for more detailed information from Drexel before 
deciding to make a bid for the firm's junk holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bond industry analysts said the possibility of selling off Drexel's entire 
junk bond portfolio in one or more big blocks would have several advantages. A 
negotiated sale would prevent a large quantity of the securities from being 
dumped on the market, which would drive down already severely depressed prices. 
In addition, Drexel would be able to get rid of securities for which there is 
no current demand on the open market but which aren't necessarily valueless. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, a Belgian company that 
holds a 26% stake in Drexel, said it would write off its entire investment in 
the American firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Drexel bankruptcy filing appeared to underscore that the federal government 
wouldn't necessarily step in to prevent the collapse of a major Wall Street 
firm. Regulators from the Federal Reserve Board, the Treasury Department and 
the SEC have closely monitored the situation to make sure that there was no 
chain reaction that might have taken down other big firms. But few steps were 
taken to pressure commercial banks or other firms to bail out Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, David S. Ruder, who recently stepped down as 
chairman of the SEC, said he didn't believe that the federal government should 
be obliged to rescue a big securities firm unless its downfall threatened to 
take other big firms with it. But Ruder sharply criticized current federal law, 
which gives the SEC only very limited access to details of the financial 
affairs of securities firms' parent holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
Ruder said he had no knowledge of the Drexel financial crisis beyond what he 
has read in newspapers. But he said he believes that, if the SEC had received 
earlier warning of the holding company's financial troubles, it might have been 
able to act sooner to head off the crisis, possibly by pressuring other firms 
to make an offer for Drexel. "I think it would have been much better if there 
had been some knowledge and early warning from Drexel to the commission."

U.S. to Study 'Globalization' of Mass Media: The United States may need updated 
communications policies, the government said in announcing that it will study 
the "globalization" of the mass media. The National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration said it will seek to determine how widespread the 
globalization of the media has become, noting that current policies, such as 
limits on foreign ownership of U.S. communications concerns and cross-ownership 
prohibitions, need to be re-examined.

PANEL TO CONSIDER DEPOSIT INSURANCE OVERHAUL; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: THE SUBJECT WAS CONSIDERED TOO HOT TO HANDLE DURING LAST YEAR'S 
S&amp;L BAILOUT DEBATE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the House Banking Committee announced a review of federal 
deposit insurance Wednesday, declaring that "Congress should not regard the 
$100,000-per-account insurance as a divine right." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) scheduled a hearing Feb. 21 as "the opening 
shot" in what promises to be the most explosive financial issue before Congress 
in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said the committee would take up a subject considered too hot to 
handle during last year's debate over savings and loan bailout legislation: the 
scope of deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Many private experts have said deposit insurance encouraged the risky behavior 
that created mammoth S&amp;L losses, but Congress did not even talk about 
changing the $100,000-per-account coverage limit last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only do we need to examine the absolute limits of the coverage, but to 
determine whether the multiple accounts maintained by some depositors are 
unnecessarily increasing the risks to the funds," Gonzalez said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department and the General Accounting Office are studying deposit 
insurance. Congress isn't expected to act until those studies are finished, but 
already the battle lines are being drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Small banks, in particular, oppose any reduction of deposit insurance. They 
argue that no matter what the rules, depositors in big banks would continue to 
enjoy protection because regulators would bail them out rather than risk 
collapse of the banking system, as regulators did in the failure of Continental 
Illinois National Bank in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Deposit insurance was enacted in 1934 in an attempt to prevent future waves of 
withdrawals, or bank "runs," like those that proved so destructive in 1931-33. 
</P>
<P>
Originally the first $5,000 in an account was insured; the limit was raised in 
several steps, rising from $40,000 to $100,000 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's announcement came two weeks after Budget Director Richard G. Darman, 
in the Administration's 1991 budget, suggested consideration of several 
sweeping changes. 
</P>
<P>
Without endorsing anything, Darman listed a range of possibilities, including: 
</P>
<P>
* Scrupulously enforcing the existing $100,000 limit and forcing big depositors 
and other creditors to accept some loss. 
</P>
<P>
* Forcing depositors to bear some loss through a deductible. 
</P>
<P>
* Allowing insured deposits to be used for only a limited range of safe 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
* Charging banks with risky investments higher deposit insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
* Making the government the "catastrophic" insurer that steps in only if 
private insurance fails.

President Bush's annual economic report, issued a week after the budget by his 
chief economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, said deposit insurance "can 
encourage excessive risk taking" but added that it also has "worked very well 
in preventing . . . panics." 
</P>
<P>
The only change mentioned by Boskin was charging higher insurance premiums to 
banks posing a greater hazard to the insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, in hearings conducted by Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), chairman of 
the Banking Committee's financial institutions subcommittee, private analysts 
said the commercial bank insurance fund, while solvent, is dangerously weak. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, whose agency 
insures both bank and S&amp;L accounts, has said there are enough reserves to 
cover foreseeable bank failures. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman and Charles A. Bowsher, head of the General Accounting Office, are 
scheduled to testify Feb. 21.

DEALER INCENTIVES GIVE AUTO SALES A BOOST

Early February sales of North American-made cars and light trucks rose 7.9% as 
generous incentives stirred car sales, auto makers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the incentives weren't enough to stop a loss of market share by the 
nation's Big Three auto makers to U.S. plants owned by five Japanese makers. 
</P>
<P>
Combined car and truck sales for General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and 
Chrysler Corp. were up 6% in early February, trailing the overall market 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's eight major makers reported that car sales, which trailed last 
year's pace in January, showed a 10.1% increase in the Feb. 1-10 period. 
Domestic truck sales were up 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Car buyers responded to aggressive incentives offered by the auto makers, said 
Jeannette Garretty, an analyst at Bank of America in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
GM, Ford and Chrysler said they sold 7.2% more cars than in early February, 
1989. Ford led the surge with a 14.3% jump. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler reported an 8.4% drop in car sales and a 16.5% drop in truck sales for 
the period. The company stopped giving rebates on its popular minivan models, 
which are classified as trucks, on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the eight domestic auto makers reported selling cars and trucks at an 
average daily rate of 19,316 during early February, compared to a rate of 
17,539 cars a day in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three's share of the domestic market slipped to 87.6% for Feb. 1-10 
from 91.5% in the same period last year. The remainder was divided among the 
American plants owned by Honda, Mazda, Toyota, Mitsubishi and Nissan.

Boeing Predicts Deal With China: Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Dean 
Thornton predicted that Boeing will clinch a deal with China to build 150 
aircraft by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton made his comments at the Asian Aerospace 90 air show in Singapore. 
China has already built 13 MD-82s in cooperation with McDonnell Douglas in a 
program to construct 25 aircraft. China is considered likely to insist on 
participating in the project to design and build either Boeing 737-300s or 
McDonnell Douglas' MD-90s.

CHEVRON TO SELL OFF FACILITIES IN BAHAMAS

Chevron Corp. said it will sell an unused refinery and an operating shipping 
and storage facility in the Bahamas to Venezuela's state-owned oil company. 
</P>
<P>
No terms were disclosed for the mostly cash deal with Petroleos de Venezuela, 
which owns the Citgo oil company. The deal must be approved by the governments 
of the Bahamas and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
The 500,000-barrel-per-day refinery was shut in 1985, but storage facilities 
for 20 million barrels and marine facilities that can accomodate ships carrying 
up to 500,000 tons have been used almost continuously since the entire facility 
was opened by Chevron in 1970.

JUNK BOND MARKET IMPROVES, BUT INVESTORS REMAIN WARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The junk bond market, jarred Monday and Tuesday by the collapse of Drexel 
Burnham Lambert, regained lost ground early Wednesday, then surrendered some of 
its advance in later trading. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of top-tier junk bonds were up 1 to 1.5 points after a slide of 2.25 
points between Friday and Tuesday, Moody's Investors Service said. One point 
represents $10 for each $1,000 in face value of a bond. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was light as most usual participants remained wary, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some improvement, but the market's suffered a lot of shocks 
recently, and there's no fundamental change in the way people are viewing 
things," said Kevin Mathews, portfolio manager at Van Kampen Merritt, in Lisle, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Some traders argued that Wednesday's early rally was due primarily to "short 
covering" -- the purchase of bonds by traders who had earlier sold borrowed 
bonds in hopes of turning a quick profit when prices fell. "A lot of people 
thought the Drexel problem would hurt the market more than it did, and 
(Wednesday) they had to cover themselves," said Cricket Weaver, a trader at 
Deltec Securities in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Among advancing issues Wednesday were the widely held bonds of RJR Nabisco, 
Kroger, Turner Broadcasting and Safeway Stores. RJR Nabisco's 13.71% bond due 
in 2007 was up 2.5 points at 64.25; the company's 13.5% bond due in 2001 was 
quoted at 91, up 3.25. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's bankruptcy removed the biggest player in the junk bond market, the 
firm that popularized the high-risk, high-yield bonds and underwrote nearly 40% 
of new issues last year. And its failure came only days after another shock to 
the junk market -- the downgrading of RJR Nabisco bonds by a credit-rating 
agency over concerns about the big tobacco-and-food firm's cigarette business. 
</P>
<P>
The market had been pounded even earlier by the bankruptcy filings by the 
retailing units of Campeau Corp., the Canadian owner of a large collection of 
U.S. department stores. 
</P>
<P>
Most bonds now are trading at 60% to 80% of their face value, compared to 100% 
as recently as last summer. 
</P>
<P>
While several mutual funds specializing in junk bonds said redemptions were 
minimal, there was little active buying by either the funds or insurance 
companies, the two most active buyer groups when the market is stronger. "The 
buying there came from the dealers," Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bond yields have continued to drift upward and are now, on average, almost 
8 percentage points higher than Treasury bond yields, an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Vaselkiv, vice president at the T. Rowe Price mutual fund company in 
Baltimore, said he is optimistic that the market is heading toward recovery. 
But he predicted that many institutional buyers will hold back for awhile 
because of the seemingly unending series of jolts that the market has felt over 
the last five months. 
</P>
<P>
"They've seen a lot of bad news, and at these low price levels they're 
nervous," Vaselkiv said. But he insisted that, with the fall of Drexel and the 
major bankruptcies of recent months, "there's just not much more bad news left 
to happen."

FATE OF 400 DREXEL STAFFERS STILL UP IN AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A number of Los Angeles brokerage executives said Wednesday that they expect to 
hire workers from Drexel Burnham Lambert in coming months despite an industry 
slowdown that has caused major staff cutbacks in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many question whether the Southern California brokerage industry is 
strong enough to handle an influx of about 400 people who are likely to be 
pounding the pavement within a matter of weeks. While Drexel, whose parent 
company filed for bankruptcy protection late Tuesday, is not saying how soon or 
how many Beverly Hills workers will be laid off, company executives said 
privately that they believe everyone will be gone within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Workers, desperate to find jobs in a slack market, were faxing their resumes to 
other big brokerage houses, industry executives said. 
</P>
<P>
But even the firms that are talking about "aggressive hiring" speak in terms of 
relatively small groups of people -- typically under a dozen -- rather than 
hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
"Bear Stearns and other big firms will take some of the key players," said 
Richard Zander, president of Zander Associates, a Century City executive search 
firm that specializes in the brokerage industry. "But the support staff, the 
younger members, the lower producers, I would guess these people will have a 
difficult time finding jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Several firms -- including Sutro &amp; Co., Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. and the 
smaller regional house of H. J. Meyers -- said they plan to hire aggressively. 
However, none would give exact figures on how many Drexel employees they would 
be willing to snap up. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say we are taking an open-minded approach," said Lloyd Greif, vice 
chairman and managing director of corporate finance at Sutro &amp; Co., Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Added Michael Tennenbaum, vice chairman of investment banking at Bear Stearns: 
"I think the likelihood of adding a substantial number of people will depend on 
whether a group with a specific business expertise wants to move." 
</P>
<P>
Bear Stearns is also interviewing individual brokers, traders and investment 
bankers, Tennenbaum said. But before Drexel's news, the company considered 
itself fully staffed, so it will only hire those it considers exemplary or 
those who will be able to expand Bear Stearns' business. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said the approximately 400 workers at Drexel's Beverly Hills 
offices have been frantically searching for work since Drexel first announced 
the depth of its problems two days ago. 
</P>
<P>
The firm had previously been losing workers as top investment and corporate 
bankers became disillusioned with the company's tarnished image and diminishing 
influence on Wall Street. While Drexel was once the most prominent firm in the 
specialized arena of high-yield debt financing, it had been losing customers 
and market share in recent years. IDD Information Services, for example, said 
Drexel's share of the junk bond market fell to 38.7% in 1989 from 55.2% in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been coming out of Drexel in waves over the past year, but right 
now it is a tidal wave," Sutro's Greif said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Drexel employees are also grappling with a number of other 
unanswered questions, including what will happen to their deferred compensation 
and pension plans. Normally, pension plans would not be affected by a 
bankruptcy, said Richard M. Neiter, senior attorney at Stutman, Triester &amp; 
Glatt in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
However, deferred compensation is another matter. Employees are typically 
second to be paid off in a bankruptcy, only after payments to bankruptcy 
administrators. However, their high-priority claim only applies to $2,000 in 
wages, salaries and commissions. Those owed more than that become unsecured 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, many employees had been persuaded to take Drexel stock in lieu of cash 
compensation, and these people are likely to lose the bulk -- if not all -- of 
their investment.

DRUG-USERS OF THE '60S AND EARLY '70S STRUGGLE TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN AVOID THE 
SAME PROBLEMS

Allan, 42, who smoked dope almost daily in the late '60s, is now a businessman 
and father. His son is 13 -- and may soon face the temptations Allan couldn't 
resist. 
</P>
<P>
"I've given it a lot of thought," said Allan, a San Fernando Valley resident, 
"and I haven't figured out what I'll tell him. I'll have to say something." 
</P>
<P>
What should Allan say? Should he admit his experiences, possibly damaging his 
credibility if his son decides to try drugs? Or should he lie? 
</P>
<P>
No answer applies to every situation; circumstances vary from family to family. 
But one thing's for sure: As the generation of drug users in the late '60s and 
early '70s approaches middle age, they find themselves on the other side, the 
inside of the once-dreaded Establishment. And now their teen-agers must 
confront the drug battle. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers of people who took drugs and now have teen-age kids are growing 
all the time," said Jerry Bachman, program director of the University of 
Michigan's Institute of Social Research. "And they'll continue to grow." 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1988 survey conducted by the National Institute of Drug Abuse in 
Washington, about 45 million Americans over the age of 26 have smoked 
marijuana; about 14 million have used cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
And while, in an institute survey released this week, the proportion of high 
school seniors who said they used drugs in the last year dropped to 35.4% -- 
the lowest figure since the survey began in 1975 -- the percentage of students 
who said cocaine would be "fairly easy" or "very easy" to obtain climbed to 
58.7%, an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
David Robb, an assistant to William Bennett, President Bush's drug czar, said 
that how parents discuss their past drug habits may determine if their children 
eventually experiment or at least admit their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God not everyone's parents went to Berkeley," Robb said. 
</P>
<P>
For months, Dick Callahan's daughter, Megan, 17, had been staying up late, 
oversleeping, missing school and acting erratically. He figured she was 
drinking or maybe taking speed. He knew the symptoms well. 
</P>
<P>
One night, when she was high on marijuana, they talked. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe, I thought, if I told her about my experiences," said Callahan, 42, of 
Tujunga, "I could get her to cop her story." 
</P>
<P>
Callahan's strategy is common -- tell the truth and hope your kids will be 
honest with you.

<P>
Nancy -- not her real name -- recently discussed drugs for the first time with 
her 13-year-old daughter. She admitted that she smoked marijuana in college. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I wanted to show her it wasn't beyond my understanding of reality," 
Nancy said. "I wanted to show her I wouldn't judge her, that she could tell me 
things." 
</P>
<P>
The line between being honest and too honest is fine. 
</P>
<P>
Specific details -- how much, how often -- could send the wrong message, 
especially when schools teach that drugs are detrimental to physical and mental 
health. Soon after the talk with her daughter, Nancy began to worry that she 
had revealed too much, that maybe it "wasn't a real parent thing to do. I 
thought maybe it came out sounding like drugs are OK." 
</P>
<P>
And Nancy's husband, Larry -- not his real name -- doesn't think he'll tell his 
daughter the whole truth. He loved dope. 
</P>
<P>
"There's such a potential for abuse that it frightens me," Larry said. "I'm her 
father, not her pal." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Herb, who smoked marijuana every day for 10 years, held nothing 
back from his three teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"If you leave anything out, it'll come back at you at some later point," said 
Herb of North Hollywood. "If I said I didn't enjoy it, they'd wonder why I 
smoked so much." 
</P>
<P>
Herb, who is in the music business, also told them that he was paying the price 
for his drug experiences. "I could've been an achiever if I hadn't done drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Many psychologists prefer Herb's approach: Tell your kids the extent of your 
drug involvement, both positive and negative, hoping that on the balance, the 
adolescents will be dissuaded from experimenting. 
</P>
<P>
"If their confession is consistent with the open dialogue that has gone on 
between parent and child," said Howard Levitt, president of Counseling West in 
Woodland Hills, a family counseling center, "it's OK to say that you used 
drugs. It's a sign of respect between parent and child. It may help the child 
open up." 
</P>
<P>
But, Levitt said, if parent and teen-ager don't communicate well, "it may be 
better in some cases to lie because it would be hard for the child to take what 
the parent is saying in the spirit it was intended." 
</P>
<P>
And, if a parent is open, the teen-ager may cry "hypocrite" when there is an 
attempt to crack down on drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Vicky Townsend, 40, of North Hollywood used to get high in front of her 
children. Living with an alcoholic husband, Townsend saw dope as a daily 
escape. A joint, and she could handle anything. "We used to laugh and call it 
'Turkish Tobacco,' " Townsend said. "I didn't think it would have any effect on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Years later, her teen-age daughter Jessica started using drugs and didn't stop. 
Townsend was furious. She ordered Jessica to get rid of the grass. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Who are you to say this is wrong?' " said Jessica, 17. "This was my 
thing and I enjoyed doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Herb fears getting the same response from his 23-year-old son, who has used and 
may still be using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I get that sinking feeling when I talk to him about drugs," he said, "that 
he's thinking, 'How can you even suggest anything when you were a daily user?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Some parents staunchly differentiate between their drug use, in the 1960s, and 
that of their children. Back then, they say, drugs were taken in communal 
spirit, as a moral and political rebellion against society. Everything was open 
to experiment, to discovery. And, unlike today, nobody knew about the long-term 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the pre-Manson era," Nancy said. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists don't accept the distinction. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a cop-out," said Loree Cohen, a psychotherapist who counsels families 
with drug problems. "The motivation might have been different, but were there 
any less addicts? Any less deaths? The results were the same." 
</P>
<P>
Marlene Nadel, 41, can't dismiss her drug use as 1960s experimentation. She was 
an addict. For years, she took LSD, speed, opium, hashish -- and almost died 
from several overdoses. 
</P>
<P>
Nadel eventually sought help, and now works with others at Cri-Help, a North 
Hollywood drug treatment center. Her 15-year-old daughter, Sidra, has smoked 
her share of dope and, last year, checked into Renew Life Adolescent chemical 
dependency program at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Nadel shared her past with her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been ashamed to tell her," said Nadel, whose ex-husband, Jack 
Bernstein, was also a heavy user. "Because there are a lot of drugs that she 
has not tried, and I want to educate her totally." 
</P>
<P>
Sidra said such honest warnings didn't make much difference. She was convinced 
that she would not become addicted like her parents. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard it from them, I just blew it off," Sidra said. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan's daughter, Megan, also received treatment at St. Joseph and didn't 
find much relevance in her parents' drug admissions. Last year, her mother, 
Ginny, tried to scare her by telling a story of how she thought she was dying 
when she experimented with grass about 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Megan found the story amusing. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was so hysterical," said Megan, laughing. "I couldn't see my 
mom stoned. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's anything they could have said to change my mind," Megan 
said of her drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists and drug counselors agree that in many cases nothing a parent 
says can stop a teen-ager from trying drugs. "There are no guarantees," said 
Barbara Swenson, director of training at Counseling West. "You can't follow 
them to the party." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most parents can hope to accomplish by admitting past drug 
involvement, Swenson said, is to create an atmosphere where the teen-ager feels 
less need to rebel. 
</P>
<P>
And parents who have taken drugs are better able to spot the signs of drug use 
in their kids. Callahan knew his daughter was on something. Herb noticed his 
son "had that certain look." 
</P>
<P>
Past generations didn't have this perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't look us in the eye and see that we were using," said Loren, 37, 
of Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Loren's wife, Donna, remembers she was so high once, she parked her car in the 
middle of the street in front of her house. Her mom was angry. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her I had to vomit," Donna said, "and she believed me." 
</P>
<P>
Allan knows he can't postpone his discussion about drugs forever. His son is 
rapidly maturing, and the peer pressures aren't going to disappear. Allan 
acknowledges his confession, depending on its extent, might give his son 
conflicting messages. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a point," Allan said, "where I can tell him what I did. It's 
going to be difficult." 
</P>

THE KINDER DISCOVER THE SOLACE OF KINSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN JALON, Allan Jalon, a Los Angeles-area writer, is working on a 
biographical essay on the German rabbi Joachim Prinz. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anne Steinberg drove from Laguna Hills to the Fairfax District to see a 
documentary that captured painful images of her past. 
</P>
<P>
"Ach, why do they have to show so much of this stuff?" she muttered, stiffly 
turning away. She glanced back, then flinched again. The screen showed Nazis in 
1938, on the eve of the Holocaust, smashing Jewish shops, gutting synagogues, 
dragging people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg shared these memories recently with about 60 others at the Westside 
Jewish Community Center on Olympic Boulevard, at the first reunion of Los 
Angeles-area Kinder -- the children saved by the British from Hitler's camps in 
a legendary, last-minute exodus called the Kindertransport. 
</P>
<P>
While other nations (including the United States) were protesting through 
diplomatic channels or ignoring the unfolding horror in Nazi Germany 
altogether, the British government swung into action in late 1938. Between 
December, 1938, and the start of World War II the following September, about 
10,000 children, 80% of them Jewish, were brought to England from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
There was little formal ceremony about the reunion, just coffee, refreshments 
and earnest conversation among people who had shared an intense experience, 
however painful. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Why am I alive and the others not?' is the difficult question you ask 
yourself all the time," said Fay Shaw, who watched the film with a sad, knowing 
expression. "I think this question to myself every day." 
</P>
<P>
Her searching expression dissolved into a shrug: "There is no answer. There is 
guilt. There is pain in the memory. But still, you remember." 
</P>
<P>
"This is remarkable, to look across a table and see someone else has survived 
from a whole time of your life that is gone," added Paula Balkin, who had come 
up from San Diego. She and Shaw, both from Leipzig, knew each other as children 
and met again last year in London at a worldwide reunion of the Kinder 
(pronounced Kin-der), which provided the impetus for subsequent local 
gatherings such as Monday's. 
</P>
<P>
Times with fellow survivors, said Balkin, are a solace, offering "a feeling of 
belonging you do not get with others." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly all of them, the exodus experience was identical except for minor 
details: After being chosen through a chain of British and Jewish welfare 
agencies, the unaccompanied children were put on trains with nothing but a 
backpack or a suitcase. The trip to the German border was a nervous one: Would 
the Nazis interfere? One father rode with his daughter to the border, to make 
sure she was safe, and jumped off. She remembered him waving. The trains, from 
Vienna, Frankfurt, Cologne and other cities, went to ports in France and the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the boat to England, when the reality, and the homesickness, set 
in for many. In England, the children were lodged in various temporary camps, 
later with Jewish and Gentile foster families. 
</P>
<P>
Balkin was among several people who said they are only now starting to face 
memories long locked away. "My husband has woken me from nightmares many 
nights," she said. "My children have woken me from nightmares. But I did not 
talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
The awful dreams she and others described were of last embraces, trains forever 
pulling away. In their sleep, they search through concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
After reaching England, where few spoke the language, they clung to letters and 
postcards from home that one day just stopped coming. Said Shaw, who escaped 
with a sister: "My mother wrote only about my sister and I. 'Do not worry about 
us,' (she wrote). She did not think about herself." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, whose maiden name was Mendzigursky, never again saw her mother or a 
second sister who stayed behind. She learned after the war that they had frozen 
to death on trains going to the Riga concentration camp. Her father managed to 
escape from a camp and joined her in England. 
</P>
<P>
The full story for those present at the reunion began when Hitler came to power 
in 1933. Between 1933 and 1938, a succession of laws and decrees deprived Jews 
of citizenship and eventually turned them literally into outlaws. Children had 
to stay away from school. They heard whispered conversations of worried parents 
who had lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some families could not, or would not, fully grasp Hitler's purpose 
until the explosive anti-Semitic violence of Nov. 9 and 10, 1938 -- 
Kristallnacht. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched it from my bedroom window," Balkin said. "The synagogue was right 
down the street from our house and I saw it going up in flames. I saw our 
neighbors being taken out of their homes and beaten." 
</P>
<P>
After Kristallnacht, German Jews became frantic. They placed ads in The Times 
of London pleading with the English to take their children. They wrote to 
distant relatives in England or America. On Nov. 21, the British House of 
Commons spent 3 1/2 hours debating the problems faced by German Jewry. The Home 
Office agreed to skip the formalities of passports and visas for shipments of 
children. The first group arrived on Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Balkin, whose maiden name is Grunbaum, had an uncle who became active in the 
effort to evacuate children and made sure that those from his family got to go. 
</P>
<P>
Her parents and the uncle crossed Europe in search of safety. Nazis caught her 
parents in Greece, the uncle in Budapest. "She wrote thousands of letters 
trying to find them," said her American-born husband, Sam. "To rabbis, to the 
Red Cross." 
</P>
<P>
"My father died in Auschwitz," Balkin said, her large blue eyes unblinking. 
"Just a few weeks before the end of the war."

A FABULOUS HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: FROM SPECIAL STAGING TO ACOUSTICS, THE AMBASSADOR AUDITORIUM IN PASADENA 
FILLS EVERY NEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stage looks warm and intimate, with russet wood walls and a piano gleaming 
in a pool of light. In 45 minutes, veteran concert pianist Eugene Istomin will 
walk to the piano and fill the Ambassador Auditorium with nimble-fingered 
trills and runs in a program of Beethoven, Schubert and Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Morris, performance stage manager, gives stage and empty seats a critical 
once-over. "After the concert, this will all be just an empty, hollow space," 
he said. "I'm always amazed at it." 
</P>
<P>
From the outside, the Ambassador in Pasadena is the Rock of Gibraltar of 
concert halls. Columns, square cornices and a flat half-acre of a roof give it 
a solid, monumental look. But inside the hall, the Ambassador can be as 
changeable as an itinerant swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
In minutes, acoustic panels can be tucked away, banks of curtains hauled into 
place, batteries of spotlights switched on or off, rows of seats added or 
subtracted. 
</P>
<P>
Administering a major concert hall such as the Ambassador, which began a 
cultural boom in Pasadena when it opened in 1974, is a theatrical roller 
coaster. Few handle the curves as well as the Ambassador staff, visiting 
artists have said. 
</P>
<P>
"A fabulous hall, the best that money can buy," flamboyant Yugoslav pianist Ivo 
Pogorelich told an interviewer, "and there's a lot of money in Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
There are 100 or more events in the hall's nine-month season. Piano soloists 
give way to jazz bands, chamber orchestras follow on the heels of pop singers. 
Each event has its own peculiar staging requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Take the hall's convertible acoustics. The crisp, brilliant sound that the 
Ambassador's house staff has programmed for Istomin's lyrical piano pieces 
won't work for the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra, the big band scheduled to 
play in the hall the next evening. 
</P>
<P>
"With all of that sound bouncing around the room, it would start coming back to 
the microphones," said Peter Eddington, the Ambassador's technical and lighting 
supervisor. "After a while, it starts sounding like you're in a toilet bowl." 
</P>
<P>
To "deaden" to sound, the Ambassador staff will fold away the teak sidewalls, 
remove the gold-leaf-covered acoustical panels (the "gold clouds") that hang 
above the piano and swath the stage in black curtains. 
</P>
<P>
"With the piano, the hall approaches about two seconds of reverberation time," 
Eddington said. "For a big band, you want to get below one second." 
</P>
<P>
Every Monday morning, the house staff gets together in the orchestra of the 
1,262-seat hall to work out technical requirements for the week's events. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's events began with an opera-in-concert on Monday, complete with 
orchestra, chorus and soloists. That was followed by the Istomin recital on 
Wednesday and the jazz concert on Thursday. The cycle ends tonight with a 
performance by Mummenschanz, the Swiss mime, dance and puppetry troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Each event requires radical restructuring of the Ambassador stage. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, lighting technicians tinker with some spotlights as 
Istomin, a studious-looking man in wire-rimmed glasses, rehearses a Beethoven 
sonata, his fingers ruminatively exploring a dense adagio passage. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for the concert pianist, Istomin said, is conveying a 
19th-Century composer's intent while performing in a 20th-Century concert hall. 
"All of these pieces were written to be played in a place which was about 
one-quarter the size of this hall," Istomin said. "There are subtleties -- 
perfumes -- that can only be communicated through a kind of stage whisper." 
</P>
<P>
Eddington is gratified to hear Istomin talking about music instead of staging. 
"When he walks onto the stage," Eddington said, "there should be nothing to 
worry about as far as the facility or the crew are concerned. He should only 
worry about the piece of music." 
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador is run by the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation, an 
arm of the Worldwide Church of God. Ambassador College, on whose elegant 
Pasadena campus the concert hall sits, is another arm of the church. The church 
plans to relocate the college later this year to another facility in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no way that the church would give up this gem, church officials 
say. In just 16 years of operation, the hall brims with musical lore. Here's 
the backstage elevator that was installed ahead of schedule so that Italian 
tenor Luciano Pavarotti wouldn't have to climb the 28 stairs from dressing room 
to stage level. "He said that climbing the stairs would interrupt his breathing 
patterns," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
An electric eye was subsequently installed in the elevator so Mstislav 
Rostropovich wouldn't worry that his cello would be smashed by the closing 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Here and there are some extraordinary features of the edifice itself, including 
its pinkish lobby walls, from basement to balcony, which used up Turkey's 
entire export quota of rose onyx for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Even that much wasn't quite enough," Snyder said, pointing to a single 
six-foot panel of grayish marble at the balcony level. 
</P>
<P>
By early evening, the recital shell is in place and lights are set for the 
performance. Istomin arrives, tense and unsmiling in a black tuxedo. He tells 
technicians not to turn on the "bow lights" when he walks on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want any spots on me, none of that show biz stuff," said Istomin, who 
has been performing since 1943. "Make it boring. The glamour should take place 
in the sound." 
</P>
<P>
A warmly appreciative audience, marveling at Istomin's light-fingered facility 
at the keyboard, applauds enthusiastically and demands two encores. As audience 
members trickle away into the night, Morris and three assistants begin to strip 
the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The teak walls, folded up into five panels, are winched toward the ceiling, 60 
feet above the stage. There's a loft full of catwalks and folded equipment up 
there -- a dark, cavernous space hidden from the audience by slatted ceiling 
panels -- that is almost as big as the performance hall itself. 
</P>
<P>
The golden clouds are lowered to the stage, turned on their sides and hauled 
up; the same with banks of lights. Each piece of movable equipment is 
counterbalanced with lead weights, so that stage assistants can move them up or 
down just by pulling on ropes. 
</P>
<P>
In just 41 minutes, the four men have stripped the stage. The next day, rows of 
black curtains would be lowered into place, putting the stage into what is 
called a "theater black" mode, and risers and microphones would be installed 
for the jazz band. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, the stage is just a forlorn, empty space, waiting for technology 
and magic to convert it into a place where musicians can somehow be intimate 
with a crowd of more than 1,200 strangers.

TESTS PROVIDE NO MAP IN HUNT FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, Gray is a regular contributor to Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents interested in private school education are asking for test scores to 
help them compare schools, but even though the scores exist, they're coming up 
empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
And now that the Los Angeles Unified School District has decided to move to 
year-round schools, the demand for private education is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents are panicking," said Steve Bogad, headmaster of the Valley Beth Shalom 
Day School in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep getting calls from parents asking how we rank schools," said Mimi Baer, 
executive director of the California Assn. of Private Schools in Los Angeles. 
"Parents want objective criteria because it's easier, I guess, than going out 
to many schools and really looking." 
</P>
<P>
But nearly all private schools refuse to release test scores. Why the 
hesitation? Can parents evaluate a school's academic excellence by just 
looking? 
</P>
<P>
Tests are just a snapshot of a school, not a video, said Baer, echoing the 
comments of many of the directors and principals at private schools in the San 
Fernando Valley. Tests can be flawed, skewed and deceiving, they say. Don't 
focus on the scores; look instead at the total program the school provides. 
</P>
<P>
But the California Achievement Program (CAP) scores for the state's public 
schools are published annually, and many parents say they find those test 
results useful in understanding the student population at a given school. Even 
real estate agents track the public school scores and use them as potent bait 
in attracting prospective buyers to certain neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
But just because parents -- and real estate agents -- are interested in school 
test scores doesn't mean they are valid indicators of a school's performance, 
said Margo Long, principal of the elementary campus of the Oakwood School in 
North Hollywood. Oakwood will not release its school's Educational Records 
Bureau (ERB) standardized achievement test scores to the public, but does 
review each enrolled child's score with parents. 
</P>
<P>
The California Assn. of Private Schools requires member schools to administer 
achievement tests every two years, and many give them yearly. 
</P>
<P>
"Our students outperform the national norm on the test," Long said, "but here 
we treat the test as just another factor." Long said prospective parents 
frequently ask about test scores, and she tells them the scores depend on the 
individual child. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any independent school that releases a norm test score 
statistic to parents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Archdiocese of Los Angeles doesn't release its schools' test scores either. 
According to Sister Claire Patrice Fitzgerald, elementary school supervisor, 
the archdiocese uses the Stanford Achievement Test annually to evaluate 
students in grades one through seven, with optional testing in the eighth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose in testing is to evaluate individual progress annually," Sister 
Claire Patrice said, "and besides, the populations differ and change very 
quickly within a school." She said the archdiocese's schools rank, on average, 
in the 50th percentile or higher. She said she understands why parents want to 
know the schools' test scores: "It's the only measurable thing they have and, 
of course, they want the school environment to be challenging." 
</P>
<P>
Valley Beth Shalom Day School, like other members of the California Assn. of 
Independent Schools, gives the ERB achievement test. Headmaster Bogad said he 
often has to explain to parents why they cannot compare his school's scores to 
the public schools' CAP tests, to the California Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) or 
to scores from other private schools. 
</P>
<P>
While Bogad refuses to say how well his school does on the ERB and does not 
give this information to prospective parents, he said the school sends home 
each child's test results and discusses them in detail with the child's 
parents. Because the school only admits children it considers average or above, 
he said, his students "would top out the CTBS. The ERB has a higher top than 
the CTBS." The ERB is a more sensitive measure of students performing at the 
higher end of the spectrum, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the California Assn. of Independent Schools said the association 
does not recommend that schools refuse to release school test score 
information. 
</P>
<P>
It's not educationally sound to release the scores because it puts too much 
emphasis on the tests, Bogad said. 
</P>
<P>
"A child takes a test on one particular day," he said. "In elementary schools, 
placing a lot of emphasis on test scores is the wrong thing to do; it's 
misleading." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason many independent schools don't release their test scores, Bogad 
said, is that "we don't want parents choosing our schools based on test scores. 
We want people to choose us, to embrace us, based on our distinct philosophies. 
We want parents at our school who believe in what our school stands for." 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Beth Shalom Day School's test scores, said Bogad, are lower than 
some other independent schools in the community. 
</P>
<P>
He said his scores will be significantly lower than the Buckley School's in 
Sherman Oaks because Valley Beth Shalom accepts a more diverse student body. 
"But," he said, "my parents know this. My board knows this." 
</P>
<P>
Long said many independent schools use test scores as criteria for admission, 
creating from the start a student body that will tend to score well on the same 
sort of tests that got them into the school in the first place. And, she said, 
some children as young as 4 or 5 squeal with delight as they take an admission 
exam, thrilled that they know the answers because they've taken the same test 
before, sometimes several times. 
</P>
<P>
"They are test-wise at 4," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Jim Ferrell, professor of educational psychology at Cal State Northridge, 
said he doesn't think that disclosing a school's test results is a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a general indicator of how all the children in the school are 
performing against a norm, and such test scores are helpful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that test scores need to be looked at in addition to other information 
about a school, such as the campus climate, outside programs and 
extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
Parents interested in a school's academic standing, said Long, should look at 
the percentage of its graduates who go onto college. "At most independent 
schools, it's 99%," she said, "as compared to a public school where you're 
lucky if it reaches 33%." 
</P>
<P>
She also suggests that parents evaluate a school's reputation in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrell said that assuming a test is administered in the standard fashion and 
that none of the students have been coached, it is valid. Validity, which 
assesses how closely a child's test performance compares with his or her 
classroom achievement as measured by grades, varies somewhat between tests. The 
best tests, he said, measure about one-third of whatever is being taught by a 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"So there is an awful lot of information that can't be reflected in the tests," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also warned that tests like the ERB, which is compared to a national norm, 
have to be far more general than state tests because they will be taken by 
children all across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Bogad said he uses the ERB test to make decisions about the school's 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"If we, let's say, get low test scores in fractions, we can decide whether we 
will put up with that because we know we'll be teaching that material next 
year, in the next grade, or we will change the curriculum," he said. "But we 
don't let the tests dictate what we'll teach." 
</P>
<P>
But as schools -- from preschool to college -- become increasingly competitive, 
educators say it's only natural that parents are interested in the hard data as 
they make tough and costly choices about where to send their children. Some 
parents say they're just curious. Others think the information is more critical 
to their choice of schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to hoodwink anybody," said Bogad. "We want an informed 
populace making decisions based on reality." 
</P>
<P>
THE RIGHT SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
Parents investigating private schools should consider the following tips: 
</P>
<P>
* Ask about the school's philosophy and make sure it fits with your own. 
</P>
<P>
* Find out -- if you can -- how the students typically score on the achievement 
test used by the school, i.e. 50th percentile, 90th percentile. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask which secondary schools or colleges the school's graduates attend. 
</P>
<P>
* Visit the school and assess the campus climate, the relationship between 
students and teachers, the student-teacher ratio and the value placed upon 
parent involvement in school programs and decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
* Assess the number and availability of extracurricular activities at the 
school, such as music, drama and sports.

EX-BYRD TAKES OFF WITH RETURN TO COUNTRY ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time this year, an ex-Byrd is coming to town. In January, 
drummer Michael Clarke appeared at Winston's Beach Club in Ocean Beach; 
tonight, bassist-singer Chris Hillman will be at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The two charter members of the seminal 1960s folk-rock group, however, are 
flying in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke is touring with a crude bar band he has the audacity to call the Byrds 
and limping through such vintage hits as "Mr. Tambourine Man," "Turn! Turn! 
Turn!" and "Eight Miles High." 
</P>
<P>
Hillman, meanwhile, is touring with the Desert Rose Band, which in the last 
three years has scored six No. 1 singles on the national country charts and in 
1989 was named Band of the Year by the Academy of Country Music. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman said he can't fathom what it would be like, trading places with Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
"I could never say 'There but for the grace of God go I,' in regard to doing 
the nostalgia thing," he said. "I'd sooner go back to college or go into some 
sort of other business. You can't live in the past forever; you have to go out 
there and jump into the shark tank, go out and try things. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also a matter of conscience. When I was in the Byrds, my role -- and 
everyone else's role -- was to enhance Roger McGuinn. It was Roger's band, 
Roger's songs. 
</P>
<P>
"So I can't go up there and sing 'Mr. Tambourine Man.' I don't have the right. 
I have to forge my own identity, and that's why I feel so sorry for Michael." 
</P>
<P>
That Hillman is forging his own identity in country music isn't surprising. 
He's always been a country boy at heart. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Los Angeles, Hillman and his family moved to San Diego County in 1948, 
when he was four. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in Rancho Santa Fe and Del Mar, a very happy, well-adjusted, 
middle-class white kid who fell madly in love with hillbilly music while in 
high school," Hillman recalled. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from San Dieguito High School in 1962, Hillman launched his 
musical career in a long-gone Mission Beach nightclub called the Blue Guitar, 
playing mandolin with the bluegrass-oriented Scottsville Squirrel Barkers. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, he moved to Los Angeles and played with several country bands -- 
including the Hillmen, the Green Grass Group, and the Golden State Boys -- 
before switching to bass and teaming up with McGuinn, Clarke, David Crosby, and 
Gene Clark to form the Byrds. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman was primarily responsible for the Byrds' gradual shift from folk rock 
to country rock. In early 1968, he recruited studio players for the countryish 
"The Notorious Byrd Brothers" album. Later that year, he and newcomer Gram 
Parsons urged the band to cut a full-fledged country album, "Sweetheart of the 
Rodeo." 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, Hillman and Parsons left the Byrds to continue their country 
experiments with the Flying Burrito Brothers. Three years later, Hillman 
dropped out and spent the rest of the decade playing with various other 
country-rock outfits, including Stephen Stills' Manassas and the 
Souther-Hillman-Furay Band. 
</P>
<P>
He subsequently cut two albums with fellow ex-Byrds McGuinn and Clark, but the 
old magic, he recalled, simply wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost like a second job," Hillman said. "We made a lot of money, but 
it just wasn't very creative or rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
So in 1981, Hillman went solo, recording three albums of acoustic country music 
and performing in honky-tonks and at bluegrass festivals throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"I went back to square one," he said. "I redefined what I was doing, learned 
what I do best, and got better as a singer and as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, it was the greatest thing in the world I could have done. I was 
out there on my own -- without a wall of sound, without other people to bounce 
the spotlight on -- and I realized that I was most comfortable doing country 
music, which I had started out doing." 
</P>
<P>
The Desert Rose Band, Hillman said, was a natural progression. 
</P>
<P>
"It just came about sheerly by accident," he recalled. "In 1985, I was touring 
with my own acoustic quartet, opening for Dan Fogelberg, and I had no intention 
of putting another electric band together. 
</P>
<P>
"But when we got off the tour in the summer of 1985, I had a lot of songs that 
I had written, and my guitarist, John Jorgenson, was pressuring me, 'Why don't 
we go electric? Why don't we get a pedal-steel player?' So it just seemed like 
a natural place to go." 
</P>
<P>
This acoustic quartet of Hillman, Jorgenson, guitarist Herb Pedersen, and 
bassist Bill Bryson became the nucleus of the Desert Rose Band, whose other 
members are pedal-steel guitarist Jay Dee Maness and drummer Steve Duncan.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: CONNORS, HENDERSON TAKE A DETOUR BACK 
TO JAZZ ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Drummer Norman Connors and singer/bassist Michael Henderson did some of their 
most important work as pioneers of electric jazz/rock/funk fusion in the '70s. 
But in the '80s, they found success as purveyors of the music known in the 
industry as "quiet storm," the soft, romantic R&amp;B of singers like Whitney 
Houston, Anita Baker and Luther Vandross. 
</P>
<P>
This Sunday, Connors and Henderson bring their bands to Smokey's in Mission 
Valley for shows at 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Lest jazz fans think there's 
nothing in it for them, Connors said the live dates are much different than his 
honey-dripping self-produced albums. 
</P>
<P>
"My direction is jazz, similar to Quincy (Jones)," he said. "I come from a jazz 
background, I studied jazz and classical music. We always play some jazz. I 
always start off the show doing Coltrane's 'Naima,' Miles (Davis), Herbie 
(Hancock). Then, when the singers come out, we play our vocal hits." 
</P>
<P>
Connors' pre-fusion jazz work was on the edge. He worked with Archie Shepp, 
Jack McDuff, Jackie McLean, Sam Rivers and Charles Erler before joining Pharoah 
Sanders' group in 1971. His pioneering fusion album was the 1972 "Dance of 
Magic" with Hancock, Stanley Clarke, Ron Carter, Hubert Laws, Gary Bartz, 
Airto, Ron Carter and Hubert Laws. 
</P>
<P>
Although his last album, "Passion," includes several of the pulsing, romantic 
ballads that have brought him commercial success, there are also tunes like the 
title track, in which Marion Meadows' electrified, Contrane-like soprano sax is 
layered over dreamy, funk rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Connors has always had great singers in his groups. His current band features 
Spencer Harrison, a baritone with a voice Connors described as "somewhere 
between Peabo Bryson and Jeffrey Osborne," and Gabrielle Goodman, a former 
backup singer for Roberta Flack whose early training was in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and Connors made their last album together -- "You Are My Starship" 
-- in 1977. It went platinum. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Henderson's most intense jazz training came during his seven years with 
Miles Davis. Henderson grew up with the gritty sounds of Detroit, and by the 
mid-'60s, was one of the top session players during the "Golden Era" at Motown 
Records. He has toured with Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin, and played with 
Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, the Supremes and the Four Tops. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and Connors' best known hit together was their recording of 
Henderson's song "Valentine Love." 
</P>
<P>
How will the evening unfold? 
</P>
<P>
"Michael's group will play, then I'll play. At the end, we'll all get together, 
like a gumbo soup," Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans most often hear Ron Satterfield as half of the successful local 
band Checkfield, whose music has become a mainstay of light jazz and adult 
contemporary radio. But Satterfield is also an accomplished straight-ahead jazz 
man, as he'll be proving Sunday and Monday nights through March 26 at the 
Marine Room in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Satterfield and top local flutist Holly Hofmann are using a variety of 
material, including Hofmann's compositions, lots of Antonio Carlos Jobim and 
several Frank Sinatra songs. 
</P>
<P>
Satterfield plays several instruments, but for these dates, he's bringing only 
his guitar and voice. 
</P>
<P>
Checkfield's new album, "A View from the Edge," featuring Satterfield and 
partner John Archer, is due out March 1. Hofmann's next, titled "Further 
Adventures," and using Mike Wofford on piano, Sherman Ferguson on drums and Bob 
Magnusson on bass, is also due in March. 
</P>
<P>
Last time he was here, temperamental sax man Gato Barbieri blitzed the 
Bacchanal with a set that leaned too heavy on ear-shredding volume, too light 
on musicianship. Barbieri, who played free jazz with Don Cherry before finding 
a more Latin sound, appears once again at the Bacchanal this Friday night. 
Depending on how he reacts to the idea, Barbieri may be joined on stage not 
only by his band, but by the Japanese artist Rocco, who is visiting San Diego 
and who often paints large, spontaneous murals to the accompaniment of live 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
For Grammy night next Wednesday, the Catamaran Resort Hotel's Cannibal Bar will 
present the awards program on a large screen television, with local jazz man 
Hollis Gentry interjecting some live music. The Catamaran has been hit hard by 
last year's demise of KSWV-FM (102.9), "The Wave." The club had been drawing 
crowds of up to 300 for its regular jazz nights hosted by KSWV deejay Art Good, 
promoted heavily on "The Wave." Good is back hosting the occasional "Jazz Trax" 
nights with his former employer, KIFM (98.1), and business is much slower, 
according to Catamaran general manager George Harrington. The Catamaran 
originally left KIFM's "Lites Out" jazz club circuit to become the only club 
with a regular jazz night promoted by KSWV. With KIFM again, the Catamaran 
can't get its old Wednesday night "Lites Out" slot back -- it was given to the 
Del Mar Hilton. Harrington is crossing his fingers that the Hilton will "go 
away" so he can officially rejoin the "Lites Out" circuit, with its 
commensurate crowd-drawing radio promos. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Mark your calendar now for Elario's list of coming jazz heavies: Feb. 
21-25, Red Rodney; Feb. 28 to March 11, Scott Hamilton and Dave McKenna; March 
28 to April 8, Art Farmer; April 11 to 15, Harry (Sweets) Edison; April 18 to 
May 6, Papa John Creach; May 9-13, Charlie Haden's Quartet West, featuring 
Ernie Watts; May 16-20, Freddie Hubbard; June 6-10, David (Fathead) Newman; 
June 13-17, James Moody; June 27 to July 1, Anita O'Day. It'll be the first

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN GABRIEL; 
</P>
<P>
ZONE CHANGE FOR THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Progress toward construction of a 2,100-seat multiscreen theater at the 
southwest corner of Arroyo Parkway and Green Street advanced Tuesday with a 
zoning change that provides less-stringent parking and design requirements for 
the $8.89-million project. 
</P>
<P>
Under the change approved by the Board of Directors, the Arroyo Cinema Plaza 
Project will provide 420 parking spaces instead of 559 and will be subject to 
design review under Old Pasadena district guidelines instead of the more 
specific Downtown Pasadena district guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Director Rick Cole cast the lone vote against the zoning change, saying 
developer George Krikorian will no longer be required to provide parking for an 
estimated 100 employees who will hold jobs in the structure, "I think the 
record should be clear," Cole said. "Break after break after break has been 
accorded to Mr. Krikorian in order to make this innovative project work." 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for a five-story, 79,510-square-foot complex that will include an 
11-screen theater, 8,214 square feet of retail space, 24,379 square feet for 
offices and a 3,980-square-foot restaurant. Two years ago, the directors 
approved a $1.5-million loan to Krikorian to help his secure the land for the 
project.

NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO HISTORICAL AREA: FOCUS; 
</P>
<P>
LOS RIOS DISTRICT IS COUNTY'S HISTORICAL SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES , Clipboard researched by Dallas M. Jackson and Janice L. 
Jones / Los Angeles Times; Graphics by Doris Shields / Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Steve and Olga Rios brought their newborn son home from the hospital 
recently, the tiny infant entered the warmth of the same San Juan Capistrano 
home where his ancestors have lived and died for more than 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
The couple and their four children occupy the historic Rios Adobe in a part of 
central San Juan Capistrano called the Los Rios District. The house was built 
in 1794 by Feliciano Rios, a soldier in the Spanish garrison that helped Father 
Junipero Serra found Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1776. 
</P>
<P>
Mission records show that Feliciano Rios married a Juaneno Indian woman in 
1793. Since then, their descendants have enjoyed a rich heritage centered 
around the adobe, which is the oldest home in California continually occupied 
by the same family. 
</P>
<P>
The adobe is also the focal point of some of San Juan Capistrano's most 
interesting lore. A trapdoor in the ceiling leads to an attic hiding place 
where Gregorio Rios is said to have hidden the famous bandit, Joaquin Murietta. 
</P>
<P>
A local spirit known as the White Lady has reportedly been sighted numerous 
times by San Juan Capistrano residents near a pepper tree in the Rioses' front 
yard. Descriptions have changed little since sightings began around the turn of 
the century. She is always described as youthful, with long black hair, wearing 
a white dress that ends in a swirling mist at her feet. Sometimes she is seen 
walking a black dog on a rawhide leash. 
</P>
<P>
Rios has never seen the White Lady, "but my sister, Juanita, has," he says. Nor 
has he disputed tales that his house is occupied by spirits. But he dislikes 
the term "haunted." 
</P>
<P>
"Since so many generations spent their lives here, it doesn't seem outrageous 
to me that the spirits of my ancestors could still be around. I'm not afraid of 
them. They're Rioses," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The quirky, shadowy Los Rios District is associated with other tales of lost 
and moaning ghosts, some of whom are said to lurk in Trabuco Creek, which runs 
just behind the district. But it is a peaceful place where quail can be heard 
rustling and peeping in the brush. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere gets livelier across the tracks and closer to the mission. Music 
spills out from the Swallows Inn Bar on Camino Capistrano nearly every night. 
The dance floor is full of cowboys and cowgirls in boots and Stetsons. But it 
is not unusual to find a row of Harley-Davidson motorcycles parked out front, 
their owners mingling inside with yuppies, hippies and tourists. Several of the 
honky-tonk's regulars appeared as extras when Clint Eastwood filmed bar scenes 
here for "Heartbreak Ridge" in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Swallows Inn is surrounded by restaurants and gift shops in older, brick 
storefronts. Newer developments, like the recently built Franciscan Plaza, have 
drawn criticism from those who say more effort must be made to preserve the 
city's historic ambience. 
</P>
<P>
However, the San Juan Capistrano Public Library, designed by architect Michael 
Graves, has drawn international attention and praise since its completion in 
1983. The building, located just outside the mission grounds, combines elements 
of Spanish Colonial, Roman and pre-Columbian design into a strikingly modern 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
But the dominant feature of central San Juan Capistrano is still the mission, 
often called the birthplace of Orange County. At dusk, its whitewashed dome and 
bell tower glint in a brown and rose landscape reminiscent of a Western 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
The landmarks are part of a larger replica of the mission's original church, 
which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1812. Ruins of the old stone church as 
well as the graves of several Indians killed in the collapse can be seen on the 
mission grounds. Bells salvaged from the ruins were later hung in a bell wall 
and still toll to announce the death of a parishioner. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere of the mission grounds is not that of a silent ruin. The newer 
church, dedicated in 1987, serves an active parish of more than 2,000. About 
356 students attend the Mission School (kindergarten through eighth grades), 
which was formed in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
Serra Chapel, however, is pervaded by solemnity. Constructed in 1778, it is the 
oldest church in California and the only remaining structure where Father Serra 
officiated. 
</P>
<P>
During a period of decline, the chapel was once used as living quarters and a 
storeroom. In fact, the entire mission complex fell into serious disrepair 
during the 1800s when the Mexican government seized control of the California 
missions from the Franciscans. 
</P>
<P>
Pio Pico, the last Mexican governor of California, put the San Juan Capistrano 
mission up for auction, and it was purchased by his brother-in-law, John 
Forster, and James McKinley for $710, according to mission archivist Charles 
Bodnar. 
</P>
<P>
The Forster family occupied several mission buildings but allowed a priest to 
live in Serra Chapel. But control of the missions was returned to the Catholic 
Church in a decree signed by President Abraham Lincoln shortly before his death 
in 1865. 
</P>
<P>
The mission was saved from total ruin by Father St. John O'Sullivan, who began 
extensive restoration in 1910. Archeological studies and stabilization efforts 
continue today at the mission, once the center of Orange County activity and 
now its historical soul.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN, 21, WINS SUIT IN 1979 MOLESTATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Lomita woman has won a $241,000 civil suit against a man who she 
alleged had molested her when she was 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court jury awarded Danielle Adam $141,000 in 
compensatory damages for pain and suffering and $100,000 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged that Fred Thrasher, 48, of Los Angeles, had molested her for 
two years, beginning in 1979, while living with her mother in the family home. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Allred, the attorney who filed the suit for Adam, said that her client 
had "experienced trauma so devastating that she attempted suicide three times." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Bencangey, attorney for the defendant, said "we will resist this judgment 
all the way." He said his client took "exhaustive psychological tests and 
interviews which showed that he was extremely normal and not an aggravated 
offender."

PROTEST OVER WAR TOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The battle against war toys on Wednesday moved to an auto wrecking company on 
East 92nd Street in Los Angeles, where thousands of play guns were crushed. 
</P>
<P>
The demolition, sponsored by the Los Angeles Alliance for Survival, was billed 
as a "teach love, not war" effort aimed at preaching that "war is not a game." 
</P>
<P>
Alliance members planned to gift-wrap a solid block formed by the crushed toys 
and send it to the Toy Manufacturers of America during the 21st annual Toy Fair 
now under way in New York City.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRST HOUSE DEMOLITION SINCE MORATORIUM OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday authorized the bulldozing of an 
abandoned home in South-Central Los Angeles in its first review of a proposed 
demolition since a 60-day moratorium was imposed on "Operation Knockdown." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores' emergency motion, requested by police and 
Building and Safety Department officials, was approved unanimously and will 
lead to the bulldozing Thursday morning of a vandalized home at 11560 S. Link 
St. 
</P>
<P>
Under Operation Knockdown, unsafe buildings that have become hangouts for drug 
dealers and gang members can be demolished. But in the wake of reports that the 
city has been overly aggressive and bulldozed more than 200 homes, the council 
on Jan. 30 ordered the moratorium to allow a review of the program.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WITNESSES TO FATAL FREEWAY ACCIDENT SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police sought public assistance Wednesday in investigating the death of a 
34-year-old motorist on the Harbor Freeway near downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The man was killed when an unknown object smashed through the windshield of his 
van and struck him in the forehead. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bruce Hagerty said investigators hope to determine whether John A. Raff of 
Los Angeles, a self-employed glass architect, was killed by something thrown 
from an overpass or struck by an object accidentally hurled up from the 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
Hagerty urged motorists and pedestrians who may have witnessed the incident, 
which occurred about 1:15 p.m. Tuesday near freeway overpasses at 23rd Street 
or Adams Boulevard, to call detectives at (213) 237-1733 or (213) 237-1774.

THE LAPD'S IDEA MAN; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICER'S LATEST GADGET IS DESIGNED TO PUT THE SQUEEZE ON CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Policeman Robert Mika figures the best way to make a pinch is with a pinch. 
</P>
<P>
Mika is a Los Angeles police officer who spends his spare time devising new 
gadgets to help cops put the squeeze on crooks. And that's exactly what his 
latest invention does. 
</P>
<P>
It is a tweezer-like device that officers can use to pluck demonstrating 
protesters out of doorways or to arrest belligerent suspects. 
</P>
<P>
When squeezed against a finger or earlobe, the tiny pincers produce instant 
pain that can bring the strongest man to his knees without causing permanent 
injury, Mika claims. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, it does it with a subtleness that is missing when officers whack 
at suspects with night sticks or twist controversial, menacing-looking martial 
arts weapons around their wrists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Image is important in police work," said Mika, a 16-year police veteran who 
patrols the streets of Van Nuys when he is not tinkering in a workshop in a 
spare bedroom at his Woodland Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want something that looks too militaristic or has high visibility. 
You don't want something that gives the image of overkill." 
</P>
<P>
To fellow officers, Mika is the Los Angeles Police Department's resident 
inventor. Hundreds of them use special gun holsters he has designed and 
stitched together. Others won't go on duty without tucking one of his special 
mirrors into their shirt pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials are evaluating the "Mika Come Along" -- the tweezer pincer 
that Mika sees as an alternative to clubs, electrical stun guns, chemical 
sprays and martial arts nunchakus sometimes used to subdue unruly suspects. 
</P>
<P>
A nunchaku is made of two foot-long lengths of hard plastic that are connected 
by 4 inches of nylon cord. In contrast, Mika's pencil-length tweezers can be 
discreetly held in the palm of the hand. 
</P>
<P>
If judged to be safe and effective, the tweezers could eventually win a place 
on police officers' belts alongside handcuffs and guns. 
</P>
<P>
Use of weapons and "pain compliance" equipment is a touchy issue for law 
enforcement officials -- particularly when television news footage shows police 
swinging batons or clamping neck holds on suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Some officers have been criticized for manhandling demonstrators and causing 
injuries in recent anti-abortion protests at which nunchakus were used. 
</P>
<P>
More than two dozen abortion protesters sued Los Angeles police last week, for 
example, claiming that they suffered broken arms and damaged nerves through 
officers' use of the weapons at a June 10 demonstration. Police have denied 
using unnecessary force to remove the Operation Rescue demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Mika, 37, came up with the pincer idea when he accidentally mashed his finger 
with a nutcracker last Thanksgiving while cracking walnuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I slipped, and it hurt," he said. "It got me to thinking that something that 
could be used in situations like those abortion protest demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
Mika assembled several prototype pincers in December and took them to the Van 
Nuys police station. 
</P>
<P>
At first, his fellow officers howled with laughter at his tiny aluminum 
tweezers. But the laughs quickly turned to cries of anguish when Mika grabbed 
their fingers to test his invention. 
</P>
<P>
"He clamped that thing on my pinky and there was immediate pain," said Officer 
Charles Valencia, one of Mika's guinea pigs. "He tried it on a lot of guys with 
the same result." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Valencia joked, "I unholster my weapon when I see him coming down the 
hall. You wonder what he's going to come up with next." 
</P>
<P>
Like many other Los Angeles police officers, Valencia carries his 
department-authorized backup gun in a "Mika Pocket Holster." It is a 
moisture-proof, plastic-reinforced nylon and Naugahyde holder that prevents 
guns from snagging on trouser pockets when they are drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Mika has stitched together more than 6,000 of the $9.50 holsters on a sewing 
machine at home and sold them by mail order. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 officers have ordered the "Mika Pocket Mirror." It is made of 
break-resistant plastic and has a fold-out handle that officers can use to peek 
around corners and peer into attics when looking for burglary suspects. Mika 
got the idea for it by watching his wife, Patricia, use a hand mirror as she 
combed her hair. 
</P>
<P>
"I use it on every building search I go on," said LAPD Officer Adam Greenburg, 
who also pulls out his mirror when hunting for contraband beneath automobile 
seats and dashboards. "I even carried it with me when I wore shorts on beach 
patrol at Venice." 
</P>
<P>
Other Mika innovations have been slower to catch on, however, such as his 
tennis balls. 
</P>
<P>
Mika's tennis balls have happy faces and frowning faces painted on them. The 
faces serve as ice-breakers when children are interviewed during 
investigations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mika also uses the tennis balls for knocking on doors where an armed 
suspect may be hiding. Standing out of the possible line of fire, Mika can 
"knock" by throwing balls in quick succession against the door. 
</P>
<P>
That's a dumb idea, according to at least one top-level Los Angeles police 
tactical training officer. He is Sgt. Frank Mika -- the brother of Robert Mika. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always the problem with liability if you miss and throw one of those 
balls through a window," said Frank Mika, 43. "I can just see having to 
schedule a four-hour training (period) on how to throw a tennis ball." 
</P>
<P>
There has been no stampede for the "Mika Robbery Alarm," either. 
</P>
<P>
The $350 device is a revolving light with red, white and blue lenses that is 
designed for installation outside banks, liquor stores and mini-marts. 
</P>
<P>
The light alarm is connected to a hidden switch or to the store's regular 
silent alarm. It starts flashing if the robbery alarm is triggered, Mika said, 
alerting passing patrolmen who have not yet received a robbery-in-progress call 
on their radio. It also can attract the attention of witnesses who can describe 
the robbers to police, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mika said the alarm idea came to him on the Ventura Freeway when he noticed 
that eastbound traffic had slowed as motorists gawked at flashing lights on 
emergency vehicles at an accident on the westbound side. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Wouldn't it be great if people a mile away could know that a 
robbery was going on?' I can see a use for these things all over L.A.," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Only one robbery light has been installed, however. And it has been placed on 
the roof of a restaurant in Detroit on the recommendation of a Dearborn 
Heights, Mich., policeman who bought one of Mika's holsters and was pleased 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
But the alarm light atop the Ram's Horn restaurant has never been used to 
signal a robbery. In fact, when James Woolford purchased the Michigan 
restaurant three months ago, nobody bothered to even tell him what it was for. 
</P>
<P>
"When we turned it on to see what it did, it looked like a blue-light special," 
Woolford said. "I'm going to take it down when spring comes and I get up on the 
roof. . . . It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit police say no one has told them what the Ram's Horn light is for, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"We get runs up there all the time on fights and everything. That light's never 
been flashing that I know of," said Gary Arnold, precinct desk officer. "Of 
course, we'd never look up when we're going out on a fight call." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police hope Mika's inventions keep coming, however. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of in the Dark Ages. We're using weapons first constructed in the 
14th Century -- clubs and handguns," said Capt. Art Lopez, who is in charge of 
training LAPD officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We need people with minds like that who are going to get us out into the 
future."

IMMIGRANTS CAUTIONED ON INS 'FAMILY FAIRNESS' PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of several Los Angeles immigrant groups cautioned illegal 
immigrants Wednesday about rushing to apply for temporary U.S. residency under 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service's new "family fairness" policy. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from Latino groups and Congress, INS Commissioner Gene McNary on 
Feb. 2 announced a policy allowing close relatives of legalized aliens to 
remain in the United States while they wait to qualify for permanent status. 
</P>
<P>
While they voiced general support for the gesture, immigrants' representatives 
contended at a Los Angeles press conference that the policy, affecting 
thousands of immediate family members of amnesty applicants, has serious flaws 
that could hurt some applicants. 
</P>
<P>
For example, they said, the confidentiality aspect of the amnesty law, which 
was required by Congress as a condition of its passage, is not part of the 
policy, which took effect Wednesday. The lack of confidentiality could lead 
some applicants to deportation, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a new amnesty program," said Teresa Sanchez-Gordon of the Labor 
Immigrant Assistance Project. She was among several advocates who urged aliens 
to wait for clarifications from the immigration service before applying for 
temporary residency under the liberalized policy. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the activists said, the benefits of the policy -- keeping an 
amnesty applicant's immediate family together, the authorization for work for 
adults and the access to Social Security benefits for minors -- should outweigh 
its negative aspects for most applicants. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's the bottom line," said Boyle Heights lawyer Antonio Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
The policy provides for a renewable, one-year authorization to live in this 
country for spouses and children under 18 years of age who can prove that they 
have lived in the United States since before Nov. 6, 1986 -- the date the 
landmark amnesty legislation became law. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials were criticized by Latino activists and civil-rights advocates 
because the treatment accorded immediate family members of amnesty applicants 
varies from region to region, depending on how local INS officials interpret 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no firm figures, the immigration service estimates as many 
as 1 million aliens could be affected by the new policy. About 3 million aliens 
applied for amnesty nationwide, with about half of them living in California. 
</P>
<P>
Officials painted McNary's gesture as a "double-edged sword" that could as 
easily hurt as help potential applicants. 
</P>
<P>
J Craig Fong, director of the Downtown Legalization Project, said aliens who 
received public assistance, minor children who were outside the United States 
at the time the parent applied for amnesty and those illegals with physical or 
mental disabilities are ineligible to apply. 
</P>
<P>
"This also doesn't pertain to late amnesty" registrants whose cases are being 
contested by the INS in the courts, Fong said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, INS spokesman Duke Austin acknowledged that there was no 
guarantee of confidentiality under the policy, noting that all INS programs -- 
with the exception of amnesty -- do not guarantee confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that rejected applicants can always appeal their cases under 
established INS procedures.

MORE STOLEN EXPLOSIVES DISCOVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven more stolen explosive cartridges believed used in the space shuttle 
turned up Wednesday in a Saugus neighborhood where 10 of the devices have been 
found since Feb. 3, including one that blew up and slightly injured a boy, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery came two days after Los Angeles County sheriff's officials warned 
area residents to be on the lookout for the devices, 46 of which were stolen in 
1987 from a now-closed testing plant run by Hi-Shear Technology Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies planned to visit several schools in the area today to describe the 
cartridges to students and instruct them to call authorities if they find any 
of the devices, Sheriff's Lt. Ed Chenal said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe the remaining 25 cartridges, which are seven inches long 
and three-quarters of an inch in diameter with red plastic caps on each end, 
were also discarded in the area. The cartridges are used on the space shuttle 
to jettison empty fuel tanks after liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dean Scoville said Hi-Shear employees found the 11 devices Wednesday in 
a plastic foam container dug from rubble near a brick wall in the 27500 block 
of Urbandale Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Torrance-based Hi-Shear could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday. Scoville said the company sent representatives to scour the field 
for additional cartridges after authorities announced the earlier finds on 
Monday.

BERTH SITE MAY HAVE BEEN TOO SHALLOW FOR SHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY and DAN WEIKEL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tanker American Trader may have been operating in water five feet shallower 
than indicated on depth charts when it apparently impaled itself on its own 
anchor and spilled 394,000 gallons of crude oil in the ocean off Orange County, 
a Coast Guard official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have turned up "preliminary indications" that the 811-foot tanker 
may have been operating in 46 or 47 feet of water instead of the 51 to 53 feet 
listed on navigational charts, said Cmdr. Scott Porter, Coast Guard assistant 
chief for marine safety in California. 
</P>
<P>
If that discrepancy proves true, it would mean the ship may have had less than 
five feet of water under its hull as it passed over its anchor, which is about 
4 feet wide and 10 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
The ship's anchor apparently punched two holes in the hull, triggering the 
worst oil spill in two decades off Southern California. Some Coast Guard 
officials have speculated that a depth discrepancy may have occurred when sand 
from the shore was swept by currents, forming a shoal. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that the depth changes might have been a factor in the accident at an 
oil pipeline mooring off Huntington Beach, the Coast Guard has decided to look 
for similar potential safety problems at about 15 other berths off the 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure this is not a problem that could result in a disaster 
anywhere else," Porter said. "The fact that this one (off Huntington Beach) has 
been used safely for years and years, and now there's a problem, certainly 
raises a question with the others." 
</P>
<P>
Porter emphasized that the Coast Guard was undertaking the action as a 
precaution. Authorities would "take appropriate actions within the Coast Guard 
regulations" if other apparent discrepancies crop up at other moorings. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Coast Guard has shut down the Huntington Beach mooring to vessels 
with a draft -- the depth of water that a vessel draws -- of greater than 20 
feet, the other on the California coast remain open. 
</P>
<P>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration supplies navigational 
charts for waters off the United States. Those charts are updated weekly using 
reports of depth changes or obstacles supplied to the Coast Guard by captains. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Gorman, a spokesman for NOAA, said the agency takes great pains to ensure 
that charts are accurate. "Our chief concern is the protection of life and 
property," Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
The navigational chart for the ocean off Huntington Beach was last updated by 
NOAA in September, 1988. Since then, there have been no reports by commercial 
or private vessels of changes in ocean depth in the stretch around the 
Huntington Beach mooring, Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
As investigators continued to search for the exact cause of the accident, state 
officials sponsoring spill-related legislation contended that a lack of 
prevention and adequate inspection might have contributed to last week's 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
They said that a vacuum in oversight was created more than 10 years ago when 
state budget cuts abolished a watchdog unit that monitored and wrote operating 
standards for oil tankers, marine terminals and offshore moorings. The 
six-person unit under the State Lands Commission was disbanded before it had 
time to address tanker safety issues, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Left behind were inconsistent inspection programs by the Coast Guard and the 
owners of terminals, said Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo). 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is have a comprehensive approach," said Lempert, who 
is sponsoring a bill to create a $500-million oil-spill fund and increased 
prevention efforts. "We are so unprepared. Very little is going on in 
prevention and response right now in the state." 
</P>
<P>
Lempert's bill also would restore the authority of the State Lands Commission 
to do thorough inspections of and promulgate regulations for oil tankers and 
almost 50 marine terminals. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the legislation will give us that opportunity again," said Charles 
Warren, executive director of the Lands Commission. "We think the political 
conditions have changed under the circumstances and now warrant an effort to 
obtain permission and funds to do those inspections once more." 
</P>
<P>
The unit, funded by state and federal grants in 1979, wrote regulations and 
monitored the operation of marine oil terminals, including offshore moorings. 
Warren said that it was created after a series of spills in San Francisco Bay 
revealed deficiencies in monitoring by regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the unit drafted a 400-page manual for oil terminal operations and 
found malfunctioning equipment and procedural problems at several terminals. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some oversight but that was lost," said Donald J. Everitts, a State 
Lands Commission official who headed the watchdog program. "It was a useful 
operation for two years. Our inspections did find violations, but the program 
died before we could get into the tanker safety aspect." 
</P>
<P>
Everitts declined to say whether anything that the agency did might have 
prevented the Huntington Beach spill. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Coast Guard is responsible for making yearly inspections of the 
so-called spread mooring terminals, which are found off El Segundo, Huntington 
Beach, Carlsbad, Santa Barbara County, San Luis Obispo County and in Monterey 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
But those inspections, Coast Guard officials say, include reviews of operating 
procedures and ensuring that mooring buoys are secure and well-lighted. Depth 
is not routinely checked at the moorings. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of offshore terminals do other inspections, but they differ from 
facility to facility. John Miller, a vice president at Golden West Refining 
Co., which is leasing the ill-fated mooring site from the state, said his firm 
only inspects the bottom around the facility after major storms or if a ship 
captain notices something unusual.

DEUKMEJIAN SAYS WILSON 'SHORTSIGHTED' ON OIL DRILLING;

ENVIRONMENT: GOVERNOR TRIES TO ASSURE ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENTS THAT EVERYTHING 
IS BEING DONE TO CLEAN UP THE COASTAL SPILL BUT CAUTIONED THAT A MOVE TO

Punctuating major differences between himself and his would-be Republican 
successor, Gov. George Deukmejian on Wednesday criticized Sen. Pete Wilson's 
opposition to offshore oil development as "shortsighted" and not in the 
nation's interest. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP governor also objected to Wilson's campaign pledge to create a state 
environmental protection agency, implying that the proposal merely was a 
political ploy and insisting that the new entity is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's campaign aides have been saying for some time that the senator would 
be a different kind of governor than Deukmejian, and a press conference held 
Wednesday by the lame-duck incumbent aptly illustrated the point. 
</P>
<P>
A Wilson spokesman, Bill Livingston, said afterward that although the senator 
"has great admiration" for Deukmejian, the two "invariably disagree" on some 
issues. "Sen. Wilson is not a clone," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides disagreeing with Deukmejian on offshore oil drilling, Wilson generally 
has been more pro-environment than the governor, advocating managed growth 
rather than laissez faire economic development. The two Republicans also have 
taken opposing positions on other issues, such as abortion; Deukmejian supports 
restrictions, Wilson is "pro-choice." 
</P>
<P>
Illustrating the depth of their differences in style and ideology, one 
anonymous Wilson strategist recently commented to a reporter: " 'The Duke' has 
been asleep at the switch for the last couple of years." Another, referring to 
the crime issue, criticized Deukmejian's "one-note governorship -- lock all the 
thugs up." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's main goal on Wednesday was to assure people residing along Orange 
County's beaches and trying to make a living there that everything possible is 
being done to clean up the oil spill. But he also said that "we should not fool 
ourselves. As long as California remains thoroughly dependent on imported oil . 
. . we are going to run the risk of having oil tanker accidents. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental lessons of this most recent oil spill is that the best thing 
we can do for California's environment and economy is to strike out hard 
against our dependency on imported oil and produce more California energy of 
all types right here at home." 
</P>
<P>
And this, the governor said, includes offshore oil development "done in an 
environmentally safe manner." 
</P>
<P>
The governor has refused to declare a state of emergency along oil-stained 
stretches of beach, saying it was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter pointed out that Wilson -- who is virtually certain to be the 
GOP gubernatorial nominee -- advocates banning any new offshore development, 
the governor responded: 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that he has a different view than I do on this subject. 
And I have said of these people who hold the view of wanting to continue a ban 
on any further offshore oil development, I think it's a very shortsighted view. 
And I think they're not looking at the bigger picture of the interest of our 
country and what the needs are. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hear, for example, the people who are calling for a (drilling) ban 
calling on residents of this state to cut the consumption of the amount of 
gasoline that they use in half." 
</P>
<P>
At another point, Deukmejian was asked about Wilson's pledge to establish a new 
state environmental agency -- Cal-EPA -- to oversee regulation of pesticides, 
hazardous waste, air and water pollution, garbage and recycling. One of the 
purposes is to take pesticide regulation away from the farmer-oriented state 
agriculture department. The governor dismissed the idea as lacking merit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't support making a change just to make a change," Deukmejian said. "I 
would support making changes if it is necessary . . . if there's some reason. 
At the present time, I don't believe there is sufficient reason to make that 
kind of change. The expertise in this area is in the Department of Food and 
Agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson talked about his differences with Deukmejian on Tuesday in Santa Barbara 
while touring the state to officially announce his gubernatorial candidacy. 
Standing on an ocean-side cliff with oil platforms in the far background, the 
senator praised Deukmejian for being "perhaps the most pro-law enforcement 
governor in our history" and also said they share "concern for the hard-earned 
tax dollars of Californians." 
</P>
<P>
"But we do have differences," Wilson added, citing offshore drilling and 
support for the California Coastal Commission, which he would give more money. 
The senator also said he would have unhesitatingly fully funded family-planning 
clinics, which Deukmejian reluctantly did only after having been pressured by 
fellow Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Deukmejian also jabbed at state Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp, a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. The governor 
noted that Van de Kamp personally opposes capital punishment but still defends 
the state in death-penalty cases. So he questioned the attorney general's 
recent decision to withdraw as the state's lawyer in cases involving the 
logging of old-growth redwoods, just because Van de Kamp personally opposes the 
cutting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm finding it a little hard to figure out -- whether people are more 
important to him than trees, or are trees more important to him than people," 
Deukmejian said. "I can't figure out his logic in all this." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Van de Kamp, Duane Peterson, said the logic is that Van de Kamp 
has not made a campaign issue out of capital punishment but is pushing to 
eliminate logging of old-growth redwoods. The attorney general does not want to 
be accused of providing poor legal representation for political purposes so is 
telling the state to get another lawyer, the spokesman said.

EDUCATION: THE SAND WAS THE PLAYGROUND, UNTIL LAST WEEK. NOW THE TEACHERS AT 
NEWPORT BEACH ELEMENTARY ARE HOPING THEIR STUDENTS WON'T FORGET WHAT THEY'RE 
SEEING.

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifth-grade teacher Frank Vaiuso's science lesson began Wednesday at the edge 
of the Newport Beach Elementary School playground, where the sand meets the 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
There, while brown foam washed ashore and a yellow-slickered cleanup crew made 
its way along the beach, Vaiuso showed his 27 students how oil from last week's 
tanker spill was breaking up -- "getting chewed up by the waves." 
</P>
<P>
As the children leaned into the wind, craning for a closer look, some of them 
pronounced the spill "nasty," "dirty" and "really, really gross." Morgan 
Wooley, 11, took Polaroid pictures for Soundings, the school newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The spill made them "sad," Morgan and many of her classmates said. They were 
upset that birds and fish were dying and "mad" at the oil company that did it. 
</P>
<P>
"There are strong feelings about this," Vaiuso explained as he led his class 
back inside. "The beach is their back yard. And now, because of the spill, 
they're restricted from going there." 
</P>
<P>
The children of Newport Beach Elementary attend what is perhaps the nation's 
only public school on a beach -- located on a wide swath of sand just south of 
the Newport Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Their asphalt playground ends about 50 feet from the ocean. From their 
classroom windows, they can watch as whales spout, pelicans dive for fish and 
porpoises play in the waves. And when 
</P>
<P>
school is out, many of them not only play on the beach but also swim and surf. 
</P>
<P>
So when the Feb. 7 tanker spill dumped nearly 400,000 gallons of crude oil into 
the ocean, the children were alarmed. And as winds and tides pushed the muck 
from Huntington Beach to Newport -- by Monday, directly behind their school -- 
many students took it as a personal affront. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, meanwhile, seized on the situation as an opportunity for firsthand 
environmental education. They've assigned essays on the oil spill, taken 
students on field trips to watch the cleanup and led class discussions on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be fools not to take advantage of this," said third-grade teacher Jean 
Rocchio, who last week took her students to the Newport Pier, where some of the 
thickest oil was washing ashore. 
</P>
<P>
Vaiuso agreed. Also, he said, he believes it's important that the students 
write and talk about the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that they get a chance to express their feelings," 
he said. "Hardly anybody ever asks the kids what they think. But some of these 
kids are really hurt by this. Other kids have great soccer fields to play on 
after school. These kids have the beach." 
</P>
<P>
When the tanker American Trader ruptured last week, Rocchio was concluding a 
lesson on "people who made a difference." That included a look at such 
important figures as Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin and Mother Teresa. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday Rocchio asked her students to consider ways that they could make 
a difference. "How can you make a difference on Earth?" Rocchio asked them. 
"How can you can help our environment" and prevent another oil spill? 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should stop polluting and help the ocean by stopping using cars so 
much and walking instead," suggested third-grader Renee Polestra. 
</P>
<P>
Added classmate Alex Dulian, "You shouldn't use powerboats as much as 
sailboats." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Boukather, another classmate, chimed in: "I think we always should have 
double-bottomed tankers -- and they should not always go close to the coast." 
</P>
<P>
Although Congress is still debating the merits of double hulls, many of Newport 
Beach Elementary's students have boned up on the issue and vigorously endorse 
their use. 
</P>
<P>
"They should make it law to have double hulls," said Scott Simms, one of 
Vaiuso's fifth-graders. Added classmate Eddie Truxton, "They could prevent 
spills if they could double-layer the oil tankers -- and make the anchor 
heavier." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Elementary's students had some other suggestions for averting or 
containing spills. Fifth-grader Ben Pollack said he would "like to invent a 
nontoxic powder to evaporate the oil." 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-grader Cameron Boubolious recommended that oil companies abandon tankers 
and instead build "a train sort of thing" to carry the oil over the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
And several of sixth-grade teacher Ralph Whitford's students suggested that 
Californians should reduce their dependence on oil by using solar-powered cars. 
</P>
<P>
"These are tough decisions, folks," Whitford counseled. "You can use nuclear 
power. But 'no nukes,' right? Solar power? Wind power? You guys are going to 
have to figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
Whitford didn't add -- "when you grow up." But that was understood. 
</P>
<P>
As his students headed for lunch, Whitford said that many of them were coming 
to grips with an environmental disaster that they had never imagined could 
happen to them or their beach. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them "have never considered anything like this," he said. "But in five 
or six years, when they're voters, you can be sure it will be imprinted on 
their minds."

ARCTIC AIR HAS JACK FROST NIPPING AT GROVES; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: RARE NORTHWESTER SENDS TEMPERATURES PLUNGING AND PUTS GROWERS ON FULL 
ALERT. OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE 20S WERE FORECAST FOR MOST AREAS OF THE COUNTY.

<P>
A rare blast of arctic air routed Orange County's normally mild winter climate 
Wednesday and threatened to damage thousands of acres of crops with the first 
widespread frost of the winter season. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day Wednesday area growers prepared for a second night of chilly 
weather, readying wind machines, sprinkler systems and thermal coverings called 
"hot caps" to save strawberry fields, avocado trees, citrus groves and nursery 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, the low temperatures hovered in the 30s and 40s in most 
areas of the county, with just a few pockets reporting freezing weather. The 
county's lowest temperature of 27 degrees was recorded in San Juan Canyon, just 
east of San Juan Capistrano on Ortega Highway, according to the National 
Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
But as the brunt of the Alaskan cold front hit Wednesday night, temperatures 
plunged and were expected to drop to the mid-20s in most areas in the early 
morning hours today. 
</P>
<P>
"A front from the Gulf of Alaska is coming almost straight down the entire West 
Coast, which is why it's so cold," said Weatherdata meteorologist Rick Dittman. 
</P>
<P>
On agricultural lands, predominantly in Irvine and San Juan Capistrano, special 
machinery to handle cold spells is kept on the premises, growers said. "We've 
got our wind machines fueled up and ready to go," said Alan Reynolds of 
Treasure Farms, which leases 5,000 acres of Irvine Co. ranch lands in northeast 
Irvine to harvest oranges, lemons, grapefruits, avocados and beans. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll start monitoring temperatures, and as the areas get cold we'll turn on 
the machines," Reynolds said, adding that 2,000 acres of crops were in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Also threatened by the chill are ficus and coral trees at the 280-acre 
SeaTreeNurseries in east Irvine, where workers were moving trees within range 
of the wind machines, Executive Vice President Tom Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have a clear sky, no wind and these (low) temperatures, we're in store 
for possible danger," Larson said. The nursery uses a device called a 
thermograph to measure temperatures at regular intervals, and to record the 
duration of high and low readings, Larson added, explaining that the length of 
a freezing spell determines the amount of crop damage. 
</P>
<P>
The Arctic-born weather system caused problems on other fronts as well, driving 
about 50 homeless people into the National Guard Armory in Fullerton and 
creating miserable working conditions for the hundreds of people working to 
clean up the oil spill in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, powerful gusts prompted the California Highway Patrol to advise 
large trucks and "high-profile vehicles" to stay off roads from Newhall to 
Bakersfield. CHP cars equipped with chains escorted traffic along a 40-mile 
stretch of the snow-swept Golden State Freeway between Castaic and the northern 
end of the Grapevine near Frazier Park. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous sheets of ice and snow kept that section of the freeway, the main 
link to the San Joaquin Valley, closed between 2:45 and 7 a.m., CHP Lt. Robert 
Caldwell said. All lanes of the freeway were not completely opened by Caltrans 
snowplows until 11 a.m. Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By afternoon today, the cold front will be moving east and temperatures will 
start to warm. Highs today are expected to climb to the low 60s in Orange 
County, with lows tonight in the 40s. Friday, increasing cloud cover from a 
second Alaskan weather system could bring a chance of rain over the weekend and 
continued cold, Dittman said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County typically gets about three widespread freezes each winter, said 
Harry Otto, a farm adviser with the University of California Cooperative 
Extension, who noted that Wednesday's predicted frost was late in the current 
growing season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sound like an old codger who's been around for years," Otto 
said. "But frost-wise, it's been a relatively good season for us. We usually 
get more than one frost a year in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, crop growers sustained more than $30 million in damages that were 
mostly the result of cold weather, according to figures from the Orange County 
Farm Bureau.

WIEDER, ROTH GET CAMPAIGN PAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and Don R. Roth have made their 
reelection bids official. Both have obtained election papers from the registrar 
of voters, and must complete and return them by March 9. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who also faces reelection in June, had not taken 
out papers as of late Wednesday, a deputy registrar said. 
</P>
<P>
Roth, who represents the 4th District and chairs the board, is seeking his 
second term as a supervisor. He faces no opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, who is seeking her fourth term as a supervisor in the 2nd District, 
faces only nominal opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Alexis Antos, 45, a homemaker from Seal Beach, has also taken out papers 
to run for the 2nd District seat, but said she has not yet raised any money for 
the race. Anos said that she would concentrate on balancing the budget, 
reducing traffic congestion and seeking a solution to the landfill problem with 
a countywide recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the incumbents facing reelection this year has raised well over 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Supervisors Roger R. Stanton nor Gaddi H. Vasquez are up for reelection 
this year.

DRIVER DIES AFTER CAR CRUSHES HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who lost control of his car on the Santa Ana Freeway was killed Wednesday 
when he was thrown from the car and it rolled on him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Massoud Mansouri, 37, of Playa del Rey was traveling south at more than 100 
miles per hour and using all lanes of traffic when he lost control of the 1989 
BMW at about 1:25 a.m., California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Angle Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mansouri hit a traffic sign on the right shoulder just south of the 1st Street 
off-ramp "sending his car 60 feet into the air," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The car landed near the embankment where it struck a light pole, ejecting 
Mansouri, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle then rolled down the embankment and on top of Mansouri, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mansouri was taken to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana where he later died 
of his injuries, a hospital spokesperson said.

LOCAL LEADERS VIEW SITE OF ART CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives from the city government and local art organizations and 
business leaders met this week to survey the future site of the Huntington 
Beach Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
The 11,000-square-foot building at 538 Main St. was bought by the city in 1988 
for $750,000 from Southern California Edison Co., which had used it for 
business offices. 
</P>
<P>
The art center will be the inland anchor of the city's Main-Pier area 
development center. 
</P>
<P>
At an open house ceremony, Councilman Peter M. Green thanked the FHP medical 
group, which on Tuesday gave a $75,000 check to the Huntington Beach Art Center 
Foundation, the fund-raising arm of the center. 
</P>
<P>
The center is scheduled to open in spring, 1991, and will include three 
galleries covering 4,000 square feet of exhibition space, a performance room, a 
studio and a bookstore. The renovation of the building is expected to cost 
about $750,000, bringing the total cost of setting up the center to about $1.5 
million. JOHN PENNER

NEW REGIONAL PARK SITE TO BE DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City, county and state officials today will dedicate the site of a 
long-proposed county regional park. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremonies, to be at 11 a.m. on Seapoint Street near Palm Avenue, will mark 
the first phase of the Bolsa Chica Linear Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
The new park overlooks the shoreline that has been blackened in recent days by 
the oil spill from the American Trader. 
</P>
<P>
"You can look from the park site and see the infamous oil spill," noted Barbara 
Foster, executive assistant to county Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. Wieder 
will be among the governmental dignitaries taking part in the park dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the new regional park will extend from Pacific Coast Highway to 
Central Park and will include 113 acres. Much of that land, while pledged, has 
yet to be officially donated. The dedication today will be of about 24 acres of 
land the city already has given to start the long, ribbon-like park. 
</P>
<P>
The new park is scheduled to have a hiking trail on which people can walk from 
Central Park all the way to the ocean. Overlooks of the Bolsa Chica Wetlands 
Preserve will allow park visitors to view birds that frequent the marshy area.

PANEL TO DISCUSS TRYING AGAIN ON MEASURE M 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County transportation commissioners are expected to say "one more time" 
at a workshop today focusing on whether to try again in November for voter 
approval of a half-cent sales tax increase to pay for highway and transit 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
If the workshop participants decide to go for it, the staff of the Orange 
County Transportation Commission will develop an election proposal for formal 
approval in March, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers for Highway Safety, an Irvine-based grass-roots organization opposed to 
car-pool lanes, is expected to try to talk the commission out of placing a 
Measure M before the voters again. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M, a half-cent sales-tax proposal, was defeated in November by a margin 
of 52.6% to 47.4%. Political experts said the measure lost because voter 
turnout -- 22% -- was low. Critics of the tax plan said it would have earmarked 
too much money for car-pool lanes and mass transit at the expense of new 
highways. However, a post-election survey paid for by Measure M supporters 
concluded that it failed simply because of anti-tax and anti-government 
sentiment and that it probably would have passed in a general, rather than a 
special, election. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M was the only countywide issue on the ballot last November; only a few 
city and special district elections were held at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ward, a member of Drivers for Highway Safety, said that group will propose 
alternatives to Measure M today, although the commission is not expected to 
allow testimony, as the session is a workshop and not a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
His group is seeking nighttime public hearings, Ward said, so that the 
commission "can get closer to the people and really hear what's on the public's 
mind. They're really out of touch with what the public really wants." 
</P>
<P>
Ward recently urged the panel to explore the possibility of a local gasoline 
tax that would be devoted to highway improvements, but commission officials 
pointed out that it would take a local gas tax of 19 cents per gallon to raise 
the same amount of revenue that a half-cent sales tax increase would. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect to go for a November election," commission Chairman and county 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said Wednesday. "The state is out of money, and the 
federal government is using money (the highway trust fund) for purposes other 
than which it was intended." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said federal officials are refusing to spend highway trust fund dollars 
so as to make the federal deficit appear smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Riley and Transportation Commission Executive Director Stanley T. Oftelie said 
some minor changes may be made in the implementation ordinance for the measure 
so that cities could use some of the money from sales taxes for other transit 
projects. One such project could be the central Orange County monorail system 
that various cities, Santa Ana among them, have proposed. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed last year, Measure M would have raised an estimated $3.1 billion 
over 20 years for highway and transit projects. The proceeds would have been 
split, with $1.325 billion earmarked for freeway improvements, $350 million for 
local streets and roads, $650 million for regional highway projects, and $775 
million for mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
Oftelie said a new measure for a sales tax increase may retain the same 
"Measure M" ballot designation. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is the only urban county in the state without such a sales tax 
surcharge.

UCI 'SHANTYTOWN' GOING DOWN BUT PROTESTERS AREN'T GIVING UP

<P>
Student activists at UC Irvine decided Wednesday to dismantle a "shantytown" 
constructed to protest the university's housing policy, but vowed to issue new 
demands to Chancellor J.W. Peltason. 
</P>
<P>
The cardboard shacks were erected last week to protest Peltason's statement 
that the university's policy prohibits gay and lesbian and other 
"non-traditional families" from residing in campus housing. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Olson, vice president for internal affairs of Associated Graduate 
Students, said the shantytown will be removed during a "big bash" Friday at 
noon, after which protest leaders will issue a new set of demands to Peltason. 
If those demands are not met within "a couple of weeks," Olson said, the 
shantytown will be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Kerr, a member of the Campus Coalition for Human Rights, said the 
decision to dismantle the shantytown was reached because organizers, many of 
whom have manned the shanties for a week, wanted to "conserve their energy" for 
future demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a party (Friday) to declare a victory for us in unifying 
on this issue," Kerr said. "We don't feel in taking down the shantytown we're 
admitting defeat." 
</P>
<P>
Olson said student leaders also decided to maintain an information booth 
detailing the students' position, and will construct a "thermometer" showing 
the number of people who have signed petitions against the housing policy. 
Organizers will also work on soliciting support from sympathetic faculty 
members, she said.

APPELLATE JUSTICE SCOVILLE TO RETIRE, WILL MANAGE CONTROVERSIAL TRUST 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harmon G. Scoville, presiding justice of the 4th District Court of Appeal's 
Santa Ana division, surprised his colleagues and staff by announcing his 
retirement Wednesday to accept a job as special master of a major and 
controversial trust in Marin County. 
</P>
<P>
Scoville, 67, urged Gov. George Deukmejian in a retirement letter to appoint 
his successor as soon as possible because of the appellate court's heavy 
workload. He also reiterated a longstanding argument that the Santa Ana 
appellate division should have seven justices instead of five. 
</P>
<P>
Scoville, appointed presiding justice of the Santa Ana division just two years 
ago, said that he had not been thinking about retirement any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
But two weeks ago, he said, a longtime friend since his law school days, former 
Superior Court Judge Homer G. Thompson of Santa Clara County, offered him the 
special master position of the Buck Trust, which has assets of more than $250 
million. Thompson is under appointment by the state Supreme Court to control 
the trust. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that several people had applied for the position, but he wanted me 
to to take it because of my experience in probate and trust law," Scoville 
said. "The offer was clear out of the blue, but after meeting with him, I 
decided, by golly, that I would accept it." 
</P>
<P>
Scoville's announcement left his colleagues on the appellate bench surprised 
but happy for him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been great to have here," Justice Edward J. Wallin said. "He has a 
tremendous grace and presence that's really very nice to be around." 
</P>
<P>
Scoville's 23-year career as a judge was noted recently by the Orange County 
Bar Assn., which awarded him the annual Franklin G. West Lifetime Achievement 
Award, the highest honor that it bestows on a judge. 
</P>
<P>
Scoville told Deukmejian that his retirement would be effective April 1. 
</P>
<P>
He is the second presiding judge to leave the Santa Ana division, which was set 
up in January, 1983. Former Presiding Justice John K. Trotter left two years 
ago to become involved with a statewide arbitration panel. 
</P>
<P>
No one had expected Deukmejian to replace Trotter with any of the other three 
justices on the panel, because they were all appointments of former Gov. Edmund 
G. Brown Jr. In fact, Deukmejian, as attorney general sitting on the Commission 
on Judicial Appointments, had voted against all of them at their confirmation 
hearings. They had all refused to publicly declare their personal views on the 
death penalty, which he had requested. 
</P>
<P>
Scoville, known statewide as an authority on probate and trust law, was in his 
second term as presiding judge of Orange County Superior Court when Deukmejian 
tapped him to replace Trotter. Though capital punishment was not a major issue 
at Scoville's confirmation hearing, he volunteered that he supported the death 
penalty. His selection was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
Scoville immediately lobbied for a fifth justice on the panel, which the 
Legislature eventually agreed to. Justice Henry Moore was appointed by 
Deukmejian to that position last year. 
</P>
<P>
Scoville also set up a settlement program for civil appeals, which is rare for 
appellate courts. He told Orange County's lawyers that they could choose any of 
the five justices to oversee the settlement. If the case could not be settled, 
Scoville assured them, that justice would not sit on the three-member panel 
that would then hear oral arguments for a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We settled more than a hundred cases last year," Scoville said proudly. "I'm a 
great believer in settlements whenever possible." 
</P>
<P>
But Scoville says the next task will be to add two more justices to the Santa 
Ana appellate bench. The workload ration per justice is already far greater 
than in most major metropolitan counties in the state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scoville is a graduate of UCLA, who went on to law school at Stanford 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a choice between Stanford and Harvard, but I figured if I was going to 
practice law in California, I ought to go to a California school," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He began his career with a Los Angeles law firm, then moved to Orange County to 
practice in 1955. He was appointed to the Municipal Court bench for the 
Huntington Beach/Seal Beach district by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan in 1967. He was 
elevated to the Superior Court bench two years later. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, Scoville has lectured annually on probate and trust law at the 
California Center for Judicial Education, an orientation for new judges, at UC 
Berkeley's Boalt Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the years, he has maintained his friendship with Thompson. When 
Scoville was recently heading to San Francisco for a temporary assignment with 
the state Supreme Court, the two made plans to get together for dinner. But 
Thompson surprised him before then, Scoville said, with the job offer. 
</P>
<P>
The Buck trust was left by the late Beryl Buck for care of the needy and other 
charities in Marin County. When the San Francisco Foundation which controlled 
the trust tried to modify the terms to allow distribution of its funds to other 
counties, Marin County officials challenged it in court. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson presided over the trial in 1986 and ruled that the trust's funds must 
remain in Marin County. The Marin Community Foundation took control and 
Thompson, in charge of the trust after his retirement from the bench, appointed 
a special master to oversee it for him. The position recently became open. 
</P>
<P>
Scoville said he expects Deukmejian to appoint his replacement within three to 
six months. In his letter to the governor, Scoville said he would be available 
to return to the bench for temporary assignments.

ROLLER-COASTER CAREER TAKES A DIP FOR SYKES

<P>
John Sykes still practices with Cal State Fullerton's basketball team, but he 
might never play another minute for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt it," Sykes said as he worked on his shooting after practice this week. 
"I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
For three seasons, Sykes has been the Titans' center of contention. He is a 
free-thinking senior who hasn't gotten along with two head coaches. Still, 
Sykes has maintained a legion of loyal fans who cheer and chant, "Syke-O, 
Syke-O" whenever he enters a game. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet-8, 235 pounds, Sykes is a sturdy 22-year-old who looks as if he can 
dominate a game. But he has never done that at Fullerton, and he has gone from 
starter to bench-warmer too many times to count. 
</P>
<P>
His game has always been a mix of ferocious two-handed dunks and 
sometimes-overzealous defense. For a time late last season, he played well, 
twice making game-winning plays during Fullerton's late-season run. Against 
Fresno State in Titan Gym, he delighted fans with a between-the-legs bounce 
pass to Wayne Williams on the fast break. 
</P>
<P>
But this season, he has not been effective. He was the starting center for 
seven games early in the season, but since has had a disciplinary suspension, a 
mysterious infection that made his eyes bleary-red for weeks, and a bout with 
strep throat. 
</P>
<P>
He has missed five games, and played sparingly in others. Since his most recent 
start, at Utah State in early January, he has played only 91 minutes in 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
He is averaging two points and four rebounds a game, and this time, his 
up-and-down career appears to be on its final decline. 
</P>
<P>
If that much was in doubt, it was probably decided on Saturday in Stockton, 
when about a dozen fans sat behind Fullerton's bench during a loss to the 
University of the Pacific. The fans cheered and they shouted. They were not 
members of Coach John Sneed's fan club, and they even called for Sneed to be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"All family," said Sykes, who is from Merced. "They were saying, 'We need a new 
coach.' They were on Sneed a lot, I know that." 
</P>
<P>
Could Sykes possibly play again, after that? 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, his chances aren't awfully good. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed, who by now has learned that the most unobtrusive way to discipline a 
player is simply to leave him on the bench rather than publicly suspend him, no 
longer pays much mind to what Sykes does. Last week, even missing practice 
without an excuse didn't draw a suspension. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired of the whole situation," Sykes said. "I felt I had to take a day 
off and get away from the program." 
</P>
<P>
Sykes called Sneed to tell him he wouldn't be at the Utah State game the day 
after the missed practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he was kind of sick," Sneed said after the game. "I told him I was 
kind of sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Sneed is noncommittal about what Sykes' role will be in the final five games. 
Instead, he chooses to praise the play of senior David Moody, who has become 
the starting center. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, Moody has played extremely well the past month," Sneed said. "I 
needed somebody at the five-spot (center) to rise to the occasion." 
</P>
<P>
But there Sykes is at practice, still working out even though his playing 
career could well be over. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to stay in shape," Sykes said, adding that he intends to play 
professional basketball next year, perhaps in Europe. "I'd hate to just sit 
out." 
</P>
<P>
As for his relationship with Sneed, Sykes only shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have different styles," he said. "He tries to restrict me offensively 
and defensively. I want to play 'man' defense; he wants to play zone. . . . 
It's his philosophy. He's the coach." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's basketball season has turned into a disappointment after road 
losses to Fresno State and Pacific, which gave the team a 3-10 record away from 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, the Titans were picked by some to challenge for second place 
in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
With a 12-10 record entering a final stretch that includes games against UC 
Santa Barbara, New Mexico State, Cal State Long Beach and Nevada Las Vegas, the 
Titans will have to play well in order to finish with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is resting its hopes on Titan Gym, where they are 9-0 this season, 
and where they play four of their final five games. The Titans' only road game 
is against UC Irvine, which is 2-19. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's 13-game home winning streak, which dates to last season, is tied 
for the 13th longest among Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
Two guys most likely to be working out after dark in the weight-lifting shed 
behind the Titan football house are Mike Pringle and Reggie Redding, both 
awaiting the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle's record-breaking season dominated the headlines last fall, but it is 
Redding, a 6-4, 270-pound offensive lineman, who probably will be the first 
Fullerton player taken in the April draft. 
</P>
<P>
Don Morel, who coaches Fullerton's offensive line, said Redding could be taken 
as high as the second or third round, based on conversations with scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, who led the nation in all-purpose running and was second in rushing, 
figures to be drafted somewhat lower. 
</P>
<P>
Both players participated in the recent NFL Scouting Combine at Indianapolis, 
where players are tested, timed and measured. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a meat market," Pringle said. 
</P>
<P>

After seven games, Mate Borgogno is leading the baseball team with a .400 
batting average and six runs batted in. . . . The early word on Cedric 
Ceballos' competition in the College Basketball Slam Dunk &amp; Three-Point 
Championship: Kendall Gill of Illinois and Sam Ivey of Wake Forest are the 
first players to accept invitations to participate in a dunking contest at the 
Final Four. Ceballos is one of eight seniors invited to the contest, to be held 
April 1 in Denver.

HARD WORK IS A WAY OF LIFE FOR FEARNLEY

<P>
Imagine the Tasmanian Devil in track spikes and you have a fairly good 
description of Trindl Fearnley, UC Irvine heptathlete. 
</P>
<P>
Long jumping, high jumping, shot putting, hurdling, sprinting . . . Every 
afternoon, Fearnley is an on-the-go track-and-field show, zipping from one 
event to the next like a pinball with a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
To develop her skills in the heptathlon's seven events, Fearnley, a senior, 
works out four to five hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that 16 quarterly units of academics and 15 hours a week as a marketing 
representative for an Irvine insurance broker, and you have a student-athlete 
on the move. 
</P>
<P>
But Fearnley, 22, doesn't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, there's always cleaning to be done, and Fearnley, a 
self-described neatness freak, can't seem to stop scrubbing. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah, I clean," Fearnley said. "It's bad. It's like compulsive behavior. I 
mean, I'm real tidy." 
</P>
<P>
Said her boyfriend and teammate Mike Morales: "She says she'll just clean one 
room, then one room sort of blends into the next. It's funny, when you look 
back, you realize how nutso she is." 
</P>
<P>
When she isn't studying, cleaning, working or working out, she's at rest. Of 
course, for Fearnley, that often means playing tennis or riding her bike. 
</P>
<P>
"She's definitely an overworker," assistant coach Kevin McCarthy said. "If I 
told her to climb a mountain, she'd climb a mountain." 
</P>
<P>
"And," added head Coach Vince O'Boyle, "She'd sing at the top too." 
</P>
<P>
Fearnley, one of Irvine's three team captains, doesn't mind the teasing from 
coaches and teammates. She realizes that some see her work ethic as, well, a 
bit beyond reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people see me as a maniac," Fearnley said. "They say, 'You're always 
working out.' But it's not like that really. I guess you could say I'm addicted 
to it, but that's only because I want to be the best I can be." 
</P>
<P>
Fearnley's reputation for dedication has developed over four years at Irvine. A 
former sprint standout at Edison High School, Fearnley came to Irvine hoping to 
improve her times in her favorite event, the 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
But while her freshman year was successful -- Fearnley helped Irvine set four 
school records in sprint relays -- she hit a lull in her sophomore year, 
despite plenty of hard work. Some say the lull was caused by the work. 
</P>
<P>
"She's kind of had a string of injuries and, in my opinion, it was because of 
not listening to her body, of working too hard," said Morales, UCI's 
All-American hammer thrower. "She'll prepare for a meet so much (that) she 
winds up doing more harm than good. I guess it's just part of her personality, 
but she's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of her sophomore year, Fearnley switched to the heptathlon. That 
summer, she spent hours each day going through each event, learning all the 
complex techniques as fast and as best as she could. In addition, with Morales' 
encouragement, she started an intense weight-lifting program. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lifting like a maniac," Fearnley said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, three days before the Big West Conference Championships last year, 
Fearnley pulled a hamstring muscle during a hurdle workout. Her season was 
finished. Her conference debut was reduced to watching from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"It was totally the worst," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Fearnley is trying to make her final season at Irvine her best. Two 
weeks ago, in a meet at Cal State Los Angeles, she scored a personal-record 
4,577 points -- despite falling in the 100-meter hurdles, the first event. 
</P>
<P>
"She was mad, but instead of giving up like some people would, she never did," 
McCarthy said. "She swore a little, but realized it was over and in half an 
hour she went into the high jump and jumped four inches higher than she ever 
had in her life." 
</P>
<P>
That, McCarthy said, reflects a welcome change in Fearnley's attitude, one that 
makes a smarter, healthier Fearnley. 
</P>
<P>
Said Fearnley: "I have some goals, sure . . . But I think I've learned to do it 
for the right reasons. I do it because it's fun. And because this is the only 
time in my life I can do what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine men's swim team did something last Saturday no other team has done 
in 15 years. It defeated UC Santa Barbara, the 11-time Big West defending 
champion, in a conference dual meet. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a biggee," Coach Charlie Schober said. 
</P>
<P>
The last team to beat UCSB in a conference dual was Irvine, in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, which will meet UCSB again next week at the Big West championships in 
Long Beach, had several key contributors, but All-American Brian Pajer probably 
had the biggest victory, upsetting conference leader Glenn Peoples in the 200 
breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
With that victory, Pajer, a senior, finishes his four-year collegiate career 
undefeated in the event in dual meets. Pajer is ranked by Swimming World 
magazine as the eighth-fastest American in both the 100- and 200-yard 
breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
After being benched in a game against Pacific last week, Jeff Herdman played 
one of the best games of his career against New Mexico State. Herdman, who was 
benched for what Coach Bill Mulligan described as "childish" behavior in games 
and practices, scored 22 points, making eight of 14 field goals in 26 minutes 
off the bench. . . . Irvine opens its track and field season at 11:30 a.m. 
Saturday with a home meet against Cal Poly Pomona and UC San Diego. Decathlete 
Matt Farmer will compete in a pentathlon championship at Louisiana State this 
weekend. . . . The golf team finished second in the UC Davis Invitational last 
week with a 54-hole score of 906 behind winner Cal State Northridge (884). . . 
. Water polo players Chris Duplanty, Julian Harvey and former Anteater Mike 
Evans will represent the Newport Water Polo Foundation when they play Club 
Partizan, Yugoslavia's premier club, Sunday at Newport Harbor High School. . . 
. The men's volleyball team won its first match of the season with a 2-15, 
15-10, 15-10, 15-12 nonconference victory over UC San Diego Saturday. The 
Anteaters are 1-6 overall, 0-6 in the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. 
. . . The baseball team (2-6), which plays Cal State Dominguez Hills Friday at 
Irvine, has lost senior first baseman Brian Young for four to six weeks because 
of a knee injury he suffered against Cal Poly Pomona last Friday.

COSTA MESA DRUG MAKER, YUGOSLAV FIRM TO MERGE

<P>
SPI Pharmaceuticals said Wednesday it has tentatively agreed to merge with 
Yugoslavia's second-largest drug manufacturer in what it said would be the 
first merger of its kind between U.S. and Eastern European drug companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa-based pharmaceutical company said it had signed a letter of 
intent to merge with Galenika, a Belgrade-based firm with 5,800 employees and 
annual sales of about $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed merger would create an international drug company with close to 
7,500 employees and nearly $300 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Sholl, an SPI spokesman, said his company would benefit from the proposed 
merger by gaining direct access to consumer markets in Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"This proposed agreement symbolizes the new opportunities that have been 
created by the changing political climate in Eastern Europe," SPI Chairman 
Milan Panic said. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the proposed agreement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Sholl said the deal is subject to approval of both companies' boards of 
directors as well as the government of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Galenika manufactures and sells a wide range of pharmaceuticals. The company's 
products are sold throughout Eastern and Western Europe, Africa and the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
SPI is a prescription and non-prescription pharmaceutical company with $124 
million in sales annually and about 1,600 employees worldwide. About 89% of 
SPI's stock is owned by ICN Pharmaceuticals, a Costa Mesa-based drug company. 
</P>
<P>
SPI has recently seen an increase in international sales, especially in Mexico 
and Central America. The company has also benefited in those areas from 
increased demand for injectable multivitamins and antibiotics. SPI does not 
have approval to sell those drugs in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Boosted by strong international sales, SPI recently posted a 26% jump in its 
earnings for fiscal 1989. The company earned a record $12.9 million for the 
year ended Nov. 31, contrasted with $10.2 million in fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
SPI's shares closed unchanged Wednesday at $9.125 per share on the American 
Stock Exchange.

PITCHING THEIR OIL-SLICK SOLUTIONS -- TO NO AVAIL; 
</P>
<P>
SALES: BUSINESSES PUSHING NEW PRODUCTS TO DISPERSE OR SOAK UP THE GOO FIND THAT 
CLEANUP CREWS ARE STICKING WITH TRIED-AND-TRUE METHODS.

<P>
Want to tame an oil slick? 
</P>
<P>
Just spray on Oil Spill Eater, an enzyme solution with such common ingredients 
as yeast, molasses, malt and sugar. Faster than you can say "American Trading 
Transportation Co." -- well, in about three days, its makers say -- naturally 
created bacteria will eat right through the goo. 
</P>
<P>
Is that slick headed for the beach? 
</P>
<P>
It's time for Wollastic Fiber, something its manufacturer calls a "a simple 
solution to the complicated problem of oil spill cleanup." Just lay out the 
latex-backed coconut-fiber mats at the surf line like so many beach blankets. 
The mats will sop up the oil before it reaches the sand, a company executive 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For some companies, Orange County's oil disaster would seem to hold the promise 
of a big business opportunity. But this small army of entrepreneurs, sales 
representatives and inventors has had a tough time pitching products to stop 
the slick and clean the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst time to try to present something when you have a serious 
situation like this," said John Kearns, sales manager of Nickey Petroleum Co. 
in Santa Ana, who has been trying in vain to persuade officials to try his 
company's BioSolve oil solvent. "They are so busy trying to resolve this 
situation they don't have time to look as closely at things that need to be 
looked at." 
</P>
<P>
Both British Petroleum, whose oil is involved and which is directing the 
cleanup, and the California Department of Fish and Game, which is involved in 
wildlife rescue efforts, report they have been flooded with ideas and sales 
pitches since the tanker American Trader leaked nearly 400,000 gallons of oil 
into the waters off Huntington Beach last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been receiving a fair number of calls," said BP spokesman Peter 
Necarsulmer in Long Beach. "They are all evaluated fully and not dismissed; but 
as you can imagine, we've had some out-of-this-world suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
One man proposed using a fleet of outdoor vacuum cleaners that could be rolled 
along the beach. "There's a lot more beach (sand) and oil than can fill those 
bags," Necarsulmer lamented. 
</P>
<P>
Another caller suggested spreading sawdust along the surf line to absorb the 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Game spokesman Patrick Moore said his office, too, has received its 
share of novel ideas. One balloon company representative called to inquire 
whether tankers could be required to carry large balloons that could be filled 
with oil in the event of a spill. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup crews, however, have been sticking to the tried-and-true -- skimmers at 
sea and beach workers armed with absorbent pads and booms. 
</P>
<P>
Further, officials have specifically decided against using any kind of 
dispersant, which could break up the oil on the water's surface but pose a 
threat to wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
The adherence to traditional methods comes as a tough break for the legitimate 
entrepreneurs who see the oily waters off Orange County as an ideal proving 
ground for their products. 
</P>
<P>
A Phoenix-based salesman armed with swatches of Wollastic Fiber walked up and 
down Huntington Beach in vain last weekend trying to demonstrate the product's 
oil-absorbing qualities for any official who would watch. 
</P>
<P>
"I could do a better job than those little diapers they're using down there," 
said Jeff Nickum, who represents Envirocology Inc. 
</P>
<P>
F.P. Woll &amp; Co. of Philadelphia developed the coconut-fiber material as 
padding for seat cushions. Company officials say the material has tremendous 
potential for cleaning up oil spills -- if only officials would be willing to 
give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done everything we can think of," said Fred Woll II, the company's 
president, about trying to get his product considered. "We have been to 
everyone we can think of." 
</P>
<P>
The makers of Oil Spill Eater have not had much luck either. Executives of Sky 
Blue Chems of Dallas said they believe that had their product had been sprayed 
onto the oily seas soon after the spill, the petroleum would have been 
neutralized within 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got 100 drums (of the solution) in Las Vegas that could mitigate 275,000 
gallons of crude," Sky Blue Chairman Steve Pedigo said. "We could have it there 
in four hours. We had enough to do the entire job when it first happened. That 
oil would have never come ashore." 
</P>
<P>
Nickey Petroleum executives didn't lose any time in letting officials know they 
were ready with their BioSolve oil neutralizer. Kearns said he called British 
Petroleum the night of spill but that "they indicated they had everything well 
under control." 
</P>
<P>
Kearns said, however, that the skimmers were able to collect only a small 
percentage of the oil before it came ashore. BioChem, a dispersant that 
encapsulates the broken oil molecules before they sink, could have safely 
stopped the slick, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
"I (heart) the KGB!" 
</P>
<P>
It was a slogan I hadn't expected to see. 
</P>
<P>
But there it was, emblazoned on neckties being sold at an artists' flea market 
in a Moscow park. 
</P>
<P>
And they were selling like hot cakes. 
</P>
<P>
Now, by most accounts, the Soviet people are a cynical bunch who tend to look 
at the sweeping reforms taking place inside the Kremlin with a great deal of 
skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
But for even the most casual visitor to Moscow these days -- and that's what I 
was -- it's obvious that things are changing. 
</P>
<P>
Take soldiers, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them are actually smiling. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
And not only is it possible to capture this remarkable event with your camera, 
it's also possible now to talk with them in public. 
</P>
<P>
One morning in a busy coffee shop, for example, I ended up in a line with two 
young army officers just back from a tour of duty in East Germany. Before I 
knew it, they had bought me coffee and a pastry and invited me to join them for 
what turned out to be a 30-minute conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Their English was marginal and my Russian nonexistent, but somehow we ended up 
talking about everything from pop music to perestroika. And when I asked them 
if I could take their picture -- no problem. In fact, they looked disappointed 
when I stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the U.S. Embassy the very next day, a Soviet army guard not only agreed 
to pose with me but hammed it up on camera by pointing at my new artificial-fur 
hat and laughing. (OK, so the hat looked a little funny. What do you expect for 
20 rubles?) 
</P>
<P>
And this new openness seemed to be everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
If you think New York cabbies are opinionated, try listening to a Moscow cabbie 
these days. A typical cab scenario would be speeding through the city at 60 
m.p.h. with a Duran Duran tape blaring while the cabbie rants and raves about 
the sorry condition of the streets (and hits some gigantic potholes to prove 
his point). 
</P>
<P>
Visit a "Sports Club" (the closest thing to our health clubs) and you're 
immediately surrounded by young people curious about your colorful workout 
clothes and complaining that American muscle magazines aren't available at 
their newsstands. All of this is given a little extra twist by the giant poster 
of Arnold Schwarzenegger in full combat gear staring down at you from its 
prominent place on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The schools are full of students learning English as quickly as they can, and 
using it. They are intelligent, probing kids, very curious about American 
culture. After finding out I was from Los Angeles, they asked if I lived close 
to Michael Jackson and also wanted to know, "Is it true there are some 
Americans who still hate us?" 
</P>
<P>
But nowhere is the new openness more evident than in the field of art. I'm not 
talking about the art that hangs in galleries and museums; I'm talking about 
the souvenir art available to the masses. There may not be much bread on the 
shelves, but the sidewalks and parks are full of stuff that's creative, 
provocative and fun. 
</P>
<P>
Izmailovo Park is a few miles from the center of Moscow and is filled every 
Sunday with people flocking to the weekly flea market. The market sprang up 
from nowhere a few months ago and is an example of private enterprise gone 
berserk. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of small stands sell everything from old records to used clothing. But 
the stands with the most people crowding around were selling items that only a 
short time ago would have been inconceivable in this country. 
</P>
<P>
How about a matreshka doll? You know, the traditional Russian doll that comes 
apart with ever smaller dolls inside. Well, the matreshka doll on sale here was 
just a little different. It started with Gorbachev, came apart to reveal a 
smaller Brezhnev, a smaller Khrushchev, a still smaller Stalin, and finally a 
minuscule Lenin. This was a hot item. 
</P>
<P>
And then there were the rubber masks. 
</P>
<P>
They were one of the most extraordinary sights of my entire three-week journey. 
</P>
<P>
Rubber masks of Gorbachev -- an uncanny likeness complete with birthmark on the 
forehead -- pinned up on a great cork board. Everyone crowded around for a 
look. Lots of chuckles and smiles and some buyers. One woman shook her head and 
said: "Why should I buy a mask of Gorbachev? I see him all the time on TV." 
</P>
<P>
The Gorbachev masks were displayed next to masks of Stalin, which had been 
molded to look as frightening as possible. The squinting eyes and scowling face 
gave me goose bumps. 
</P>
<P>
And next to that, a long board filled with biting political cartoons: 
Watercolors and pencil drawings making fun of Gorbachev and his policies and 
depicting past Soviet leaders as buffoons -- or worse. 
</P>
<P>
One cartoonist selling his work was a 17-year-old student whose mother told me 
he was occasionally taken to police headquarters and lectured about the 
impropriety of making present Soviet leaders look bad. 
</P>
<P>
"When they call me and tell me they have my son, I explain to them that he is 
not breaking any law and they always send him home," his mother said. "I'll be 
glad when he's no longer a minor so I won't get the calls." 
</P>
<P>
None of these items, by the way, has a set price. The sellers love to wheel and 
deal, especially when they find out you have dollars or something to trade. 
</P>
<P>
More brisk business is done by the poster sellers in the Moscow subway. This 
underground metro system was built as a showcase by Joseph Stalin, but the 
hottest item in the subways these days are the girlie posters plastered 
everywhere. And while not quite X-rated by U.S. standards, they're 
revolutionary by Soviet standards and are causing quite a stir. 
</P>
<P>
Want to buy an "authentic Russian army watch," a rabbit hat or a lacquer box? 
Want to change dollars into rubles at black-market rates? (Twenty to the 
dollar, as compared with the official rate of six to the dollar). Then all you 
have to do is go to Red Square and stand in front of Lenin's tomb. You'll be 
able to do business very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Right in front of Lenin's Tomb. 
</P>
<P>
It's all very bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
But for even the most casual visitor to Moscow these days, it's obvious that 
things are changing.

LET'S BREAK A DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
DIVORCE: TRUMP-WATCHERS ALREADY ARE CHOOSING SIDES IN THE BILLION-DOLLAR 
BUST-UP OF DONALD AND IVANA. BUT ONLY TIME WILL TELL WHO HOLDS THE TRUMP CARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If bumptious billionaire Donald Trump manages to divide his considerable spoils 
with wife Ivana according to their prenuptial agreement, it will be the deal of 
his lifetime. But he won't win without a fight. Because Trump vs. Trump is 
already sizing up to be the biggest divorce bout of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
The man behind "The Art of the Deal" isn't shy about touting his phenomenal 
deal-making ability -- make that artistry, by Trump's measure -- which has 
enabled him to amass a staggering $1.7-billion fortune, according to Forbes 
magazine. And if the prenuptial agreement should fend off a challenge, the 19th 
richest man in America will still be in that incredibly rarefied neighborhood. 
The much-revised agreement, barely two years old, would leave Ivana no more 
than a relatively paltry $25 million, their 45-room mansion in Greenwich, 
Conn., and custody of their three children. 
</P>
<P>
But her lawyers are crying fraud and calling the agreement "unconscionable," a 
term that packs more punch than ruffled feathers since it's a court test that 
could theoretically overturn the pact. They're saying that as grande dame of 
major Trump holdings like the Plaza Hotel -- a task for which she earned a 
notorious $1 a year plus all the dresses she could buy -- she performed more 
than the usual wifely duties. 
</P>
<P>
Trump reportedly has branded Ivana an arrogant clone of convicted hotelier 
Leona Helmsley, and his publicists -- super-flacks Howard Rubenstein Associates 
-- supposedly belittled her as little more than a figurehead businesswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Her lawyers are threatening to sue his publicists. 
</P>
<P>
Back to your corners. 
</P>
<P>
Remember Liz and Dick, Jackie and Ari -- their counterparts in coupledom, by 
New York gossip columnist reckoning? Now it's Ivana and The Donald, as she 
calls him, and divorce spectators are choosing up their sides of the proverbial 
aisle, led off by the gossip columnists. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Daily News' Liz Smith says Ivana walked out: "She still wants to 
be his wife. But the bottom line is . . . she won't give up her self-respect to 
do it. . . . Intimates say she had every chance to continue being Mrs. Trump by 
allowing her husband to live in an open marriage. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The New York Post's Suzy says The Donald walked out: "Get it straight. It's not 
Ivana who did the walking out. She wants to stay together at almost any price. 
. . . It's Donald who's breaking it up. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this tabloid-nutty town has been virtually papered with giddy 
headlines about the troubled Trumps. Witness the Daily News' "Ivana Better 
Deal" in fist-size type and its peppy "Ivana may bid one no-Trump." Or the 
concise "GIMME THE PLAZA," as the Post blared across its front page. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got everything but violence," says Richard Johnson, who edits the Post's 
gossipy Page Six. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's fascinated," says Newsday's James Revson. "They've always been the 
pivotal glamorous figures. They add a touch of Hollywood to New York." 
</P>
<P>
If the Trump tussle has captured the attention of even this busy metropolis, 
remember that New York is also a place where people thrill to any hint of 
unseemliness in the lives of the city's impossibly successful people, the gods 
of commerce and the arts who put the New York in New York. 
</P>
<P>
And that goes double for Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the fact that they've flaunted their wealth and their purchases and 
packaged themselves as this golden-haired royal couple who presided with great 
lust and fanfare, seeing people knocked down a notch has been catnip to the 
public, especially New Yorkers who are really tired of the Trump name 
everywhere," says professional Trump watcher and Spy magazine co-editor Graydon 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
So if the masses are relieved to hear that money can't buy love, as truisms 
tell, it can still borrow more than its share of influence, a fact that will 
doubtless interest Ivana's lawyer Michael Kennedy, whose mission it is to 
discredit the prenuptial pact. "There's not a lot of disagreement (in the 
marriage), because ultimately Ivana does exactly as I tell her to do," Donald 
Trump told Oprah Winfrey in happier days. 
</P>
<P>
Money also comes in handy when it comes to retaining expensive lawyers. 
Kennedy, once termed "experienced, elegant and deadly" by New York magazine, 
represented Jean Harris, convicted murderer of Scarsdale diet doctor Herman 
Tarnower. On Tuesday, Donald retained Stanford Lotwin and Jay Goldberg, whose 
profile got a boost in the Bess Meyerson trial, for which he represented 
Meyerson's companion, Andy Capasso. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a mere few days. The public beginning of the end of the Trumps' 
12-year marriage erupted Sunday in Smith's column, and later reports linked him 
with model-actress and erstwhile Miss Georgia finalist Marla Maples, who 
appeared in "Maximum Overdrive" and "The Secret of My Success." The tabs 
reported that Maples confronted Ivana in Aspen after Christmas, demanding that 
the wife surrender The Donald if she didn't love him. Donald Trump, 43, has 
repeatedly denied reports of his straying eye. Maples' spokesman Chuck Jones 
denied the Aspen incident happened, declining to comment on her relationship 
with Trump. 
</P>
<P>
But professional gossips for some time have linked him to beauties such as 
actress Catherine Oxenberg and skater Peggy Fleming, plus fashion designer 
Carolyne Roehm, married to business tycoon Henry Kravis, and Georgette 
Mosbacher, cosmetics queen and wife of Secretary of Commerce Robert A. 
Mosbacher. Smith pooh-poohs rumors about Roehm and Mosbacher, even though Trump 
has been known to relish reports of his supposed flirtations with the wives of 
his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Trump let it drop to the Daily News that he was being pursued by the 
former-model wife of Hartz Mountain titan Leonard Stern, touching off a 
predictable flurry of denials. Trump fanned a few flames himself when he 
recently fended off a Playboy interviewer's question about his taste for 
monogamy. And when Ivana, 40, reportedly went under the knife last year, 
bobbing a nose and boosting her breasts, speculation was rife that she was 
mimicking various blonde rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Still, such titillating bits have never really officially advanced beyond 
speculation until this week. "She's been protected by the press," says Smith, 
who has been hearing such rumors for years. "She's a nice woman and she's 
honest." 
</P>
<P>
"I periodically get what I consider to be a real tip and I report it out and it 
would disappear into air," says Deborah Mitchell, who writes for the New York 
weekly 7 Days. "I would get denials and all of a sudden, sources who had 
supposedly seen something firsthand, it became hearsay. It petered out." 
</P>
<P>
And somehow, with the Trumps' stronghold onto images that are larger than life, 
the end of their marriage is being viewed as the symbolic, if belated, end of 
the decade. "This monied hothouse that New York became in the '80s, the Trumps 
were certainly the exemplars of that value system, and if the '80s indeed ended 
on Dec. 31, this is another cap to that decade," observes Spy's Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Trumps' empire, embracing Trump Tower, the Plaza, Trump Castle 
and Trump airlines, isn't going anywhere. And there's nothing -- yet -- to keep 
either Trump from walking away with a piggy bank fit for the gods. 
</P>
<P>
Says local gossip Lance of the Hollywood Kids: "He's got a game show called 
Trump Card coming out in the fall, and I thought maybe he can have Ivana as his 
Vanna White, to help pay her off. But definitely, she should get a hundred 
million."

MAGAZINES: EGG AND ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY HATCH THEIR OWN IDEAS OF FUN; 
</P>
<P>
MAGAZINES: MALCOLM FORBES' LATEST VENTURE AIMS FOR THE CHIC CLUB-GOING SET. 
TIME INC. TARGETS MIDDLE AMERICA.

Rotten? Soft-boiled? Scrambled? 
</P>
<P>
When Malcolm Forbes decided to call his new, heavily hyped bicoastal night life 
magazine "Egg," he was inviting bad puns. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them seem appropriate. But before we give this primping Humpty Dumpty a 
shove, let's look on the sunny side of Egg -- which, along with Time Inc.'s new 
Entertainment Weekly, is giving itself a nightclub launch party in Los Angeles 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Forbes lost his bid to buy Interview and announced he would create 
Egg instead, folks in publishing circles have been wondering what it would be 
about and what the name means. 
</P>
<P>
Most assumed the title was inspired by Forbes' fixation with Faberge eggs. Most 
assumed it would concern itself with equally important issues. 
</P>
<P>
It seems they were wrong. In part. The name, according to editor Hal 
Rubenstein, doesn't mean a thing: "My sister pulled the word out of nowhere one 
day, and we thought it was funny." 
</P>
<P>
As for what the magazine is about, in his editor's note, Rubenstein writes: 
"Egg is about fun. That's it. Fun." 
</P>
<P>
In his own opening statement, which reads a bit like a groovy beatnik rap, 
Forbes informs us that "there's a whole, pulsating Life After Eleven we never 
knew was out there. In New York and Los Angeles and some other making/shaking 
cities around the country. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Egg, Forbes proclaims, will guide a vanguard of trendies through the chaos of 
clubdom, protecting elite chicsters from the heartbreaking humiliation of 
discovering a club or label that is already declasse. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the magazine is notable for its willingness to look at the 
gay aspects of the club scene. Rubenstein said that Egg has not intentionally 
slanted any articles to a gay readership. But, he adds, "If you're going to 
talk about night life in New York or Los Angeles and not talk about gays, 
you're lying." 
</P>
<P>
The problem for the magazine, which launched itself with 145,000 copies and a 
healthy base circulation of 40,000 -- not to mention 101 ad pages -- will be 
how to remain eclectic and still maintain a steady readership of any sexual 
preference. 
</P>
<P>
Rubenstein isn't worried. He was writing popular columns and features on food 
and entertainment for such publications as Details, 7 Days, Elle and Vanity 
Fair when Forbes invited him to join the Egg masthead. He thinks Egg will draw 
readers of from all those publications and others with its eclectic mix of 
features. 
</P>
<P>
The first issue of the monthly ($2.50) offers a seven-page guide to New York's 
night scene that is hip -- as well as graphically gripping, witty and 
utilitarian. 
</P>
<P>
Egg's charts track vital club statistics ranging from the degree of pain 
inflicted by various sound systems to "the number of well-known people seen," 
and "the percentage of men and women with ponytails." 
</P>
<P>
Club-goer's will want to know, for instance, that the median age at 
Stringfellows is 35, while only 20 at Love Transporter; that the maximum 
occupancy at Private Eyes is under 500 and the Palladium holds more than 2,000; 
that the ratio of black clothes to clothes of other colors is better than 
90%-10% at several clubs and more than 60%-40% at all but a few. 
</P>
<P>
(No irony is apparent when another article pities the poor East Germans for 
their monochromatic clothing.) 
</P>
<P>
Another interesting feature takes designer Geoffrey Beene out on a shopping 
spree along New York's proletariat 14th Street. The piece demonstrates that for 
under $100, someone who knows what they're doing can put together a 100% black 
outfit that looks a lot like the expensive 100% black outfits featured in 87% 
of Egg's fashion ads. 
</P>
<P>
Other articles and columns focus on food, gossip, and celebrities from various 
fields, most of whom won't be found in Fame magazine. One peculiar pictorial 
features New York firefighters in macho poses, one exposing his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Some readers may be annoyed by the magazine's often trivializing tone that 
occasionally wobbles towards a sort of cloying camp. 
</P>
<P>
"The Guys in the Freudian Slips," for instance, is a profile of three female 
impersonators who've made a splash on Broadway. One of them, Charles Busch, 
asserts in the piece that "behind every woman is a man who wants to get his 
hands on her lipstick." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the cover story on Mary Hart's legs is enough to send even a 
People magazine devotee in search of more substantial reading matter. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the magazine as a whole is too caught up in the spirit of Hart's 
own immortal words: "People today have an incredible interest in celebrities, 
and my legs are part of that." 
</P>
<P>
For all the energy and talent thrown into Egg, you'd think they'd dish up a 
better omelet. As it is, even the most mindless of trendies will find too much 
in the magazine that hardens their cerebral arteries. 
</P>
<P>
Using the ingenious rating scale devised by Entertainment Weekly, Egg gets a C. 
</P>
<P>
Like Egg, Entertainment Weekly is about fun. But it's about the kind of fun 
sensible, Middle Americans have at a reasonable hour, preferably in the comfort 
of their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
Even the folks who get a few hours of sleep a night, though, know that time is 
money. And for $1.98 an issue, Entertainment Weekly will tell readers, in very 
little time, how to get the most for their money. 
</P>
<P>
To do this, the publication spews forth dozens upon dozens of snippets, blurbs, 
factoids, and summaries of all the television programs, movies, videos, music, 
books and magazines an American might choose from in a week. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing elitist about this publication. It has a target circulation of 600,000 
for its first year. But it really covets all 250 million of us. Except, 
perhaps, the clubbies who subscribe to Egg. And a few overly serious New Yorker 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
The pervading philosophy of the magazine can be found in managing editor Jeff 
Jarvis' opening remarks. These are listed as 10 commandments, but the crux is 
revealed in No. 9: "Short is fine." 
</P>
<P>
"We won't have long, ponderous, pompous articles about show biz . . . , " 
Jarvis promises the Philistines. 
</P>
<P>
So a seven-paragraph review of a television show informs us: "Merely by 
reminding us of that period of history, 'A Nation of Law?' stirs up 
exhilarating ideas, arguments and emotions." 
</P>
<P>
Who has time to wonder what those ideas, arguments and emotions might be? 
</P>
<P>
This is sushi bar journalism -- USA Today on speed. But for what it is, it 
works well. The reviews -- even the whopping, approximately 1,000-word piece on 
the biography of poet John Berryman -- will not leave readers ruminating about 
the meaning of life. 
</P>
<P>
But they are smart, well-written, and often witty. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the news and notes running down the sides of the pages are distracting 
and irrelevant to even a die-hard television addict. 
</P>
<P>
But here and there this hailstorm of factoids turns up something fun or even 
significant (take, for instance, the "Grammy Hall of Shame," box, which makes 
graphically clear how absurd those music awards tend to be). 
</P>
<P>
On the Entertainment Weekly curve of grades from A+ to F, Entertainment Weekly 
gets a C+.

World Press Reviews Invasion of Panama 
</P>
<P>
What did the world think of the U.S. invasion of Panama? The February World 
Press Review presents the views of newspapers around the world. Reactions are 
pretty much what readers would expect. In Mexico's Excelsior, for instance, 
author Carlos Fuentes portrays the United States as a cowardly bully whose 
concern for Panama's democracy "is not convincing on a continent where 
Trujillo, Somoza, Pinochet, and the Argentine junta came to power and survived 
with U.S. assistance and goodwill." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, as The Australian saw things, "Ridding the world of the 
scourge of Noriega . . . is as worthwhile a cause as there can be." 
</P>
<P>
In the same issue, WPR presents it's annual catalogue of the most important 
stories of the year, as seen by various news agencies. As usual, there is 
considerable discrepancy between how U.S. news people see the world as opposed 
to their colleagues abroad. 
</P>
<P>
There was no mention on the U.S. lists, for example, of the fall of Indian 
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Japan's corruption scandal, the Death of Khomeini, 
the rise of environmental Green parties, the departure of P. W. Botha in South 
Africa, or other events foreign agencies saw as earthshaking. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, no foreign agency listed the San Francisco quake. 
</P>
<P>
Universally, however, agencies saw the decline of communism in Eastern Europe 
and the setback of the pro-democracy movement in China as extremely 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
There were, however, certain differences in how those events were seen. The 
pro-government China Daily, for example, listed the stories like this: 1. 
Chinese government puts down counterrevolutionary rebellion in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
2. Drastic changes in East European political situation.

<P>
WILL THE ACADEMY VOTERS CONSIDER THE YEAR'S ANGRIEST MOVIE, 'BORN ON THE FOURTH 
OF JULY,' TO BE THE BEST? DON'T BET ON IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Until they were answered Wednesday, the two big questions about the Academy 
Awards nominations were which four films would join Universal's "Born on the 
Fourth of July" on the best-picture ballot, and which four directors would join 
Oliver Stone on the list of best directors. The question now is, can Stone and 
"Born on the Fourth" hold on to win? 
</P>
<P>
Given the growing sentiment for Miramax's independently made Irish film "My 
Left Foot," Disney/Touchstone's "Dead Poets Society" and Warner Bros.' "Driving 
Miss Daisy" -- three of "Born on the Fourth's" competitors on the best-picture 
ballot -- the outcome seems very much in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"Born on the Fourth," based on the life of a man whose values were reshaped by 
his disillusionment with his and America's involvement in Vietnam, got the 
nominations predicted for it -- eight in all -- and still bears the strongest 
Oscar credentials. It is a major studio movie with social effects (much more 
popular this time of year than special effects) and is doing respectable 
business at the box office. But at a time when the Red Menace is in full 
retreat and America's political tempers are down, you have to wonder if the 
voters will consider the year's angriest movie its best. 
</P>
<P>
All four of "Born on the Fourth's" rivals are smaller, calmer pictures with 
inspirational messages that are downright sanguine by comparison. "Dead Poets 
Society" is the tale of a free-thinking English teacher's effect on 
intellectually constricted youths in a New England prep school. "Field of 
Dreams" revives traditional American ideals in a fantasy about a farmer who 
works out unsolved problems with his father by calling the ghosts of baseball 
past to workouts in his corn field. "Driving Miss Daisy" takes a leisurely look 
at black-white civility in the South through the 25-year relationship between a 
Jewish matron and her sagely chauffeur. "My Left Foot" manages to make both 
uplifting and entertaining the life of the severely disabled Irish author and 
painter Christy Brown. 
</P>
<P>
On mood alone, any one of these films might beat "Born on the Fourth." But 
traditional voting patterns with academy members give "Dead Poets Society" and 
"My Left Foot" the best chances. Like "Born on the Fourth," they were also 
nominated for best director and best screenplay, a trifecta that's almost 
imperative for a best-picture winner. 
</P>
<P>
In analyzing the nominations, it's important to remember that except for the 
best-picture category, the nominations are made by the individual branches of 
the academy. That explains how Woody Allen received nominations for both best 
director and for best original screenplay while his opinion-splitting "Crimes 
and Misdemeanors" was overlooked for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
There were notable omissions Wednesday, as usual. "Roger &amp; Me" didn't make 
the documentary-feature slate and the two Jacks -- perennial Oscar nominees 
Jack Lemmon and Jack Nicholson -- did not make the final five among best 
actors. Rob Reiner's highly popular "When Harry Met Sally" received just one 
nomination, for Nora Ephron's screenplay. Gus Van Sant's "Drugstore Cowboy," a 
small but very accessible film that won the Los Angeles, New York and National 
Society of Film Critics' awards for best screenplay, was shut out altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the directors' branch to nominate any one of the three directors 
of black-themed films -- "Do the Right Thing's" Spike Lee, "Glory's" Edward 
Zwick and "Driving Miss Daisy's" Bruce Beresford -- is a troubling footnote to 
the list of the year's best achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Lee's omission is the one surest to rile most film critics. In a 
soon-to-be-published American Film magazine poll of 80 critics, Lee topped the 
list of directors and "Do the Right Thing" led all pictures. Lee did get a 
nomination Wednesday for his screenplay, but it was his boldness as a director 
taking an uncompromising look at race relations in inner-city Brooklyn that 
most influenced critics. 
</P>
<P>
"Glory," whose combination of history lesson, spectacle and critical success 
made it a perfect Oscar candidate, was omitted from the best picture, director 
and screenplay ballots, though the film received five other nominations. The 
fact that two black actors were nominated -- Morgan Freeman for "Driving Miss 
Daisy" and Denzel Washington for "Glory" -- hardly reflects a year that 
produced the most first-rate, mainstream black-themed films in history. 
</P>
<P>
But the most glaring of all the omissions was Bruce Beresford from the 
best-director list. "Driving Miss Daisy" led all films with nine nominations, 
and could have taken the front-runner label away from "Born on the Fourth" had 
Beresford also been nominated. The last time a movie received as many 
nominations without receiving one for its creative leader was in 1986 when "The 
Color Purple" (another black-themed film with a white director) got 11 
nominations but failed to land Steven Spielberg on the best-director list. 
</P>
<P>
"The Color Purple" did not win any Oscars, but the snub of Spielberg was 
mitigated personally by his winning the Directors Guild of America award that 
year. Beresford failed to get a nomination from either group. 
</P>
<P>
Only three of this year's DGA nominees made it onto the Oscar ballot. DGA 
nominees Rob Reiner ("When Harry Met Sally") and Phil Alden Robinson ("Field of 
Dreams") were displaced on the academy's best-director list by Kenneth Branagh 
("Henry V") and Jim Sheridan ("My Left Foot"). 
</P>
<P>
If the academy's 4,800 voting members follow traditional patterns, they will go 
for one of the three movies whose directors were also nominated. Tradition also 
favors films whose directors win the DGA award (only three times since 1949 has 
the DGA winner not also won the Oscar). That would make Oliver Stone's "Born on 
the Fourth" and Peter Weir's "Dead Poets Society" the leading contenders for 
the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
But in a year that has seen five pre-Oscar best-picture awards -- from four 
critics groups and the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. -- go to five different 
pictures, all bets are off. This year's Oscar show could go the way of 1982's, 
when "On Golden Pond" and "Reds" split several of the major awards and 
"Chariots of Fire" slipped in to win for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
The wise money in office Oscar pools, as at race tracks, will be on the 
favorite, which still figures to be "Born on the Fourth of July." But the odds 
are not as prohibitive as they seemed a few weeks ago. "Born on the Fourth" is 
not the runaway box-office hit that made Stone's "Platoon" impossible to ignore 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Among the best-picture nominees, "Dead Poets Society" is the top wage earner, a 
summer release that grossed $96 million (10th best on the year's box-office 
list) and overcame the industry's infamously short memory during the 
nominations period. 
</P>
<P>
"Driving Miss Daisy" has been surprisingly commercial, considering its subject 
matter, and is getting a boost at just the right time. Warner Bros., which 
elsewhere suffered disappointments with the shut-out of "Roger &amp; Me" and 
the general dismissal of "Batman," has just eased "Driving Miss Daisy" into 
wide national release. Its continued popular success could persuade enough 
voters to forsake their director/picture tandem voting behavior and drive "Miss 
Daisy" all the way. 
</P>
<P>
But don't be surprised if the smallest film in the field, "My Left Foot," ends 
up with the biggest prize. Its nominations for best screenplay and best 
direction were not unusual, since the director and writer branches of the 
Academy are small. But the fact that it received enough votes from the general 
membership to place it on the best-picture ballot indicates more support than 
almost anyone imagined it had.

NO BLACK ACTRESSES? PLAY MAY BE DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana's Alternative Repertory Theatre is looking for four black actresses 
to cast in its next offering, "Yalla Bitch," a coming-of-age drama about a 
young black woman. 
</P>
<P>
But when nobody showed up at an open audition earlier this week, artistic 
director Patricia L. Terry said the storefront theater may drop the play, which 
is to run from April 6 to May 27. 
</P>
<P>
"We're holding another audition," she said. "We'd settle for one black actress 
for the lead. If we can't find her, we'll have to look for another show." 
</P>
<P>
Terry, who is white, speculated that the title of the drama by Lorna Hill -- a 
black playwright from Buffalo -- might have offended minority actors and kept 
them from showing up. JAN HERMAN

GUITARIST EVANS JOHNS SEES A LOT OF THE U.S.A. IN HIS OLD CHEVROLET; 
</P>
<P>
ROCK: HE'S ON THE ROAD 300 DAYS A YEAR AND HAS PUT 240,000 MILES ON HIS VAN. 
THE NEXT STOP IS TONIGHT, WHEN HE PERFORMS AT BOGART'S IN LONG BEACH. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whoever coined the ad phrase, "See the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet," would have 
had to go on an industrial-grade binge before imagining how guitarist Evan 
Johns would take that slogan to heart. 
</P>
<P>
Johns, who rolls into Bogart's in Long Beach tonight fronting Evan Johns and 
the H-Bombs, has clocked more than 240,000 miles on his blue 1975 Chevy 350 van 
(with the original engine no less) as he spends about 300 days a year 
crisscrossing the country. When not behind the wheel, Johns can typically be 
found on a nightclub stage with drummer Jim Starboard and bassist Steve Riggs 
howling and hammering out his particularly unfettered version of rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to get a Chevrolet endorsement," suggests Johns in a voice that, in 
its softer moments, has been likened to a cross between Popeye and Howlin' 
Wolf. "Mr. Blue," however, might not be a vehicle the folks at Chevy would 
particularly care to be associated with. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever seen this truck?" Johns asked. "It's a piece of work. All the 
way around it's totally scathed. There's a club owner in Houston who wants to 
buy it, cut it in half and hang it from the ceiling, the way the Hard Rock Cafe 
does with classic cars. This would be the 'anti' version of that. It's ragged. 
It's all just bumper stickers what holds it together. We keep finding dents we 
didn't know were there, and the only way we know they're new is they're not 
rusty yet." 
</P>
<P>
True to form, Johns was calling from a roadside pay phone while making a pit 
stop in Santa Barbara for gas and crackers. His favorite road cracker?: "I 
don't know, anything that's yellow or orange." 
</P>
<P>
Long before his van rolled off the assembly line, Johns was on the move. A 
persistent runaway from his McLean, Va., home, before he was college-age he had 
crossed the country 11 times, hitching or riding rails. "Between 13 and 18 I 
went everywhere. I came out here the first time in 1969. I was 13 and wanted to 
see San Francisco. But it was all screwed up. It wasn't no fantasy land. I've 
looked for them, and they don't exist. That's one thing I learned." 
</P>
<P>
During his stints at home, Johns learned some of his guitar craft from bluesmen 
Mississippi John Hurt and the Rev. Gary Davis, and later from guitarist's 
guitarist Danny Gatton. Once he began playing professionally, he became one of 
the hottest acts on the Washington scene, which, according to Johns, wasn't 
saying much. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a government town, and no musician makes it out of there. They all 
have to move: Roberta Flack, Duke Ellington, Roy Clark, Roy Buchanan, all of 
them had to move to get noticed." 
</P>
<P>
That was the case with Johns, who relocated to Austin, Tex., to do a stint with 
the LeRoi Brothers. Shortly after, he persuaded his band to follow him down, 
and he resumed playing his own music. While Austin is a city with more hot 
guitarists than parking meters, John's blend of fret-board technique and 
recklessness stood out, and he was one of the featured players on the 1985 
Grammy-nominated "Big Guitars From Texas" compilation album. 
</P>
<P>
Johns has a fairly succinct statement of purpose: "I like to get up there and 
make a bunch of . . . (choice expletive) racket is what I like." 
</P>
<P>
While often classed as a roots rocker, he balks at the notion that he's playing 
retro-rock. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is how music should sound right now, in this day and age. It's 
rock 'n' roll, the definition of rock and roll. Not rock, we've got some roll 
left, you know what I mean? Nowadays Metallica is called rock 'n' roll, and 
there ain't no roll; they never swing. You've got to swing on occasion. We'll 
do waltzes, I don't care. Rock 'n' roll is everything. It's not just one style. 
I'd like to hear a heavy metal band do a mambo." 
</P>
<P>
A representative sampling of Johns' racket can be heard on his current album, 
"Bombs Away," which, oddly enough, is on the audiophile-oriented Rykodisc 
label. The album was produced by ex-E Street Band bass player Gary Tallent, who 
became a fan of Johns back in his Washington days. Tallent had been slated to 
produce Johns' 1986 "Evan Johns and the H-Bombs" album, but an 18-month 
hindrance known as the "Born in the U.S.A." tour got in the way. 
</P>
<P>
On "Done By Me" on the "Bombs Away" album, Johns sings "Well this rockin' ain't 
no way of life / Least that I can say it's done by me." He does feel a 
musician's life is a mixed blessing. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a dog I can't even take care of. My buddies have to. So how am I 
going to look after a wife or children? But I can't make a living if I don't 
travel. But that's the way it is. It's kind of like if you're in the Army and 
you say 'Well, I'm a lifer.' I can't quit. I play music. So I'll do it until 
the day I die, and that's all there is to it. I don't know how to do anything 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Another of the album's songs, "Lessons That Burn," was drawn from his 
experience with the "Big Guitars From Texas" album. "We were sure ripped off on 
that one. Everyone else involved has gotten checks from that album, except for 
the musicians that actually played on it." Hoping to avoid that experience 
again, Johns and the other Austin musicians involved are planning a second 
album, a live one this time, that they will release on their own. 
</P>
<P>
He considers his own misadventures to be among the least of the indignities 
suffered in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
"The perfect show for me would be to open up for Little Richard and Jerry Lee 
Lewis, and back both of them up. They're the greatest rock 'n' rollers of all 
time, and neither of them even have a recording contract! I mean they're 
national treasures! This is Bach and Beethoven, centuries from now. But the 
record companies are not into music; they're into sales, and the two living 
greatest rock 'n' rollers, bar none, aren't recording. Nobody alive that I know 
will ever touch them. I don't care about the Bob Dylans, U2 or the 
Springsteens. Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard 100 years from now will be 
recognized as the greatest. These record companies are so lame I can't believe 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've listened to those old records and I've met a lot of those old guys, and 
let me tell you, those were musicians. That's where it comes from, and that's 
all I am. If it wasn't for them I might be washing dishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Evan Johns &amp; the H-Bombs will play at 9 tonight at Bogart's, 6288 E. 
Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach. Information: (213) 594-8975.

POP BEAT: YOU'LL HAVE TO ALTER NAME TO KEEP UP WITH JONESES; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: ORANGE COUNTY BAND SIGNS AWAY MONIKER TO BOSTON-BASED GROUP FOR A 
'CONSIDERABLE' CASH SETTLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the real world, tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of Joneses can coexist 
peacefully. In the rock 'n' roll world, there is room for only one. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the 1980s, as far as anyone can tell, rock's version of the Joneses 
was a raunchy guitar band hailing from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But not any more. The Joneses, Anaheim branch, have been muscled aside by some 
newer, upstart Joneses from Boston who have the extra clout of a major-label 
recording deal. 
</P>
<P>
After some testy legal negotiations, the Western Joneses last month signed away 
their name to the Eastern Joneses in exchange for a cash settlement that 
neither side would disclose. The band from Boston, which is about to release 
its debut album for Atlantic Records, will continue to be the just plain 
Joneses. The Anaheim group, led by founder and singer Jeff Drake, is henceforth 
to be known as the Hollywood Joneses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not supposed to say (how much the settlement was), but it was 
considerable," Drake said Wednesday. "More money than I've seen in my life, 
that's for sure. I bought a '68 Mustang, completely restored. I'm a big Mustang 
fan." 
</P>
<P>
Drake said the chain of events that led to him losing a name but gaining a car 
began last fall, when he received a phone call from a lawyer in New York 
representing the Joneses from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"He was really insulting. He said, 'Nobody's ever heard of your band, why don't 
you hang it up?' At first they offered me $50, or maybe it was $500. I said, 
'You've gotta be kidding.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Joneses had one big advantage in the name wrangling: They had 
registered "Joneses" as a trademark with the U.S. Department of Commerce -- 
something their West Coast counterparts had never done. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston band knew of no other Joneses when it registered the name, said John 
M. Waxman, the group's lawyer. "We don't deny that (the Western group) used it 
first, but as a matter of fact, we didn't know anything about them until I read 
an advertisement in Option magazine" that had been placed by Trigon Records, 
the small Los Angeles label that is releasing a new mini-album by Drake's 
Joneses. 
</P>
<P>
Drake said his Joneses would have had some strong ammunition of their own if 
the name-haggling had gone to court. The Joneses had released a 1986 album, 
"Keeping Up With the Joneses," on Dr. Dream Records, as well as an early '80s 
EP, "Criminals." They had gone on two national tours, and had been written up 
in such national music publications as Creem magazine and College Music 
Journal, which once put the Joneses on its cover. The band also has received 
coverage in The Times. Drake said his Joneses could have used that evidence to 
support a legal claim to the name. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have done things to really, really mess them up, but it would have 
put a crimp in our style" to get involved in a lawsuit over the name, he said. 
"So I decided to take the money and run." Drake said he would have preferred 
renaming his band the Downtown Joneses, but the Bostonians vetoed that in 
negotiations and insisted that Drake use another name he had proposed, the 
Hollywood Joneses. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Joneses' new mini-album has just been released (with an off-color 
title that can't be printed in full in this newspaper). First-pressing copies 
bearing the old Joneses name have been stickered over with tags saying "Now the 
Hollywood Joneses," Drake said. "On the next pressing they're going to change 
the art work" to reflect the new name. Besides Drake, who sings and plays 
guitar, the other Hollywood Joneses are drummer Mike Sessa, formerly of Ann De 
Jarnett's band, bassist Mike Occhiato and guitarist Jeff Moses. Drake said the 
band's first priority now is to find a manager and set up shows. 
</P>
<P>
As for the just-plain Joneses from Boston, they are profiled in the current 
issue of Musician magazine, and their debut album, "Hard," is due out shortly. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S IN A NAME, PART II: Another local band playing the name game is the Wild 
Cards. Maria Corvalan, co-manager of the veteran Orange County roots-rock band, 
says she was taken aback to find that a band called the Wild Cards had been 
booked last month to play at Peppers in Garden Grove. Those Wild Cards were a 
Top-40 club band, unlike Corvalan's Wild Cards, original rock contenders who 
have gained exposure through national touring, a beer company endorsement and a 
1988 album, "Cool Never Cold," on Chameleon Records.

John McEntee, booking agent for the Top-40 Wild Cards, said the group is going 
to switch rather than fight. "I think they just changed their name to Suzie and 
the Knockouts," he said. As for the roots-rock Wild Cards, they recently went 
through their second change of bass players in two years, with Dave Carpenter 
replacing Albert Farias.

A HIT OUT OF THE BOX?: Record producer Jon St. James is getting excited about 
the prospects of Anything Box, the techno-pop band that relocated from New 
Jersey to Orange County last summer to work with St. James at his Formula One 
studio in La Habra. The group's first single for Epic Records, "Living in 
Oblivion," surfaced on the Billboard pop chart this week at No. 95. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had a buzz like this since 'Two of Hearts,' " St. James said. That 
Stacey Q song, produced by St. James, hit No. 3 on the Billboard chart in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Anything Box is hurrying to finish its debut album, tentatively titled "Peace." 
Singer Claude S. said that the sudden upswing in the band's fortunes is 
"scary," but also "really exciting. I'm getting calls from friends back East 
who are telling us they're hearing it on the radio." Dania Morales and Paul 
Rijnders are the trio's other members. 
</P>
<P>
BANDSTAND ROCKS AGAIN: Orange County's biggest club venue for rock 'n' roll is 
now the Bandstand in Anaheim, at least on Wednesday nights. The 1,000-capacity 
club, at 1721 S. Manchester Ave., has started a series of weekly concerts 
produced by promoter Joe Schultz of Positive Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz said he will interweave shows by local hard rock bands with concerts by 
nationally known headliners, including the Stray Cats, who play Feb. 28, and 
Junkyard, on March 7. Next Wednesday, local acts Jimmy Richardson, Chyna and 
Wisdom will appear. On most other nights, the Bandstand features local country 
bands. Information: (714) 956-1410.

HUSBANDS PITCH IN FOR CHILDHELP USA BENEFIT

"We are the lucky ones," said Kathy Nagy, addressing a banquet hall full of 
well-tended ladies and a few tuxedoed gents. "We're living the blessed lives." 
</P>
<P>
Nagy and Ginni Valley co-chaired a fashion show luncheon at the Irvine Hilton 
last week that raised about $100,000 for the Orange County chapter of ChildHelp 
USA, a national organization that offers treatment programs and shelter for 
severely abused children. 
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the lunch bunch from a podium on the dais, Nagy told the 870 guests 
that responsibility came with their privileged lives. Then she told a story 
about the first time she saw someone less fortunate than she and thought, 
"There but for the grace of God go I." 
</P>
<P>
It was thoughts like these -- and fashions -- that got this crowd into chic 
suits and out to a $60-per-person lunch last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, guests faced a line of fast-talking raffle-ticket salesmen who 
just happened to be the husbands of the party planners. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys can charm the ladies right out of their money," said co-chair 
Valley, "but they are taken! They're husbands! There's mine, over there." 
</P>
<P>
Among the 20 ticket hawkers was Al Nagy, who reported that he and the other 
spouses were pressed into service last year "and we doubled (raffle ticket 
sales). . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Describing his sales technique as "loving," Al Nagy offered this mock pitch: 
"Hey, c'mon, you came here to eat and drink and have a good time -- your 
husband can afford (raffle tickets). Put some money in this hat!" 
</P>
<P>
Also hawking prizes was Don Minkoff, who held a ticket-stuffed top hat in one 
hand and his 5-month-old granddaughter, Brittany Forsdick, in the other. 
</P>
<P>
During the luncheon program, a "Children's Friend" award was given to Newport 
Beach resident Carol Newett, who in the past 22 years has been a foster mother 
to more than 100 babies, many of whom had medical problems or were born 
addicted to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Before the ceremony, Newett said she found it "heartbreaking" to see so many 
drug-addicted babies come into the foster-care system and so many older 
children who have been sexually abused. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems like the problems are getting worse," she said. "At the same 
time, it's getting harder to find foster (parents) and adoptive homes. I think 
a lot of people who want to adopt now want a perfect child, and we just don't 
have any of those." 
</P>
<P>
The fashion show featured the spring collection of New York-based designer 
Laura Marolakos, who was chosen for the occasion by Billur Wallerich of Saks 
Fifth Avenue at South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the event will be used to underwrite expenses of ChildHelp USA's 
residential treatment center in Beaumont, Calif. The Village, as the center is 
called, is home to 80 severely abused or neglected children, 3 to 12 years old. 
They are attended by psychologists, therapists, teachers and nurses and are 
allowed to stay for up to 18 months before returning to their natural parents 
or to be placed with adoptive or foster parents.

JOSEPH N. BELL: POWERING YOUR WAY INTO HARNESS RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the truths about columnists that I have been unlearning for several 
years now is the myth of power. 
</P>
<P>
I always believed that anyone with a column in a major newspaper would be 
inundated with invitations to mega-parties, power assignations and exotic 
offers to sell out. I imagined myself stiffing all of these offers with a stern 
little lecture about the sanctity and probity of the press. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened? 
</P>
<P>
Not much. 
</P>
<P>
I'm as far from the Orange County social swim as I ever was, there are no 
assignations in view and not a single corporation has made me an offer that 
would give me an opportunity to deliver my sanctity speech. 
</P>
<P>
So you can imagine how exciting it was when into this vacuum galloped Orange 
County's only horse racing track: the Los Alamitos Racing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, I wrote a column that began: "I gamble whenever possible. . . ." 
A few days later, I received a funny letter from a man named Dick Feinberg, who 
is publicity director for harness racing at Los Alamitos track. Feinberg wrote 
that the gambling statement "naturally attracted my attention, and I'm here to 
uncomplicate your life." Enclosed were two passes to the race track and a 
parking sticker. 
</P>
<P>
I reasoned that my speech didn't apply here because if I went, I'd probably 
give them a chunk of my money through the mutual windows because I know nothing 
about harness racing. Even so, it took a couple of months before I decided to 
use the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
My oldest daughter and I went to Los Alamitos on a recent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The parking sticker didn't mean much since parking was free -- at least on this 
night -- and so was admission to the grandstand for senior citizens. But my 
passes were for the clubhouse, where my daughter and I had a pleasant dinner in 
a warm, glass-enclosed area that offered a full view of the track. We even had 
a little TV set on our table to watch a close-up of the action we could see at 
a distance through the window. 
</P>
<P>
I'd never watched harness racing before and wasn't sure what to expect. Turns 
out that instead of sitting on the backs of horses, the jockeys -- who are 
called drivers in harness racing -- ride in little buggies behind the horses 
and go careening around the track in these rigs at a rather remarkable speed. 
Everything else is the same as thoroughbred racing; the programs and form 
sheets are full of the same unintelligible numbers that the clever visitor can 
supposedly translate into winning bets. 
</P>
<P>
I had phoned Feinberg -- at his suggestion -- to tell him we were coming and he 
dropped by our table. He's an elfin type who talks as funny as he writes. He 
gave us a short course in harness racing which got away from me rather quickly. 
I just kept remembering Prof. Harold Hill in "The Music Man" telling the 
townspeople they were in big "Trouble" when: 
</P>
<P>
". . . Some outta-town Jasper tells about horse-race gamblin'. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a wholesome trottin' race. No! 
</P>
<P>
"But a race where they set down right on the horse! 
</P>
<P>
"Like to see some stuck-up jockey-boy settin' on Dan Patch? 
</P>
<P>
"Make your blood boil? Well I should say." 
</P>
<P>
I got a sense of what the "trottin' " people are like when Feinberg introduced 
us to a man named Lloyd Arnold who was entertaining a party at the next table. 
Arnold is a tall, lanky, down-home sort of guy who last fall headed up a group 
that bought the floundering Los Alamitos track from Hollywood Park and is 
determined to turn it around. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the dining room has been spruced up considerably -- a face lift 
planned for the whole plant -- but the biggest difference, Arnold told me, is 
that he has brought in a retinue of experienced horses and drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want non-professionals," he said. "We want our customers to be able 
to depend on our horses and drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold's own professional credentials are impressive. 
</P>
<P>
He's a successful farmer and livestock owner from Iowa who took some of his 
horses to a racing meet in Chicago two decades ago and got hooked. He has bred 
two world champions, has twice been harness racing's Man of the Year and got 
into race track management in Sacramento in 1976. He had a previous three-year 
run at Los Alamitos (1979-82) and the track has been going downhill ever since. 
Now he comes back as an owner -- the first time in 100 years in California that 
harness interests have owned their own track. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a total refurbishing of the racing plant, he has other plans too 
-- office buildings, a new hotel, an upgraded golf course on the same site. 
When I suggested that the Los Alamitos track had been something of a dog and 
asked Arnold how he expected to turn it around, he smiled his down-home smile 
and said: "We know race track management. That's what we do." 
</P>
<P>
I believed him. So the rest of the evening I tried to see how he was betting, 
not very successfully. He probably would have told me had I asked him, but it 
was more fun -- if less financially rewarding -- to try and sneak a look. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, my daughter and I were doing rather well on our own until two of our 
horses ran into each other at the end of a triple on which we already had two 
winners. But a long shot came through for us in the last race, and we actually 
went home a little bit ahead, the first time that has happened to me at a race 
track for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
So I may try out my free parking pass again. 
</P>
<P>
The harness racers will be around until late April, and I was just beginning to 
get the hang of handicapping those little buggies. Forget about all the numbers 
on the program. What you do is look for a horse's name that resembles the name 
of an old girlfriend or some event in your life that you remember warmly. Then 
bet the hell out of it.

DEMOCRATS OK PRIMARY IN MARCH; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: CALIFORNIA WOULD GAIN MAJOR CLOUT IN THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION 
PROCESS. THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR MUST APPROVE EARLIER DATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
California's chances of becoming a major, early player in the presidential 
nominating process improved dramatically Wednesday when a national Democratic 
Party panel decided to let the state move up its 1992 presidential primary from 
the traditional June date to the first Tuesday in March. 
</P>
<P>
The state Legislature and the governor must approve advancing the date, and 
there are indications that they are willing to do so. 
</P>
<P>
If the state's presidential primary is changed, it could dramatically alter 
nomination politics, dominated for nearly two decades by the small states of 
Iowa and New Hampshire, which usually hold their contests in February, and by 
New York, where the presidential primary is in April. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the southeastern states have become a more important force by 
organizing a "Super Tuesday" collection of primaries in March. 
</P>
<P>
The intense national focus on early results has long given Iowa and New 
Hampshire a clout in the nominating process far out of proportion to their 
delegate numbers. Critics have also complained that their populations do not 
reflect the demographics of the country. 
</P>
<P>
New York has also enjoyed enormous clout -- in 1984, Walter F. Mondale derailed 
Gary Hart's surging Democratic candidacy there and, in 1988, Michael S. Dukakis 
and Jesse Jackson ended the candidacy of Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, even though California better reflects the country's demographics 
and has by far the most delegates, the state has been an afterthought in the 
nominating process because its June primary comes so late that the nominations 
are basically locked up by then. In 1988, for example, Democrats Dukakis and 
Jackson hardly bothered to campaign here. George Bush had wrapped up the GOP 
nomination on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last generation everything that has been done in the Democratic 
Party's rules game has been designed to make the nominating process a long, 
drawn-out, bloody battle that divides the party and leaves it unable to 
position itself for the general election," said consultant William Carrick, who 
managed Democratic Rep. Richard Gephardt's 1988 presidential bid. "If 
California moves up its primary, it will give the Democratic Party a decisive 
early battle to stop this nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
"For the Republicans, it will force them to leave those little all-white states 
and come to California, which is more diverse and has more mainstream 
Republicans," added Carrick, who is managing Democrat Dianne Feinstein's 1990 
bid for governor in California. 
</P>
<P>
One result of an earlier California role would likely be a spotlight on urban 
issues and immigration, which get no mention in early, small-state contests. 
</P>
<P>
The nominating process itself could be affected in major ways if California 
moves its primary up to March. 
</P>
<P>
Because it does not cost much to campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire, that has 
allowed unknown, under-financed candidates to compete. Jimmy Carter won Iowa 
with a thousand handshakes in 1976 and became an overnight phenomenon as he 
headed for the White House. Hart, dead broke, still upset Mondale in tiny New 
Hampshire in 1984 and very nearly took the front runner out of the contest 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
If California weighs in as early as March, the presidential candidates will 
face some tough choices. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, Iowa and New Hampshire will still go first, since those states so 
enjoy the economic benefits of the attention that their laws require them to be 
first in the nominating process. So the news media would still focus on them. 
</P>
<P>
But, if Wednesday's development in Washington goes forward, awaiting the 
candidates when they come out of the tiny states will be the monster. 
Campaigning in California, which will have 30 million people in 1992 spread 
over seven major media markets, is an enormous, expensive, television-driven 
endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
The prize, though, would also be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, California sent 336 delegates to the Democratic national convention. 
The party requires a division of them based on how each candidate does in the 
primary. The California Republican Party sent 175 delegates to its 1988 
convention and it was winner take all. 
</P>
<P>
Early primary campaigning activity is likely to be intensified in California in 
1992 by new state Democratic Party rules and the state party's eager chairman, 
former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. The new rules allow the party to endorse in the 
presidential primary. And Brown has indicated recently that he will encourage 
all would-be candidates to come out to the state early and compete for the 
party's support. 
</P>
<P>
There is still a ways to go before Wednesday's decision by the national 
Democratic Party leads to a new California primary date. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic National Committee has no legal power to block California from 
moving its primary date, but Wednesday's decision sent an important signal to 
those in the state who want to make the change. 
</P>
<P>
The California Assembly has already passed legislation to make the change, and 
Senate action could come as early as today. State Senate President Pro Tem 
David A. Roberti has now dropped his opposition to moving up the primary, 
according to an aide. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's backers in Sacramento are confident of passage, said Democratic 
officials in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's terribly important for a state as crucial as California to have 
an early impact on the nomination," said Democratic National Chairman Ron 
Brown, who led the cheering here for the California shift. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Democratic Party leaders anticipate that by having the nation's 
largest state weigh in early, the nomination competition would be speeded up. 
Thus the party's candidate would have more time to plan his attack on incumbent 
President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that gets the showdown states into the process quicker is better for 
us because it gets the nominating process over sooner," said Paul Tully, the 
party's national political director. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, though, as party leaders here acknowledged, the results of such a 
shift are hard to calculate in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"We always have unintended consequences," cautioned Don Fowler, chairman of the 
party's Rules and By-Laws Committee, which reviewed on Wednesday a draft of the 
new delegate selection rules for 1992. The rules are expected to get final 
approval from the Democratic National Committee next month in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
After both the state Assembly and Senate work out differences in the bills, it 
must be signed by Gov. George Deukmejian. Although the governor in 1988 opposed 
having the early primary, he has since been lobbied by both Republicans and 
Democrats who would like the state to have a greater impact on the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
The governor has "expressed support for moving up the date of the primary in 
presidential election years," said his deputy press secretary, Tom Beerman. 
"He'd be expected to sign" a bill to move up the primary. 
</P>
<P>
Because Democratic Party rules require that delegates be distributed by 
proportional representation, it is possible that the California results could 
be inconclusive since the delegates could be spread among many candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Republican rules permit the winner of the primary to get all the delegates. But 
with President Bush expected to seek reelection, a nominating contest seems 
unlikely in the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
The date of the California primary has not been a major issue among 
Republicans. The Republican National Committee traditionally gives the states a 
lot of leeway on when they want to hold primaries. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler could foresee other problems after Wednesday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate that other states will move up their primaries to compete with 
California's," he said. "If that happens, the support they all get on primary 
day might be dispersed, so that the nominating process would then be prolonged 
instead of speeded up. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a mechanical adjustment, the political impact of which is not 
necessarily cosmic," Fowler added. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the proposed California date change, Fowler's committee approved 
a change in the rules to begin the "window," the alloted time period for most 
delegate contests, on the first Tuesday in March instead of the second Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
By placing an expensive California primary so close to the front of the 
process, just before the sprawl of Super Tuesday, the Democrats will accentuate 
the importance of money in determining the next President. 
</P>
<P>
But many Democratic analysts point out that an early California primary might 
only raise the value of Iowa and New Hampshire, not diminish it. 
</P>
<P>
"In a situation where California moves up, it could create one of the most 
explosive weeks in a nominating calendar," said Democratic consultant Tom 
Donilon. 
</P>
<P>
Love reported from Los Angeles and Shogan from Washington. Contributing were 
Times political writers John Balzar and Ronald Brownstein. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
California voters have not had much say in picking presidential nominees 
because the primary election comes so late. The state Legislature is trying to 
change that for 1992, by moving the primary from June to March. On Tuesday, a 
Democratic Party rules committee gave the green light for the change. The state 
Senate is expected to approve the change, possibly this week. After the 
Assembly and Senate work out differences, the bill will go to Gov. George 
Deukmejian, who endorsed the concept last year.

TROOPS BATTLE MOBS IN SOVIET ASIAN REPUBLIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet security forces battled throughout Wednesday against rioting mobs in the 
Central Asian city of Dushanbe in an effort to restore order there and end the 
country's latest, and some of its fiercest, anti-government violence. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the deployment of more troops to Dushanbe, the capital of Soviet 
republic of Tadzhikistan, and tougher measures to enforce the state of 
emergency there, the situation continued to deteriorate throughout the day, the 
official Soviet news agency Tass reported, and government forces had not yet 
regained full control of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with firebombs and bottles of acid, the rioters for the third day 
attacked the headquarters of the Tadzhikistan Communist Party, demanding the 
resignation of the regional party leadership, Tass said, suggesting that an 
attempt to seize power was under way. 
</P>
<P>
The rioters also began assaulting Russians and other non-Tadzhiks on the 
streets and in their homes, according to Tass and other Soviet news media 
reports. Various ethnic groups reportedly began forming "self-defense 
detachments," largely composed of veterans of the Afghan war, to protect their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, harshly criticizing the rioters, 
called for stricter enforcement of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"The nation's destiny and the safety of our citizens is at stake," Gorbachev 
told the Supreme Soviet, the country's Parliament. "We must do everything to 
put out the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"We should crack down on those who, under the slogans of ethnic revival, draw 
people into a fight for their ambitions and selfish goals. This is a kind of 
chain reaction accompanied by an orgy of ethnic revival that draws people into 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev called in his speech for new laws to curb the ethnic violence that 
has plagued his reform effort over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The events in Dushanbe, where the flame has spilled over from Baku, speak of 
the great danger of inter-ethnic violence," he said, referring to the attacks 
last month by Azerbaijanis on Armenians in Baku and the subsequent efforts of 
the government to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the first vice president, said the new Supreme Soviet 
session will consider draft laws against instigating ethnic violence as well as 
other legislation on the introduction of states of emergency and the use of 
troops in civil disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers will also consider new legislation that makes the Soviet Union a 
more federal system, giving every major ethnic group a great deal of autonomy 
as the relationship between the central government and the constituent 
republics is defined. 
</P>
<P>
Armored vehicles, including tanks, were patrolling the streets under the state 
of emergency and the 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew, and the firing of automatic 
weapons could be heard over the telephone during calls to several government 
departments and newspaper offices in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The troops reportedly opened fire several times on groups of rioters and 
looters, killing as many as eight people Wednesday, according to reports from 
opposition groups in Dushanbe. Correspondents for state radio and television 
said they had seen the bodies, still lying in the street, of some of those 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
But the report of more fatalities was rejected by Communist Party and 
government officials, who put the total deaths over three days of clashes at 11 
or 12. 
</P>
<P>
They also denied as "totally unfounded" reports on Soviet television and Radio 
Moscow that 37 people had been killed in the first two days of clashes. 
</P>
<P>
The troops began regrouping late Wednesday, pulling back from many of their 
positions on the major thoroughfares of Dushanbe and positioning themselves 
around major government buildings. Commanding officers told Soviet journalists 
that the maneuver was "normal" in such situations, but it was welcomed by 
opposition activists who saw it as a conciliatory gesture before the funerals 
of those killed in the earlier clashes. 
</P>
<P>
There were also contradictory reports on the political situation, reflecting 
not only the confusion in the streets but the uncertainty about the ability of 
the Tadzhikistan Communist Party there to reassert its control. 
</P>
<P>
Tass and Soviet television reported that the Tadzhikistan party's Central 
Committee held an emergency meeting Wednesday to debate the situation and ended 
by confirming its support for the present leadership, including the party's 
first secretary, Kahkar Makhkamov, who had earlier offered his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
But journalists in Dushanbe said that Makhkamov had quit, along with 
Tadzhikistan President Gaibnazar Pallayev, and the republic's premier, Izatullo 
Khayeyev, and through their resignations managed to ease the confrontation 
between the rioters and security forces. 
</P>
<P>
The reported resignations brought cheers from the crowd outside the party's 
Central Committee building. 
</P>
<P>
Tass earlier Wednesday described the battle between the protesters and troops 
in Dushanbe. 
</P>
<P>
"Militants have been making attempts to reach the Tadzhik party headquarters 
since this morning,," the agency reported. "Crowds threw gasoline bombs, 
bottles with sulfuric acid and stones at the troops blocking the building's 
entrances." 
</P>
<P>
The rioting was touched off by rumors that Armenian refugees fleeing 
strife-torn Baku, Azerbaijan, would get preferential treatment and be assigned 
scarce new housing. 
</P>
<P>
Even when this proved to be false, the idea lingered on that Tadzhiks are not 
masters in their own land and that the government is a Russian or Soviet 
creation. 
</P>
<P>
Dushanbe residents said that the problems there have deeper roots -- high 
unemployment and an upsurge of Islamic fundamentalism among young people. 
</P>
<P>
"If you cannot run the republic," ran one of the anti-government slogans, 
"leave it to the clergy."

UNSOLD BONDS RAISED AS ISSUE IN TREASURER RACE

Waking up the quiet race for state treasurer, Democrat Kathleen Brown on 
Wednesday accused incumbent Republican Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes of delaying 
numerous public works projects by moving too slowly to sell $7 billion in bond 
measures approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that voters are being asked to approve another $5.1 billion in bonds in 
the June primary election, Brown told a group of Times reporters during a 
breakfast interview that Hayes has not "taken an aggressive enough approach" to 
selling the state's bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"The treasurer ought to be leading some sort of effort to determine why the 
bonds aren't being issued. If they aren't needed anymore, then we should be 
cleaning them off our books," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes conceded that he is waiting to sell $7 billion in bonds approved by 
voters over the last 16 years. But the treasurer, who is running for his first 
full, four-year term after being appointed last year by Republican Gov. George 
Deukmejian, suggested that nothing short of catastrophe would result if the 
state suddenly moved to sell the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Selling bonds faster than he has been doing, Hayes said, would "cost the state 
billions" in higher interest costs, jeopardizing the tax-free status of 
California's bonds and threatening the state's AAA bond rating. He said it 
would also rush massive school, water and prison construction projects before 
they are ready to leave the government planning incubator. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds, usually paid off over 20 years, are the state's traditional means of 
financing long-term building projects. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who spent the day making campaign stops in the capital, seemed eager to 
shift what promises to be a long and bruising campaign for state treasurer into 
high gear. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown and sister of ex-Gov. Edmund 
G. Brown Jr., the Democrat will face Compton City Treasurer Wesley Sanders in 
the June primary. But Brown clearly is looking toward the general election in 
November, taking swipes at both Hayes and his Republican primary opponent, 
Angela (Bay) Buchanan, a former U.S. treasurer under President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Brown described Buchanan to Times reporters as "an Orange County gal" who is 
off base in criticizing other candidates in the treasurer's race for accepting 
campaign contributions from financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Buchanan raised money for Reagan and Bruce Herschensohn, an 
unsuccessful Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1986, Brown said the 
GOP candidate "had a midnight conversion" on the contributions issue for 
"political purposes." 
</P>
<P>
But Brown, who was an elected member of the Los Angeles school board during the 
1970s and more recently a Los Angeles public works commissioner, spent most of 
her time talking about her differences with Hayes, who served as the 
Legislature's chief auditor before being appointed treasurer by Deukmejian. She 
drew Hayes' background as a career civil servant into her remarks at every 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Sacramento Press Club, Brown said, "When you put on the green 
eye shade and you start saying you cannot issue more than X billion dollars of 
bonds, you begin to ignore two things. One, what is the need? And two, what is 
the public telling you? The treasurer is an elected official and not a civil 
servant. The treasurer is there to solve problems and to respond to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, poking some fun at herself, said she had three key assets as a 
candidate: She is a woman, a Democrat and a Brown. Each, she said, would help 
her win votes. Then she got a laugh from members of the Press Club when she 
outlined her three main liabilities: being a woman, a Democrat and a Brown.

MONTOYA CASE TURNS THE TABLES FOR EX-SEN. SONG 
</P>

<P>
Almost 12 years ago, challenger Joseph B. Montoya drove veteran Sen. Alfred H. 
Song from the Legislature with a pointed reminder to voters that Song was under 
investigation by the FBI for suspected political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The tables turned Feb. 7 when Montoya himself was convicted of seven federal 
corruption counts of using his Senate office for personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
Song was never charged with a crime, but he went into political oblivion. 
Montoya, who took Song's seat as a "good government" candidate, may go to 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
But for Song the irony is beside the point. He holds Montoya responsible for 
wrecking his 16-year-long career in the Capitol and robbing him of the credit 
he feels he is owed for his legislative achievements. 
</P>
<P>
As for Montoya's current troubles, Song finds it impossible either to gloat 
over his successor's downfall or to express sympathy for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry for his family, but, in all candor, I don't like Joe Montoya for 
what he did to me in the election," Song told The Times in an interview in 
which he broke a self-imposed silence on the predicament of Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1978 Democratic primary, Montoya successfully seized upon the highly 
publicized investigation of Song as a political springboard to attack Song's 
ethics. Only days before the election, Montoya sent out a tabloid-style hit 
piece suggesting, as Song put it, that "I was going to be indicted tomorrow. I 
was dead (politically)." 
</P>
<P>
Song, formerly of Monterey Park, finished a distant third in a three-way race 
for the 26th Senate District seat. 
</P>
<P>
During the interview, the 70-year-old Song -- his hair now snowy white -- 
showed traces of his trademark cockiness as he surveyed the landscape of the 
past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
But he indicated he has not found peace. The father of four and grandfather of 
11, Song was anxious to put forward his record, contending that his 
accomplishments as a legislator have been overshadowed by the attention paid to 
his fall from power. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something like my last hurrah," he said, handing a reporter a 
newspaper clipping recalling Montoya's campaign attacks on his integrity and a 
sheaf of documents outlining Song's legal and political career. Included were 
copies of 1978 Senate and Assembly retirement resolutions commending Song's 
service. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled that shortly after his first election to the Assembly in 1962 as 
the Legislature's first Asian-American, he won enactment of pioneering 
legislation designed to protect minority voters from harassment at the polls. 
He called the bill "probably my proudest" achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he successfully carried major bills giving credit card customers greater 
protection from hidden costs and substantially toughening restrictions against 
sham appliance warrantees. He also routed through the Legislature a bill that 
overhauled the California evidence code. 
</P>
<P>
Song has conceded making "mistakes in judgment." But he said he did nothing 
illegal and attributed his fall to FBI "leaks," news media reports, a vengeful 
ex-wife and ultimately Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
But to this day, Song, an attorney and once considered one of the sharpest 
legal minds in the Legislature, insists that "I never knew what in the hell 
they were investigating me for." 
</P>
<P>
"There is one overriding question that I'll never find the answer to and it has 
troubled me for years -- that is the why of the investigation. . . . I will 
never know why, or what was behind it, or for what reasons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
News stories at the time reported that he received favors and expensive gifts 
from persons who had an interest in legislation. Song did not deny receiving 
gifts but insisted he never accepted anything in return for his vote or use of 
his legislative power. Two associates of Song were indicted on perjury charges 
but their trials ended in hung juries. 
</P>
<P>
From news accounts, Song said, he discovered that he was being investigated for 
accepting a membership from a prominent lobbyist in a tony Sacramento golf and 
country club. He said that before the investigation began in 1977 he repaid the 
lobbyist in increments for the membership. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like an almost daily occurrence that every time I'd pick up a paper 
or look at a television news program, there was something more about me, things 
I just could not believe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months after Song's defeat at the polls, the U.S. attorney issued a 
note saying "Prosecution is not warranted." 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving the Senate, Song -- who now lives in Sacramento -- has worked at 
a variety of part-time jobs, some of them patronage appointments from 
Democratic Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and Republican Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
A former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Song said he had figured 
he certainly would be in line to receive offers from powerhouse law firms. None 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
So, he left Sacramento and "hibernated" for a year in Los Angeles. In 1980, he 
returned to the practice of law, a short-lived venture. The next year, he was 
appointed by Brown to the Agricultural Labor Relations Board after Brown's 
first choice could not get confirmed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Deukmejian appointed him to the California Occupational Safety and 
Health Appeals Board. In 1985, Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp hired 
him as a special consultant on nursing homes and in 1986 he was named a deputy 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Song said he once asked Deukmejian to name him the state public defender, an 
office that was created by legislation that Song authored. He said the signs 
looked favorable, but a news story recalling the FBI investigation popped up 
and apparently dashed the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Song is a Deukmejian appointee to the Medical Board of California, 
which licenses physicians, and also is a state administrative law judge, both 
part-time positions. But they take only a few hours a month of his time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I could be happier if I could work for 15 or 20 hours a week" to 
supplement his state pension, Song said. 
</P>
<P>
Song, whose outwardly suave and cosmopolitan demeanor earned him a nickname of 
the "Korean Cary Grant" among some at the Capitol, said he has maintained 
cordial relations with his former colleagues in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
He said that since the conviction of Montoya they have greeted him even more 
warmly in the Capitol: "They say, 'What goes around comes around.' "

STORM DRIVES LAST OF OIL SPILL ASHORE; 
</P>
<P>
CLEANUP: OFFICIALS ESTIMATE IT COULD TAKE 6 WEEKS TO REMOVE THE MESS FROM 
BEACHES. NONE OF THE WILDLIFE REFUGES ON THE COAST WERE DAMAGED.

Battling a stinging and bitter-cold sea spray, about 1,300 workers used rakes, 
rags and hand-booms to sop up remnants of last week's 394,000-gallon oil spill 
that finally washed ashore Wednesday, blackening areas along 15 miles of Orange 
County beaches. 
</P>
<P>
A fierce overnight windstorm drove most of the remaining slick onto the 
shoreline from Newport Harbor to Bolsa Chica State Beach. About 100 members of 
the California Conservation Corps joined the cleanup efforts and another 100 
are expected to arrive today. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 gallons of oil reached land by dawn, driven ashore by winds 
gusting up to 60 m.p.h. With about 82% of the oil having been cleaned up or 
naturally dispersed, what came ashore Wednesday accounts for virtually all of 
the remaining crude from the spill on Feb. 7, when the tanker American Trader 
punctured its hull with its own anchor while mooring at a pipeline off 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has hit the shoreline," Coast Guard Petty Officer Dennis Hall said. 
"All the oil that was in the water is now on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
A very light sheen of oil washed ashore at Crystal Cove -- near Laguna Beach, 
the farthest south that the oil has reached, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Cleanup down there is a lot more difficult on a rocky shoreline such as that, 
as opposed to a sandy beach," said Lt. Reed Smith, coordinating the response 
for the state Department of Fish and Game. "We were hoping it wouldn't head 
that way, but it has." 
</P>
<P>
At dawn, layers of black crude, six to eight inches thick in some places, 
greeted officials who were forced to suspend cleanup operations late Tuesday 
because of the cold and winds. By mid-morning, workers stood 
shoulder-to-shoulder a mile on either side of the Huntington Beach Municipal 
Pier, shoveling the muck into plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest-hit shoreline was in Newport Beach, just north of the city pier. 
The goo on the sand was so widespread that police using bullhorns ordered 
everyone except cleanup workers off the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a lava flow appearance of a mixture of oil and water," Newport Beach 
Police Lt. Tim Newman said after surveying the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the windstorm, none of the wildlife refuges on the coast were damaged. 
Protective booms, dikes and sandbags kept tainted seawater from penetrating 
waterways leading to the habitats of scores of migratory bird species, 
including several that are endangered. 
</P>
<P>
However, biologists predicted that the full impact of the spill on shore birds 
and marine life will not be known for months. By late Wednesday, 340 oil-soaked 
birds had been rescued, but another 160 had died. Many more may not be found 
for days -- if ever, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Powell, a patrol captain for the Department of Fish and Game, estimated 
that two-thirds -- and possibly as many as 90% -- of the birds affected by the 
spill will not be recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the birds that have been exposed early, if we haven't got them yet, they're 
probably lying dead somewhere," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven dead seals have been found and an injured one washed ashore Wednesday 
morning. Authorities were trying to determine if the deaths were related to the 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, Mayor Thomas J. Mays grew increasingly irritated over Gov. 
George Deukmejian's refusal to declare stretches of the Orange County coastline 
-- including Mays' city -- a disaster area. The city formally sought the 
disaster declaration on Monday, but the governor's office has so far not acted 
on the request, saying cleanup operations were proceeding smoothly and there 
was no need for state assistance because British Petroleum is paying the full 
cost of the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, there is no need for such a declaration," said Bob Gore, the 
governor's press secretary. "We've asked the city to 'tell us what you need,' 
and we've provided everything that's been asked of us." 
</P>
<P>
Mays disagreed on the assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"They find two fruit flies and they declared that a natural disaster . . . and 
yet you have hundreds of gallons of oil and toxic waste coming in here," Mays 
said during a morning press conference. "I guess that's my major complaint." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an investigation into the tanker accident has preliminarily revealed 
that the ship may have been operating in water five feet shallower than 
indicated on depth charts, a Coast Guard official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the American Trader may have been operating in 46 or 47 feet 
of water instead of the 51 to 53 feet listed on depth charts, said Cmdr. Scott 
Porter, assistant chief for marine safety in the California district. If true, 
it would mean the ship had less than five feet of water under its hull at the 
time of the accident. The ship's anchor is 10 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
Gill net fishermen filed a $10-million claim in Los Angeles federal court 
against British Petroleum, charging that the spill has devastated halibut 
fisheries off the Southern California coast. The tanker accident occurred in 
prime spawning grounds at the peak of the halibut season, and fishermen have 
been prohibited from fishing those waters because of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
On the beach, officials supervising the cleanup were reluctant to speculate on 
how long the process will take. But several crew supervisors on the beach said 
it could take as long as a month to six weeks to mop up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
"That may turn out to be right, but we really just don't know right now," said 
Tom Thomson, a public affairs officer for British Petroleum. "We'll be here as 
long as it takes." 
</P>
<P>
Company and Coast Guard officials agreed, however, that having the oil 
accounted for is good news. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst of it, from the standpoint of not knowing where the oil is, is 
over," said Fred Garibaldi, a BP executive. "We know exactly what we have to 
deal with." 
</P>
<P>
As workers methodically combed the beach, they piled up thousands of pounds of 
oil-soaked cloths and mops. The potentially toxic materials are temporarily 
being stored in steel containers at the Newport Beach Sewage Treatment Plant, a 
seven-acre facility near Pacific Coast Highway and the Santa Ana River, said 
Bob Dixon, Newport Beach public utilities director. At the treatment plant, the 
cleanup materials will be tested to determine if they are hazardous before 
being transported to a landfill approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. Officials said the landfill has not been selected yet. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the cleanup workers were draped in three or four layers of clothing on 
Wednesday, braving the blasts of frigid sea air to earn $10 an hour. Others 
said they felt a sense of public service to remain on the cleanup line. 
</P>
<P>
Antone Pagan, a 49-year-old worker from Long Beach, was in an area just south 
of the Balboa Pier when some of the oil-soaked foam blew into his face. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like it was on fire," said Pagan, whose skin was daubed with cream. 
Pagan added that his supervisors suggested he visit the hospital, but he 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
Other workers complained of headaches and nausea, and officials from the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration tested the air for traces of 
benzene, a toxic substance that is sometimes found in crude oil. The test, 
conducted early Wednesday morning, proved negative. 
</P>
<P>
The spill's impact on local businesses continued to mount Wednesday. Harbors at 
Anaheim Bay and Newport remained closed to boat traffic, angering sportfishing 
and charter operators idled by the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Kelley, president of American Yacht Charter, which provides boats for 
weddings in Newport Harbor, said that she has had three wedding parties cancel 
since the spill. She estimated that business is "off by about a half," and the 
company has lost about $15,000 in bookings. 
</P>
<P>
"We sell them by the blue water and the blue sky and that's not going to be the 
case," Kelley said. "They are afraid to go out. They don't want to go out in 
the oil." 
</P>
<P>
Operators of whale-watching boats have also been hurt. Monika Sloan, owner and 
operator of the Schooner Spike Africa, which takes tourists to watch the 
California gray whales migrate off the coast, said, "We've been put out of 
business."

STATE SUES MONTOYA FOR ALLEGED MISUSE OF FUNDS

State authorities slapped former Sen. Joseph B. Montoya with a lawsuit 
Wednesday seeking $270,000 in penalties for his alleged misuse of campaign 
funds and failure to disclose certain financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
The civil action filed by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and the Fair Political 
Practices Commission comes two weeks after a federal court jury convicted 
Montoya on criminal corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
The $270,000 penalty is by far the largest ever sought by the state for the 
misuse of campaign funds and one of the largest for a violation of state 
campaign laws. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya is accused in the lawsuit of diverting $98,343 in campaign funds for 
his personal use by making phony loans to associates and by purchasing clothes, 
videos, investment newsletters, encyclopedias and a life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action Wednesday, the Senate Rules Committee fired Senate staff 
member John Shahabian, an undercover FBI informant who played a key role in 
Montoya's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Republican members of the Senate pushed for Shahabian's termination after he 
admitted during the Montoya trial that he was caught in an FBI sting when he 
solicited a payment from an undercover agent. Privately, some senators also 
acknowledged that they wanted Shahabian fired because he secretly tape-recorded 
conversations with legislators as part of the FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In a rare public statement, Shahabian said he may seek legal action to regain 
his job. "What is most important is the fact that some light was shed on the 
problem of corruption in the capital and a reform effort is under way," 
Shahabian said. "I'm proud I was able to be a part of it and I wouldn't change 
the way I did it." 
</P>
<P>
In large part because of evidence Shahabian helped collect, Montoya was found 
guilty on seven counts of extortion, racketeering and money laundering. He 
faces 20 years in prison on each count and potential fines totaling more than 
$1.75 million. Last week, he resigned his Senate seat rather than be expelled 
by his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has called a special election April 10 to replace 
Montoya, with a runoff scheduled June 5, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to charges that he pocketed campaign funds, the 14-count action 
filed Wednesday charges that the Whittier Democrat failed to publicly report 
nearly $68,000 in gifts and income he had received since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
During his trial, Montoya admitted that he diverted more than $45,000 in 
campaign donations for his personal use, but contended that he was legally 
entitled to the money. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya defense attorney Michael S. Sands charged that Van de Kamp, who is 
seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, is attempting to boost his 
campaign at the expense of the former senator, who has few resources left for 
another court battle. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're beating a dead horse," Sands said. "It's basically political. 
The attorney general is running for governor and everybody's got to have their 
piece of the cake." 
</P>
<P>
But Sands acknowledged, as he did earlier in court, that Montoya's handling of 
campaign funds was not entirely proper. "I said very candidly I think there 
were errors made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Van de Kamp said it is an unresolved legal issue whether 
Montoya can use leftover campaign funds to pay whatever fine is assessed 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya will get some help from the legislative pension system, however. 
Beginning March 1, he will receive $1,681.78 a month, even if he goes to 
prison.

FAA AGENT IN CRASH PROBE CHANGES STAND, PRAISES USAIR PILOT TRAINING 
</P>

A federal examiner who earlier had been critical of USAir on Wednesday told 
investigators studying last September's crash of a USAir jetliner that the 
airline has good training and certification programs for its pilots. 
</P>
<P>
In his report to the National Transportation Safety Board in December, William 
Dubis, leader of a Federal Aviation Administration team studying the airline, 
had criticized some USAir training and proficiency-check programs as 
"inconsistent," "lacking realism" and "degraded by an absence of challenge." 
</P>
<P>
But, on Wednesday, in his testimony before an NTSB panel investigating the 
crash, Dubis said that the airline is producing safe pilots and there is no 
need for regulatory change. 
</P>
<P>
Dubis told the panel that it is just a matter of USAir's changing training 
techniques in a few areas, and "they're in the process of doing this at a rapid 
pace." 
</P>
<P>
Another FAA official, principal operations inspector James A. Rapucci, 
testified that he also thought USAir has good training and pilot-evaluation 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"USAir operates at a very high level of safety," Rapucci told the NTSB panel. 
</P>
<P>
NTSB investigators have questioned whether pilot Michael Martin and co-pilot 
Constantine Kleissas utilized appropriate cockpit procedures last Sept. 20 
during an aborted takeoff attempt at La Guardia Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737 jetliner skidded off the end of the runway and into the East 
River, killing two of the 57 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 15, Dubis submitted his report of a three-week FAA study of the 
airline's training and certification programs, which include flight-proficiency 
tests in simulators and actual aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The report complained that the training programs "are lacking in 'real world' 
scenarios and result in non-thinking performance, where the ability of the 
student to demonstrate a mastery of complex problems, good judgment, 
situational awareness, cockpit management and leadership skills have all been 
removed."

ANC WILL CONSIDER SAFEGUARDS FOR WHITE MINORITY, MANDELA SAYS;

SOUTH AFRICA: HE INSISTS ON FULL VOTING RIGHTS FOR BLACKS, SAYING COMPROMISES

<TEXT>
<P>
Nelson R. Mandela, submitting to dozens of interviews with television 
journalists from around the world, said Wednesday the African National Congress 
is willing to compromise and consider constitutional guarantees for South 
Africa's white minority but will not budge on the issue of full black voting 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Compromises must be made in respect to every issue, as long as that compromise 
is in the interest not only of one population group, but the country as whole," 
the 71-year-old leader said as he sat in his back yard with an ANC flag behind 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela also said he hopes a settlement to the country's long racial conflict 
can be reached before President Frederik W. de Klerk's ruling National Party 
faces elections in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that, in discussions between the ANC and the government, we 
will be able to find a solution which will be accepted by everybody, black and 
white," Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the direction of the liberation struggle, including any 
compromises, will be determined by the ANC leadership. It is meeting at its 
headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, to discuss Mandela's future role and to develop 
a response to De Klerk's initiatives. Mandela said he will be traveling to 
Lusaka soon. 
</P>
<P>
The interviews were conducted at Mandela's home, a four-room brick house 
surrounded by a tall fence in the Orlando West section of Soweto, where he 
spent the night Tuesday for the first time since he went to prison in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of blacks and whites have made the pilgrimage to Mandela's 
house since he was released Sunday after serving 27 years of a life sentence 
for sabotage. But things began to return to normal Wednesday, a day after he 
addressed 120,000 people welcoming him home at a soccer stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign television crews lined up outside the Mandela home for 10-minute 
interviews with the leader, who has become a unifying force among blacks during 
his years in prison, and Mandela repeated again and again the themes that he 
carried beyond the gates of Victor Verster Prison. 
</P>
<P>
He defended the ANC guerrilla struggle, which he says should not be abandoned 
until the government stops using force against blacks. He said government 
installations are legitimate targets but added that "you can't avoid people 
getting caught up in the cross-fire when two people are shooting at each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
"People must not only worry about casualties" caused by the ANC, he said. "They 
must worry about the series of casualties caused by the government over the 
decades." 
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela stressed the ANC's commitment to peace and suggested that 
whites who want an end to confrontation "must support the government in its 
effort to reach a peaceful settlement." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, who released Mandela on Sunday, told ABC-TV's "Nightline" on Tuesday 
that he is not bothered by Mandela's continued support for the armed struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit too early to judge" Mandela's stand on the armed struggle, De Klerk 
said, because the reasons Mandela launched the ANC's guerrilla war in 1960 are 
no longer valid. 
</P>
<P>
"He said then that violence was justified" because all the avenues to peaceful 
political protest had been closed by the authorities, the president said. "That 
has changed." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has moved quickly in recent weeks to open up black political activity 
by lifting 30-year bans on the ANC and the South African Communist Party and 
rescinding restrictions on hundreds of anti-apartheid activists. The government 
wants to create a climate in which it can lure black leaders, such as Mandela, 
to the negotiating table to draw up a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials say they hope to have a new constitution with voting 
rights for blacks within five years. A government elected under that 
constitution, they say, is unlikely to be controlled by the ruling National 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Although both the ANC and the government say they want to give blacks the vote, 
they differ over what that future political system will look like. The ANC 
insists on a one-person, one-vote system with a universal voters' roll. The 
government wants a system that protects the white minority. 
</P>
<P>
"A simple majority-rule model is not the right system for South Africa," De 
Klerk said on "Nightline." "There must be equality, but checks and balances 
have to be built in." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela has sought to reassure many of South Africa's 5 million whites who 
worry about living under a government controlled by 27 million blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the fears of the whites of being dominated by blacks, and we 
are addressing that very seriously and very earnestly," he said. And he added 
that because of De Klerk's flexibility and integrity, "the possibility of a 
settlement is always there." 
</P>
<P>
Since his release, Mandela also has reiterated the ANC's commitment to 
nationalizing mines, banks and other sectors of the economy, causing jitters in 
markets here and worrying overseas investors. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said such a policy does not make sense, especially in light of the 
failure of state-controlled economies elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"That will kill the goose that laid the golden egg," De Klerk said on 
"Nightline." "What is needed is a sound economic policy." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that their decision to legalize the ANC does not mean 
they support its stand on nationalization. 
</P>
<P>
The intent "was to shift the fight against that policy from the field of 
violence and suppressive measures to open political debate," said Gerrit 
Viljoen, the government minister of constitutional development.

TRAFFICKERS SURRENDER 3 COCAINE LABS ON EVE OF SUMMIT; 
</P>
<P>
COLOMBIA: THE GESTURE IS SEEN AS A PEACE BID. BUSH BEGINS TALKS TODAY WITH 
THREE ANDEAN LEADERS.

CARTAGENA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As President Bush and three Andean colleagues prepared to converge here today 
for a drug-war summit, Colombian traffickers reinforced calls for peace by 
turning over three cocaine laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest gesture yet in a monthlong series of attempts by the 
notorious drug lords to blunt a government crackdown by showing that they are 
mending their venal and violent ways. 
</P>
<P>
"As one more contribution to our promise of struggling for peace so that 
democracy will be strengthened, we have decided to give up the three largest 
and most modern laboratories for processing cocaine that currently exist in the 
country," declared a communique published Wednesday. It was signed "The 
Extraditables," a code word for the so-called Medellin Cartel of cocaine 
traffickers, headed by fugitive kingpin Pablo Escobar. 
</P>
<P>
Traffickers had two dozen Colombian reporters escorted secretly to the three 
laboratories, hidden in the swampy Darien wilderness of northern Colombia, near 
the Gulf of Uraba and the Panamanian border. Broadcast reports on the 
surrendered labs filled Colombian airwaves Wednesday as security forces moved 
in to take over the illegal installations. 
</P>
<P>
The drug lords apparently timed the gesture to steal some of the media thunder 
from Bush's meeting today in Cartagena with presidents Virgilio Barco Vargas of 
Colombia, Alan Garcia of Peru and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
The four leaders will sign a joint declaration outlining strategy for fighting 
cocaine traffic, from its South American origins to its U.S. destinations. The 
declaration also will emphasize the need to control American demand for illegal 
drugs and to bolster the Andean economies with legal trade and aid. 
</P>
<P>
The summit has also encountered a good bit of domestic opposition from 
Colombians. About 10,000 people protested Bush's visit with a march through 
Bogota on Wednesday, burning U.S. flags and setting off firecrackers. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,500 journalists and technicians will cover the Cartagena summit. 
But few will get close to the presidents, who are to meet in a colonial fort at 
the heavily guarded Colombian naval academy on Manzanillo Island. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly surrounded by the waters of Cartagena Bay, the site can be reached by 
single road over a narrow neck of land. As pre-summit security intensified 
Wednesday, armed Colombian marines guarded the entrance while others patrolled 
the bay in motor launches. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said 5,000 troops and police are deployed around Cartagena, which 
was a heavily fortified port in Spanish colonial times. Much of this week's 
security activity is concentrated around Cartagena's sprawling convention 
center, from where many reporters will watch the summit on closed circuit 
television. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. Navy moved a destroyer and an amphibious assault vessel, 
complete with Marines, helicopters and fighter-attack jets, to the waters off 
the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some recent press reports in the United States that an attack on Bush 
by drug traffickers was feared, Colombian officials said they expected no 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have serious evidence that would permit us to think of the 
possibility of an attack on the presidents," Miguel Maza Marquez, head of 
Colombia's police intelligence agency, said in a press conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Colombian drug traffickers have been accused of killing thousands of people, 
including government ministers, police officials and judges, in retaliation to 
a government crackdown against them. In the last four months of 1989, they set 
off scores of terrorist bombs around the country, including one that killed two 
people in the Cartagena Hilton last September. 
</P>
<P>
Another bomb demolished a domestic airliner leaving Bogota with 107 people 
aboard, and yet another devastated a large area around the police intelligence 
headquarters in Bogota, killing 67 people. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 17, however, "The Extraditables" said they were suspending their 
campaign of violence. They promised to release kidnaped hostages, turn in arms 
and explosives, and surrender clandestine drug laboratories in return for 
"legal and constitutional guarantees." In a series of gestures since then, the 
traffickers have released several hostages and turned over a ton of dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said their main goal apparently is to persuade the government to stop 
the extradition of Colombians to the United States for trial there on drug 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the surrender of the cocaine laboratories in northwestern 
Colombia, the traffickers said the three installations had a combined 
production capacity of 20 tons a month. Over a year, that would amount to 40% 
of the 600 tons that U.S. officials estimate as Colombia's total cocaine 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
One American official suggested Wednesday that the capacity of the surrendered 
labs was exaggerated and that their surrender was a token gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they have quite turned over everything," the official said. 
"When they start turning themselves in, I'll start paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
Maza Marquez, the police intelligence chief, told reporters that the three 
laboratories were no longer in use when they were turned over. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not convinced by this gesture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Radio reporters who saw the laboratories, however, said they were complete with 
functional power plants to operate elaborate refining equipment and even to run 
air conditioners in some rooms. They said they found refrigerators still 
stocked with cold beer. 
</P>
<P>
Escorts told the reporters that the laboratories had cost $20 million and 
employed 150 people. The three installations, miles apart from one another, 
were deep in swampy forests near lagoons where hydroplanes could land, the 
reporters said. 
</P>
<P>
The surrender of the laboratories followed the pattern of a publicity campaign 
that Carlos Lemos Simmonds, the minister of government (roughly equivalent to 
interior minister in other countries), said is aimed at convincing Colombians 
that the traffickers have become worthy of public trust and government 
leniency. Lemos told two foreign correspondents Tuesday in Bogota that the 
campaign also carries an implicit threat that if there is no positive response 
by the government, "narco-terrorism" may resume. 
</P>
<P>
"They do not lose hope that the Colombian government, under public pressure, 
will make concessions to them," Lemos said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the concessions that the traffickers hope for is an end to extradition, 
he said. Since August, when the government issued an emergency decree 
permitting extradition, 14 accused traffickers have been sent to the United 
States for trial. 
</P>
<P>
Lemos said 14 more extradition requests are being processed, and the government 
does not intend to negotiate with the traffickers on that or any other issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Coca, a shrub sacred to Andean highlands Indians who have chewed its leaves for 
centuries to counter hunger and thirst, is the natural resource of an illegal 
international industry worth billions of dollars. Chemically processed into 
cocaine, coca grown in the Andes can be harvested three or more times a year, 
experts say. Peru and Bolivia grow most of the world's coca, but Colombia 
dominates in producing cocaine and smuggling it to other countries, especially 
the United States. Peru's annual coca production is about 115,000 tons, U.S. 
officials say, and Bolivia produces an estimated 130,000 tons. Police experts 
estimate that Peruvian drug gangs earn about $1.2 billion a year from the drug 
trade. They add that about $200 million is paid annually to guerrilla groups 
for protection of processing labs and the planes that transport the coca base.

CHAMORRO LOSING GROUND IN NICARAGUA; 
</P>
<P>
POLLS: THREE OPINION SURVEYS GIVE PRESIDENT ORTEGA A HUGE ADVANTAGE. SOME 
OBSERVERS QUESTION METHODS IN POLLING.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega's chief rival in the Feb. 25 election has lost ground 
in all five voter opinion polls published in recent weeks, and three of the 
surveys give the Sandinista leader a huge advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the challenger, is ahead by smaller margins in the 
other two polls, conducted for her United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO). But 
those results are questioned by independent analysts because their polling 
methods have not been fully disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity between voter preference figures in the two sets of surveys is so 
wide, surpassing all margins of statistical error, that analysts warn against 
relying on any of them to predict the election outcome. A "poll war," they say, 
has shed more heat than light on the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no question that Chamorro was in a slump in January, when the 
latest polls were taken. 
</P>
<P>
Her campaign manager, Antonio Lacayo, acknowledged the unfavorable trend in an 
interview last week. But he insisted that it was momentary and caused by a 
downturn of opposition campaign activity, which has been revived in the last 
two weeks by large and enthusiastic crowds at Chamorro's rallies. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega led Chamorro 53% to 35% in a survey by the Washington pollsters Bendixen 
&amp; Schroth broadcast recently by Univision, a Miami-based, Spanish-language 
television network. Univision's previous poll, in October, put Ortega up by one 
point, 40% to 39%. 
</P>
<P>
Two polls done by another Washington firm, Greenberg-Lake, for a Boston-based 
election observer group called Hemisphere Initiatives, show voter preference 
for Ortega rising to 51% in January from 44% in December, while Chamorro 
remained stuck at 27%. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, with the challenger static at 18%, Ortega soared from 36% to 54% 
between October and January, according to surveys done for the Jesuit-run 
Central American University here by ECO, a Nicaraguan company that often polls 
for the government. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's own surveys, by Costa Rican pollster Victor Borge, show her ahead. 
But her lead slipped sharply, from 44% to 18% in October to 37% to 30% in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Doxa, a Venezuelan company also polling for the opposition, gave Chamorro a 36% 
to 25% edge in December, which was cut slightly last month, from 41% to 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's campaign manager said the polls were taken after her campaign hit a 
low point in early January. Its funds were running short then, and a broken 
kneecap sidelined the candidate for 18 days, while the Ortega campaign was in 
full stride. 
</P>
<P>
But most pollsters, including her own, say Chamorro was hurt on the issues as 
well. They said the U.S. invasion of Panama and increased military activity by 
the Contras, who are highly unpopular among Nicaraguans, helped Ortega shift 
attention from his weakest issue, the shattered economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to explain the shift is the war and peace issue," said Sergio 
Bendixen, the Univision poll director. "Feelings about the war run deep, and 
once such an emotional issue takes over, it is hard to turn the campaign 
around." 
</P>
<P>
The Bendixen poll is significant because its fieldwork was conducted by Logos, 
the only Nicaraguan polling firm regarded by both camps as relatively neutral. 
</P>
<P>
Since opinion polling was first permitted here in June, 1988, eight companies 
have published 21 surveys and interviewed more than 36,000 of Nicaragua's 1.7 
million registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is obviously the most surveyed Third World country," said William 
Bollinger, director of the Inter-American Research Center in Los Angeles. "The 
problem is that polling is still so new here, there is a lot of potential for 
biased results."

Iranian radical leaders said Wednesday that no matter how closely he is 
guarded, British author Salman Rushdie will be killed in accordance with the 
edict issued by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini just months before his death. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Mahdi Karrubi and Parliament member Ali Akbar Mohtashemi 
spoke to Iran's Parliament on the one-year anniversary of Khomeini's death 
sentence against Rushdie, who is accused of blaspheming Islam in his novel "The 
Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie has been in hiding under guard since Feb. 14, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither the passage of time nor Salman Rushdie's repentence" will affect the 
death edict, said Mohtashemi, the former interior minister and a hard-liner in 
the Iranian Parliament, was quoted as saying by the official Islamic Republic 
News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia as was the IRNA report, quoted Karrubi as 
telling legislators that "however much Salman Rushdie may be kept under guard, 
eventually a Muslim will carry out the edict." 
</P>
<P>
In recent interviews, Rushdie said his book was not meant to as an affront to 
Muslims, but he said that he stands by what he has written.

Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, voicing Warsaw's disquiet at the 
prospect of a united Germany, demanded a role for Warsaw in talks leading to 
unification but ran into opposition from Bonn on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki said Poland, whose postwar borders include huge tracts of former 
German territory, must be involved in negotiations between East and West 
Germany and the principal victorious wartime Allies in order to guarantee its 
security. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be present wherever the question of security of Germany's neighbors 
would be discussed. Our security matters cannot be settled by proxy for us," he 
told a news conference in London. 
</P>
<P>
But West German government officials in Bonn virtually rejected the demand, 
saying that West and East Germany would make no claims on Polish territory. 
</P>
<P>
"It would not be meaningful to include Poland in the six-nation talks," one 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
In Ottawa, where the unification plan was drawn up, the Soviet Union changed 
the draft by adding the phrase, "including the issue of security of the 
neighboring states," at the behest of Poland, it was understood. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki refused to be drawn out on whether Poland wants full membership in 
the six-power group overseeing German unification -- the United States, Soviet 
Union, Britain, France and the two Germanys.

<TEXT>
<P>
The headlong rush toward German reunification has cleared two important 
hurdles, but serious, potentially volatile difficulties still loom ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's accord in Ottawa on a formula for talks on German unity is a 
significant step even if it was anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Although the four major Allied powers that vanquished Nazi Germany 45 years ago 
had already committed themselves to supporting the principle of unification, 
the fact that they agreed that the framework to discuss the subject is 
considered an important step forward. 
</P>
<P>
That the formula itself was conceived by West Germany's Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher is seen as an especially hopeful sign for those Germans 
who feared that the victorious powers might try to dictate the terms of 
reference. 
</P>
<P>
The decision in Bonn by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East Germany's 
caretaker Prime Minister Hans Modrow to begin formal preparations for a 
currency union was also an important, if predictable, step toward 
reunification. 
</P>
<P>
The joint commission established to prepare what amounts to a de facto 
deutschemark takeover of the East German economy will launch the idea of 
economic and currency union on the path to reality. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the move seemed another nail in the East German state's coffin, for 
by ceding control over the national currency, Modrow also effectively cedes a 
piece of East Germany's sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these steps toward unity, however, the meetings in both Ottawa and Bonn 
carried with them the seeds of far greater political challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Behind all the congratulations, the Ottawa agreement only begins a larger 
process by which the two German states, the Big Four powers -- the United 
States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France -- and the other nations of Europe 
will determine what kind of united Germany eventually emerges. 
</P>
<P>
For all concerned, the stakes could not be higher, for the participants will be 
shaping nothing less than a mini-superpower that is destined to become Central 
Europe's dominant power. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, there are major differences about just what shape this new Germany 
should take. 
</P>
<P>
In the West, there is the conviction that a united Germany must remain a part 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, while Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev sees it as a neutral state, tied to neither NATO nor the Soviet-led 
Warsaw Pact, floating on its own between East and West. 
</P>
<P>
Although few expect this Soviet position to carry, it has buttressed the 
support for neutrality that is already widespread in East Germany as well as 
among elements of the West German left. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe this additional support for neutrality could eventually 
play an important role in influencing German foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets are making a crucial mistake," maintained Michael Stuermer, 
director of the Research Institute for International Politics and Security near 
Munich. "The present Germany of 60 million within NATO is the best they could 
hope for -- involved in the process of European integration, well anchored in 
Western Europe and basically a 'do-gooder' country. 
</P>
<P>
"A Germany of 75 million people, not part of NATO and subject to all sorts of 
international conditions is unstable, unworkable and dangerous," Stuermer 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm Bruns, head of the Foreign Policy and Security Department at the Social 
Democratic Party's think tank, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Bonn, 
described both German neutrality and full NATO membership as unworkable 
options. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither can achieve a consensus," he said. "There has to be some kind of 
middle ground." 
</P>
<P>
While opinions differ on this and other key points, there is little dispute 
that the negotiations will be tough. 
</P>
<P>
Those who followed Modrow's two-day visit to Bonn that ended Wednesday also 
expressed concern about much of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's decision to reject Modrow's request for about $9 billion in emergency 
aid to prop a fast-unraveling East German economy has done little to boost 
confidence among a people so dispirited that as many as 2,000 each day simply 
give up their homes and their jobs and head to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts -- and many East Germans -- believe Kohl's refusal to 
provide at least some token additional emergency help is part of a grander 
strategy to weaken East Germany to a point where reunification talks become 
little more than an East German capitulation. 
</P>
<P>
While the dejection was visible among members of the large East German 
delegation as they were shown departing Bonn for East Berlin on Wednesday 
evening, a certain bitterness was evident among East Germans themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"They are handling us like an African colony," said Horst Moritz, an official 
at the East German Academy of Sciences. "There's a resentment building about 
their smugness."

Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, in a departure from recent Israeli statements, 
has said his nation need not fear a democratic, united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks broadcast by Israel Radio on Wednesday, Arens said no Jew could 
think about German reunification without remembering the Nazi Holocaust in 
which 6 million Jews were exterminated during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
But he said: "If that united Germany is a democratic Germany . . . fully 
conscious of the responsibilities that it has toward the Jewish people, a 
country that will contribute to strengthening democracy throughout the world, 
then I don't think that there's a danger to be concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was in sharp contrast to remarks by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
last November that the prospect of a united Germany was a grave concern for the 
Jewish people. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rabbi Marvin Hier, chairman of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles, asked to meet with the leaders of West and East Germany to discuss 
"the great fear that German reunification brings to the community of victims of 
Nazism."

EXXON, U.S. DISCUSS OIL SPILL SETTLEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A DEAL WITH THE JUSTICE DEPT. COULD PREVENT A CRIMINAL TRIAL OVER 
DAMAGE TO ALASKA. POSSIBLE TERMS OF A PACT ARE NOT DISCLOSED.

<P>
The Justice Department is discussing a settlement with Exxon Corp. that could 
result in a substantial fine but spare the energy giant a possible criminal 
trial over its role in last spring's disastrous Prince William Sound oil spill, 
government officials confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges naming Exxon have been announced, but a federal grand jury 
in Alaska has been investigating the firm since the Justice Department opened 
an environmental crimes office in Anchorage in the aftermath of the March 24 
Exxon Valdez grounding. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of a possible settlement were not disclosed Wednesday, but Exxon 
officials have made it known that they are seeking assurances that most or all 
money collected would be used to fund cleanup and environmental restoration 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Word of behind-the-scenes negotiations between U.S. lawyers and Exxon 
officials, first reported in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, was revealed 
by University of Alaska marine biologist Rick Steiner of Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday, Steiner said he learned about the talks 
Jan. 23 when he met privately with Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi 
in Washington to discuss a proposal that Exxon invest about $100 million to 
protect timberlands in the Prince William Sound area. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that Exxon had agreed to the total amount of (settlement) money it 
would pay and that they expected to reach an agreement . . . any day," Steiner 
said. "He wouldn't tell me how much that was, but I got the impression that 
$500 million is in the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade acknowledged that 
discussions are under way with Exxon attorneys. She declined to say whether 
those talks involve possible criminal charges. However, the Associated Press 
reported that federal prosecutors were involved in the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon spokesman Bill Smith said the company would have no immediate comment on 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
Still at issue, according to Steiner, is whether anticipated financial 
penalties would be assessed as criminal fines or put into some sort of fund to 
benefit the damaged Prince William Sound environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It is probably in the best interests of the state of Alaska and the whole 
country" if the settlement is heavily weighted to underwriting restoration 
efforts, said Steiner, an associate professor with the university's marine 
advisory program in Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to generate more funds for the federal Treasury," Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Atty. Gen. Douglas Baily offered at least partial support for that view 
saying: "Obviously, a fine doesn't do any direct good to the state of Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
He said the state is aware of talks between Exxon and the Justice Department, 
but he said Alaska has taken no position on what sort of terms should be worked 
out. Baily said the state has not been invited to participate in the 
negotiations. And he said he doubts that a federal plea agreement would affect 
the state's pending civil litigation against Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has already spent $2 billion in cleanup efforts in Alaska, but critics 
claim much more work needs to be done. Reducing the amount of criminal 
penalties in favor of increasing the amount of cleanup funds could be a boost 
for the company's public relations, and might mitigate civil damage 
assessments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a win-win situation for everyone -- the environmental community, 
commercial fishermen, everyone" said Steiner, who also is a commercial 
fisherman in Prince William Sound. "Ideally, we'd like to see an agreement that 
ends up with a $1 fine and a restoration fund of $499,999,999."

Americans are suffering from a dearth of effective birth-control methods 
because almost all U.S. pharmaceutical companies have "fled the field" of 
contraceptive research and development, according to a two-year National 
Academy of Sciences study released on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 153-page report, prepared by 16 experts from the academy's National 
Research Council and its Institute of Medicine, said the United States needs to 
reduce the exposure of contraceptive manufacturers to product-liability 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Although most contraceptives have side effects that hurt a small portion of 
their users, the study said those risks should be weighed against the more 
subtle, but greater, problems created by withholding more effective forms of 
birth control from society. 
</P>
<P>
Those problems include unwanted pregnancies, particularly among teen-agers and 
older women, as well as abortions and voluntary sterilizations that could be 
avoided if more reliable methods of birth control were available, the study 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite a potential market of more than a half-billion people worldwide, the 
outlook for new contraceptive development under the current regulatory and 
legal climate in the United States is bleak," Dr. Luigi Mastroianni Jr., 
chairman of the academy's research committee, said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
New contraceptives are being developed in Europe, including once-a-month pills, 
reversible male and female sterilizations, and methods to block sperm 
production. The United States, however, has not developed a "fundamentally new" 
form of birth control since introduction of the pill and intrauterine devices 
in the early 1960s, Mastroianni said. 
</P>
<P>
Europeans already have access to a wider variety of approved birth-control 
methods that are easier to use, work longer and fail less frequently than those 
available in America, he said. They include time-release contraceptives 
implanted under the skin, injectable contraceptives, alternative sterilization 
techniques, and RU-486 -- the so-called "morning-after" pill. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Food and Drug Administration approves all contraceptives sold in 
the United States and the warnings that accompany them, pharmaceutical 
companies have no assurance that they will not be sued for unforeseen injuries, 
the study noted. 
</P>
<P>
That potential liability has scared away all but one U.S. manufacturer from 
developing new means of birth control, despite a need for more and better 
contraceptives, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"The threat of litigation is an obstacle to contraceptive development," said 
Mastroianni, who also is director of human reproduction at the University of 
Pennsylvania Medical Center. "Without a change in this legal climate, even 
fewer U.S. firms will allocate even fewer dollars to contraceptive 
development." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers called on Congress to create a product-liability shield to 
protect pharmaceutical companies so they can operate more freely to develop new 
birth-control methods. 
</P>
<P>
Under the academy proposal, users who claimed they had been injured by a 
contraceptive would find it more difficult to collect punitive damages in 
court. If the contraceptive had been tested and approved by the FDA, such 
damages would be awarded only if the injuries were proven to have been caused 
by the manufacturer's negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer rights advocates, however, have raised objections to a 
product-liability cap because it would limit a citizen's right to sue if 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Downer of the Federation of Feminist Women's Health Centers in Los 
Angeles criticized the academy's recommendations, which are similar to earlier 
proposals by the pharmaceutical industry to reform product-liability laws. 
"Why," she asked, "should a woman getting contraceptives suddenly become a 
non-person in our legal system?" 
</P>
<P>
The study suggested that product safety could be increased through stricter FDA 
monitoring of customer complaints and more detailed studies of the different 
effects and special risks of alternative forms of birth control on older women, 
teen-agers, smokers and breast-feeders. 
</P>
<P>
Eight firms had been engaged in serious contraceptive research and development 
in the early 1970s, according to the study. By the 1980s, however, 
pharmaceutical companies "fled the field of contraceptive research and 
development" after being slapped with too many injury claims involving 
FDA-certified contraceptives, Mastroianni said. 
</P>
<P>
Their fears were based in part on the public furor over the Dalkon Shield, an 
intrauterine device manufactured by A. H. Robins Co. from 1971 to 1974. The 
Shield later was found to have caused severe pelvic inflammation and other 
ailments in hundreds of thousands of women. 
</P>
<P>
More than $2 billion in injury claims were filed against Robins, and the firm 
filed for bankruptcy court protection. Robins eventually was acquired by 
American Home Products Corp., and a $2.3-billion trust fund was created for 
women injured by the Shield. 
</P>
<P>
The only U.S. company still aggressively developing contraceptives, Ortho 
Pharmaceutical Corp. of Raritan, N.J., has enjoyed success in marketing of oral 
contraceptives, spermicides and other birth-control devices, Mastroianni said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, however, the Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary lost a $4.75-million 
verdict to a Kansas woman who claimed that Ortho Novum birth-control pills gave 
her a rare kidney disease. 
</P>
<P>
"A few more lawsuits like that, and Ortho won't be developing more 
contraceptives either," Mastroianni said. 
</P>
<P>
The academy's study links between 1.2 million and 3 million unwanted 
pregnancies each year in the United States to contraceptive failure. Last year, 
it said, those failures and resulting pregnancies accounted for about half of 
some 1.5 million abortions nationwide.

LAWYERS FILE 1ST CHALLENGE OF FLAG-BURNING LAW

Attorneys for four people accused of burning a U.S. flag made the first 
constitutional challenge Wednesday to the Flag Protection Act of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Haggerty, Carlos Garza, Darius Allen Strong and Jennifer Campbell are 
charged with burning a U.S. flag outside a Seattle Post Office shortly after 
midnight last Oct. 28, the day the flag protection law took effect. U.S. 
District Judge Barbara Rothstein said she would issue a ruling in several days 
on the constitutional challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed the law in response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that 
burning a U.S. flag is protected under First Amendment guarantees of free 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
New York lawyer William Kunstler argued that Congress singled out all common 
forms of protest against the flag while allowing it to be disposed of by 
burning when it becomes old and worn. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark Bartlett said the three men and one woman charged in 
the case were not arrested because of their political beliefs but because of 
the action they took: burning the flag. 
</P>
<P>
Another defense attorney, David Cole, said if Rothstein denies the motion to 
dismiss he will appeal directly to the Supreme Court, as provided under the 
act. 
</P>
<P>
Trial for the four defendants is set for Feb. 26. In addition to the 
flag-desecration counts, each is charged with one count of depredation of U.S. 
government property. Conviction on the flag-desecration and 
destruction-of-property counts each carries a maximum penalty of one year in 
prison and a $100,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush had sought a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning.

A howling, blinding snowstorm blew into the Windy City on Wednesday, paralyzing 
air traffic, reducing rush hour auto traffic to a crawl and stranding couples 
out on the town to celebrate Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
At one point early in the evening, weather gauges were recording snow falling 
at an inch an hour with 7 inches on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Snow plows were powerless to keep streets clear of the accumulating snow, and 
forecasters described conditions for the rest of the night as unpredictable 
with more than a foot of snow possible by morning. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hare International Airport closed at about 7:30 p.m. when an American 
Airlines jet bound for Zurich slid off the one open runway as it attempted to 
take off. None of the 146 passengers and crew were injured. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any runways available," said Lisa Howard, spokeswomen for the 
Department of Aviation. O'Hare was not expected to open until sometime today. 
Midway Airport was only open for departures, but since no arriving flights were 
permitted to land there were few airplanes available to depart. 
</P>
<P>
Air traffic was not the only problem for commuters. At least one commuter train 
derailed as it attempted to leave Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
Expressways and surface streets were still crowded more than three hours after 
the evening rush is normally over. The ride from O'Hare to downtown, normally a 
30- to 45-minute trip during rush hour, took up to three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic at major expressway exits was backed up more than two miles, and some 
streets were blocked by abandoned and stalled cars and multi-vehicle accidents.

Gov. George Deukmejian announced Wednesday the appointment of Bruce J. Janigian 
of Sacramento to replace Ben G. Davidian, who resigned as chairman of the 
Agricultural Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
Janigian, 39, has been a Fulbright professor of law at the University of 
Salzburg, Austria, since the fall of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member board was created in 1975 to set up collective bargaining for 
farm workers. For years the growers contended that appointees of Gov. Edmund G. 
Brown Jr. gave the board a pro-worker bias. But since Deukmejian's election in 
1982, the workers have contended that his appointees have given it a pro-grower 
bias. The last Brown appointee left the board last year. 
</P>
<P>
Janigian earned degrees from UC Berkeley, the Hastings College of Law and 
George Washington University. He has been a commissioner for the U.S. Navy and 
Marine Corps Court of Military Review, an attorney adviser for the U.S. Agency 
for International Development, and deputy director and chief counsel for the 
state Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
He is a commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve and an adjunct professor of law at 
the McGeorge School of Law.

DEATHS OF 4 SEA OTTERS LEAD TO TIGHTER CURBS ON GILL NETS 
</P>

<P>
State fish and game officials say they will further restrict the use of gill 
nets in a small area of the Central Coast waters after the weekend deaths of 
four sea otters. 
</P>
<P>
The sea otters -- classified a "threatened" species -- were entangled and 
killed in a fine-filament gill net near Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
Al Petrovich, chief of the Fish and Game Department's marine resources 
division, said he was informed that a state-paid ocean observer -- looking 
through a land-based telescope -- saw a fisherman take the four dead otters 
from his gill net off Ragged Point. The number of dead otters reported was 
unusually high for one net and brought documented deaths of the threatened 
marine mammal to six this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had them trickle in periodically, one here and one there," Petrovich 
said about dead otter reports. "But not four." 
</P>
<P>
Petrovich said the state is now drafting an emergency measure that would allow 
commercial boats in the Ragged Point area to use their gill nets only in water 
180 feet or deeper. Existing regulations permit gill nets in water as shallow 
as 120 feet. Petrovich said the boats use gill nets on the Central Coast to 
catch halibut, which bring fishermen as much as $2.25 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The use of gill nets in California coastal waters is a simmering controversy, 
which has pitted commercial fishermen against environmentalists and 
recreational fishermen. Operators of commercial boats say the nets are 
efficient, but the environmentalists say the fine-filament mesh 
indiscriminately kills endangered marine mammals such as porpoises and otters. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and game fishermen are currently gathering signatures to 
place a measure on the November ballot to ban the use of gill nets in the 
coastal waters of Southern California.

CENSUS WILL COUNT 'UNMARRIED PARTNERS' FOR FIRST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR F. ZONANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that reflects the changing definition of the American family, the 
Census Bureau for the first time will attempt in its 1990 population survey to 
count the number of people who consider themselves "unmarried partners." 
</P>
<P>
The new designation will be added to such traditional categories as "single," 
"married," "roommate" and "boarder," Donald Hernandez, chief of the bureau's 
marriage and family statistics branch, said in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The new category will give government officials -- as well as policy makers, 
marketers and others who rely on census data -- a better handle on the number 
of unmarried couples in committed relationships, both heterosexual and 
homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important milestone," said David Link, a member of the city Task 
Force on Family Diversity in Los Angeles. "It marks the first step by the 
federal government toward recognizing the concept of domestic partnership." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said the main purpose of the new category is to identify unmarried 
persons of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
"We already know that half of the people who get married today were living as 
unmarried partners before they got married," he said. "It's a major change in 
the family formation process, and it's important that we get a handle on this 
group. As a byproduct, we will also be able to identify unmarried partners of 
the same sex." 
</P>
<P>
An accurate count of unmarried couples is important because many public and 
private initiatives are launched on the basis of census data. For example, the 
number of unmarried partners will probably be seized upon by both advocates and 
opponents of local "domestic partnership" ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
That in turn could affect the growing debate on whether to grant such spousal 
benefits as health insurance coverage, hospital visitation rights and 
bereavement leaves to unmarried partners. 
</P>
<P>
The "unmarried partner" designation on the census questionnaire reflects the 
growing acceptance of the concept of family diversity. A poll last fall by 
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. found that only 22% of those surveyed 
defined families in a legalistic way as "a group related by blood, marriage or 
adoption." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, 74% defined the family in more emotional terms, such as "a group 
who love and care for each other." 
</P>
<P>
A Time Magazine/Cable News Network poll last November found that, by a margin 
of 54% to 37%, Americans thought that homosexual couples should be permitted to 
receive medical and life-insurance benefits from a partner's policy. However, 
they opposed the concept of homosexual marriage by 69% to 23%. 
</P>
<P>
Gary L. Bauer, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Family Research Council, 
a conservative think tank that aims to preserve the "traditional" family, said: 
"While we are troubled by the phenomenon of unmarried couples living together 
in a sexual relationship, that does not mean we are vehemently opposed to 
learning how many people are engaged in such a life style." 
</P>
<P>
Bauer, a White House domestic policy aide during the Reagan Administration, 
added that "it might be useful to see the figures because they may in fact show 
a lot fewer people in such relationships than is commonly believed." 
</P>
<P>
In a rough calculation based on a 1988 population survey, census officials last 
year estimated that of the nation's 91 million households, 2.6 million are made 
up of unmarried couples of the opposite sex, while 1.6 million involve 
unmarried couples of the same sex. 
</P>
<P>
Ivy Young, director of the Families Project of the National Gay and Lesbian 
Task Force, applauded the inclusion of the new category, but she criticized the 
Census Bureau for failing to alert affected groups that the question exists or 
to explain what "unmarried partner" means. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no outreach effort, no community education, no discussion with 
lesbian and gay activists about how to best ensure that the question is 
understood and answered accurately," she said. On the other hand, the bureau 
has developed outreach programs for such undercounted groups as blacks, 
Latinos, the homeless and illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Young added, "fear and apprehension" of government intrusion among 
gay men and lesbians -- unless countered by explicit promises of 
confidentiality -- "could lead to a serious undercount of same-sex couples."

<P>
Marion Barry, mayor of Washington, was indicted by a federal grand jury today 
on five criminal counts of possessing cocaine and three counts of lying to a 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, one of the most prominent and controversial black politicians in the 
United States, was charged with possessing cocaine on four occasions in 1988 
and at the Vista International Hotel in downtown Washington on Jan. 18 when he 
was arrested in a police "sting" operation. 
</P>
<P>
Barry is undergoing treatment for substance abuse at a Florida clinic and has 
turned over the day-to-day operations of the district government to a city 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charged that during a Jan. 19, 1989, grand jury appearance Barry 
lied under oath by stating he was not aware that Charles Lewis was involved 
with drugs and by stating that the two men had not exchanged cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who is cooperating with the investigation, was recently sentenced to 15 
months in prison on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the three false declaration charges carries a five-year prison term and 
a maximum fine of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Four charges against Barry involve alleged possession of cocaine between Dec. 
16-22, 1988, the period when Barry was visiting Lewis at the downtown Ramada 
Inn. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth drug-possession charge stems from Barry's Jan. 18 arrest at the Vista 
where he was visiting a former girlfriend, Rasheeda Moore.

DRUG SUMMIT ENDS IN PACT;

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush and the leaders of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, holding a 
drug-fighting summit under an unusually heavy air, sea and land security cover, 
reached agreement today on a coordinated attack against narcotics producers and 
murderous traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
After Bush signed a series of drug-fighting agreements concluding the 2 
1/2-hour summit, he and Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas said in a 
joint statement that the summit was "a significant step toward improved 
anti-drug coordination." 
</P>
<P>
The leaders were to have met in the afernoon after the 2 1/2-hour morning 
session, but that meeting became unneccessary. 
</P>
<P>
Bush promised to seek expanded U.S. markets for Colombian products, part of an 
effort to coax Andean producers out of the coca business and into growing other 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Barco conferred separately during the four-nation meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia has complained that U.S. trade policy is hurting its major legal 
exports, including coffee, cut flowers and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Among other steps taken at the summit meeting, held at a tightly guarded naval 
base off this Caribbean resort city: 
</P>
<P>
* An agreement with Bolivia to help stem the movement of U.S. firearms into 
South American nations. The U.S. government will be more restrictive in issuing 
export licenses for firearms and will work "domestically to suppress the flow 
of smuggled arms," the agreement stated. 
</P>
<P>
* An agreement with Peru to enhance "effective law enforcement cooperation" 
that places a high priority on extradition of fugitives to stand trial in the 
country where they are accused. 
</P>
<P>
* Tax agreements with Bolivia and Peru that would permit exchange of tax 
records, bank statements and other information "to uncover illicit drug 
profits, trace drug money laundering and generally to further civil and 
criminal tax investigations." 
</P>
<P>
* Agreements with Bolivia and Peru to establish a computerized network with a 
database on anti-drug activities. 
</P>
<P>
Barco told the summit members on their arrival at Cartagena that "we shall move 
forward in spite of the sacrifices that we have had to take on. 
</P>
<P>
"No, we will not weaken, we will not let the deaths of thousands of Colombians 
be in vain," said Barco, whose country has been ravaged by bombings, 
assassinations and other violence from drug lords and leftist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-morning, Bush, Barco, and Presidents Alan Garcia of Peru and Jaime Paz 
of Bolivia strolled briefly in 85-degree heat along the shore of Cartagena Bay, 
admiring the panoramic skyline of the sun-drenched city in the distance, before 
they entered the rugged old stone Ft. Manzanillo to begin their talks. 
</P>
<P>
Security was extraordinarily tight around the summit site. Patrol boats sped 
along the shore with machine guns pointed inland, and a Colombian frigate was 
stationed just off the peninsula. Across Cartagena Bay, the wharves were empty, 
and the streets of this resort city -- normally packed with traffic and 
pedestrians -- were virtually abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Security concerns were heightened when suspected pro-Cuban guerrillas kidnaped 
two Americans in and near Medellin earlier this week and seized an American 
priest today. The abductions were apparently to protest Bush's trip to 
Colombia.

Marion Barry, mayor of Washington, was indicted by a federal grand jury today 
on five criminal counts of possessing cocaine and three counts of lying to a 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, one of the most prominent and controversial black politicians in the 
United States, was charged with possessing cocaine on four occasions in 1988 
and at the Vista International Hotel in downtown Washington on Jan. 18 when he 
was arrested in a police "sting" operation. 
</P>
<P>
Barry is undergoing treatment for substance abuse at a Florida clinic and has 
turned over the day-to-day operations of the district government to a city 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charged that during a Jan. 19, 1989, grand jury appearance Barry 
lied under oath by stating he was not aware that Charles Lewis was involved 
with drugs and by stating that the two men had not exchanged cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who is cooperating with the investigation, was recently sentenced to 15 
months in prison on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the three false declaration charges carries a five-year prison term and 
a maximum fine of $250,000.

CLEANUP CREWS TACKLING LAST PATCHES OF OIL 
</P>

<P>
Workers in yellow jumpsuits patrolled beaches as far south as Laguna Beach 
today, cleaning up the last of the 394,000 gallons of oil spill trickling 
ashore looking much like chocolate mousse, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-morning, Coast Guard officials said only two patches of oily sheen 
remained at sea, both about half a mile off the Huntington Beach Municipal 
Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of British Petroleum, which operates the American Trader, the tanker 
that spilled the oil Feb. 7, said they expect whatever crude is still drifting 
at sea to evaporate rather than move ashore. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach officials remained concerned about the oil at sea, however, 
and expressed skepticism of the report that the city is no longer under threat 
from the slick. 
</P>
<P>
By late morning, 358 oil-coated birds had been rescued and 183 had died. Reed 
Smith, a biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game, said some 
injured birds have recovered enough to be released at Point Mugu in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Today's cleanup efforts were concentrated at Huntington State Beach south of 
the city's pier and in Newport Beach between 47th Street and the Newport Pier, 
officials said. Meanwhile, officials in the cities south of Huntington Beach 
said very little oil is washing up on their beaches, but residents reported 
seeing light patches or scum. 
</P>
<P>
"The beach is open and we haven't found any oil," said Laguna Beach lifeguard 
Mike Dwinell. "There was a light froth at Crystal Cover earlier, but that's 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Scruggs, public information officer for the Laguna Beach Fire Department, 
said the worst appears to be over for the beaches south of Huntington Beach.

JUDGE BARS PRESS FROM HEARING REAGAN TESTIFY; 
</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA: BUT EDITED TAPES OF THE TESTIMONY WILL BE MADE PUBLIC. MEANWHILE, 
PRESIDENT BUSH ALSO WANTS TO KEEP REAGAN DIARIES SECRET.

A federal judge today refused to allow reporters to attend Ronald Reagan's 
videotaped Iran-Contra deposition in Los Angeles Friday, but allowed media 
access to the videotape as soon as it is edited. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, in a 13-page decision, rejected a lawsuit by 
12 news organizations seeking an order allowing press and public attendance 
when Reagan undergoes questioning in a California federal courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Greene refused to open the deposition to the press and public, saying the 
likelihood of disclosure of sensitive national security information is too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a partial compromise, Greene said the edited videotape would be made 
public before its use at the trial of Reagan's former national security 
adviser, John M. Poindexter, now scheduled for March 5 in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In a footnote to his opinion, Greene said the videotape should be edited in 
"two or three working days" barring any "extraordinary disputes" over 
classified material. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bush Administration invoked executive privilege today -- joining 
a move Reagan made earlier -- in an attempt to keep secret excerpts from 
Reagan's personal diaries. Although Reagan agreed to testify on videotape, he 
still is fighting to keep the diaries secret. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said it was claiming executive privilege on the diary 
excerpts on behalf of Bush and maintained that Poindexter has not shown a 
sufficient need for the personal notes to overcome the importance of enabling 
"Presidents to consult with their advisers effectively." 
</P>
<P>
Greene said he will resolve the diary issue after he hears Reagan's testimony. 
The judge will decide which portions of Reagan's testimony will be edited out 
of the videotape. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times and other news organizations had fought for access under 
the First Amendment -- freedom of the press. Greene ruled that the First 
Amendment had to be considered in conjunction with "respect for the 
constitutional prerogatives of the chief executive." 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, Reagan's former national security adviser, is accused of five 
criminal charges.

SOVIET LEGISLATORS CLASH OVER 'PRIVATE PROPERTY'

Soviet legislators clashed today over a proposal to restore private property 
rights in the Soviet Union, and one Ukrainian lawmaker said such an idea is so 
radical that it should be put to a national referendum. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to ask the people," said lawmaker Leonid Sukhov of Kharkov. "The 
people know better." 
</P>
<P>
While the 35-article property bill does not go as far as to use the words 
private property, it does recognize the right for the existence of diverse 
forms of property and says citizens can own property, including houses and 
apartments, for private use. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal does not clearly state whether land can be privately owned. State 
ownership of all land is a fundamental principle of Marxism. 
</P>
<P>
In another departure from orthodox dogma, which forbids individuals to own 
factories and equipment on a large-scale, the bill says citizens can now own 
the "means of production" for farming and other labor activities. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would also allow foreigners to enjoy the same rights as Soviet 
citizens in owning property. Citizens could own stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Premier Leonid Abalkin, who is one of the country's leading radical 
economists, said it was decided to speak of "individual" rather than "private" 
property in the bill because society has a "negative attitude" toward the 
latter term. 
</P>
<P>
After its first reading before the 542-member Supreme Soviet last fall, the 
bill underwent substantial revisions with at least 10,000 changes written into 
the lengthy draft, Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
During the initial debate, conflict arose over who currently owns land and 
natural resources -- the national government or the individual republics. That 
issue has been skirted in the draft in favor of phrasing that says the land and 
its resources "belong to people living on a given territory." 
</P>
<P>
The issue is critical because the legislature in Lithuania has already adopted 
laws that allow the sale of land to individuals.

A pilot who flew cocaine profits to Panama pleaded guilty today to one count of 
illegally transporting funds, becoming the first person indicted with former 
Panama dictator Manuel A. Noriega to admit wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
But the attorney for Eduardo Pardo, 44, said he did not know if his client 
would testify against Noriega and the other defendants in the drug conspiracy 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer William Meadows said there was no plea bargain with the government. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot pleaded guilty to making a flight with $800,000 in drug money from 
Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., to Panama in 1983. U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler 
told Pardo he could face up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, who is still arguing with prosecutors over their right to prosecute 
him, is accused of taking payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.

Fire swept through the offices of the outspoken reformist weekly Moscow News 
before dawn today and editor-in-chief Yegor Yakovlyev said arson could not be 
excluded. 
</P>
<P>
One person was killed jumping from a fifth-floor window of an adjacent actors' 
club and three firemen were injured fighting the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Yakovlyev, who transformed the once unknown newspaper into a campaigning 
journal for radical causes, told a news conference: "We will go on publishing, 
but we will need help from our friends at home and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
Estimating damage at $8 million, he said: "With our finances, we could never 
cover this." 
</P>
<P>
A deputy in the Soviet parliament, Yakovlyev has often been bitterly criticized 
by conservatives but is reputed to have support among officials around 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

Stung by news reports that he is secretive and deceptive, a fuming President 
Bush told the news media today as he flew to Colombia for a four-nation drug 
conference, "From now on, it's going to be a little different." 
</P>
<P>
Bush vowed to hold fewer news conferences and to limit his sessions with 
reporters in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to be burned for holding out or doing something deceptive," Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush aired his grievances with the news media in a chat with reporters aboard 
Air Force One, shortly before he landed here to transfer to a helicopter that 
would take him to Cartagena for a drug summit with the presidents of Colombia, 
Bolivia and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
What apparently riled the President were news stories suggesting he had 
sometimes said one thing, then done something else. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, his comments at a news conference Monday that he did not think it 
was time for a four-power conference on the future of Germany came a day before 
a major agreement on German reunification was reached in Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
"When I told you . . . that I didn't think there'd be a deal and there shortly 
was a deal, then I'm hit for deceiving you," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that at his news conference he did not know that an agreement that 
would involve oversight by the four post-World War II European powers -- the 
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France -- was at hand. 
</P>
<P>
The President expressed his testiness from the start of today's exchange with 
reporters accompanying him here on Air Force One. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had slept aboard the plane in a hangar at Andrews Air Force Base in the 
Maryland suburbs so that he would not arrive in Colombia sleepy after today's 
pre-dawn flight, and he was asked if he had enjoyed a good night's sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a very good night's sleep. I can't get into the details of that because 
some will say it's too much sleep, some will say it's too little." 
</P>
<P>
Then the President added: "I think we've had too many press conferences. It's 
not good. It overdoes it. It's overexposure." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has had about one news conference a week on the average, since he took 
office on Jan. 20, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking no answers to questions. I'm not going to discuss what I'm going to 
bring up," Bush said when asked about his agenda for the day's drug 
conference." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about an NBC-TV report that Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas has 
made a deal with some drug lords in his country not to extradite them to the 
United States if they turn over drug labs, Bush snapped: "I have no comment 
whatsoever on that. I have no comment on whether I know about it or not. I 
can't comment on whether it's true or not." 
</P>
<P>
"So from now on, it's going to be a little different," he added. "We're going 
to have a new relationship. It will be pleasant. It will be fun. But it's 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to be burned for holding out or doing something deceptive." 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not mention which news reports he was referring to. However, today's 
editions of the Washington Post, copies of which were on Bush's plane, had a 
story on what it called "the debate between President Bush and the press over 
secrecy and deception."

Japan and the United States have officially signed a new voluntary restraint 
agreement limiting Japanese steel imports to between 5% and 5.3% of total U.S. 
consumption for 30 months retroactive to last Oct. 1, the Foreign Ministry 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement, signed in Washington, replaced one that expired at the end 
of September. 
</P>
<P>
Japan will limit its steel exports to the United States to 5% of the U.S. 
consumption for the first 15 months. The ceiling will be raised to 5.3% in the 
following 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said the new arrangement may be extended beyond 1992 if 
international rules being negotiated in the Uruguay Round of multilateral free 
trade talks fail to apply to steel trade. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has already signed similar agreements with eight major 
steel-exporting countries.

The United Mine Workers, in a shift of policy, is proceeding with a 
rank-and-file vote on a contract with Pittston Coal Group though $64 million in 
strike-related fines have not been dropped, a UMW official said today. 
</P>
<P>
The union's turnabout means that a vote to end the 10-month strike against the 
nation's largest coal exporter could come as early as Monday, according to Don 
McCamey, secretary-treasurer of UMW District 28 in Castlewood. 
</P>
<P>
A settlement was reached New Year's Eve with the help of William Usery, a 
special mediator appointed by Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole, but terms 
have not been disclosed publicly. Sources familiar with the agreement, however, 
said the union won concessions they sought on the two biggest concerns: job 
security and health and retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
UMW President Richard Trumka said Jan. 1 that the union would withhold a 
rank-and-file vote until all legal action connected with the strike was 
settled.

Jack C. Massey, who helped build Kentucky Fried Chicken Co. into an 
international success and co-founded Hospital Corp. of America, died today at a 
Palm Beach, Fla., hospital. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
Massey died of pneumonia at Good Samaritan Hospital early this morning, said 
Mimi Scruggs, his secretary at Massey Investment Co. in Nashville. Massey, who 
retired from the company in 1978, had been staying at his winter home in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
From a chain of six drugstores, the Nashville businessman founded Massey 
Surgical Supply Inc. in 1930. He sold that company for about $1 million in 1961 
with the intention of retiring in Florida but soon found himself looking for 
other business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964 he bought Kentucky Fried Chicken Co. from its founder, Col. Harland 
Sanders. With John Y. Brown Jr., who later became governor of Kentucky, Massey 
built the company into one of the world's largest commercial marketers of 
prepared food. The two sold that business to Heublein Corp. in 1969.

Hanson Industries agreed to buy the Peabody holdings of three U.S. 
shareholders, Boeing Co., Bechtel Investments Inc. and energy company Eastern 
Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>

RADIO EMPLOYEE WINS SUIT OVER AIRED PERSONAL JOKES

A jury ordered a radio station and two disc jockeys to pay $694,200 in damages 
to a news director they referred to with risque jokes on a "shock radio" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Liz Randolph, 32, claimed the jokes, which implied she was promiscuous and 
mentally unstable, caused her to suffer panic attacks and led her to seek 
psychiatric treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Disc jockeys Jim Quinn and Donald (Banana Don) Jefferson, and EZ Communication, 
owner of WBZZ-FM, were found liable for defamation and invasion of privacy and 
ordered to pay about $260,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph won an additional $390,000 from Quinn and Jefferson for intentional 
infliction of emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the jury awarded Randolph $30,704 for medical bills and $13,500 
for lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph said she was glad she had endured a two-week trial that made public 
much of her personal life, including details of her psychiatric history. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was going to be tough," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One of her attorneys, Samuel P. Kamin, said Wednesday's verdict by the 
Allegheny County Common Pleas jury sends a message to broadcasters about airing 
risque humor, especially jokes that target co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's something the industry's going to have to think twice about 
now," he said. "The signal this sends is the workplace is no place for abuse." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's no question this will have an impact on the kind of conduct 
you'll hear on morning shows," said Jeff Pollack, a Los Angeles-based media 
adviser. "It's clear this case will make a lot of people think twice what they 
say to fellow workers on the air."

Singing has always been Hovie Lister's stock in trade, but the gospel artist 
likes politics enough to spend his winter days opening doors for Georgia 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
Lister, 64, who sang at the funerals of Hank Williams and Elvis Presley, is an 
assistant doorkeeper for the Senate this year, a job he sought from music fan 
Zell Miller, the lieutenant governor. It pays about $1,800 per session. 
</P>

"I just love politics," Lister said.

The Statesmen Quartet, started by the Baptist minister in 1948, has been cited

It's out of the recording studios and into the docket for the rock group 
Boston, whose leader is the defendant in a $20-million breach-of-contract 
lawsuit by CBS records. 
</P>
<P>
In opening arguments Tuesday, Don Engel, an attorney for band leader Tom 
Scholz, said the company bullied his client, illegally suspended his royalties 
and could not, or would not, understand Scholz's artistic difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
CBS charged that Scholz refused to produce albums "not because he couldn't do 
his job, but because he wouldn't do his job." The $20-million lawsuit, 
originally filed in 1983 against the entire band, charged the band with failing 
to deliver the number of albums agreed to under their 1976, $5-million contract 
with CBS. Allegations against other band members were thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the suit is a dispute over royalties that led Boston to switch 
from CBS to MCA Records, which is also named in the suit. The group's first two 
albums, "Boston" and "Don't Look Back," were platinum sellers for CBS.

Spike Lee says the strides made during the civil rights movement are being 
eroded and that it's his job as a filmmaker to portray "the present state of 
racism today." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, who addressed more than 1,200 people at the University of Iowa on Tuesday, 
said racial violence in the Howard Beach section of New York City compelled him 
to make his 1989 film "Do The Right Thing," about racial tension and violence 
during a hot city summer. 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of ways this country is going backward instead of forward, especially 
with all the whole . . . affirmative action and all that stuff that people were 
dying for in the civil rights movement," the black filmmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to film about the present state of racism today. I knew I don't have 
the answers, but that wasn't my job," Lee said. "My job was to hold the mirror 
up and let people know that this is the way it is and unless we all make an 
effort to do something about it, it's going to get worse."

Outraged over the James (Buster) Douglas-Mike Tyson controversy, Gov. Jim 
Florio is trying to persuade his former colleagues in the U.S. Congress to 
regulate boxing. 
</P>
<P>
And the one-time Navy boxer has a big name in his corner as he takes on the 
boxing Establishment -- Howard Cosell. 
</P>
<P>
The former sportscaster and Florio sent jointly signed letters Wednesday to 
members of Congress who are interested in the sport. The letters ask them to 
revive old proposals by Florio to bring uniform, national regulations to a 
sport that sometimes seems to veer wildly out of control. 
</P>
<P>
The letters were triggered by the handling of the long-count controversy after 
Douglas knocked out Tyson in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas' claim to the undisputed heavyweight title was in doubt for several 
days as two of boxing's three governing bodies reviewed allegations that 
Douglas was given a long count after being knocked down in the eighth round. 
Douglas recovered and knocked out Tyson in the 10th round. 
</P>
<P>
The World Boxing Council and the World Boxing Assn. finally agreed that Douglas 
is the champion. 
</P>
<P>
"No governmental action could have kept Mike Tyson on his feet, but the 
aftermath of the fight sharply highlights the need for changes," the letter by 
Florio and Cosell says. 
</P>
<P>
The unlikely pair came together during Florio's unsuccessful boxing reform 
efforts in the 1980s. Florio chaired a subcommittee with jurisdiction over the 
sport, and the former ABC announcer testified at hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a need for more harmonizing, for a national, uniform certification 
process," Florio said. "This is big business, and it's in the hands of 
organizations no one knows anything about." 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Don King, a Tyson adviser, was accused of trying to use his 
considerable clout to overturn Douglas' knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Florio and Cosell said the incident showed the "undue influence" of promoters 
over the governing bodies. 
</P>
<P>
King could not be reached for comment. But spokesman Al Braverman criticized 
Florio, saying politicians should be more interested in "reforming themselves" 
than in reforming boxing.

Charles Barkley doesn't have an NBA championship ring on his finger, but he 
does have a winning streak ring on his ear. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley showed up in the Philadelphia 76ers locker room Wednesday night wearing 
a diamond-studded earring on his left ear, similar to those worn by Mike 
Gminski and Rick Mahorn as a result of a pact among several members on the team 
to get their ears pierced if they won 10 straight games 
</P>
<P>
They won 12 straight before losing two last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I said when I was ready to do it, I'd do it," he said. "We made a pact, and 
I'm going to stick to it. It's a permanent fixture." 
</P>
<P>
According to Gminski, once the team accomplished the 10-game goal, Barkley had 
talked Mahorn and Gminski into joining him on the earring promise. 
</P>
<P>
"I think once he saw Rick and I had done it, he finally succumbed to peer-group 
pressure," Gminski said. "He was, like, back there making the snowballs and we 
were throwing them, and so he had to finally step up to the plate."

NBA CHIEF GETS $27.5-MILLION, 5-YEAR CONTRACT

David Stern is the NBA's latest $3-million man. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner received a five-year, $27.5-million contract, including a 
$10-million bonus, according to a report in USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
Team owners confirmed Stern's annual salary -- 3 1/2 times what any other 
sports commissioner is paid -- and said it was approved during last week's 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA declined comment on the story. 
</P>
<P>
The pay raise follows the recent network and cable television package Stern 
negotiated with NBC and Ted Turner's TNT. The deal will boost average payments 
to clubs from $2.55 million to $8.1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Of the other major sports commissioners, Paul Tagliabue receives $1 million a 
year, baseball's Fay Vincent gets $500,000 and the NHL's John Ziegler is paid 
$425,000. 
</P>
<P>
Stern's salary reportedly will cost each club $129,630 each year, or 2.4% of 
the $5.5-million increase the teams are getting from the new television deal. 
</P>
<P>
"David is very deserving," Phoenix Suns President Jerry Colangelo, who is on 
the league committee that approved Stern's deal, told USA Today. "Stern has 
done an outstanding job leading our league." 
</P>
<P>
"We think he's an exceptional commissioner, a terrific talent, and he should be 
appropriately paid," Daniel Finnane, president of the Golden State Warriors, 
said.

Dan Bean, an Alpine select team coach for the U.S. Ski Team, died today from 
head injuries suffered in a car accident on an icy mountain highway. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred Wednesday afternoon as Bean and his wife, Lisa, both of 
York, Me., were driving in a caravan with team members from Winter Park to 
Crested Butte for the U.S. Alpine Championships, which begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Their car went out of control on icy U.S. 24 about 12 miles north of Buena 
Vista and ran off the road, down an embankment and into a tree, the Colorado 
State Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Bean, 34, a passenger in the car, died at St. Francis Hospital in Colorado 
Springs at 4:15 a.m. today after being flown there Wednesday night from Salida 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Bean, 22, was hospitalized with a lower back injury and was still being 
observed to determine if she would need surgery, St. Francis spokeswoman Kitty 
Sears said today. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Bean was in his sixth season as a U.S. Ski Team coach and was moved to the 
position of Alpine select, or B team coach, this year.

Sales of hunting and fishing licenses in California have declined steeply for 
the last 10 years and threaten the Department of Fish and Game with a serious 
money shortage, its director says. 
</P>
<P>
Director Pete Bontadelli said urbanization of California and shifts in social 
attitudes toward hunting have had a major effect on the department, which 
traditionally relies on license sales to sportsmen to finance much of its work. 
</P>
<P>
"The traditional funding bases . . . are not holding up," Bontadelli said 
Wednesday. "In the last (1988-89) fiscal year, we had a $7-million deficiency. 
This year it may be even greater." 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli testified at the annual seminar on fishing issues held by the 
Senate-Assembly Joint Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture. He said that for 
the first six months of the current fiscal year, the department's cash 
shortfall has reached $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Future economies may include closing fish hatcheries, dumping fish and 
restricting travel of employees "to the point where their work will be 
ineffective," he said.

Caught in lockout limbo, Bob Ojeda and other major leaguers today have a new 
set of concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Like when to play, where and with what. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't even come here," Ojeda said at the New York Mets' spring training 
camp Wednesday, a day before the owners' lockout went into effect. "The 
players' union isn't saying don't work out. But I don't think they think it's 
best for the whole team to get together." 
</P>
<P>
That's because, as teammate and union executive board member Ron Darling said, 
there's more at stake than baseball practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we learned something from the NFL strike," Darling said. "If owners 
see 25 or 30 players together working hard to stay in shape, maybe there isn't 
as much incentive for the owners to bargain. We'll probably work in groups of 
two or three. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll try to find someone who will catch me, maybe Barry Lyons or Mackey Sasser 
or Chris Jelic. I'll get whoever I can. We could just find a Little League 
field and back up to the fences and throw." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' practice field was deserted. On a distant field, Coach Bud Harrelson 
was working with fantasy campers. "We're pretty much locked out, too," he said. 
"We're in limbo. Usually on the first day of spring training, you'd hear noises 
from around the fields, the sound of the bat and ball. That's missing today." 
</P>
<P>
By noon, the Mets had sold a total of four tickets for the upcoming exhibition 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a place, the players need their own equipment. Kids always have bats 
and balls; for million-dollar major leaguers, it's not always so convenient. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard Tim Teufel is bringing down some baseballs from Connecticut," Darling 
said. "At least I hope he is." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets were one of the few teams that had players voluntarily working out the 
day before security guards fastened the locks and turned the keys. 
</P>
<P>
Up the road a few miles at Vero Beach, Manager Tom Lasorda was the only one at 
Dodgertown. He was there for the end of a fantasy camp but didn't plan on 
staying in town. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be sad," Lasorda said. "There isn't going to be anyone around. 
But that's the way it is. Camps are closed. I'm going home tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, however, planned a Friday workout for non-roster players and may 
be the only team doing so. Former major leaguers Glenn Hoffman, Edwin Correa 
and Butch Davis are among those expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Most camps in Florida and Arizona were deserted. It was empty at the field in 
West Palm Beach, which is shared by the Atlanta Braves and Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of players, including Mike Lavalliere and John Smiley, were at 
Pittsburgh's camp at Bradenton, while Bobby Thigpen of the Chicago White Sox 
and Ray Searage of the Dodgers worked out at St. Louis' site near their homes

Question: I have a feeling that if the same 10 horses raced against one another 
10 times, there would be a different winner almost every time. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "That depends, I would think, on the class of horse to which your 
reader refers," says Hall of Fame trainer Leroy Jolley. "If you are talking 
about cheap claiming horses, then I agree that there would be a lot of winners 
in 10 races with the same field. If good horses were involved, I think two or 
three horses would dominate. Good horses have the consistency that is often 
missing in cheap horses."

Q: What percentage of horses never win a race? 
</P>
<P>
A: A study was made some years ago of the produce of 1,000 broodmares. These 
mares produced approximately 6,600 foals. Of this group of foals, 18% never 
raced. Another 20% raced but did not win. Thus, 38% of this study group failed 
to win. Students of breeding estimate that these figures would stand up fairly 
well if a similar study were made today or tomorrow. These statistics underline 
the hazards of horse ownership. It is important to remember that it is the 
owners who put on the show. If not for their willingness to buy horses, there 
would be no racing as we know it. The late (Sunny) Jim Fitzsimmons always said 
the owners and the public who support the sport are the only important groups 
in racing.

Q: How much will a horse's speed rating change during the course of a season? 
</P>
<P>
A: "If a horse does most of his racing at the same distance and in the same 
area through most of the year, his speed ratings won't show a wide range of 
change," says the well-known handicapper and breeder, Jule Fink. "However, when 
a horse changes distances, his speed ratings can be affected. Consider a 
sprinter asked to go a distance of ground in several races. He will probably 
show a higher speed rating in those races, for he has been conditioned in 
sprints to run at a faster pace. On the other hand, when he drops back to 
sprints, his speed ratings are likely to be lower for his speed may have been 
dulled going distance of ground several times. A point to remember, however, is 
that this horse may have more stamina because of those distance races. This 
added stamina could be of help to him, even in sprints."

<P>
Q: How far is a horse beaten if the margin is a neck? 
</P>
<P>
A: "We calculate that two noses equal one head, two heads equal one neck, and 
four necks equal one length," says Daily Racing Form track man Jack Smallwood. 
"The length of an average racehorse is between 8 and 9 feet, and thus a neck 
would be about 2 feet."
