<TEXT>
<P>
In your article on gang violence, state Sen. David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) 
laments the rending of the social fabric in the inner city. This, he explains, 
is the consequence of cuts in social programs occasioned by Proposition 13 and 
former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan took office in 1981. Proposition 13 passed in 1978. There were already 
plenty of drugs, guns, and crimes in the ghetto before then, so the senator had 
better look deeper for root causes. 
</P>
<P>
Let him take as his starting point the birth dates of the hard young criminals 
who do the rending he complains of. They were born in the '60s and early '70s: 
products of the Great Society, not victims of Republican parsimony. It was an 
age of faith that social programs would end crime and poverty. Roberti may 
still believe, but wiser folks have learned from experience. 
</P>
<P>
Bring forth a government program that will keep fathers in the home, Senator, 
or cause mothers to care that their children are raised right. Some things 
cannot be bought with tax dollars.

The numbers say it all. More than 2,700 people have been killed by gang members 
in the 1980s in L.A. County and 15,000 more have been seriously injured. It 
seems that no matter what we do to prevent gang violence, the number of 
killings per year continues to increase. So many innocent people are needlessly 
killed or seriously injured because of gang violence, because they happen to be 
at "the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
What, then, is the right place at the right time? I'm often afraid to walk down 
a busy street, or anywhere else for that matter, for fear of being shot in the 
cross fire of two rival gangs. Nowadays, you never really know what might 
happen and when. I feel for those who live their lives in fear because I can 
empathize, but we shouldn't be made to live that way. 
</P>
<P>
I'm happy to know that several new programs have been created to protect 
"at-risk" children, strengthen gang-prevention programs, etc., but I also 
realize that these programs cost a lot of money, which we don't have a lot of.

COURT APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My attention has just been called to a recent letter (Jan. 18) by Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Paul Rugnetta. Rugnetta complains that the Office of the State Public 
Defender has squandered taxpayer money by raising on appeal the single 
contention that our client received a prison sentence that was three days too 
long. 
</P>
<P>
Parenthetically, I would note that three hours let alone three days of unlawful 
and undeserved time in prison constitutes a miscarriage of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Under our justice system, a person convicted of a crime has a statutory and 
constitutional right to have an appeal court review his case to determine that 
he or she had a fair trial and received a lawful sentence. When an appeal court 
appoints this agency to represent an indigent person, we have an ethical 
obligation to review the record, explore all potential issues, but raise only 
arguable and not frivolous issues. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the facts and circumstances of the case, I am personally 
satisfied that the deputy who authorized the appellant's brief acted pursuant 
to her professional responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The state public defender's office did its job well and responsibly and 
corrected an injustice.

SPEAKING FEES AND DOLE FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sara Fritz's report about congressional speaking fees and charitable 
foundations ("Speech Fees: Handy Tool for Congress," Part I, Jan. 16) was a sad 
disservice to your readers and to disabled Americans. 
</P>
<P>
As president and chief executive officer of the Dole Foundation -- one of The 
Times targets -- I want an opportunity to set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
The Times claims that the Dole Foundation is "perhaps the most elaborate 
outgrowth of excess honorariums." This statement is preposterous. In the four 
years the Dole Foundation has operated, Sen. Robert Dole's (R-Kan.) 
contribution of "excess" honorariums accounts for less than 1% of the total 
funds we have received. The fact is that the vast majority of our funds come 
from corporations and individuals, not congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Dole -- one of the nation's 36 million persons with a disability -- 
established the Dole Foundation in 1983 to help the disabled develop employment 
skills and to make work areas accessible to them. 
</P>
<P>
Times readers were not informed about the 10 programs we have funded in 
California alone, which total $295,234, or about the hundreds of people with 
disabilities across the nation who have been given marketable skills as a 
result of the foundation's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
I am proud of the accomplishments of this organization. Our purpose is to 
enhance employment opportunities for people with disabilities, not to 
"redistribute" honorariums.

THE PENDULUM SWINGS TO SALVADORAN LEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

at the National Autonomous University, Mexico.

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The five Central American presidents may have signaled an end to the war in 
Nicaragua when they agreed to have the Contras removed from their Honduran 
sanctuary in exchange for the Sandinistas' holding of earlier-than-scheduled 
open elections. This brings the war in El Salvador back to center stage and 
clarifies the logic behind the peace proposal offered recently by the Farabundo 
Marti Liberation Front (FMLN). It also underlines the importance of the plan by 
several key FMLN leaders to travel from Mexico City to San Salvador this 
weekend. It would be the first time that the guerrilla leadership appeared 
publicly in the capital of their country since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The FMLN has proposed that the March 19 presidential election be postponed 
until September. They would participate by supporting the candidates of their 
political allies in the new Democratic Convergence. Most important, the rebels 
agreed to accept the election results and the legitimacy of whatever government 
emerged from the vote. A key condition of their proposal was U.S. neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
While the move was widely viewed as skillful, it was also met by a great deal 
of skepticism: What if the Salvadoran army and government accepted the offer 
instead of automatically turning it down (as they seem to have done)? How could 
participation in elections, even with suitable guarantees, possibly benefit the 
FMLN guerrillas? 
</P>
<P>
The answers are yet to be fully known, but some are obvious. Since 1980 the 
insurgents have realized that the more their struggle is militarized and the 
less it is politically centered, the more difficult it would be. Also, while 
they knew that no arrangement was possible during Ronald Reagan's tenure at the 
White House, they hope -- perhaps naively -- that the Bush Administration may 
be more willing to enter negotiations in El Salvador. But one of the main 
underlying motives for the FMLN's bold move must be found in the pendular 
movement of regional symmetry. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, when the wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador became regional, each 
side has tried to make symmetry work in its favor. Each side has struggled to 
impose identical conditions -- of war or of peace -- on different situations, 
hoping that what was favorable to its interests in one country at a given 
moment would be unfavorable to its enemy's interests in the other country at 
the same time. In the early 1980s, when the FMLN and the Sandinistas were 
strong and the Contras and the Salvadoran army weak, symmetry worked in favor 
of the left and against the United States. The latter could not afford to have 
the same deal cut in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
As the Contras received more aid and got stronger, and as the Sandinistas faced 
growing economic and international difficulties, and as the FMLN stagnated and 
the Salvadoran regime stabilized, the effects of symmetry swung over to the 
U.S.-backed side. The Reagan Administration tried to use the situation in El 
Salvador as leverage to further its aims in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Today symmetry is clearly perceived by the FMLN and the Sandinistas as being 
squarely on their side. The commandantes in Managua evidently believe that the 
Contras are finished and that, despite their country's economic woes, they can 
win a competitive election. The guerrilla leaders in El Salvador consider 
themselves stronger than ever militarily and in moderately better shape 
politically. Their military strategy has once again put the army on the 
defensive, and their "mayor elimination" campaign in the countryside, while 
cynical and brutal, has worked. Most rural mayors have resigned, and the 
central government's local authority is virtually non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas and the FMLN now call for the same objectives and propose the 
same rules in both countries: elections, guarantees and an end to outside help 
for everybody. This means an end to U.S. and Honduran aid to the Contras and a 
significant drop in whatever backing the Salvadoran guerrillas continue to 
receive from Managua. It also means an end to massive U.S. aid ($1 million a 
day) to the government of El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
In Nicaragua the Sandinistas win hands down; in El Salvador the insurgents 
either win tactically, by making the army responsible for prolonging the war, 
or strategically, by reducing U.S. involvement and participating in elections 
under conditions that would assure the FMLN-backed candidates a far better 
showing than most people would expect. 
</P>
<P>
The key to understanding Central America has always been the balance of forces 
-- knowing who's up, who's down. After Contra aid was defeated, and once it 
became evident that the FMLN had outlasted Ronald Reagan and several billions 
of U.S. aid dollars, it was obvious that the basic equation would eventually 
return to what it was in 1980: the Sandinistas in power, the FMLN making a 
serious bid to achieve it. Plus ca change ....

DEDICATE THE '90S TO THE ENVIRONMENT; 
</P>
<P>
INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENT COULD BE OUR GIFT TO NEW CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GUSTAVE SPETH, James Gustave Speth is the president of the World 
Resources Institute in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's environmental problems are closely interlinked, planetary in scale and 
deadly serious. They cannot be addressed issue-by-issue or by one nation or 
even by a small group of nations acting alone. They will not yield to modest 
commitments of resources in the face of a doubling of world population and a 
quintupling of world economic activity in the lifetimes of today's children. 
</P>
<P>
The nations of the world must come together in recognition of that grave 
challenge. They should declare that a priority mission of international 
cooperation and diplomacy in the 1990s will be to deliver a gift to the new 
century of a planet sustained and whole. To give long-term structure to this 
commitment they should establish a 10-year program, the International 
Environmental Decade. 
</P>
<P>
This program could be inaugurated with the high-level international conference 
on the environment promised by President Bush during the campaign -- a pledge 
that he has since reiterated. Born in politics, this conference in fact 
presents an opportunity to do something of genuine historical importance. 
</P>
<P>
The timing could not be more propitious. The world's environment is in trouble. 
The buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere threatens 
far-reaching climate change, and one class of these gases -- 
chlorofluorocarbons -- is also depleting the Earth's ozone layer, which shields 
us from the sun's ultraviolet radiation. Over large areas of the globe, air 
pollutants are escaping urban-industrial areas and invading the countryside, 
seriously damaging aquatic life, forests and crops. 
</P>
<P>
In the developing world, pressures on natural resources intensify daily. The 
deserts expand while the forests, with their immense wealth of life forms, 
retreat. An acre of tropical forests disappears every second. Hundreds of 
millions of people live in absolute poverty, destroying the resources on which 
their future depends because no alternative is open to them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the seriousness of these challenges is increasingly acknowledged by 
political leaders as diverse as Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev and Rajiv 
Gandhi, only modest efforts have been launched to deal with them. As yet there 
is no concerted international response on a scale equal to the challenges. The 
international conference on the environment would be a major step in closing 
the gap between the increasing realization that grave problems exist and the 
paucity of the political response to date. 
</P>
<P>
An International Environmental Decade could both stimulate and coordinate 
action on three fronts. The first of these is providing the poor of the world 
with environmentally non-destructive livelihoods; sustainable development is 
critical both to meet basic human needs and to take pressure off a 
deteriorating resource base. The second front is transforming industrial 
systems away from the pollution-prone technologies of the 20th Century to the 
environmentally benign technologies that will be essential if economic growth 
is to continue. And the third is stabilizing populations both in nations where 
growth is explosive and on a global basis before the world's population doubles 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Most basically, world political leaders must devise a new system of 
international responsibility -- burden-sharing to sustain the Earth and its 
people -- that does not exist today. Unless such a system is worked out, the 
next great international crisis is likely to be about the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is such a system needed more than in slowing down the global warming 
brought on by the greenhouse effect. To be successful, we will need a series of 
international conventions that not only respond to the complexity of that issue 
but also provide complementary solutions to other environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
We need to secure swift international approval of the ozone-layer protection 
protocol signed in Montreal last year and have the nations of the world come 
back to negotiate a complete, swift phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons. We need 
an overall global climate-protection convention -- a prime goal of which should 
be to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions through greatly improved energy 
efficiency and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
We need an international agreement to protect the world's tropical forests and 
to reforest the spreading wasteland areas in many developing countries. Relief 
for Third World countries from the stifling burden of international debt will 
be required for progress on this front. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's sponsorship of an environmental conference of world leaders can put the 
world on the road to this new system of international responsibility. The 1990s 
are all the time that we have left to prepare what can be our most important 
gift to the new century.

BLACK HISTORY BEGINS AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK HARRIS III, Frank Harris III is a writer who lives in West Haven, 
Conn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have always been curious about black history. Curious about the people who 
moved in life while I was yet a whisper in the womb. But that curiosity, that 
quest for knowledge about the black people before me, extended beyond the 
general knowledge of great black figures like Frederick Douglass, Harriet 
Tubman, Martin Luther King and other historical figures who symbolized the 
struggle of blacks in America. 
</P>
<P>
My curiosity went inward toward the story of my own personal black history -- 
the history of those in my family. 
</P>
<P>
Like most black Americans, my knowledge of the family lineage was limited to 
the 100 years this side of the Emancipation, and this, too, was limited. From 
my parents' stories I could go back as far as Mississippi, their home state. 
From these same stories I had a clear picture of what life was like in 
Mississippi in the 1930s and 1940s for blacks in general, and my family in 
particular. I knew, too, that Mississippi historically has been one of the 
poorest states in the Union, and one whose name was synonymous with violent 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
My parents left Mississippi and headed north to Illinois after they were 
married. Their brothers and sisters also left. I was born and raised in the 
North, with my knowledge of Mississippi limited to periodic visits to my 
maternal and paternal grandparents who remained as the sole roots to the family 
tree that had branched out across the country. They were my oldest living 
relatives, and as I grew older I wanted to know about their life and the lives 
of those before them as far back as they could remember. I wanted to know what 
thoughts, what passions, what events had come together in molding my family 
into the people we have become, and the people we shall become. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago I traveled to Mississippi in pursuit of my family's black 
history. Much of my time was spent with my maternal grandfather -- a 
tobacco-chewing, tough but witty man who didn'tmind my tape recorder playing 
everywhere we went. He took me around the small Mississippi delta town in which 
he lived, and we walked and we talked about his life and the family and the 
things he thought and felt. He talked about the long years of the Great 
Depression when times were tough for everyone but particularly for a black man 
in the state of Mississippi. He told me about the struggle to keep the family 
together, about his trip to Vicksburg to find work, about the callousness and 
the warmth of human beings -- and about his unyielding faith. 
</P>
<P>
My grandfather died two months ago. Today, in the center of Black History 
Month, my sorrow at his passing has been tempered by the gift he granted six 
years ago: the gift of his voice on tape telling, in his own words, his life 
and the life of our family. 
</P>
<P>
I hear his voice and feel the gravel beneath our feet as we walked along the 
dirt road atop the levee, and touch the bittersweet beauty of the cotton puffed 
and white in the September sun, and watch the ripples in the water of the 
mighty Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
I am thankful for my curiosity. I listen to the tapes. I hear his voice. I know 
I have something special. It is a gift that transcends his lifetime and will 
transcend mine. 
</P>
<P>
As we celebrate this month, it is important not only that black Americans learn 
about the history that we have in common as a group but also that we learn 
about the unsung heroes in our own families who struggled through life in the 
best way they knew to make life a little better for the present generation. 
</P>
<P>
Black history begins at home. The strength of any celebration of black history 
is to be felt in knowing the personal history of our family members who came 
before us. It is the knowledge of the stony roads they trod, their victories 
and defeats, their life of living that forms the cornerstone to a strong 
foundation for black Americans as individuals and as a group.

DELUSIONS OF SUPERIORITY FESTER AGAIN IN GERMANY -- BUT NOT ONLY IN GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROLF SCHULZE, Rolf Schulze is professor of sociology at San Diego State 
University. He emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1950. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A strong sense of deja vu came over me when I heard about the election victory 
in West Berlin of a party described as fascist and Nazi-like. 
</P>
<P>
I lived in Berlin at the time of the infamous Kristallnacht on Nov. 9, 1938. I 
was only 6 years old, and probably slept through that night of destruction and 
killing, but I do recall the Star of David painted in front of Jewish-owned 
stores, as well as the yellow stars that Jews were forced to wear. 
</P>
<P>
Barely 50 years later, we are witnessing the open political re-emergence of 
German racism in the form of a neo-Nazi political party winning votes on a 
racist platform, this one directed against Turks and other immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
As World War II ended and the horrors of the Nazi extermination camps were 
revealed, the world was shocked into the realization of just what monstrous 
deeds a modern state is capable of when under the influence of ideological 
delusions. My own awareness of what my countryhad done to millions of Jews and 
others began a bit earlier, shortly before the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
Driven out of Berlin by allied air raids, my mother and brothers and I found 
ourselves temporarily quartered as refugees in a small town in Saxony. One day 
in February, 1945, I was walking with some of my schoolmates near a crossroads 
when a policeman approached our group and motioned for me to come to him. He 
instructed me to run to the next village down the road and inform the police 
there that a column of prisoners was scheduled to come through their community 
before long. I had just arrived back at the crossroads when the column of 
"prisoners" arrived, 1,000 or more men in vertically striped uniforms. There 
was only a handful of armed guards, which surprised me. My next reaction was 
apprehension: With so few guards, the prisoners could easily escape or perhaps 
overpower their guards. But as the front of the column arrived at an open area 
near the crossing, the guards permitted the prisoners to stop for some rest. 
Most of them just collapsed in place to sleep, while others began to urinate or 
defecate wherever they happened to be. The sight of these prisoners, the most 
emaciated people I had ever seen, eliminating where they stood or sat, without 
any sign of modesty or shame, was utterly unanticipated and shocking to me. I 
had never witnessed such a sight before, and I have never seen anything like it 
since. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until after the end of the war, and the widespread revelations of 
what had been done in the concentration camps, that I understood what I had 
seen that day at the crossroads. Though I had become an unwitting witness to 
only a small fragment of the horror of the Nazi extermination machine, the 
image of those terribly thin, exhausted and thoroughly dehumanized prisoners 
became forever etched into my mind. 
</P>
<P>
I was 13, a crucial and formative age, and those events and their genesis 
became a lifelong, even life-altering, concern of mine. I most likely would 
have become a comfortable businessman in Berlin, as my father had been (he died 
in a Russian prisoner-of-war camp). But the war and its horrifying aftermath, 
the recognition of what people are capable of doing to their fellow human 
beings, shocked me to the core and motivated me to spend much of my adult life 
in search of understanding the complex reasons for genocide. 
</P>
<P>
It is frightening to realize that in the United States today we, too, have in 
our midst a sizable number of people who seem to have learned very little from 
the errors of the past. The Ku Klux Klan, various neo-Nazi groups and, most 
recently, "skinheads" have been trying to propagate their message of hate in 
America. Instead of dismissing these groups and their leaders as extremist or 
irrelevant, we must recognize that their message has not fallen on deaf ears 
here, either. 
</P>
<P>
Why are these groups gaining in popularity, and how can we counteract such hate 
groups and their appeal? 
</P>
<P>
American history offers numerous examples of the use of ideological delusions 
about white superiority. First the American Indians and then black Africans 
were kept "in their places" and out of competition with whites by a variety of 
legal barriers and outright terror. As long as there was an ample supply of 
cheap land and cheap labor, the ideology was justified by the "proof" of its 
success economically. 
</P>
<P>
In Germany the contemporary parallel came with the so-called postwar economic 
miracle. With a relative shortage of manpower, the newly revived industries 
imported "guest workers" from Turkey, Portugal and other impoverished countries 
to do the monotonous, dirty jobs -- menial work for the lowest possible wages. 
Over time, the guests settled in, and now their children, born and educated as 
Germans, are in competition with ethnic Germans. 
</P>
<P>
We are still living with the vestiges of historic racism here in America, and 
the Germans are learning that racist ideologies did not die with the collapse 
of Hitler's "Thousand-Year Reich." In both countries, ideological delusions are 
again the means by which discrimination and prejudicial behaviors are 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
Economic disparities may be the primary motivating factor in prejudice, but 
unfair competition and bloody conflict is often the result. Since fair and 
equal competition would mean that natives, or the majority, might not get the 
greater share of the better jobs, other means may be employed by the majority 
to avoid fair competition. Either existing ideologies are utilized to 
characterize the imported labor as inferior or worse, or new ideological 
delusions are developed to justify the discriminatory treatment of the imported 
workers. Just as blacks in America were portrayed as inferior and thus 
incapable of work in the mainstream, the German "Republicans" now view Turks 
and other non-natives as inherently inferior and thus suited only for menial 
and mindless work. Ironically, the Turks, who are themselves charged with the 
1915 genocide of 1 1/2 million Armenians, have now become the victims. Will we 
ever learn? 
</P>
<P>
Once racist delusions about the inherent inferiority of outsiders are accepted, 
the corollary of the superiority of the majority is not far behind. Many 
working-class people, whose own economic well-being is rather precarious, are 
vulnerable to appeals based on primitive ethnocentrism and nationalistic 
chauvinism. 
</P>
<P>
Though Nazi Germany was not the only country to perpetrate mass killings in 
this century, the Nazis did so on an unparalleled scale and with great 
viciousness. Thus Germany today must be even more alert to such developments. 
Its recent history demands not just reparations and restitution, but an even 
greater sensitivity to the kinds of actions and attitudes that bred and 
supported the Nazis. We cannot afford to forget, and we certainly cannot let 
this happen again.

Actor Clint Eastwood, the former mayor of Carmel, has offered to help save 
central California's Monterey Peninsula from a water shortage by donating 275 
acres of land for construction of a $40-million reservoir. The Monterey 
Peninsula Water Management District delivers water to about 110,000 people, but 
officials have told residents to cut water use by 20% because they fear a third 
consecutive year of drought. Eastwood, a longtime resident of Carmel whose 
two-year term as mayor expired last April, in the past has donated land for a 
low-income housing project and for public parks.

The on again, off again avant-garde art exhibit in Beijing has been closed a 
second time by police because a newspaper received a letter saying bombs would 
be placed in the gallery if the show continued. Police closed the show the day 
it opened, Feb. 5, when a woman shot her sculpture with a BB gun in defiance of 
a ban on performance art. The artist and her boyfriend were detained for three 
days and then released, and the show reopened. Organizers suspect an artist who 
was not picked to take part in the show was behind the bomb threat. "It seems 
to be another kind of performance art," said one organizer. ALEENE MacMINN

MICROWAVE . . .: TRY FLASH-FROZEN VEGETABLES THAT STEAM IN THEIR OWN SAVORY 
VAPOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to the microwave oven, frozen vegetables may stage a comeback. They're 
quick to prepare, versatile and available year round. Better yet, they often 
taste fresher than vegetables that have lolled about supermarket bins. 
</P>
<P>
And why shouldn't frozen vegetables taste just-picked? Most were flash-frozen 
before the dew had a chance to dry. Frozen vegetables, moreover, rarely require 
additional liquid when microwaved. They steam in their own savory vapor so that 
their natural flavors are intensified. 
</P>
<P>
Often a solidly frozen vegetable block can be popped into a casserole, 
sprinkled with herbs or spices, covered, then thawed and cooked in a single, 
quick operation. And there's no need to worry about vegetables scorching or 
sticking to the pot. 
</P>
<P>
What this means is that you're free to tend to other meal prep jobs while the 
vegetable microwaves out of the way, needing, for the most part, nothing more 
than an occasional stir or turn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reduce Recommended Time 
</P>
<P>
Almost all frozen vegetables now include microwaving instructions on the 
package. For crisper vegetables with fresher flavor, however, we like to reduce 
the prescribed time by 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
And a final word of advice: never microwave frozen vegetables in their paper 
carton, they'll taste terrible and be messy and dangerous to remove from the 
carton. It's far better and simpler to microwave them in a casserole that can 
be removed to the table. 
</P>
<P>
Here, then, are some of our favorite ways to jazz up frozen vegetables. Most 
are ready to serve in less than 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

FOOD BRIEFS: TROLLING FOR FISH-OIL KNOWLEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal researchers are in the final stages of selecting participants for a 
unique study designed to explore the relationship between diets naturally high 
in fish oils and blood clotting. 
</P>
<P>
Awaiting those chosen for the project are 100 days in virtual confinement at 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Western Human Nutrition Research Center on 
San Francisco's Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
For much of that time, 40 consecutive days, the subjects will be fed salmon at 
both lunch and dinner. The daily intake of fish during this portion of the 
study will average about a pound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Participants Closely Monitored 
</P>
<P>
Dietitians are doing their best to vary the 80 salmon meals by selecting 
fish-compatible presentations such as teriyaki, salads, lasagna and barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
For the remainder of the study, the participants will eat a more varied 
selection. With or without the salmon, however, the subjects will be closely 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA scientists, led by research chemist Gary J. Nelson Ph.D., will try to 
determine exactly how fish oils, popularly known as Omega 3s, inhibit blood 
clotting. Previous research has indicated that this relationship may reduce the 
incidence of thrombosis, which can precipitate heart attack or stroke. 
</P>
<P>
The project is distinguished by the fact that it is among the first to 
exclusively use fresh fish that might normally be found in the diet, rather 
than the more concentrated fish oil capsules, to explore Omega 3's properties. 
</P>
<P>
That may not be any consolation to the study's 12 subjects, who are likely to 
endure some tediousness. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers, expected to come from throughout California, will be housed in 
the metabolic ward, said Marcia Wood, of the USDA's Agricultural Research 
Service. There they will live under the watchful eye of the research and 
medical staff. 
</P>
<P>
"They usually let them out for an escorted walk twice during the day or they 
are taken on an expedition to the museum, things like that," she said. "It's 
done for control, so that they won't eat anything other than what's on the 
menu." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allowed Use of Pool Table, Telephone 
</P>
<P>
While in the metabolic ward, the subjects will have the use of a television, 
videocassette recorder, pool table and a pay phone. 
</P>
<P>
The agency was inundated with 1,500 volunteers when word first surfaced that 
the USDA was about to embark on the study, with some of the inquiries coming 
from as far away as Tahiti, Paris and Stockholm. But as the specifics of the 
project became known, such as no conjugal visits, the interest dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
Those selected are mostly Northern Californians, said Nelson, the study's 
architect. 
</P>
<P>
"They're people who don't hold 'eight to five' jobs, but they are not street 
people or those without resources," he said. "Some are artists or people who 
can work while they are here. . . . Most are middle class." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers had originally wanted women for the study, but settled instead 
on men. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting a dozen females between ages 35 and 60 proved too time consuming, 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are not willing to be incarcerated for 100 days in a metabolic 
unit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The strict regimen is not without benefits. If the participants make it through 
the entire study they stand to earn $2,075. And, according to Wood, on the 
100th day they get to eat anything they want. 
</P>
<P>
A full range of medical care is also available to participants including one of 
the most important: psychological support. 
</P>
<P>
Fugu to America -- Japanese seafood firms have received permission to export 
the infamous fugu, or puffer fish, into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The fish, whose toxin claims several lives each year in Japan, is considered a 
delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had banned import of fugu 
because the species contained tetrodotoxin, a strong poison, for which there 
are no known antidotes. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA's change of heart was contingent upon importers meeting several 
restrictions that are designed to ensure adequate consumer safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions were stipulated in an FDA letter to the Japanese Ministry of 
Health and Welfare, the contents of which were released last week. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Japanese officials will play a major role in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Import Guidelines 
</P>
<P>
The import guidelines include limiting the species approved for consumption in 
this country to the tiger puffer, a variety that does not contain the toxin in 
the skin and meat. The liver and ovaries, where the poison concentrates, must 
be removed only by those licensed by the Japanese government to clean the fish. 
</P>
<P>
After processing, the filet must be certified as free of tetrodotoxin by a 
Japanese food sanitation inspector. All fish must then be flash frozen and 
shipped only by air freight to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Each shipment must carry complete documentation, including location where 
caught, the names of the individual who worked on the fish and the government 
inspector. 
</P>
<P>
Firms will only be permitted to export tiger puffer to this country between the 
months of September and March, according to the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Those who handle the fish must undergo extensive training before being licensed 
by the Japanese government to clean fugu. In fact, most deaths associated with 
the fish occur because the puffer was prepared by amateurs, according to one 
industry trade journal's account. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the import of fugu comes at a time when consumer advocacy groups 
have charged that the U.S. government is not doing enough to ensure safe and 
wholesome seafood supplies.

Our Back to Basics column on beating egg whites prompted a request for a 
similar technique -- whipping cream correctly. Once again a wire whisk can be 
used for the task, but those lacking a strong arm may opt for an electric 
mixer. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to begin with a bowl and beaters that are not only spotlessly 
clean but chilled in the refrigerator at least two hours. The whipping cream 
also should be well-chilled and at least a day old (hardly a problem for the 
average consumer). Fat content of the cream must be between 30% and 40% for it 
to whip satisfactorily. 
</P>
<P>
The cream will double in volume during whipping, so place it in a bowl large 
enough to accommodate this increased amount. Begin beating on medium-high 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
After a few seconds the cream will become frothy (Photo 1). This is the stage 
to begin adding sugar or flavorings, if desired. As the cream begins to 
thicken, lower the mixer speed and watch carefully, periodically stopping to 
check the progress. 
</P>
<P>
Cream beaten to the soft peak stage (Photo 2) is soft, still glossy and 
incorporates well with other ingredients. When the beaters are lifted, the 
cream folds in soft peaks or drops in large globs. This is comparable to the 
stiff, but not dry, stage of beaten egg whites. 
</P>
<P>
If the cream is to be used decoratively, continue beating to the stiff peak 
stage (Photo 3) . It may then be spooned in dollops, sculpted or placed in a 
pastry bag with a decorative tip. 
</P>
<P>
Overbeaten cream (Photo 4) will eventually clump and turn to butter. If only 
slightly overbeaten, however, it's possible to recover the product by adding 
one to two more tablespoons cream and continuing to beat. 
</P>
<P>
It's best to whip cream just before using. If it must be prepared ahead, some 
sources suggest adding a small amount of powdered sugar during the beating 
process. The cornstarch in this type of sugar acts as a stabilizer. Other 
references suggest adding a packet of unflavored gelatin, softened in one 
tablespoon water, for each cup of whipping cream. Beat the gelatin in as the 
cream begins to stiffen.

LET'S EAT OUT: GALLIC OUTPOST IN THE HEART OF CHINATOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
East-West eating is no longer a novelty. But still, it seems unusual to find a 
French restaurant in Chinatown, especially in the less traveled stretch of 
markets, shops and eating places along North Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
But there it is, brand new green and white awning smartly announcing a brand 
new restaurant, La Cigale. Cigale is French for cicada, and straw versions of 
the insect cling to plastic greenery climbing over latticework inside. At 
lunchtime, the restaurant is largely empty. Possibly dishes such as entrecote 
au poivre vert, coquille Saint Jacques, crabe farci and omelette flambee au 
rhum are a bit too foreign for the street. So a separate menu of Vietnamese 
dishes was added recently. 
</P>
<P>
It surprised me to see chicken rice on the original menu because this dish has 
no link to France. It is a specialty of the Chinese from Hainan island and is 
as basic to Singapore as chicken soup is to a Jewish community. The usual 
components are chicken meat, dipping sauces, a bowl of broth and rice sauteed 
in chicken fat and steamed in broth. 
</P>
<P>
Some dishes have a distinctly Vietnamese interpretation. Haricots verts sautes 
au beurre (green beans sauteed in butter) appeared to be sauteed in oil, not 
butter, and were embellished with bits of crisp, brown, fried garlic. Filet de 
boeuf grille, sauce moutarde, (grilled beef fillet) had the crunchiness that 
goes with fried meat, and the waiter said it had indeed been fried in butter 
with garlic. Whatever the method, it was a nice, tender piece of meat cooked to 
perfect, medium rare pinkness. 
</P>
<P>
The French approach was apparent in curried shrimp because the sauce was so 
delicate. I don't know, though, if a French chef would have decorated the 
bowl-shaped heap of rice in the center of the plate with a cherry. 
</P>
<P>
The entrecote au poivre vert (green peppercorn steak) came on a black iron 
sizzling plate shaped like a steer. The plate was so hot that it was vital to 
eat the meat and sauce at once before they scorched. Pommes frites (French 
fries) go with this dish. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't tried the chateaubriand, but the kitchen turns out an excellent 
grilled pork chop. It's on the French side of the menu, accompanied by salad 
and a French roll and also appears on some of the Vietnamese combinations. 
</P>
<P>
One of the nicest dishes is a simple presentation of filet de sole frit au 
capres (fried sole with capers). The two small, moist, tender fillets were 
garnished with lemon slices and, of course, capers. The only accompaniment was 
broccoli, still brilliantly green and firm to the bite. 
</P>
<P>
The classic French onion soup is a bit thin here, topped with dollops of bread 
and cheese instead of the usual sturdy, solid cap. I thought it would be clever 
to compose a lunch of the French soup and one Vietnamese dish. An unexpectedly 
good companion was a shrimp and salad roll -- shrimp, lettuce, mint and rice 
noodles inside a soft, almost translucent rice wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
There is often danger in translating literally a language with which one is not 
thoroughly familiar. The sauce mangue (mango sauce) for the shrimp curry was 
mango chutney, not some artful French sauce. And jus de pomme cannelle was not 
apple juice (jus de pomme) flavored with cinnamon (cannelle) but a thick white 
guanabana shake. Guanabana is also known as soursop. 
</P>
<P>
This and other Vietnamese-style drinks are sweet enough for dessert. The formal 
desserts are flan, which has a surprising topping -- cracked ice -- and the 
flaming, rum-bathed omelet. 
</P>
<P>
Glasses of hot tea come with meals. There is also strong, filtered coffee, 
served black or Vietnamese-style with sweetened condensed milk. A thermos of 
hot water lets you dilute the brew to taste. 
</P>
<P>
La Cigale's owner is Kim Le, who once had a French restaurant in Saigon. At 
$15, lobster thermidor is the top-priced dish. The green peppercorn steak is 
$8.25. The fried sole is $7.25. A plate of three shrimp and salad rolls is 
$3.95, and most of the sweet drinks are $1.75. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
La Cigale, 685 N. Spring St., Los Angeles (213) 620-1572. Open daily from 9 
a.m. to 10 p.m. Cash only. Validated parking in the Crystal Plaza garage. Enter 
on New High Street.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: TOOL TO MAKE A COOK'S HEART SING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mandolin is music to the ears of the many cooks who take pride in custom 
cutting fruits and vegetables for a beautiful presentation. The smooth sweep of 
a food item into the sharp blades of this slicing device makes the most evenly 
julienned, sliced or latticed cuts. It's not magic or a special trick; this 
old-time, French-origin tool does it all for you. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've mastered the mandolin, you may prefer it over a food processor for 
its evenness in cutting spuds for French fries and slicing nice rounds of firm 
foods such as sweet potatoes, zucchini, carrots, apples, turnips and beets. 
</P>
<P>
Manufactured in West Germany, the Boerner V-Slicer is the type of mandolin that 
never fails to capture a crowd and hold their attention when demonstrated. The 
product always gets "oohs" and "aahs" for swooshing pretty lattice slices, 
long, thin shreds of carrots and perfect potato matchsticks. Everyone wonders 
at the super thinness of sliced tomatoes, sweet peppers, potatoes, mushrooms, 
leeks, daikon radish and whatever fruit or vegetable is on hand at the moment. 
What amazes people isn't just the uniformity of the results but the swiftness 
and smoothness of the whole operation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Practice Makes Perfect 
</P>
<P>
Can the inexperienced perform as well as the professional demonstrators? With 
just a little practice, yes; in fact, we found it rather easy after several 
tries. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to go home and actually do it," says John Duncan, sales 
representative for Marjorie Duncan &amp; Associates. "The trick is not to 
strain or push but do it in a relaxed way, applying light pressure." One of 
Duncan's favorite applications is creating fine shreds of apples to sprinkle 
over his bowl of cereal. 
</P>
<P>
When using the tool, it is important that you follow directions carefully and 
use the safety holder or protector to keep fingers safely away from blade 
injury when processing the food. The holder guides the item to be sliced across 
the blade, pressing it in place with steel prongs. A small knob pushes the food 
down as it is processed. Long vegetables such as zucchini, cucumber and daikon, 
when sliced crosswise, may not require the holder until the produce reaches an 
unsafe, shorter size. 
</P>
<P>
Molded of sturdy plastic with sharp metal blade inserts, the Boerner blade 
system features extra attachments that offer other garnishing cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular set according to Duncan, is the V-Slicer ($24.95), which 
consists of the rectangular frame fitted with the V-shaped blade and two 
reversible inserts that slide into the frame: a thin and thick slicer and a 
thin and thick julienne cutter. (Chopping or dicing may also be accomplished by 
prescoring an onion, for instance, with a knife and then sliding it through the 
slicer.) The set also includes the safety holder and storage container called 
Multibox. 
</P>
<P>
The Wave and Waffle Cutter ($10.95) consists of a single frame with the blade, 
the safety holder and an insert that can be adjusted to make lattice or wave 
cuts. The Garnishing Set ($24.95) has the Roko vegetable shredder that makes 
the thinnest, longest possible shreds for unusual garnishes, the Wave and 
Waffle Cutter, a multifunction peeler, a hash-brown grater and the safety 
protector. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Knobs and Sharp Points 
</P>
<P>
Also quite popular for its versatility, sharp blades and decorative 
capabilities is the little Five-Function Peeler ($2.95). It has small knobs and 
sharp points that can score cucumbers or carrots to create a floral effect when 
sliced, dig out dark potato spots and unsightly fruit stem ends and make red 
radish designs. 
</P>
<P>
Another brand of mandolin slicer comes from Leifheit in West Germany. Well 
designed, the product is made from a very durable plastic material fitted with 
a blade that never needs sharpening. The Vario-Slicer ($24.95) is easy to use 
and stores conveniently. Aside from slicing tomatoes, fruit, cheese and cold 
meats, it will also shred cabbage for coleslaw and cut potatoes for chips. 
</P>
<P>
The unit consists of a ridged frame with handle, a stainless steel blade with 
scalloped edge, a slide adjustment for regulating thick and thin slices, liquid 
draining slots and a safety food holder. On the underside of the frame is a 
wave-form base that sits securely on the rim of a bowl for ease in slicing. 
</P>
<P>
Leifheit also carries the 4-in-1 Grater/Slicer ($24.95). Similar in frame 
design to the Boerner, it has four interchangeable steel blades for slicing, 
for pureeing and for shredding ranging from coarse to fine size. Dishwasher 
safe, the blades are rust-proof. The set also comes with a safety protector. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Boerner cutting products are available at Gelson's (Jerry Knoll from 
Germany will be demonstrating the products on March 19, from 12 to 5 p.m., at 
the new Gelson's store in Marina Del Rey), Cookin Stuff (La Habra and Palos 
Verdes) and Cook's Corner (Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
 The Leifheit slicers are available at San Marino Hardware (San Marino), CA 
Cutlery (Thousand Oaks) and Alan Ladd Hardware (Palm Springs).

DUFFY TO LET GRAND JURY REVIEW JAIL DEATHS; SAYS DEPARTMENT IS VINDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day after the decision by federal authorities not to prosecute sheriff's 
deputies for alleged beatings in the county's jails, San Diego County Sheriff 
John Duffy revealed a new policy that will transfer authority to investigate 
jail deaths from his department to the County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
During a lengthy interview in his office Wednesday, Duffy also responded to the 
decision not to prosecute deputies in 70 cases of alleged civil rights 
violations at the county jails, saying it was a vindication of his department 
and provided "a feeling of uplifting after all this sagging." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI and U. S. attorney's office announced Tuesday that there was 
insufficient evidence to prosecute deputies and jail personnel in dozens of 
incidents in which inmates were reportedly beaten or died in custody. The FBI 
began its probe in May after scores of inmates and former inmates complained of 
harsh treatment at the facilities and were the subject of many stories in the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, who has been sheriff since 1971, never acknowledged that his decision to 
let the Grand Jury investigate jail deaths was prompted by criticism of the 
department's management of the jails. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Sensible Review' 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to turn every jail death to the Grand Jury from here on, every single 
one. That, in my mind, is a sensible review," Duffy said. However, he quickly 
added that he does not expect the new policy to silence his critics. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Grand Jury reviews the death of an inmate, and they don't find that 
the deputies were sadistic, somebody will complain about that. . . . You're not 
going to satisfy the critics, no matter what you do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old policy, deaths were investigated by sheriff's homicide 
detectives, which critics, including San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, 
likened to the fox guarding the chicken coop. 
</P>
<P>
Although the federal probe cleared the Sheriff's Department in 70 cases, U. S. 
Atty. William Braniff said authorities are still reviewing two other cases to 
determine if prosecutions are warranted. Duffy said the cases still under 
review involve the death of Albert Manuel Varela, who died at the downtown 
jail, and John McDougall, a Vista man who charged that he was handcuffed and 
beaten by a deputy who responded to his emergency call for help. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal grand jury is still looking at the Varela and McDougall cases. 
I've been told that there is no evidence in either of the cases of a criminal 
conspiracy. I'm told that the maximum would be misdemeanor charges issued in 
these two cases as a result of the grand jury investigation. They haven't found 
civil rights violations," Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prosecution Unwarranted 
</P>
<P>
Braniff declined to confirm or deny that the federal Grand Jury is still 
investigating the two cases. Instead, he said that, in every case that was 
reviewed, "prosecution was not warranted." 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff blamed the news media for the massive FBI probe, which he said 
resulted from "an orchestrated campaign on the part of the San Diego 
Union-Tribune." According to Duffy, reporters from the two papers "have told us 
that they've been assigned to write something negative every single day" about 
him and the department. He claimed that editors at the two papers "don't like 
the fact that I'm independent." 
</P>
<P>
Tribune Editor Neil Morgan reacted with humor to Duffy's comments, responding 
that "we have no programmed reporters." 
</P>
<P>
"John is a consummate politician," Morgan said. "Like some politicians, he 
needs to clear his lungs. Too bad we can't clear his head, too. I'd box him if 
it were up to me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Indulging in Paranoia' 
</P>
<P>
Union Editor Gerald Warren said that Duffy was "indulging himself in a little 
paranoia." 
</P>
<P>
"We reported legitimate complaints about treatment at the jail," Warren said. 
"The FBI is not saying that the beatings did not take place. They're saying 
that they didn't have evidence, except in two cases, to recommend prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy acknowledged that there have been instances of deputies using excessive 
force at the jail and on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I've disciplined 52 deputies for using excessive force in the past five years. 
. . . If you mistreat people, you're going to answer for it. Nine of these 
deputies were referred to the district attorney's office for prosecution," 
Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Problems at Facilities 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of crowding at the jails, Duffy said, he found few problems 
at the facilities. Duffy candidly remarked that incarceration at the El Cajon 
and South Bay facilities amount to "cruel and unusual punishment." He said 
that, on Wednesday, the El Cajon jail, which was designed to hold 120 inmates, 
had 689, and the South Bay jail, which was designed to hold 192 inmates, had 
794. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said they are forwarding the results of the FBI investigation 
to the County Grand Jury, which is conducting an administrative review of the 
Sheriff's Department. Duffy said he expects a critical report from the Grand 
Jury, but added that some of the criticisms directed at him and the department 
will be unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
"My best guess is that the Grand Jury is going to make findings of a lot of 
inadequacies. Some will be mine, but some will be totally out of my control. . 
. . They will find failures in supervision and middle management, and they will 
find inadequate training, I'm sure," Duffy said.

MEASURES TO BAN, CONFISCATE GUNS GIVEN TO COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego City Council committee, divided over whether it has the authority 
to ban local possession and sale of semiautomatic weapons, sent the full 
council two gun-regulation ordinances Wednesday and created a committee that 
may suggest more alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with City Atty. John Witt's strong warning that only the state 
Legislature can regulate the assault weapons, the council's Rules Committee 
took no position on a proposal to ban the sale and possession of high-powered 
rifles, such as the AK-47, that police say are increasingly favored by street 
gangs and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee recommended approval of an alternative ordinance, written by 
Witt's office, which would allow police to seize an assault weapon and hold it 
for 72 hours unless its owner could prove that it was being used lawfully. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures are scheduled to come before the full council Feb. 27, along with 
the recommendations of a group of citizens impaneled Wednesday by the Rules 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Composed of gun advocates and their opponents, police officers and city 
officials, the panel will attempt to write regulations that weapons owners and 
supporters of the ban can live with. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor said she will try to have a representative from 
California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp's office at the City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Council members hope that a Feb. 22 hearing in a lawsuit over Los Angeles' 
recently enacted ban on the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons will 
help guide them. 
</P>
<P>
The vote ended a full day of testimony to two council committees dominated by 
the region's vocal gun lobby. Organized by National Rifle Assn. member Brad 
Boswell, working through memberships of local gun clubs, gun advocates 
thoroughly outnumbered their opponents at a three-hour morning hearing before 
the council's Public Services and Safety Committee and the 2 1/2-hour afternoon 
Rules Committee session. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with Witt's warning, the six-member Rules Committee was divided into two 
camps. Council members Wes Pratt and Judy McCarty, who proposed the Los 
Angeles-style ban, favored passage of an ordinance, even if it opens the City 
Council to lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Henderson, who is against local control of the weapons, led 
the committee's opposition. Councilwoman Gloria McColl, who strongly supported 
regulating the weapons during recent interviews, became the primary supporter 
of Witt's seizure alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt, an attorney, disagreed with Witt that state law prohibits the city from 
regulating assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
"I simply don't see the pre-emption, either express or implied," he told Witt. 
"It's hard for me to make the quantum leap . . . that we can't have more 
stringent legislation." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. John Kaheny cited a 1982 attorney general's opinion that 
concluded that "the subject of possession of firearms is not a municipal 
affair." But Pratt contended that court decisions to date pertain only to 
handguns, leaving municipalities free to regulate semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Several California cities, including Los Angeles, Stockton and Compton, have 
banned sale and possession of the weapons in the wake of last month's slaying 
of five Stockton elementary schoolchildren by a gunman using an AK-47. State 
legislation to ban the weapons has been introduced in both houses of the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hartford-based Colt Industries, manufacturer of the military-style 
AR-15 assault rifle, sued in Los Angeles Superior Court to block enforcement of 
Los Angeles' sale and possession ban, which was enacted Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Witt's alternative would allow police to impound an assault rifle seen in 
public unless its owner could prove the gun was used for target practice or 
some other lawful purpose. Possession of an unloaded assault rifle is not now a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
Targeted at gang members and drug dealers, the proposed ordinance would empower 
a police officer to make a decision "before he seizes the weapon that there is 
no evidence the weapon is being used for any of those lawful purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Bob Burgreen, testifying at the morning and afternoon hearings, 
called the proposal "a small step in the right direction. It isn't as good a 
step as we would like." 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen noted that police now seize such weapons primarily when making 
arrests. The new law would allow seizures without arrests. 
</P>
<P>
During the 72-hour hold, police would attempt to determine whether a weapon was 
stolen, or whether its owner had a felony conviction or mental illness. If 
those tests were passed, the gun would be returned. 
</P>
<P>
Modifying his position between the morning and afternoon hearings, Burgreen by 
day's end declined to endorse the City Council ordinance that would make it a 
crime to sell or own such weapons and instead called for the state to outlaw 
the weapons, which his outgunned officers increasingly face in confrontations. 
"There are some weapons which should be totally exempted from any civilian 
possession," Burgreen told the Rules Committee, referring to the assault 
weapons. "Those weapons should only belong to the police or military 
organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen's morning testimony included a display of the AK-47, AR-15, Uzi, 
Mac-10 and other semiautomatic weapons to the Public Services and Safety 
Committee, and the warning that "any good gunman with a machine shop can make 
(the AR-15) into a fully automatic weapon in less than an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Gun advocates noted that such conversion kits have been illegal for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their increasing popularity with drug dealers and gangs, assault rifles 
are just a small fraction of the weapons that officers face on the street, 
police statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, 8 people were murdered with the weapon; 74 were killed with various 
other firearms; 34 were stabbed to death; 8 were strangled; 15 were beaten to 
death and 5 were killed by other means. Of the roughly 4,800 weapons seized by 
police last year, about 50 were assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of gun advocates who testified at both hearings opposed both the gun ban 
and the 72-hour seizure, raising the arguments that the Second Amendment allows 
the unregulated possession of guns, that the guns are needed for protection and 
that law-abiding gun owners use them in target-shooting competitions. They 
urged the council to get tough on criminals instead of guns. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Heffern, range officer of the South Bay Rod and Gun club, noted that the 
U. S. director of civilian marksmanship provides shooters with high-powered 
semiautomatic weapons for use in marksmanship competitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixty years ago, they put a ban on alcohol," said National Rifle Assn. member 
Bruce Cavanaugh. "It was kind of a miserable failure. It created a whole new 
underground. I implore you not to pass a ban on these guns because I think what 
you're going to do is you're going to create a whole new underground you don't 
want to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Their opponents stressed that the guns are most efficient at one activity: 
killing human beings. "That's not the kind of firepower needed to kill a deer. 
That's not the kind of firepower needed for target practice," James Lantry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said she hopes to vote for a total ban on the weapons if she is 
convinced that the city has the authority to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some very bad criminal elements" in the city, she said at the 
afternoon meeting. "They don't care about life. They would just as soon kill 
you with their semiautomatics as say hello to you." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, O'Connor said a city ordinance may also be necessary to send a 
message to state legislators that cities want the guns regulated. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't do anything," she said. "They just hold fund-raisers."

LA MESA TOXIC GAS MANUFACTURER LOSES COURT RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clearing the way for a possible shutdown of Phoenix Research Corp., a San Diego 
Superior Court judge Wednesday ruled that the manufacturer of deadly gases is 
subject to the jurisdiction of local air-pollution officials who have denied 
the La Mesa plant a permit to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Robert C. Thaxton Jr. said "the court of common sense" forced him to 
reject claims by Phoenix attorneys that the firm should be exempt from Air 
Pollution Control District (APCD) authority because deadly arsine and phosphine 
gases have never been released -- either as regular emissions or by accident -- 
from the Alvarado Road facility. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a dangerous condition, a potentially dangerous condition that can 
cause harm, it just is not reasonable to require the condition to occur before 
regulation can take place," said Thaxton in his verbal ruling. 
</P>
<P>
But Thaxton left in place a preliminary injunction that allows Phoenix to 
continue operating without environmental controls at least until a March 2, 
when he will hear arguments on whether to refer the fate of Phoenix back to the 
APCD for another round of time-consuming administrative hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Thaxton's decision was applauded by environmental and La Mesa community 
activists, who have regrouped in recent months to bring pressure on Phoenix to 
leave its location near Grossmont Hospital, the Grossmont shopping mall and 
many residences. Union Carbide, Phoenix's parent company, has announced that it 
will move the beleaguered operation to Kingman, Ariz. by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ironic Timing 
</P>
<P>
"It's a victory for the community," Diane Takvorian, director of the 
Environmental Health Coalition, said about Thaxton's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed that the judge has continued the injunction. If the 
injunction were eliminated today, they (Phoenix) would have to stop operating 
until they get a permit." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brock, a former San Diego fire inspector and one of about 30 community 
residents who filled the courtroom, said it was ironic that the ruling came on 
the day that newspapers reported a $470-million court settlement by Union 
Carbide for a 1984 pesticide leak that killed 3,330 people. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee you that we wouldn't accept $470 million in La Mesa if lives were 
lost," said Brock, adding that his home is about a mile from the Phoenix plant. 
"There's no way in hell." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's ruling by Thaxton helps thaw a longstanding legal freeze that began 
when Phoenix filed suit in January, 1987, to stop air-pollution officials from 
taking steps to close down the plant for manufacturing arsine and phosphine 
gases without an APCD permit. 
</P>
<P>
The plant had been operating in relative obscurity since 1973, producing the 
gases in a nondescript building at 8075 Alvarado Road. Public protests erupted 
in 1985 after The Times wrote about the plant and the nature of arsine and 
phosphine, considered among the most deadly substances known. 
</P>
<P>
Federal limits for the gases, which are used to alter the electrical 
characteristics of silicon and similar materials, are very minimal -- 0.3 parts 
per million for phosphine and 0.05 p.p.m. for arsine. A whiff of 500 p.p.m. of 
arsine would cause instant death because it would freeze the hemoglobin in the 
red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
In Nov. 1985, APCD officials ordered Phoenix to apply for a permit to 
manufacture the deadly gases. After more than a year of study, the APCD denied 
the permit in Dec. 1986, saying Phoenix posed an unacceptable health risk in 
the event of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, in Jan. 1987, Phoenix went to court and obtained an injunction 
preventing the air pollution agency from closing the plant before the case 
could be appealed to the APCD hearing board. After several months of hearings, 
the hearing board was unable to scratch together a three-vote majority to 
decide anything -- a circumstance that apparently left Phoenix without a permit 
and vulnerable to closure. 
</P>
<P>
The company went back into court and challenged the APCD's authority, a 
question that was finally answered Wednesday by Thaxton, who complained that 
the case has "dragged on too long." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Back to the Board' 
</P>
<P>
Although Thaxton sided with the APCD on the question of its authority, he 
tentatively went against the agency in his decision on what to do next. County 
Counsel Barbara Baird argued that, since the APCD hearing board could not reach 
a decision on the appeal, the agency's original decision to deny Phoenix's 
permit should stand. 
</P>
<P>
Thaxton, however, sided with Phoenix attorney Betty-Jane Kirwan in saying he 
wanted to send the case back to the APCD hearing board for reconsideration. At 
Baird's request, he set a March 2 hearing to hear arguments on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get it back to the board," he said. "That's where I think it should 
go. We don't have a decision. We don't have findings." 
</P>
<P>
Such a move, Baird said after the hearing, could take months and render 
Phoenix's non-compliance a moot point, since the firm is committed to leaving 
La Mesa by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned that it may never come to resolution because of their 
delaying," said Baird. 
</P>
<P>
Brock added: "They want to tie up the courts until December, 1989, when they 
move. We're still sitting on pins and needles hoping a Miramar jet doesn't 
crash into them." 
</P>
<P>
Kirwan declined to comment after the hearing, but agreed that Thaxton's 
determination about the APCD's authority was a legal defeat for the chemical 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Secor, director of communication for Union Carbide's Linde Division, said 
Wednesday that progress in the planned move by Phoenix is going slowly. He said 
contractors have been hired to construct the firm's new plant on a 36-acre 
parcel in a Kingman industrial park, but work hasn't started yet because the 
chemical company is still waiting for its final building permit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secor said, the company has met with some opposition from Kingman 
residents, who are circulating petitions against the plant. To allay fears, he 
said, the company has flown about 25 Kingman public officials and citizens to 
inspect the La Mesa plant during the last month.

AIDS PATIENT USES CITY LAW TO SUE; CLAIMS CHIROPRACTOR DISCRIMINATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE A. WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what is believed to be the first lawsuit of its kind in San Diego, a man 
with AIDS has sued a Hillcrest chiropractor, claiming he was refused treatment 
because of his disease. 
</P>
<P>
The suit by Robert E. Walsh Jr., 36, is thought to be the first filed under a 
year-old San Diego ordinance aimed at prohibiting discrimination against AIDS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh claims he went to the Richmond Street office of chiropractor Joseph A. 
Cicmanec on Aug. 4 and requested a back realignment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questioned About X-Rays 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he filled out two forms at the receptionist's request, and indicated 
on one of them that he had recently undergone chest X-rays. When the 
receptionist asked why he had been X-rayed, Walsh told her he had AIDS and was 
under a doctor's care, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that the receptionist left to confer with Cicmanec, then 
returned and told Walsh that the chiropractor would not treat him, and told him 
to go to UCSD Medical Center instead. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh claims he was "shamed, humiliated, degraded and emotionally upset" and 
alleges that Cicmanec and his employees "acted in a despicable manner with a 
willful, conscious and callous disregard" of his "rights and emotional 
condition." 
</P>
<P>
Cicmanec declined comment Wednesday, and his attorney, Laura Halgren, said only 
that the chiropractor "does dispute the allegations of the complaint." No court 
date has been set for a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, a state employee, also declined comment Wednesday. He was diagnosed as 
having Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer, in February, 1988, according 
to his attorney, Timothy R. Pestotnik. 
</P>
<P>
Pestotnik chairs the board of the San Diego AIDS Project and helped start a 
free legal-advice clinic for AIDS sufferers who feel they are victims of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Other Choice' 
</P>
<P>
Pestotnik said Walsh went to the legal clinic within a week of his experience 
at the chiropractor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to do anything he could to make the situation not happen to somebody 
else," Pestotnik said. "I tried for five months to settle this case, but the 
defendant would not discuss it with us. My client and I felt we had no other 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
Pestotnik, whose father died of AIDS three years ago, said his law firm, Luce, 
Forward, Hamilton &amp; Scripps, will represent Walsh free. 
</P>
<P>
Many complaints of discrimination have been taken to the legal clinic, but all 
of the other cases have been resolved without a lawsuit, Pestotnik said. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to step in and explain to them that the disease is not transmitted 
casually," he said. "Usually, we get an apology and a promise it won't happen 
again. The law is there, though, in case that doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council passed the February, 1988, ordinance to enable 
people with AIDS and AIDS-related complex to sue landlords, employers and 
businesses that discriminate against them. One month earlier, the County Board 
of Supervisors approved a similar ordinance for unincorporated areas of the 
county. Similar measures have been enacted in other California cities, 
including Los Angeles, West Hollywood, Santa Monica, Pasadena, San Francisco, 
Oakland and Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of lawsuits have already been filed in other cities with AIDS 
anti-discrimination laws, including a Los Angeles case in which an AIDS patient 
sued a dentist in January, 1988, for allegedly refusing to treat him. That case 
is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Also in Los Angeles, Forest Lawn mortuary was sued in 1985 for $10 million for 
allegedly refusing to handle the body of a suicide victim who was thought to 
have had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1987, a Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge ruled that a West 
Hollywood nail salon did not have to give a pedicure to an AIDS patient who 
claimed the salon discriminated against him because of his disease. The judge 
in that case concluded that "there is an extremely small, but nonetheless real, 
risk of exposure to AIDS from the procedures of a pedicure."

TRETTIN TO RUN AGAINST WOLFSHEIMER FOR COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing his decade of experience on northern San Diego issues, former county 
supervisorial aide Bob Trettin on Wednesday announced that he intends to oppose 
1st District San Diego City Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer this fall in the 
city's first district-only council election. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference outside City Hall, Trettin argued that his seven years on 
the staff of former 1st District Councilman Bill Mitchell and three years as 
the chief policy aide to Supervisor Susan Golding would enable him to 
"effectively serve . . . the first day I am in office." 
</P>
<P>
"No other candidate for this office, including the incumbent . . . has a 
comparable record of identifying problems and finding solutions for the people 
of the 1st District," said Trettin, a 34-year-old Rancho Penasquitos resident 
who recently left Golding's staff to run for the council. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wolfsheimer will begin her reelection campaign much better-known and 
financed, Trettin suggested that San Diego voters' approval last fall of 
district-only races -- a shift from the current system of district primaries 
and citywide runoffs -- will enable him to overcome the incumbent's advantages 
through aggressive grass-roots campaigning. Trettin added that he already has 
commitments for nearly $100,000 in campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
When Wolfsheimer defeated Mitchell in 1985, Trettin noted, she was outpolled by 
Mitchell in the 1st District in both the primary and general election. 
</P>
<P>
"Abbe Wolfsheimer has already lost two elections in the 1st District," Trettin 
said. "Had district elections been in effect in 1985, (she) would not be a 
council member today." 
</P>
<P>
Trettin also charged that, during her tenure at City Hall, Wolfsheimer has been 
ineffective in communicating with 1st District community leaders and has a poor 
rapport with council colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Abbe has acted as if I-5 created an impenetrable barrier to communication and 
citizen involvement," he said. "That's got to change. Once I am elected, it 
will change."

PAYZANT ISSUES EARLY WARNING OF SCHOOL CUTS IF GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite statewide voter approval of Proposition 98 last November to guarantee a 
steady level of support for public education, the San Diego Unified School 
District may have to cut as much as $16.2 million in programs under the initial 
1989-90 state budget proposed by Gov. George Deukmejian, schools Supt. Tom 
Payzant warned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, who opposed the measure, has proposed targeting an estimated $377 
million resulting from Proposition 98 for specific mandated programs such as 
drug education and class-size reduction. That would mean the extra money could 
not be used by local districts to cover operational expenses such as salaries 
or activities such as dropout prevention or counseling, considered important by 
individual school systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cuts Would Be About 3% 
</P>
<P>
If the Legislature does not significantly alter Deukmejian's plans, districts 
such as San Diego will be left far short of the money needed to maintain 
programs at present levels, Payzant said. That would force him and the Board of 
Trustees to eliminate up to $16.2 million, or 3%, of a preliminary $500-million 
budget and to face withering criticism from parents and students similar to the 
outcry three years ago when state problems caused $9 million in local school 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
It would also crimp, if not derail, ambitious plans by the district to carry 
through far-reaching reforms in curriculum, teaching styles and neighborhood 
control of schools, Payzant added. 
</P>
<P>
Although resolution of the state budget will come only late this spring or 
early summer, Payzant's press conference Wednesday represented an early-warning 
salvo by educators upset at the governor's proposal. It was also a clear 
attempt to position public schools as a victim, rather than cause, of a 
potentially dire financial situation that faces the state for the next fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The current status of school finance in California has resulted in a lot of 
misunderstanding and misinformation," Payzant said Wednesday. "Proposition 98 
raised expectations, and many people believe its passage means much more money 
for schools and that our budgetary problems are over. That is not the case. The 
state faces serious budget problems and the schools will, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Collision of Expectations' 
</P>
<P>
Last month, county schools Supt. Tom Boysen said the public perception of 
Proposition 98 and the governor's budget is "a set-up for a collision of 
expectations." Boysen said Deukmejian's plans for specific commitments are "at 
odds with the concept of local control favored by most district superintendents 
and school boards." 
</P>
<P>
Payzant's administrators project that the district will need $515.7 million 
next year to maintain existing programs and compensate for inflation, provide 
for salary increases already agreed to and accommodate more students. However, 
under Deukmejian's proposal, the district will come up $16.2 million short, 
with total revenues of only $499.5 million when smaller federal and local 
revenues are added in. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have a plan yet to address this projected shortfall, but we must 
balance next year's budget," Payzant said. "But obviously it will result in 
some cuts." Payzant said he hopes both his advisory committees of parents and 
teachers, and trustees will agree that any cuts should be kept "as far from the 
classroom as possible," meaning no layoffs of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
And, though even the worst-case scenario means only a 3% trim from a 
$500-million budget, Payzant said the effects are magnified because the 
district has not fully recovered from $40 million in slashes made from 1981 to 
1983 and the $9 million in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Payzant Not Optimistic 
</P>
<P>
"And 85% of our budget already goes directly for people and schools so that 
doesn't leave a lot of room," he said. Payzant said across-the-board cuts are 
one alternative to significant reductions in specific programs, but, he said, 
"doing it across-the-board doesn't recognize we have differing needs and 
priorities, some of which (if cut) would have more negative impacts" than cuts 
in others. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant holds little hope that the Legislature will change Deukmejian's budget 
plans enough to eliminate the deficit completely. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to cry wolf too loudly . . . but we must have a contingency plan. 
We will determine what we have to do if the deficit is $16 million, or $8 
million or $4 million. I don't see a turnaround in its entirety in any case."

The San Fernando Valley will get a version of the posh Beverly Hills restaurant 
Bistro Garden. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday granted the luxury dining 
establishment a liquor license to open at a shopping center under construction 
at Coldwater Canyon Avenue and Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, despite 
objections from some residents. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous vote came after Councilman Mike Woo, whose district includes the 
restaurant site, spoke out in support of the project. Council members 
customarily grant the wishes of a colleague on a project in his district. 
</P>
<P>
The Bistro Garden in Beverly Hills is a favorite of some council members and 
former President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ends 2-Year Dispute 
</P>
<P>
The action ended an often acrimonious two-year dispute pitting the Sherman Oaks 
Homeowners Assn. against a usual ally, the Studio City Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Oaks homeowners claimed that the restaurant would add to parking and 
traffic woes. 
</P>
<P>
"Each step our association has taken has been only to protect the surrounding 
neighborhood," said Rose Elmassian, representing the Sherman Oaks Homeowners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
She said the association did not oppose the restaurant's opening, but sought to 
require the developer to take greater steps to reduce parking and traffic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the restaurant, including the Studio City Residents Assn., argued 
that most of the residents who live close to the proposed restaurant support 
it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticisms Questioned 
</P>
<P>
They scoffed at suggestions by some opponents that wealthy diners would leave 
behind litter and urinate on lawns. They said a Bistro Garden is preferable to 
a McDonald's restaurant on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"Why anyone doesn't want it is beyond me," said Herb Piken, shopping center 
developer. The restaurant is expected to open in July. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said he was satisfied that the restrictions imposed on the project would 
protect the surrounding neighborhood. These include requiring city approval for 
additional food establishments in the center and requiring the developer to pay 
for $300,000 in traffic improvements. The developer is also required to 
maintain graffiti-free walls. 
</P>
<P>
"We have succeeded through a combination of reducing the size of the project, 
requiring significant traffic mitigations and adopting conditions on the use of 
the restaurant, which I think adequately protect the surrounding neighborhood," 
Woo said.

HAUPT CLEARED IN BOY'S CASINO KIDNAP-MURDER

<P>
A District Court jury has found San Diego data processor Howard Lee Haupt 
innocent on charges of murdering a 7-year-old California boy after taking him 
from a casino nearly 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased that the justice system works," a visibly shaken Haupt said 
after the verdict was read. "I had my doubts early on because of the stress." 
</P>
<P>
Haupt trembled and wept as the verdict was read, then told reporters he was 
"very happy" and was going home to San Diego. He said he planned to do some 
sailing, camping and bicycling with his fiance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Sobbed Loudly 
</P>
<P>
Roxanne Harris, the mother of victim Alexander Harris, sobbed loudly and tucked 
her head in her hands as the verdict was read. She and prosecutor Mel Harmon 
then left the courtroom and went upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon said later that the mother was "devastated." 
</P>
<P>
"She's had to relive what happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury began deliberations Monday night after a five-week trial before Judge 
Stephen Huffaker. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors returned with the verdict late Wednesday morning, and the small 
courtroom was packed with friends and family of the defendant and the victim. 
</P>
<P>
The Harris boy disappeared Nov. 27, 1987, from Whiskey Pete's casino on the 
California-Nevada border southwest of Las Vegas. His body was found a month 
later and Haupt was arrested a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Thank God the System Works' 
</P>
<P>
"The system works," said defense attorney Steve Stein, who hugged Haupt as the 
verdict was read. "I knew in my heart this man was not guilty. Thank God the 
system works." 
</P>
<P>
The jury also found Haupt innocent on kidnap charges. 
</P>
<P>
Stein said in closing arguments that Las Vegas Metro Police had seized upon 
Haupt as a scapegoat in the high-profile murder case. Metro Homicide Lt. Kyle 
Edwards watched the jury verdict from a hallway off the courtroom, then left. 
</P>
<P>
Haupt resembled a man seen leaving a video arcade at the casino the day of the 
boy's disappearance. Defense attorneys contended that witnesses and experts 
could not clearly identify Haupt as the man in the videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Haupt's fiance, Tina VanDenHazel, sobbed as she clutched the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
"They arrested an innocent person, and we've been going through hell for a 
year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Further Action Possible 
</P>
<P>
Haupt held out the possibility of further action evolving from the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are going to happen after today, and I just can't comment," Haupt said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would be returning to Las Vegas, Haupt replied, "I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no amount of money you can put on a person's life," Haupt said when 
asked about the large sum of money he had spent fighting the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Haupt seemed more composed as reporters crowded around him after the verdict. 
Noting that police had made an issue of his reserved nature, Haupt said: "I'm a 
quiet guy. They just misinterpreted who I am." 
</P>
<P>
Haupt said he became concerned when the jury began deliberations for a third 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected a verdict yesterday (Tuesday)," he said. "It's been an extremely 
stressful year. I just feel total release." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relatives Gambled Nearby 
</P>
<P>
Haupt, 38, was charged with kidnaping and murdering the Mountain View, Calif., 
youth, who was taken from a video arcade at Whiskey Pete's while his mother and 
grandparents gambled nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the family were on their way home from a Thanksgiving vacation in 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses testified during the trial that the boy left the arcade with a man 
resembling Haupt. But after the verdict, two jurors said the testimony of the 
eyewitnesses seemed tainted, shaky and unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
Haupt was registered at Whiskey Pete's the weekend the boy disappeared. He 
contended he was land-sailing in the nearby desert at the time the boy 
disappeared and produced witnesses to back up his story. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments Monday, Harmon urged jurors to convict Haupt, saying that 
half a dozen witnesses who identified Haupt as the man they saw taking the 
youth from the casino couldn't have been wrong. Harmon also told jurors that 
Haupt was too rehearsed on the witness stand and shouldn't be believed. 
</P>
<P>
But Haupt's attorney pointed to conflicting testimony from witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Stein described Haupt as a victim of mistaken identity and said he was a 
scapegoat for police, who failed to find the youth's body until Dec. 30, 1987. 
The body was found under a house trailer on casino grounds. The grounds had 
been searched by Metro Police for two days after the boy disappeared.

$150-MILLION COMPLEX DIVIDED RESIDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY PLANNERS OK CALABASAS OFFICE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A $150-million office and hotel proposal supported by one group of Calabasas 
Park residents but opposed by another was approved Wednesday by a similarly 
divided Los Angeles County Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Planners voted 3 to 2 to let the Ahmanson Commercial Development Corp. 
construct a 12-building complex on 67 acres at the southeast corner of 
Calabasas Road and Parkway Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
Before construction can be completed, Ahmanson officials must contribute $6 
million to a fund that will help pay for a new $10-million Parkway 
Calabasas-Ventura Freeway interchange at the edge of the project site. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.5-million-square-foot commercial project was supported by the 
long-established Calabasas Park Homeowners Assn., which spent two years 
negotiating with Ahmanson officials over the project's size and design. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ridge Preserved 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas Park residents persuaded Ahmanson to preserve a ridge that runs along 
the south side of the development site. The ridge blocks their view of the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmanson also pledged to direct traffic from the project away from Calabasas 
Park residential areas and time its development to correspond with construction 
of the new freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
The project site separates the original Calabasas Park residential neighborhood 
from an existing strip of offices and shops between Calabasas Road and the 
Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations, Ahmanson officials agreed to reduce the height of 
their proposed buildings from 10 stories to six -- a height that was later 
dropped to five stories at the request of county planners. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we can exit our homes and save ridge tops and open space, we've 
done our job," Myra Turek, president of the Calabasas Park association, said 
after Wednesday's commission vote in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But the Ahmanson plan was criticized by members of the newly formed Westridge 
Homeowners Assn. Members said they were unaware of the extent of the 
development proposal when they bought their homes last year. Their neighborhood 
of 112 luxury homes is just west of the Ahmanson site and has only recently 
been completed and occupied. 
</P>
<P>
Westridge's lone gate-guarded entrance is across Parkway Calabasas from the 
Ahmanson site. Some Westridge homeowners will look down upon Ahmanson's office 
buildings and parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a travesty. I'm just sick," said Marcia Abab, who lives in one of the new 
$1-million Westridge homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Small Century City' 
</P>
<P>
"I consider it like putting a small Century City or Warner Center in front of 
our homes," said Beverly Sondel, a Westridge association director. "We'll be 
left without access to our homes in an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
Westridge residents had planned Wednesday to ask commissioners to order 
Ahmanson to lower the height of all buildings to two stories. But planners, who 
had conducted three previous public hearings on the project in recent months, 
did not take new testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Betty Fisher and J. Paul Robinson voted against the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been concerned about traffic that is out there," Fisher said. 
"Putting this on top of it would be terribly burdensome for the people there." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he was worried about the construction phases and whether the 
proposed new Valley Circle interchange will be finished before the hotel and 
offices are occupied. 
</P>
<P>
Two other commissioners -- Lee Strong and Clinton Ternstrom -- expressed 
unhappiness over the size of the project and potential traffic headaches it may 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
But they voted to let construction begin when planning staff members told them 
that the county can hold up the project's occupancy permits if traffic 
improvements in the area are not finished before the first phase of the project 
is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's action is final unless appealed to the County Board of 
Supervisors.

LATE TAKEOFFS BANNED OVER TOPANGA AND CALABASAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of Topanga Canyon and Calabasas have won a partial victory in a 
five-year campaign to keep noisy jets taking off from Los Angeles International 
Airport from flying over their communities. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that it has halted 
late-night flights over the two communities by airliners heading from LAX to 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Jetliner pilots will be prohibited from flying over the area between 9 p.m. and 
midnight, said FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell. There are no commuter flights 
between midnight and 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
After 9 p.m., planes taking off from LAX are being required to fly farther west 
over the Pacific Ocean to climb in altitude before turning north. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Aircraft 
</P>
<P>
As many as 70 jetliners a day have been flying over Topanga and Calabasas on a 
takeoff path known as "Gorman Five." 
</P>
<P>
The new procedures went into effect over the weekend, O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
The change in takeoffs represents the FAA's first acknowledgment that jet noise 
is a problem for residents of the two communities at the southwestern edge of 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, FAA officials brushed aside complaints by comparing jet noise over 
the area with the sound of birds, dogs, cars and wind. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the FAA removed an LAX administrator assigned to investigate 
noise complaints who had criticized an FAA report that concluded that "there is 
no appreciable difference between the aircraft noise and ambient noise for the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Conclusions 
</P>
<P>
The report stated that "ambient noise (bird/dogs/cars/wind)" registered at 65 
to 80 decibels. Departing jets peaked in the 50- to 65-decibel range, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
That prompted angry community leaders to seek help from Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Tarzana), who called for a formal FAA investigation into the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Glaser, president of the Topanga Town Council and one of the most 
persistent critics of the over-the-canyon takeoffs, credited Beilenson's 
intervention with prompting the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fantastic, just wonderful. We're already noticing a difference," Glaser 
said. "We understand the airlines don't like it and it was difficult to do, but 
we feel it's a good first step. Congressman Beilenson has taken a good, strong 
position." 
</P>
<P>
The takeoff change was announced by Jeffrey Thorstenson, manager of the FAA's 
air space and procedures branch. 
</P>
<P>
He declined further comment Wednesday, however, and O'Donnell said he did not 
know how many nighttime flights were affected. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell said he did not know if it is possible to route other Gorman Five 
takeoffs farther west to avoid Topanga and Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can safely reroute traffic without impeding safety, we most certainly 
would do that," O'Donnell said. "Noise abatement is an important issue with the 
FAA. Until further notice, they will be directed to a Ventura departure." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope Change Is Permanent 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the noise said Wednesday that they hope the change is permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Hatfield, a field representative for Beilenson, said her office in 
December appealed to FAA officials in Washington for a 60-day test period to 
study the noise situation. 
</P>
<P>
She said her office has not received official notification from the FAA of the 
takeoff ban. 
</P>
<P>
But blissful nighttime quiet the past few days has been notification enough for 
such homeowners as Margaret Rawls of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
"We can sleep now. It's a definite improvement," said Rawls, who has fought the 
jet noise since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't that many jets flying over late at night. But those that did 
were enough to wake you up."

ELECTION FIGHT RETAINS ITS HEAT ; 
</P>
<P>
TEMPERS ARE STILL FLARING AS THE DISPUTE OVER A 1987 INGLEWOOD CONTEST MARKED 
BY CHARGES OF VOTING INTIMIDATION REACHES THE COURT OF APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
During an hourlong hearing before a state appellate panel this week, opposing 
lawyers painted vastly different pictures of the 1987 election of Inglewood 
Councilman Ervin (Tony) Thomas and its subsequent annulment by a Superior Court 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Thomas and the city depicted Judge Leon Savitch's decision to 
throw out 31 votes for Thomas and hold a new election as a travesty that denied 
the city due process and will lead to a wave of frivolous, expensive election 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't care who is the councilman," said Edward Lascher, an appellate 
specialist representing the city. "We do care, to the ultimate extent possible, 
that the electing goes on in the ballot box, including the absentee ballot box, 
and not the courtroom. The voters of Inglewood are being punished for 
irregularities, blunders and human shortcomings in some of their voting." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Borenstein, who is representing Thomas' opponent Garland Hardeman, tore 
into the notion that Judge Savitch's decision in October, 1987, was based on 
technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Essence of the Process' 
</P>
<P>
He said: "Is it a mere technicality when the court believes that five people 
did not live in the district? Is it a mere technicality when the court finds 
that numerous voters did not cast their own votes or sign their own absentee 
ballot applications? These cases go to the essence of the electoral process." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing had more heat than substance, since the three-judge panel of the 
state Court of Appeal will decide largely on the basis of filed written 
arguments. And the justices asked only two questions, making it hard to gauge 
their reaction to the complex case that has left a cloud over the Inglewood 
City Council for 20 months. 
</P>
<P>
But the questions that the panel did ask addressed one of the most explosive 
issues of the case: Savitch's ruling that Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent was 
involved in intimidation of voters and other Election Code violations during an 
aggressive absentee ballot drive by the Thomas campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent energetically backed Thomas, a merchandising analyst for 7-Up, against 
Hardeman, a Los Angeles police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Savitch threw out a total of 58 votes, most of them absentee ballots, 
because of testimony that relatives or campaign workers punched ballots for 
voters, some of whom were not present; that voters -- including Thomas' three 
adult stepchildren and two voters who gave their address as Thomas campaign 
headquarters -- did not live in the district, and that some absentee ballots 
were not delivered by the voter. 
</P>
<P>
Savitch found that 31 of the votes had been for Thomas, and that the 
beneficiary of other 27 invalid ballots was inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas remains on the council pending appeal. Hardeman also appealed the 
decision, saying that instead of holding a new election, he should be declared 
the winner because the ruling left him with 16 more votes than Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most dramatic testimony during the trial concerned four votes that 
Savitch declared illegal on the grounds of intimidation and invasion of voter's 
ballot secrecy. Witnesses testified that Mayor Vincent solicited those votes at 
voters' homes. He has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
That testimony came to the forefront at Tuesday's appellate hearing when 
Justice Ronald George interrupted Lascher to question his description of 
various irregularities as essentially "harmless." George cited witnesses who 
said they had been rushed or pressured into voting by campaign workers, 
including the case of Nancy Armstrong, whose vote was thrown out along with the 
vote of her daughter Pamela. 
</P>
<P>
The Armstrongs testified that Mayor Vincent came to their home and punched 
their absentee ballots. Savitch later threw out those votes on the grounds that 
the voters were intimidated and their ballot secrecy violated. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of things that are somewhat bothersome," Justice George 
said. "(Nancy Armstrong) said he abridged her rights because she didn't have 
time to study the literature. Doesn't that go beyond hurrying the voter?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evidence Disputed 
</P>
<P>
Lascher responded that evidence in this and other cases was not conclusive and 
that Savitch based his ruling on "assumption after assumption" by Hardeman's 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview afterward, Lascher said of the Armstrong case: "That wasn't a 
great vote. But are we after perfection?" 
</P>
<P>
Lascher also told the court that evidence did not show voters would have voted 
differently if their absentee ballots had not been solicited by the Thomas 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In his response, Borenstein argued that the voter's intent is irrelevant if the 
vote is cast illegally. He cited cases in which relatives cast ballots for 
absent voters. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't walk into a polling place and say, 'Hey, I want to vote for my wife, 
she said it was OK,' " Borenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers also clashed over whether Savitch allowed the city enough time and 
information to prepare its case during the hectic trial. In such proceedings 
many normal rules governing the hearing of civil lawsuits are suspended because 
of the need to resolve the case quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' attorney Robert Stroud alleged that Hardeman's attorneys, with 
Savitch's approval, did not specify which votes they were challenging until the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Borenstein said the other side received the information required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Borenstein and Lascher also differ on the 27 ballots that Savitch said were 
illegal but could not be subtracted from either candidate's total because it 
was unclear who they were for. 
</P>
<P>
Borenstein said precedents indicate the court should subtract those illegal 
ballots in proportion to the number of absentee ballots received by each 
candidate. That method would give Hardeman the victory, since he received only 
65 absentee votes to Thomas 395. 
</P>
<P>
Lascher disputes the existence of such precedents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Election at Issue 
</P>
<P>
Another issue the justices will consider is Savitch's decision to order an 
election rather than declare Hardeman the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Hardeman's attorneys cite Election Code Section 20087, which states: "If in any 
election contest it appears that another person than the defendant has the 
higher number of legal votes, the court shall declare that person elected." 
They say that language does not allow the discretion that Savitch claimed when 
he ordered a new election. 
</P>
<P>
Lascher dismissed that argument, saying that Hardeman's attorneys recognized in 
their written arguments that Savitch had that option. "The very least that 
should be done is that the judgment (calling for a new election) should be 
affirmed in its entirety," Lascher told the court. "But I hope we don't even 
get to that point." 
</P>
<P>
But Borenstein said his arguments specifically requested that Savitch declare 
Hardeman the winner, and only presented a new election as an option if the 
ruling did not leave Hardeman with more votes. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel has 90 days to issue a written ruling, but lawyers and 
court personnel say they expect a ruling sooner because an election is 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident about the outcome," Hardeman said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he hopes the court will rule in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Frivolous Things' 
</P>
<P>
Of Hardeman's case, he said: "A lot of frivolous things were brought into 
court. This has cost me a lot of money. It has put me and my family to a 
disadvantage. Mr. Hardeman hasn't paid a dime." 
</P>
<P>
The law firm of Tuttle &amp; Taylor is representing Hardeman at no charge 
because of the public interest questions involved. 
</P>
<P>
Tension was evident between lawyers at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
During the appellate process, Borenstein has complained about Lascher's 
characterization of Hardeman's attorneys as "limousine liberals" with a 
patronizing attitude toward Inglewood's predominantly black voters. Recently, 
there have been angry words over Lascher's request to delay Tuesday's oral 
arguments until April because Lascher had surgery for stomach cancer in early 
January. That request was opposed by Borenstein and denied by the appellate 
court. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, City Atty. Howard Rosten criticized Borenstein's opposition to a 
delay. "That lawyers would treat anybody like that, much less another lawyer, 
is incredible," he said. "It reaches new lows in the legal profession." 
</P>
<P>
Borenstein repeated his contention that someone other than Lascher could have 
presented the oral arguments if necessary since written arguments, the primary 
basis for the court's decision, were already on file. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very sorry he's ill," Borenstein said. "I wish it weren't so, but it 
shouldn't interfere. The fact is there is a person sitting in a seat where an 
election was annulled. This must be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission opened investigations into the election in 1987. Both 
agencies say they are still investigating.

LAWNDALE AIMS TO OUST CRITICS FROM CITY PANELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Lawndale City Council members, angered by two residents who have formally 
challenged the city's handling of an $8-million federal grant, plan to remove 
them tonight from their posts on city advisory panels. 
</P>
<P>
Recreation Commissioner Nancy Marthens and Virginia Rhodes, chairwoman of the 
city's Beautification Committee, submitted a voluminous bound document to the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in December. They asked the 
agency to investigate whether the city properly administered the grant, which 
it lent to the developer of the $70-million Galleria at South Bay in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In a very brief response, HUD asked the city to respond to the questions raised 
but did not comment on the substance of the allegations, which include: 
</P>
<P>
Failure to meet hiring objectives for the employment of Lawndale residents at 
the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to seek HUD's approval for a recent refinancing of the mall approved by 
the council last year. 
</P>
<P>
Failure of the city and the developer, South Bay Associates, to comply with a 
10-year restriction on a buyout of the city's interest in the mall by the 
developer. The city has been negotiating for at least five months on a proposal 
by the developer to pay back the loan and buy out the city's interest in the 
mall, which could bring a windfall to Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
Officials declined to state the amount the city would receive, but City Atty. 
David J. Aleshire said last fall that the buyout would be "certainly worth more 
than the $8 million" the city originally invested. 
</P>
<P>
Aleshire said in an interview Tuesday that the city has followed proper 
procedures in administering the federal grant. He said he will draft a formal 
response to HUD. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allegations Disputed 
</P>
<P>
He and other city officials disputed the allegations of Marthens and Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the council vigorously defended the city's hiring program, which 
they said has resulted in several hundred jobs for Lawndale residents. 
</P>
<P>
Aleshire said the city does not need HUD approval for the refinancing because 
no additional debt would be incurred. HUD has signed off on the agreement, 
Aleshire said, and the city and the developer need not hold to the 10-year 
buyout restriction. 
</P>
<P>
Acting City Manager Jim Arnold said Tuesday that HUD would not have closed out 
its role in the project had federal officials detected problems with the city's 
administration of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Upset 
</P>
<P>
All five members of the City Council said they are upset that Marthens and 
Rhodes made a formal inquiry that will cost the city thousands of dollars in 
legal and staff time. Four of the five council members said they will support 
the removal of Marthens and Rhodes from their city posts. The fifth, Harold E. 
Hofmann, said he is troubled by their action but has not decided how he would 
vote on their removal. 
</P>
<P>
Marthens and Rhodes, who both were candidates in the 1988 City Council 
election, said they have acted in the city's best interest. They said they are 
appalled that the council would take away their appointments because they have 
criticized the city. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Larry Rudolph, who appointed Marthens to the city's Parks, 
Recreation and Social Services Commission last year, delivered a letter to her 
home Monday asking for her immediate resignation. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, he said he has "no problem" with her performance on the 
commission and that she has done "an adequate job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HUD Letter Cited 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "due to your recent letter to HUD, which could cost the city of 
Lawndale anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000, it is my feeling you cannot work to 
better the city of Lawndale and try to harm the city of Lawndale at the same 
time." 
</P>
<P>
If necessary, Rudolph said, he will ask the council to remove Marthens. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dan McKenzie had placed on tonight's council agenda an item 
declaring his intent to remove "a Beautification Committee member." He 
confirmed in an interview that he has targeted Rhodes because of her 
participation with Marthens in calling for the HUD inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"All they want to do is tear up the city," McKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Badgered the City' 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sarann Kruse and Councilwoman Carol Norman, who are often at odds with 
McKenzie and Rudolph, also want to remove the two from their city posts. Kruse 
said that rather than helping Lawndale, Marthens and Rhodes have "constantly 
badgered the city" with lawsuits and complaints. As city appointees, they have 
a responsibility to protect the city's interests, she said, adding: "They can't 
play two roles at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes said Tuesday that she sees the council's plan to remove her from her 
post as a violation of her right to comment on the actions of elected and 
public officials. "I didn't give up my civil rights by being on this 
committee," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marthens said that while city officials are upset at the cost of the HUD 
investigation, they don't appear as concerned about whatever staff time may 
have been spent in inquiries made by Gary McDonald, chairman of the city 
Planning Commission and a political ally of Rudolph, McKenzie and Hofmann. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph responded: "The bottom line is that Gary doesn't go out and cost the 
city money to defend itself." The issues McDonald has raised have generated 
"positive changes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Benefit to the City' 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said his investigations may have taken staff time but "have turned out 
to be a benefit to the city, reducing city expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, his 1988 discovery of embezzlement in the maintenance 
department and a subsequent restructuring of the department produced a 
projected savings of $370,000. His said his discovery of irregularities in the 
Planning Department has led to projects that are harmonious with the city's 
environmental and planning concerns while providing developer fees for traffic 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Marthens said the points she and Rhodes raised with HUD should come as no 
surprise to the council. "Every issue was raised in open council meetings, but 
they never bothered to follow through," Marthens said. "I am a federal 
taxpayer, and those are federal tax dollars. It bothers me that the federal 
government would hand over $8 million . . . and not follow up to see the city 
is complying with the requirements in their agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Roy Priest, a senior development director for HUD in Washington, said the 
federal agency does review the administration of such grant funds. Once a city 
has met its requirements, HUD closes out the agreement and gives the city a 
certificate of completion, he said. Lawndale has received this certificate, he 
said, and that normally ends HUD's involvement unless there is some evidence of 
malfeasance that requires investigation.

WOMAN FOUND HANGED IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman arrested in Gardena apparently hanged herself in her jail cell 12 hours 
after she was locked up, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who was arrested late Monday and charged with stopping traffic and 
resisting arrest, apparently used her dress to hang herself from the bars of 
the cell, said Lt. Ross Weddle. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who was 24 years old and a transient, was the only prisoner in the 
women's cellblock of the Gardena jail. 
</P>
<P>
The woman had been stopped by police Monday night in the 14500 block of Vermont 
Avenue near Rosecrans Avenue on suspicion of prostitution, Weddle said. She was 
charged with stopping and delaying traffic and later with resisting arrest when 
she refused to give police her name. 
</P>
<P>
She did not appear despondent when police officers did routine prisoner checks 
every 30 minutes, and was last seen alive during a routine check at 9:51 a.m., 
Weddle said. She was discovered dead at 10:29 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The woman died of asphyxiation, said Bob Danbacker, a spokesman for the Los 
Angeles County coroner's office. Officials have learned her identity through 
fingerprint checks, but her name has not been released pending notification of 
kin.

FUNDS FOR PALOS VERDES DRIVE WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rolling Hills will allocate $7,200 of the federal funds it will receive this 
fiscal year to the city of Rolling Hills Estates for reconstruction of Palos 
Verdes Drive North from Crenshaw Boulevard to Sunnyfield Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills, a private and gated community, cannot use the money since the 
funds may only be spent on public streets. Palos Verdes Drive North in Rolling 
Hills Estates is a principal access road to Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for reconstruction of the 1 1/4-mile stretch will be put before the 
Rolling Hills Estates City Council Feb. 28. The cost of the project has not 
been set.

BUILDING MORATORIUM EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Estates City Council has again extended a moratorium on 
commercial construction in the city's two commercial zones -- Malaga Cove and 
Lunada Bay -- to give city staff more time to strengthen codes governing land 
use and parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
A 45-day moratorium, initially imposed last March, was extended for 10 months 
and 15 days in April. The most recent extension, the last the law will allow, 
expires March 7, 1990, but city officials hope to have adopted a specific plan 
before June for developing the commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
In related action, the council also extended for 10 months and 15 days a 
moratorium on any changes in use in commercial zones. On Jan. 9, the council 
declared a moratorium on changes in the use to which commercial buildings and 
offices can be put, fearing that any changes would frustrate the implementation 
of the specific plans being prepared for commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
That moratorium, which can be extended once more, will expire Jan. 8, 1990.

Two men were being held in County Jail Wednesday after one pointed a handgun 
with his finger on the trigger at two San Diego police officers answering a 
burglary call in Southeast San Diego, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Origel, 26, was being held on suspicion of displaying a handgun in a 
threatening manner, possession of a hypodermic needle and being under the 
influence of a controlled substance, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Gonzalez, 21, was being held on suspicion of being under the influence of 
a controlled substance, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation occurred when the two men were questioned by officers 
answering a burglary call in the 3800 block of Logan Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, Kathleen Finn and Spencer Stern, questioned the pair at 9:40 a.m. 
When the officers came near the two, Origel turned and wielded a .38-caliber 
handgun, pointing it at Stern and Finn, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Both officers pulled out their service revolvers but did not fire. They talked 
Origel into surrendering his gun without firing it, Robinson said.

A second suspect is now in custody in connection with the Feb. 2 slaying of Huy 
Tinh Le, 42, who was shot several times during a robbery at a North Park home, 
police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tuan Van Tran, 18, who already was being held on suspicion of three counts of 
armed robbery, was charged with murder after he was identified Tuesday by 
witnesses to Le's slaying. Tran is one of four men arrested Saturday who are 
believed to be part of a loosely knit group of Indochinese bandits who 
committed at least four brutal residential robberies of Asian families in 
Southeast San Diego and Linda Vista beginning last December. 
</P>
<P>
Tho Van Tran, an 18-year-old Hoover High School student unrelated to Tuan Van 
Tran, was the first suspect arrested in connection with Le's death. The other 
two men arrested Saturday on suspicion of armed robbery and possession of 
illegal weapons are Nghia Hinh, 30, and Hung Van Nguyen, 22. Hinh and Nguyen 
are also in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Tho Van Tran and Tuan Van Tran both pleaded not guilty Wednesday to murder and 
robbery charges. San Diego Municipal Judge H. Ronald Domnitz set bail at 
$500,000 and ordered a review of that bail for Tuesday. They remain in County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing was scheduled for March 31. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County Sheriff's detectives, meanwhile, said they have linked both 
18-year-old men to a residential robbery of a Vietnamese family in Spring 
Valley Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Detective Sheila Anderson said Tuan Van Tran and Tho Van Tran were 
identified Tuesday by victims from Saturday's Spring Valley holdup. 
</P>
<P>
Le, of the 2900 block of Monarch Street, was killed during a visit at a 
friend's home in the 4100 block of Polk Avenue. Three men dressed in black 
burst into the home at 8:30 p.m., demanding cash and jewelry and threatening 
family members. When Le came to the aid of the family's 13-year-old girl, whom 
the men said they were going to kidnap, he was shot several times. 
</P>
<P>
In the Spring Valley robbery, three men broke into the home in the 8600 block 
of Noeline Avenue at 5 a.m., tied up three people and ransacked the house, 
taking cash and jewelry.

Martin Marietta Corp. plans to form an "advanced development and technology" 
group in San Diego, the Bethesda, Md.-based company said Wednesday. However, 
Martin Marietta has not yet leased any space or determined how many employees 
will be hired, according to a spokesman in Bethesda. 
</P>
<P>
The Martin Marietta Advanced Development &amp; Technology Operations will 
"pursue advanced technology developments across (a) broad spectrum," according 
to the spokesman. The operation will "focus primarily on new developments in 
defense electronics, missiles, astronautics and information systems," the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent engineering and production will be handled by Martin Marietta's 
existing divisions elsewhere in the United States, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The new division will be directed by Robert J. Whalen, 57, a former vice 
president of Martin Marietta, who most recently was general manager of Alcoa 
Defense Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Whalen is a San Diego resident, the spokesman said.

JACK SMITH: LIFE IMITATES THE ART OF THE CLICHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Are you all right?" -- a question asked of someone who has just been shot, 
mugged, bushwhacked or otherwise traumatized -- is apparently unchallenged as 
the most inescapable cliche of the movies today. 
</P>
<P>
But there are others. Writer Maury Green holds that a close second is "What's 
that supposed to mean?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it is ubiquitous. It most often occurs in supposedly smart dialogue 
between a man and a woman: He: "Your place or mine?" She: "What's that supposed 
to mean?" As if she didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
Green recalls that he once heard it delivered four times in a single TV show. 
The show had four writers, he says, and each writer evidently put the line in 
once. 
</P>
<P>
John Degatina observes that "Are you all right?" is not limited to action 
movies. "It's like a fungus on all types of movies and TV shows; not just 
police-action dramas. For example, a couple lose their only child, and a half 
hour later the man asks his wife, 'You OK?' She should hit him with a frying 
pan, and say, 'Of course, you idiot.' Instead, she smiles bravely and touches 
his hand." 
</P>
<P>
J. Schwartz of Marina del Rey concedes that "Are you all right?" is foolish, 
but no more so than real-life cliches. "How about the man whose hat has been 
knocked off by a thrown snowball. He turns, sees the perpetrators (small boys) 
running away, and shouts 'Come back here!' How about the fellow passenger on a 
train or bus who sees that you are sitting on a newspaper and asks, 'Are you 
reading that?' " 
</P>
<P>
David Kolpacoff of El Cajon says, "Are you all right?" may be an absurd cliche, 
but he can testify from personal experience that it is exactly what people ask 
when you've been injured and are in no condition to evaluate your health. "In 
my case," he says, "two car accidents and a construction mishap. I guess it 
replaces, 'Where does it hurt?' " 
</P>
<P>
Kolpacoff questions my judgment about another movie cliche -- the wanton 
destruction of automobiles in chases. "There is no more graphic symptom of our 
wasteful society than the mass demolition of what appear to be brand-new cars 
in action movies," I wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Come, now," Kolpacoff says. "Isn't that a little overwrought? Given that the 
movies are entertainment and that a certain portion of moviegoers love the 
demolition of fifty-thousand dollars worth of Fords and subsidize this by 
buying tickets, it can't anymore be called waste than a fireworks display or 
the money that, say, went into the lavish costumes in the 'Wizard of Oz.' " 
</P>
<P>
A poor comparison. Fireworks are manufactured for the sole purpose of being 
exploded. That is their function. Destroying them is the fulfillment of their 
purpose. Costumes are made to be worn, and if they cannot be worn after the 
movie for which they're made, they too have fulfilled their function. 
</P>
<P>
Automobiles are made to transport people from one point to another -- in 
comfort, in luxury, safely, at high speed, in style, in self-realization, in 
pride, economically, or whatever other way the owner wants to go. They cost 
from $8,000 to more than $100,000 each, and they are expected to last several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
To demolish several such objects merely to provide a momentary thrill for 
moviegoers is waste, and nonetheless so because it is paid for by the 
moviegoers. Surely the Chinese, who have few cars, must see this wholesale 
destruction as wasteful, and quite unlike their own explosion of fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of chases, I am corrected in my recollection that in "The French 
Connection" the bad guy gets away from Gene Hackman after a chase in which 
Hackman races his car along a street paralleling a train route, "banging into 
other cars, missing pedestrians by inches, shattering his car against a 
concrete pier and otherwise wreaking havoc." 
</P>
<P>
"No, he didn't (get away), Jack," writes Alene Harris. "Gene Hackman shot and 
killed 'the guy' as he (the guy) ran down the steps of the elevated platform." 
</P>
<P>
John C. Kruize corroborates: "At the end of the famous car-subway chase the bad 
guy doesn't get away. Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle catches up with the thug 
(played by Marcel Bozzuffi) at the base of the stairs leading up to the train 
platform, and shoots and kills him." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I'm all right.

ART BUCHWALD: POEM IN HIS HEART -- AND A BIG PAYCHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the things that seems to have gotten Sen. Tower into so much trouble is 
the fact that he worked as a consultant on defense contracts. He is supposed to 
have made $775,000 at this job. What does someone have to deliver to earn this 
kind of dough? I couldn't guess, so I asked another defense consultant, Roy 
Chardonnay, to tell me exactly what people like him did for that sort of money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too complicated to explain," he said. "You would be much better off if 
you came with me on my rounds. My first stop is the office of Flatwing 
Aviation, which keeps me on a $250,000 retainer. Whenever they have a problem, 
I come running." 
</P>
<P>
An hour later we were in the offices of Scotty Hoopster, CEO of Flatwing. He 
was pacing up and down. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand those SOBs in the Pentagon. We gave them the finest plane 
that money could buy, and now they want a rebate because there are cracks in 
the wings. Roy, should we go public and attack them for this?" 
</P>
<P>
Chardonnay referred to a loose-leaf book he was carrying. He read: 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much good in the worst of us / And so much bad in the best of us / 
It hardly becomes any of us / To talk about the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
Hoopster looked at Chardonnay as if he couldn't believe his ears. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that your advice?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yessir. I'll fax it to you tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Hoopster continued, "We're not just talking about money, Roy. We're talking 
about criminal charges. The Pentagon said we kept two sets of books on the job. 
If the attorney general goes after us, we're sitting ducks. What should I do 
about that?" 
</P>
<P>
Roy opened his notebook again: "If you can keep your head when all about you 
others are losing theirs and blaming it on you / If you can trust yourself when 
all men doubt you / but make allowance for their doubting too / Or being lied 
about don't deal in lies, or being hated, don't give way to hating / And don't 
look too good or talk too wise. If. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hoopster shouted, "Will you shut up and give me a game plan! We've got two 
weeks before the grand jury convenes. Now, Roy, you know how things operate in 
this town. Do we stonewall like Ollie North, and use the national security 
defense ploy, or do we make a deal with the Justice Department? I don't think 
we've got a prayer to beat this one." 
</P>
<P>
To my amazement, Roy went back to the loose-leaf book once more. He read aloud, 
"Somebody said that it couldn't be done / But he with a chuckle replied / That 
'maybe it couldn't' but he would be one who wouldn't say so 'til he tried / So 
he buckled right in with a trace of a grin, on his face / If he worried he hid 
it / He started to sing as he tackled the thing / That couldn't be done and he 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
"What the hell does that mean?" Scotty wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only here to give you advice. I'm not going to tell you what to do. If you 
want me to go further, it will cost you another $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
"I do want you to tell me what to do. Here's a check." 
</P>
<P>
Roy stood up and looked directly at Hoopster, "If you can't be a pine on the 
top of the hill / Be a scrub in the valley -- but be / The best little scrub by 
the side of the rill / Be a bush if you can't be a tree / If you can't be a 
bush be a bit of the grass, and some highway happier make / If you can't be a 
muskie then just be a bass / But the liveliest bass in the lake." 
</P>
<P>
Hoopster was deeply moved. "I don't know how I'll ever be able to thank you, 
Roy. Nobody in my organization has had the guts to tell me what you just did." 
</P>
<P>
"You need someone from outside who isn't emotionally involved," Roy told him. 
</P>
<P>
When we got out of the building, I said to Roy, "You really helped him by 
giving him the big picture. Now I can see why you get paid so well." 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged his shoulders, "The only thing you have to sell when you're a 
consultant is your brains."

ERMA BOMBECK: THIS IS WHAT BEING A PARENT IS ALL ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It came as no surprise to me that "my son" took the car keys back with him to 
California after a recent visit home. It is something "my son" has been trained 
to do by me throughout the years. If he had taken the car back with him, 
there's no doubt my husband would have granted me permanent custody of him for 
the rest of my life. 
</P>
<P>
It's something I've never really understood. How is it a child can be sectioned 
off at birth like the steer on the poster at the frozen meat locker? Mothers 
get the rump and fathers get the good stuff. It's one of those divisions we 
seem to accept without question. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby needs changing/wiping/powdering." 
</P>
<P>
"That's Mama's part." 
</P>
<P>
"The baby is hungry/cranky/bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
"It's Mama's son." 
</P>
<P>
We have discussed it. "Why is it," I asked my husband, "that 'your son' never 
needs a laxative -- it's always 'my son'?" 
</P>
<P>
"For the same reason," he explained, "that 'your son' never needed shoes. Just 
try to remember that every time his feet were flapping out of a pair of gym 
shoes and it cost $80 to cover them, you said, 'Your son needs shoes.' " 
</P>
<P>
I thought about that a moment. "Yes, but when the same feet were all over the 
furniture and never on the floor, they became my son's feet again." 
</P>
<P>
"Not always," he laughed nervously. 
</P>
<P>
"And when he stepped in something disgusting, they were always my son's feet to 
clean off. ALWAYS!" 
</P>
<P>
"Make your point." 
</P>
<P>
"I am saying," I said, "that you can't have one part one day and trade it off 
the next. Do you want the hair or not? If you say yes, remember he's your son 
when his hair is down to his shoulders and he's your son when it's short. Make 
up your mind." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll think about it. What else is up for grabs?" 
</P>
<P>
"He's always my son when he's out of a job." 
</P>
<P>
"That seems reasonable," my husband said. "You always seem to have so much 
patience." 
</P>
<P>
"You always said that when he was throwing up. I bought it then, but I'm not 
buying it now. Besides, we had the children together. Why can't we both be 
parents when they screw up? It's a shared responsibility. We're in this 
together. After all, isn't sacrifice what being a parent is all about?" 
</P>
<P>
The phone rang. Our son wanted to be picked up at the airport. He had been 
skiing and had a few hours before he took off at midnight and thought he'd kill 
them in the bosom of his family. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I looked at each other. Then we turned to our other son and 
said, "He's YOUR brother!"

HOW IMAGE-CONSCIOUS WAS DICKINSON? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, Times Book Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Figures of Speech by R. Jackson Wilson (Alfred A. Knopf: $24.95; 274 pages) 
</P>
<P>
A portrait, likely as not, will show a bit of stomach, or if not the stomach 
itself, its top end: the throat, the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
That is roughly why R. Jackson Wilson has chosen to preface his six studies of 
pre-20th-Century American authors with a painting or photograph of each of 
them. He is writing, in a way, about their stomachs. As Gromyko said of 
Gorbachev, so might Wilson say of Franklin, Emerson or even Emily Dickinson: "A 
nice smile, comrades, but notice the iron teeth." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the three mentioned, Wilson has also convened William Lloyd 
Garrison, Washington Irving and, in a brief but snide epilogue, Walt Whitman. 
</P>
<P>
Snideness is not all, but it dots the book here and there. It seems excessive, 
sometimes, but it is mitigated by Wilson's cheerful enthusiasm for his 
discovery. Not that the world is round but that such long and transcendental 
spirits as the sage of Concord, the Amherst recluse, and the thundering 
abolitionist were round, as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Familiar Figures 
</P>
<P>
Franklin is known for kindly wit, Irving for a codger's whimsy, Garrison for 
idealistic intransigence, Emerson for transcendental individualism, Dickinson 
for an elusive individual sensibility, and Whitman for speaking multitudes. 
This is our idea of who they were; this, Wilson tells us, is how literary 
critics and historians have identified them. 
</P>
<P>
And, he objects, not so; or not entirely so. Each of these public identities 
suppresses a vital part of the writer's private identity. The flesh-and-blood 
writer, in other words, created a literary personage to reach a public 
marketplace. To nourish a material stomach -- in varying degrees -- they 
nurtured an unmaterial soul. 
</P>
<P>
Writers, Wilson writes, "have become famous by warning against fame, rich by 
railing against money . . . celebrities by speaking to large audiences in 
crowded halls about the virtues of solitude in the woods." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, what Wilson is concerned to show is not the narrowly financial 
aspect involved in an author creating a persona, but its broader social and 
psychological implications. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin's celebrated portrait, for example, with its backwoodsman's fur cap, 
the puckish glance, and the benevolently pursed mouth was aimed at a very 
special audience; that of the French court. He was combining Noble Savage and 
wise philosopher, Candide and Voltaire in the same figure. Once he got the 
French to sign the treaty of alliance, Wilson notes, Franklin went on to wigs. 
</P>
<P>
He makes a similar analysis of Franklin's autobiography, tracing the different 
personages he was establishing: naive youth, ambitious journeyman, gentleman of 
culture, and skeptical sage. 
</P>
<P>
His point, as elsewhere, is that with aristocratic and other kinds of patronage 
on the wane, and with a literary market coming in, the creation of the Writer 
became almost as important as the writing of a Creation. 
</P>
<P>
Irving employed various personages, both identifying and distancing. There was 
the itinerant dilettante narrator of the Sketch books, and the aged eccentric, 
Diederich Knickerbocker, for the History of New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire for Effect 
</P>
<P>
Wilson finds Garrison's intransigence more pertinent to the writer than to the 
abolitionist. He became a radical in the cause of becoming a writer, rather 
than vice versa, the author suggests. He required "some great evil that must be 
fought" in order to justify the imperious "I" that he needed to express. 
</P>
<P>
He draws a fairly unlovely portrait of Emerson, as a writer who tempered his 
calls for spiritual heroism so as to stimulate his audiences without unduly 
worrying them. He oscillated perpetually, Wilson writes, between "the 
challenging and the reassuring." 
</P>
<P>
As for Dickinson, a recluse and amply supported by her family, the marketplace 
would seem to be irrelevant. Wilson uses the word "seem" several times. If she 
was so truly uninterested in success, he asks, why did she establish such a 
coyly insistent correspondence with Thomas Wentworth Higginson, an influential 
Boston literary figure, just after he had published an article advising young 
authors how to go about getting published? 
</P>
<P>
It was not that Dickinson needed the marketplace, materially. But, Wilson 
argues, "she needed the value system bestowed by the market; she had no other." 
</P>
<P>
The point is interesting. Here as elsewhere, though, the author tends to weight 
the material and psychological desires of the authors more heavily than the 
values they expressed. He uses the former to undermine the latter, rather than 
simply evoking the contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
His seeming lack of enthusiasm for the writing itself -- particularly with 
Dickinson and Whitman -- increases the weighting. To literary historians, he 
applies the rebuke of Marx and Engels: 
</P>
<P>
"Whilst in ordinary life every shopkeeper is well able to distinguish between 
what somebody professes to be and what he really is, our historians have not 
yet won even this trivial insight. They take every epoch at its word and 
believe that everything it says and imagines about itself is true." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson calls his own work "a shopkeeper's book." Sometimes, I am reminded of 
another observation about the shopkeeper mentality: that "it knows the price of 
everything and the value of nothing."

LEGAL VIEW: HANG ON TO SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you've just finished paying to put a new roof on your home, like I just did, 
your first instinct is probably to shove the expensive invoice far away in a 
drawer somewhere, never to be seen again. 
</P>
<P>
But before you do that, or worse yet, throw away the bill, you should remember 
that financial, legal and personal documents are important. They should be 
saved and readily available, at least for several years, and often for longer. 
They can be very helpful later when it is time to do your taxes, plan your 
estate, or even if your marriage falls apart. 
</P>
<P>
Especially important are real estate documents, such as the bill for a new 
roof, remodeling the kitchen or adding a bedroom. That's because of the way you 
will be taxed when you sell your property. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal tax law, you pay tax on the profit you make when you sell your 
property. The profit is determined by subtracting what you paid for the 
property and the cost of any capital improvements from the selling price (minus 
costs of sale). In other words, your profit is what you have left after 
deducting what you put into the house, not counting normal maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, you must pay federal tax on that profit. But that's not what happens 
to most people who sell their house, because they take advantage of a "roll 
over" exception in the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
If you sell your personal residence and buy another one of greater value within 
24 months, you won't have to pay any tax on the profit. For now. The profit is 
"rolled over" into the next house, but you will have to pay tax on it, when you 
sell the second house. Unless, of course, you buy another, more-expensive house 
again. You can keep rolling the profits into your next home, as long as each 
new house is more expensive than the last. When you buy a cheaper house, that's 
when you'll pay taxes. Let's take an example. You buy a house for $100,000, and 
add $25,000 worth of capital improvements. You sell for $200,000. You've made 
$75,000 on the sale, but don't have to pay any tax because you bought another 
home for $250,000. If you sell the second home for $350,000, and then move into 
an apartment for several years, you'll have to then pay tax on the $100,000 you 
made in the second house, and the $75,000 you made from the first one. 
</P>
<P>
But, remember, the Internal Revenue Service is not going to take very kindly to 
your contention that you invested $25,000 in capital improvements if you don't 
have the documentation to prove it. No matter how long ago it was. 
</P>
<P>
There is another exception you can use to avoid some taxation. You are allowed 
to exclude $125,000 of your gain, if you have lived in your house as your 
principal residence for three of the last five years, and you or your spouse is 
55 years or older. This is a once-in-a-lifetime exception. Neither you nor your 
spouse can use it again. And it is not automatic; it must be specifically 
elected by the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, it's extremely important that you save records in a safe, 
accessible place. There are several books on the market with forms to chronicle 
expenses and with information on storing important documents. Also, there is a 
computer program and book package that will help you keep track of your legal, 
financial and personal records. ("For the Record," by Carol Pladsen and Ralph 
Warner, Nolo Press, 950 Parker St., Berkeley, Calif. 94710. The book is 
$49.95.)

For her brand-new Italian daughter-in-law, Nancy Toomey of San Diego would like 
to find a wooden ravioli board; a metal one won't do. Can you show your mettle 
by coming up with a source, or will our newcomer be faced with a chile welcome 
because all of us want to pasta buck? 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Isabelle Meyer of Glendale says, you could buy a man's sports 
jacket made of a silvery polyurethane fabric with a quilted lining, but no 
more. It was great for backpacking because of its insulation and waterproof 
exterior. Can you come through before Meyer has to be put into a straitjacket, 
or will she pack it in merely because she didn't have enough clout to get her 
silver lining? 
</P>
<P>
Grace Johnson of Pasadena is looking for someone who will repair her 
Italian-made Copco pepper grinder. Can you come up with some sage advice, or 
will Johnson's kitchen activities grind to a halt while she awaits responses to 
this somewhat corny request? 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Thomas of Van Nuys would like to find some slack liners, which were 
available some years back. Can you help take up the slack on this matter, or 
will Thomas and friends not be able to walk into the sunset until their pant-up 
demand is met?

Hal Leonard of Rosemead, who was looking for chewable tree twigs, now has 
something to sink his teeth into. Nancy Cable of Woodland Hills says Follow 
Your Heart in Canoga Park carries licorice root. And Mrs. J. Lanning of Brea 
says to ask for licorice sticks at California Health Foods in Fullerton (and 
perhaps at other health food stores too.) 
</P>
<P>
Emmett W. Schoeberl of Agoura Hills, who was looking for an old-fashioned 
hand-operated clothes wringer, can stop wringing his hands. Several readers 
told us that Clark Dye Hardware, 210 S. Main St., Santa Ana, Calif. 92701, 
(714) 547-1633, has these wringers. Jeanne Rempel of Upland says the item is 
also available from a catalogue put out by Lehman Hardware &amp; Appliances 
Inc., P.O. Box 41, 4779 Kidron Road, Kidron, Ohio 44636, (216) 857-5441. Mrs. 
Warren H. Scott of Santa Barbara says Haack Products, Box 210, Franklin, Mich. 
48026, sells a Mr. Wringer for $34.95 plus shipping. Dirck Meengs of Thousand 
Oaks says the Vermont Country Store, P.O. Box 3000, Manchester Center, Vt. 
05255-3000, has stocked that wringer.

It's always nice to get a peek at what might be hot in tomorrow's collectible 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Here are six areas where would-be collectors might get in on the ground floor. 
They were compiled by Ada Fitzsimmons, editor of the Paper Pile Quarterly (Box 
337, San Anselmo, Calif. 94950), in the publication's January issue. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Video post cards. These are videocassettes that, typically, might show 
scenes from a particular area of the country. They also have been used as 
family holiday greetings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Electronic room keys. They are becoming more and more popular with hotels 
in an effort to protect guests from intruders. The cards, given away free, 
usually carry an advertising message and can be easily stored and displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- T-shirts. They have become increasingly popular in the last decade as an 
advertising vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Smoking items. They could become more scarce -- and, hence, more 
collectible -- in future years as the government steps up its campaign about 
the health hazards of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nutrition items. The range of collectibles has picked up steam as the trend 
continues toward eating more nutritious foods. Cookbooks, food advertisements 
and menus all fit into this category. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Savings and loan advertising giveaways. Despite much-publicized problems, 
the industry has greatly expanded in recent years, sparking a burst of 
advertising premiums ripe for collecting. Included would be pens, banks, cups, 
calendars and local history booklets. 
</P>
<P>
For collectors of early Western documents, letters, maps, photos and the like, 
there's a free catalogue available from American West Archives, P.O. Box 100, 
Cedar City, Utah 84720; telephone (801) 586-9497. 
</P>
<P>
"The interest in rare and historical documents associated with early Western 
history has really jumped in recent years," writes American West's Warren 
Anderson. "Up until the early 1980s, this specific collecting field was 
overlooked and undervalued, but that has all changed today, especially with the 
rarer pieces and autographed pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel E. Fast of Santa Monica says he "would like to communicate with other 
collectors of pieces by Sascha Brastoff, a designer active in Southern 
California since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"He and his studio created many, many pieces in ceramic and enamel, all 
hand-decorated in multiple motifs. They were distributed through his shop on 
Olympic Boulevard in West Los Angeles and on 26th Street in Santa Monica, as 
well as nationally." 
</P>
<P>
Fast's address is 2901 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 305, Santa Monica, Calif. 90403.

POLITICAL GIMMICKRY DISTORTS UPDATED 'FIDELIO' IN SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
Remember Beethoven's "Fidelio"? 
</P>
<P>
It used to be a noble Romantic opera predicated on daring expressive contrasts. 
It dealt with basics: good versus evil, freedom versus oppression, lyricism 
versus drama, Singspiel intimacy versus heroic grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
Forget all that. 
</P>
<P>
In staging Beethoven's daunting masterpiece for the first time, the San Diego 
Opera has refused to leave lofty enough alone. Seeking novelty for its own sour 
sake and fiercely courting -- here comes that awful noun -- relevance, the 
company has joined the ranks of the modish gimmick mongers. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Campbell has led his conservative operatic band down the road of 
trendiness. It is unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has seen Peter Sellars' "Tannhauser" or Patrice Chereau's "Ring" or 
Harry Kupfer's "Fliegende Hollander" or Christopher Alden's "Coronation of 
Poppea" knows that a sensitive and imaginative director need not regard the 
original libretto as gospel. Narrative and stylistic liberties are always 
permissible, even desirable, so long as the innovations shed new light on the 
emotive design, and so long as the innovator respects the dynamic structure of 
the music. 
</P>
<P>
As designed for the Houston Opera by Neil Peter Jampolis and, most crucial, 
restaged for San Diego by Robert Tannenbaum, "Fidelio" now takes place in a 
shady, chain-link prison in some ominous banana republic. The program magazine 
calls the locale "a Central American nation governed by a military regime." 
</P>
<P>
This certainly looks and smells like Nicaragua, even if it doesn't sound like 
Nicaragua. It still sounds like Beethoven. There's the first of many rubs. 
</P>
<P>
Everything here is relentlessly grim. The cozy little domestic drama of 
Marzelline and her suitor gets the same sleazy treatment as the sacrificial 
rhetoric of Leonore and the timeless pathos of the prisoners. Good-natured 
Rocco is not above accepting bribes to the tune of his "Gold" aria while a 
distinctly drab and put-upon Marzelline, anything but your ordinary 
garden-variety soubrette, looks the other way. 
</P>
<P>
The arch-villain Pizzaro -- there can be no Dons here -- becomes just the 
sadistic bureaucrat next door. He arrives in a jeep. 
</P>
<P>
The erstwhile deus ex machina, Fernando, becomes just another soap-box politico 
with a retinue of double-breasted advisers. His machina happens to be a long 
black limousine, and it inspires entrance applause. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys in this confused jumble of 
anti-theatrical images and mock-moralistic impulses. The fearless Leonore and 
her beloved Florestan are identified as "freedom fighters," a debatable 
euphemism that Ronald Reagan applied to the controversial Contras. The 
liberating conquerors are stuffy Americans who hand out little flags to be 
waved by the unwashed masses. 
</P>
<P>
The potentially uplifting denouement -- an affirmation of universal brotherhood 
-- actually inspires laughter. Something is very wrong here. 
</P>
<P>
One has to assume that the director intended to impose some elements of black 
humor and topical irony. It is an interesting idea. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, nothing in the music supports such anti-poetic license. This 
abscheulich outrage is imposed at the expense of Beethoven, and at the expense 
of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The grotesque theatrics -- especially callous in the finale -- prove doubly 
painful because the musical standards remain surprisingly high. Edward Downes 
(the British maestro, not the Met quizmaster) enforces eloquent brio with a 
dedicated cast and a rather sloppy orchestra. He also has the good sense to 
resist interpolating the third "Leonore" overture, which invariably overpowers 
whatever music follows. 
</P>
<P>
Sabine Hass, the intended Leonore, reportedly fell victim to the flu on 
Tuesday. Luckily, Elizabeth Connell happened to be vacationing in San Diego, 
and at very short notice Campbell persuaded this internationally celebrated 
soprano to fill Hass' cross-dressed trench coat. She did so with generous 
authority, luminous tone and melismatic ease, all of which compensated for 
rather self-conscious delivery of the carefully edited German dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
At the climax of the dungeon scene, incidentally, Connell appropriated Anja 
Silja's famous old trick of doffing her cap to suddenly reveal Fidelio's true, 
feminine disposition. The impact of the cascading locks was compromised, alas, 
by the realization that her husband, Florestan, had even longer hair. 
</P>
<P>
As Florestan, a Scottish quasi-Heldentenor named Graeme Matheson-Bruce sang 
with arresting freshness and a nice metallic ring. Unlike many a more famous 
colleague, he did not flinch from the high tessitura of his treacherous aria. 
He did encounter a few problems, however, involving sagging pitch and unvaried 
decibels. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Joy Langton was the endearing, tiny-voiced Marzelline, Randall Outland 
her grubby, inaudible Jaquino. Arthur Korn brought gutsy paternal fervor to the 
contradictory platitudes of Rocco. Tom Fox struggled manfully with the nasty 
rhetoric of Pizzaro, and earned approving boos for his efforts. As Fernando, 
Harry Dworchak did his best to reconcile the sight of a sleazy U.S. statesman 
with the sound of a bel-canto basso. 
</P>
<P>
The chorus, trained by Martin Wright, mustered considerable poignancy for the 
prisoners' apostrophe to sunlight but lacked conviction in the ultimate ode to 
joy. Given the bizarre staging concept, that couldn't be too surprising.

CONDUCTOR FINDS PERESTROIKA PLAYS WELL FOR CAREER 
</P>

<P>
Soviet conductor Vassili Sinaisky may be forgiven if his composure appears 
slightly ruffled. Just two weeks ago, he was alerted that he would be making 
his American debut with the San Diego Symphony, taking the place of the ailing 
Valery Gergiev. Then, a week ago, he learned that he had been appointed the new 
music director of one of Moscow's two State Symphony Orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, his first full day in America, the 41-year-old conductor gave up 
most of an already-brief lunch hour sandwiched between two long rehearsals for 
an interview. In the role of interpreterr was San Diego Symphony concertmaster 
Igor Gruppman, a Russian emigre several years Sinaisky's junior who will be 
playing the solo in Glazunov's Violin Concerto tonight under Sinaisky's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
The two musicians attended the same music conservatory in Leningrad, where each 
met his future wife, so, although they had met only the evening before at the 
airport, they displayed the camaraderie of two old friends at a reunion. 
</P>
<P>
For Sinaisky, the salutary breezes of perestroika have brought him back from 
musical exile in Latvia and put his career back on the fast track. 
</P>
<P>
"After 12 years of being the music director of the Latvian Radio and Television 
Symphony in Riga, Latvia, it meant I was given a chance to assume a post with 
the Bolshoi Opera. And now I have my own orchestra. I can breathe now!" 
Sinaisky said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before perestroika, the music that was performed was only by party composers 
and people in power, people approved by the composers' union," he said. "Now 
that censorship does not exist at all, and we can perform a broad spectrum of 
music. Ultramodern pieces -- even electronic music -- are being performed, 
although not necessarily of the highest quality." 
</P>
<P>
Although contemporary Western music has not yet achieved the status of American 
jazz and blue jeans, it is the newest fad in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Only 10 days ago, Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Requiem' was played in Moscow by the 
State Symphony Orchestra," Sinaisky said. "Over the last five years, the 
government's planning committees have begun to promote contemporary Soviet and 
Western music on a large scale. There have several new festivals devoted 
exclusively to contemporary music. Last year one took place in Leningrad. They 
performed some 300 contemporary works in two weeks!" 
</P>
<P>
As with most of the changes in contemporary Soviet life, Mikhail Gorbachev has 
been the catalyst for music's renewed importance. According to Sinaisky, after 
the Soviet leader visited the finals of the most recent Tchaikovsky 
Competition, his subordinates became converted to regular concert-goers. 
</P>
<P>
"That set the pace," Sinaisky said. "Now it is very fashionable for Soviet 
leaders to come to the concert and invite visiting officials from other 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
When then-President Reagan met with Gorbachev in Moscow, Sinaisky was on the 
podium the night the two world leaders attended the symphony at the Bolshoi 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Sinaisky said he has heard of both the upcoming San Diego Soviet Arts Festival 
and Seattle's 1990 Soviet festival. Since he has just achieved the status of a 
Soviet conductor with an international agent, he has not been approached to 
perform at either. 
</P>
<P>
"Any Soviet conductor would be happy to participate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's San Diego Symphony concert of Borodin's Overture to "Prince Igor," 
Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony and the Glazunov Violin Concert marks Sinaisky's 
American debut. However, he has performed in this hemisphere before. In the 
late 1970s, he conducted several times in Cuba. His recollections about that 
experience, however, had more to do with climate than with musical 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in Havana, and it was very hot. I was conducting a Brahms symphony, 
and the heat was 102 degrees . . . . Although the whole orchestra was allowed 
to take their jackets off, I had to keep tails on for the whole concert." 
</P>
<P>
The first big break in Sinaisky's career came in 1973, when he won first prize 
in the Herbert von Karajan International Conducting Competition, the first 
Soviet conductor to win that prize. In spite of the professional importance of 
the award, Sinaisky remains cautious about competitions when it comes to his 
15-year-old son, a budding pianist. When asked if his son is preparing for the 
next Tchaikovsky Competition, Sinaisky said, "No, not yet," and stressed that 
he and his wife are trying not to apply undue pressure.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: SILKEN STYLE ON IVORIES WEARS WELL FOR 
FLANAGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are jazz pianists who make an immediate impression with their aggressive, 
personal styles, and those who touch you in more subtle ways. McCoy Tyner, with 
his percussive attack, and the often abstract explorations of Cecil Taylor fall 
in the first category. In the second are players like the silky smooth Oscar 
Peterson and the understated Tommy Flanagan, who opens a two-week run at 
Elario's next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan's San Diego appearances seem even more interesting because of the 
other players; George Mraz, who usually backs Flanagan on bass, canceled due to 
illness, but bass man Charlie Haden, just finishing his own dates at Elario's, 
has volunteered to stay on with drummer Lawrence Marable to play behind 
Flanagan. 
</P>
<P>
Since Haden and Flanagan have never worked together before, the combination 
promises some spontaneous moments. Flanagan, though, made it clear who's the 
main attraction. He doesn't expect the change in musicians to affect his sets 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm gonna play what I usually play," he said by phone from his home in New 
York, as his wife and manager Diana listened in, occasionally adding 
information. "I expect we'll get along and have a good time doing it. I like 
Lawrence. I worked with him the last time I was out there." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan, whose long career has included time with masters such as Kenny 
Burrell, John Coltrane and Elvin Jones, leans heavily toward the classic songs 
of mainstream jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing the same composers I've always played," Flanagan said. "Thad 
Jones, Tadd Dameron. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie," his wife added. "Thelonious Monk, Bud 
Powell, George Gershwin. He has a very extensive repertoire. He won't repeat 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan, a strong composer in his own right, has been too busy to write new 
music lately, his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
Though the songs remain largely the same, Flanagan believes his playing 
continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has matured," he said. "If you compare the version of 'Chelsea 
Bridge' I did in 1957 with the one from 1974, I knew the song better 20 years 
later. I think you can hear that. There's more meaning, more feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan's last record was recorded at the Village Vanguard in New York two 
years ago. A new album with Mraz and drummer Kenny Washington is due out in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
As for the younger generation, Flanagan said he is not jazzed with many of the 
new crop of musicians. Pianist Mulgrew Miller is the only one who's impressed 
him lately. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan's career has included roughly 250 albums as a sideman and 25 as a 
leader, and through it all, he's remained faithful to straight-ahead jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether we'll ever hear him play a synthesizer, he laughed. "No, you 
certainly won't." 
</P>
<P>
At 2 p.m. every Sunday, 75-year-old trumpeter John Best, who has played with 
Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman, holds forth with clarinetist Bobby 
Gordon at Jazz Mine Records and CDs in La Jolla. Though Best is 
wheelchair-bound, his playing is far from handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
"He has chops that won't quit," said Jazz Mine owner Walt Friederang. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, a well-known Dixieland player featured for years at Eddie Condon's in 
New York, can be heard on a new album with the Hal Smith Trio. Besides the 
Sunday jams, Friederang presents occasional shows on Mondays and Tuesdays. A 
quartet featuring sax men Rod Cradit and Gary LeFebvre, with Gunner Biggs on 
bass and Jim Plank on drums, will be featured Feb. 21 at 8 p.m. The four San 
Diegans will play the music of sax legend Gerry Mulligan. Friederang's store 
features rare jazz albums, including some of the 3,000 he was given by a former 
owner of KJAZ, the Bay Area radio station. Developers hope to replace the Jazz 
Mine with shops and condos, but until then, it is one of San Diego's last 
bastions for pure jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles public television viewers will enjoy shows on Duke Ellington and 
Art Blakey Feb. 17, but the programs aren't scheduled for viewing that night on 
KPBS, San Diego's public TV station, which will, as usual, be airing a 
Metropolitan Opera performance. A KPBS official said San Diego jazz fans aren't 
getting shorted. The Ellington show aired last summer and will play again in 
the next few months. The newer program on Blakey will also be shown in the 
coming months. KCET in Los Angeles simply arranged to show it before it was fed 
to the rest of the public TV network. 
</P>
<P>
SHORT RIFFS: Vic's in La Jolla features sax man Joe Marillo Mondays through 
Fridays, 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., and the Aubrey Fay Band Friday and Saturday nights 
starting at 9, through February . . . Internationally known jazz critic Stanley 
Dance, who lives in Vista, presents the fourth in the five-part jazz history 
lecture series at the Athenaeum in La Jolla at 7 p.m., Feb. 20. Dance, who 
collaborated with the late Duke Ellington on the master's autobiography, will 
illustrate Ellington's musical career with some of his best records. Admission 
is $11, or $9 for Athenaeum members. . . . Meanwhile, Dance's wife, Helen, who 
produced some of Ellington's albums, is writing the memoirs of her life in the 
jazz world for Smithsonian Institution Press. . . . The San Diego Jazz 
Festival's Outreach Program begins Saturday night with concerts at 8 and 10 at 
the Educational Cultural Complex by Jimmy and Jeannie Cheatham. . . . KIFM 
hosts Tania Maria at the Bacchanal Sunday night at 8:30. . . . Lori Bell and 
Flight 7 are the only local jazz musicians included on KIFM's February play 
list. . . . Drummer Art Blakey put on a great show Sunday during a rare San 
Diego appearance at the Bacchanal and a lot of people who should have been 
there weren't. Promoter Rob Hagey said he sold only about half of the 550 
tickets printed and took a loss on the show.

VIOLIN RECITAL BY LEONIDAS KAVAKOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALBERT GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reviewers tend to toss around too casually such a comprehensive term as 
virtuoso. It has become a catch-all cliche that no longer specifies anything in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the only word that immediately comes to mind in describing Leonidas 
Kavakos, a boyish-looking, 22-year-old, Athens-born violinist who gave a 
recital on the Gold Medal series at Ambassador Auditorium Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Kavakos has technique to burn. In a program mainly devoted to pyrotechnics, 
Kavakos proved himself the easy master of every style of playing from Tartini 
and Paganini to Ysaye and Ravel. 
</P>
<P>
Kavakos is a prodigious master of his instrument, and within the limits his 
program set he offered a sensitive musical profile. He could not very well 
plumb interpretive depth in such mannerly pieces as Schubert's Fantasy in C, or 
in Eugene Ysaye's unaccompanied Sonata No. 5, Opus 27. There were no soaring 
lyrical flights but there was never less than a quietly urgent soulfulness that 
is the violin's birthright. 
</P>
<P>
By way of novelty, and stressing his enterprise, Kavakos played 12 Caprices for 
solo violin by Earl Kim that did not break any new compositional paths, but 
that skillfully explored the violin's capacity for unorthodox sound. 
</P>
<P>
When Kavakos closed his printed list with Ravel's "Tzigane," it was instantly 
apparent that he commands every shade of modern color, and when he added 
Kreisler's "Libesleid" among the encores it was instantly recognizable that he 
distinguishes between sentiment and sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
His tone did not suggest lushness or over-ripeness; it was rather a tasteful 
blend of reticence and innate musicality. For so young a performer, his arsenal 
of violinistic tricks and turns seemed complete and invariably reliable. Keep 
an eye on this exceptional talent. 
</P>
<P>
Also remember the name of Anne Epperson, who played the piano parts with the 
smoothest and most fluent technique and constantly produced shades of pianistic 
color that skillfully matched the effects of the violinist. Epperson appears to 
belong in the same exceptional category as Kavakos. ALBERT GOLDBERG

When Glenn Silber was told in December that the small, private school his 
preschooler had been attending for six months was in danger of going under, his 
first thought was to pull his son out.

<P>
Then Silber and other parents like him thought again. Instead of walking away 
from Los Feliz Hills School, a nonprofit school that had been without a 
director for months, they decided to try to save it. 
</P>
<P>
Silber's wife, Claudia, took over the business office. Another parent, Mary 
Louise Grady, became the receptionist. Last week, Glenn Silber joined the 
school's board of directors, and four more parents have applied. If they are 
accepted, the board will expand to 11 members. And parents have spent the last 
few Sundays refurbishing school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The parents say the school of 181 children, ages 2 to 18, is worth saving. The 
classes are small, the teachers are bright and committed, and the campus, whose 
futuristic buildings were designed by Los Angeles architect John Lautner in 
1960, is an oasis of greenery on 6.4 acres in the midst of the urban landscape, 
the parents say. 
</P>
<P>
But as the parents sift through piles of poorly organized bank statements and 
enrollment statistics, they are encountering obstacles that might give even 
experienced administrators pause. There are enormous debts to be paid and basic 
classroom equipment to be bought, they say. And while the school is staffed 
with experienced teachers, the absence of a director for a short but crucial 
four-month period left it lacking direction. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no center, no lightning rod for the school in recent years," 
said Christopher Geissmann, who took over as director of the school a few weeks 
ago. "Teachers had a vague idea that they wanted a caring, friendly atmosphere 
with a minimum of rules, no uniforms, that sort of thing. But what was missing 
was a sense of clarity, of how all this related to some larger goal." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Feliz Hills School has had four names and five directors since its 
founding in 1960. It has been variously an alternative school that taught the 
children of liberal-minded celebrities, a short-lived cooperative, a school 
closely affiliated with the nearby Church of Scientology and most recently a 
school with a dynamic director who built a strong teaching staff but ignored 
the school's worsening financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Today the school owes more than $117,000 in mortgage payments and is running a 
deficit of $14,000 to $20,000 a month. Enrollment, once at 335, has dropped 40 
students lower than what is needed to break even. The heating does not work, 
some of the buildings are in disrepair and the school on a bluff at the end of 
Russell Avenue is so low-profile that most people do not know it is there. 
</P>
<P>
Still, parents of children at the school -- for the most part young couples 
successful enough to afford tuition payments ranging from $2,600 to $4,410 a 
year -- say there is something special about the place. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a community, and there's this love that people have for the school and 
for one another that makes us want to keep the school going," said Christie 
Davis, who heads the school's newly formed Parents Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chance to Survive 
</P>
<P>
Because they believe in the school, parents say, they are working hard to give 
it a chance to survive. 
</P>
<P>
In December, they raised more than $70,000 among themselves in the school's 
first-ever fund drive. Last month, they formed a committee to recruit students, 
and a group of parents met with some of the creditors who have been demanding 
for months to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
They worked out a plan with the creditors to gain more time to pay off the 
school's loans. A parent who works as a graphic artist is designing a new logo 
for the school. Another is writing a new brochure. Next week, the school will 
hold an open house. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disaster, but we're going to survive," Silber said. "I feel that with 
all the energy I would expend trying to find an adequate preschool, I might as 
well expend it making sure this one is running correctly. I mean, what the 
hell, I'm not the type to roll over, and where else is my kid going to go?" 
</P>
<P>
The school is one of the few in the country catering to such a wide age range, 
Geissmann said. Its campus consists of 14 buildings and several playing fields 
framed by Los Feliz's graceful Shakespeare Bridge. It has about 52 students in 
its preschool classes, 72 in its elementary school and 57 in grades nine 
through 12. Every student in last year's graduating class went on to college, 
Geissmann said -- some to Stanford University, Cornell University, Occidental 
College and UC Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
"The place is refreshingly reminiscent of a mission because there is a sense of 
missionary zeal and fervor among the teachers and the students," said Thomas C. 
Hudnut, headmaster of the prestigious Harvard School in North Hollywood. 
"People were really excited about working together. I think that although there 
are things that require attention, the future is generally bright for Los Feliz 
Hills." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experiential Education 
</P>
<P>
In its various incarnations, the school has had a reputation for practicing 
what is called experiential education -- the philosophy that children of all 
ages learn best by doing. 
</P>
<P>
Experiential classes are less structured than traditional class settings, with 
children learning geometry, for example, by measuring buildings and working out 
theorems from what they have observed. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in the 1960s as the Midtown School, the nonprofit school was a small 
but thriving alternative institution known as a place where Hollywood 
celebrities sent their children. Jane Fonda sent her children there, so did 
Mama Cass of the Mamas and the Papas. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Bishop took over the school in 1974 and, under her tenure, it became 
affiliated with the Church of Scientology. The association afforded Bishop a 
ready pool of students -- the children of people affiliated with Scientology 
founder L. Ron Hubbard's movement. But when Bishop and the church parted 
company 10 years later, enrollment sank from 335 students to 74 as 
Scientologists pulled their children out. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop, a Scientologist, had changed the school's name to the Apple School, 
hired teachers who were also Scientologists and used educational principles 
developed by Hubbard and codified in a manual he wrote called the "Basic Study 
Manual." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with two Times reporters several years ago, Bishop said she 
paid the church for the use of Hubbard's teaching methods, eventually handing 
over 15% of the school's revenues to the Church of Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop told The Times that she began in 1979 to believe that the fees she was 
paying to the church were exorbitant. She stopped paying the fees but continued 
to use Hubbard's techniques. In 1983, according to Bishop and to an internal 
church memorandum, church officials began to demand money from the school 
again, threatening to charge Bishop with copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stigma Noted 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Bishop left the school, and the teachers she hired left with her. 
Parents and teachers say the school has been stigmatized with the Scientology 
image ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"The unfairness is that if we had stayed a Scientology school, we wouldn't be 
having all these troubles," said teacher Stevie Gere. "We ran off the 
Scientologists. We stood up to them and still people think we're closet 
Scientologists or something. It makes my blood boil." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, with enrollment down to 132 students, the school's board of directors 
hired as headmaster Mike D'Ornellas, a veteran educator who had worked as a 
teacher and administrator at schools and colleges throughout Southern 
California. D'Ornellas said in a recent interview that he was tired of the 
public school bureaucracy and excited about the chance to make his mark at a 
small, private school. 
</P>
<P>
Working 12-hour days, D'Ornellas began to turn the place around. He fired 18 of 
the school's 19 teachers and hired a staff of 26 new ones. To attract quality 
educators, he raised salaries and added full medical benefits. He hired an 
educational consultant to revamp the curriculum, ridding it of its last 
vestiges of Scientology teachings. He worked nights and weekends, gaining the 
trust and affection of students and parents alike. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, D'Ornellas won for the school a measure of legitimacy that it 
never had before -- accreditation from the Western Assn. of Schools and 
Colleges, one of six regional accrediting bodies in the nation recognized by 
the U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
D'Ornellas' efforts seemed to be paying off. The school's teacher-student ratio 
dropped from one teacher for every 13 students to one for every eight. 
Enrollment climbed to 220 students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'On the Right Track' 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's presence seemed to verify that everything was on the right track," said 
Bill Taylor, president of the school's board of directors. "He was very popular 
with the staff, and he was able to develop confidence among the students. His 
strong personality calmed the troubled waters that we had among our parents." 
</P>
<P>
But the new school D'Ornellas was creating cost money, and debts mounted fast. 
Last spring, D'Ornellas was diagnosed with bladder cancer and began slowing 
down and taking time off. 
</P>
<P>
"I manage more by personality than by policy, and as long as I was there, we 
had a positive program," D'Ornellas said. "When I wasn't there, the things that 
needed to be done didn't get done. I feel like I failed there, like I bailed 
out on the school.' 
</P>
<P>
In October, when D'Ornellas' cancer spread to his lymphatic system, he took a 
leave of absence. The board of directors was left to sort through its financial 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not professional educators or professional businessmen. We just got 
involved because we wanted to," Taylor said. "We knew that we had to go out and 
hire professional consultants or something, but none of us knew how to do that 
because we're mostly just concerned parents." 
</P>
<P>
The school operated without a director from October through the end of January, 
with the board confronting administrative problems it had always left to the 
director. To cut costs, the board trimmed faculty and limited school supplies. 
Board members also interviewed applicants to take D'Ornellas' place. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last month, Geissmann took over. A graduate of Harvard and Yale, 
Phillips Academy and the Trinity School in New York, Geissmann is in the habit 
of quoting Nietzsche and Socrates in the same sentence and prefers the title 
headmaster to that of director. He said he wants to make the school more 
intellectually rigorous, a place where children can read and discuss books 
together in a tranquil, unpressured environment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Critical Thinking' 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see the children here develop a kind of critical thinking, in the 
sense of questioning, so they're not thrown by controversy or conflict," 
Geissmann said. "For that I think, you have to be intellectually exciting and 
intense, but at the same time create a sense of tradition. We're still in the 
embryonic stage now." 
</P>
<P>
Geissmann, however, is an educator, not a businessman. And it is unclear who 
will take full-time responsibility to get the school out of financial jeopardy. 
But parents say they are not ready to give up. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain element of dream involved. There's a dream that the school 
can survive, can become healthy, can become known for a very strong academic 
program that can serve this community," Taylor said. "It's a chance to build 
something, so you seize it, and you just refuse to let go."

RED TAPE PUTS THE FERN DELL PROJECT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A project to restore the deteriorating Fern Dell area of Griffith Park has made 
little progress in almost a year, stymied by the city's own building code and a 
conflict between engineering and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
At an upbeat ground breaking in April, city officials said the vandal-ravaged 
canyon of streams, foot bridges and densely planted ferns would be restored to 
its former beauty in 120 days. A contractor reported to work almost 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
But the work was soon halted when the contractor learned that there were no 
building permits for the job. 
</P>
<P>
It took six months to get the permits. 
</P>
<P>
Then the first substantial sign of progress -- a row of fence posts installed 
in October -- set off such a dispute that the project stopped again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an interesting job," said Richard Humphrey, vice president of 
Hacienda Landscape of Walnut, the city's contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey said he thinks that the problems are solved and expects to complete 
the job next month. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are also optimistic, but concede that the solution may involve 
more money and could require more time. 
</P>
<P>
The troubles in the $389,000 renovation began almost the day after the April 20 
ground breaking. Hacienda employees began excavation to pour concrete footings 
for 14 metal bridges that were being bought from a Minnesota firm to replace 
the badly dilapidated original wooden bridges over the dell's streams. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey said the first problem was that water from the streams filled in the 
holes they had dug. Then a city building inspector asked for permits. There 
were none. 
</P>
<P>
The inspector not only wanted permits for the footings but required separate 
permits for the bridges. Neither request turned out to be simple to fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
The Building and Safety Department demanded a thorough structural analysis of 
the bridges and, in addition, proof that the welders who would assemble them 
were properly certified. 
</P>
<P>
"That threw us for a loop," said Richard Klink, project manager for the 
Department of Recreation and Parks. "The whole thing ended up taking around six 
months." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Klink said, "we had a little snag on the footings." 
</P>
<P>
The building inspector decided that an individual structural analysis was 
necessary for each footing because many were being placed closer to the water 
than allowed by code. 
</P>
<P>
"They're afraid the water will erode under the footings," causing them to fail, 
Klink said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has retained a private structural engineer to review the 28 footings, 
two for each bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Klink said that the reports on two bridges are done and that work can resume if 
the added cost is less than $5,000 each, the limit of cost overruns he can 
approve without consulting the Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
He was less hopeful that the problem with the fence can be cleared up for under 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the fence posts run along the surface of an asphalt walkway 
instead of beside it. 
</P>
<P>
Klink said department engineers decided to put the posts there because it would 
have been too difficult to set them properly into the rubble that forms the 
edge of the walkway. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, however, did not work for Friends of Fern Dell, an advocacy group 
that lobbied successfully for the state bond money that is paying for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Smith, spokeswoman for the group, said the reason for the fence was to 
discourage people on the walkway from trampling the ferns. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller part of the walkway inside the fence would merely draw people in, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
After deliberation, the city concurred and is awaiting an estimate on resetting 
the fence posts. The engineering has yet to be worked out, Klink said. 
</P>
<P>
When it is, commission approval will probably be required to pay for it, he 
said.

RECALL NOTICES TARGET ENTIRE CITY COUNCIL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some city officials are facetiously calling it the St. Valentine's Day 
Massacre. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that was not entirely unexpected, each of the five City Council 
members was served Tuesday night with notice that political foes have launched 
separate campaigns to oust them in a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
The required notification came at the end of an otherwise calm council meeting. 
But several council members said they suspected that it had been planned over 
several weeks and orchestrated to fall on a day traditionally reserved for 
displaying affection. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit me like a ton of bricks," said Councilman Donald E. Schultze. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday's development is only the latest in what has been a series of 
controversies that have pitted council members against each other and various 
foes. The officials have bitterly feuded recently over city finances, a bid to 
convert the Elks Club quarters into a large-scale bingo parlor and the recent 
Community Redevelopment Agency purchase of a vacant plot on Carson Street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accusations Exchanged 
</P>
<P>
In fact, several council members accused each other of being behind the recall 
efforts that began Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The scene unfolded as the council was hearing testimony on an unrelated issue, 
Mayor Kathleen M. Navejas said. An unidentified woman suddenly walked up to the 
council table and handed Navejas, Mayor Pro Tem Rosalie M. Sher and Councilman 
Venn Furgeson written notices announcing that they are to be the targets of a 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
After the council took a five-minute recess to read the notices, Public Safety 
Commissioner Art Perez -- in apparent retaliation -- presented similar 
hand-written notices to Councilman Schultze and Councilwoman H.M. (Lennie) 
Wagner. Perez is a close friend of Navejas. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Wednesday morning that they were having trouble locating 
the notices and could not immediately identify the woman who served Navejas, 
Sher and Furgeson. 
</P>
<P>
The petitioners have seven days to certify their intent to recall the council 
members. After that, they have 60 days to draft a petition and collect at least 
850 signatures against each council member, City Clerk Carol Dorfmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
But until an official notice of intent to recall is filed with her, Dorfmeyer 
said, "I don't assume that any recall is under way." 
</P>
<P>
Sher called the recall flap ridiculous and frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
"The recall never was intended to be used in this manner (for) a personal 
vendetta for no reason," Sher said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Good for City' 
</P>
<P>
The council's continuous squabbling, she complained, is divisive and not good 
for the city's image. "It damages creditability with each other. It damages 
creditability with the people out there. . . . We have important matters to 
take care of. It hinders our effectiveness. If you have malfeasance in office 
it's one thing. This is not the case." 
</P>
<P>
Sher, along with other council members, predicted that the recall attempts 
would not succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Furgeson dismissed the recall attempt against him, saying, "They may not even 
get enough signatures so why worry about them." 
</P>
<P>
He called the recall "a lot of wasted energy." Other people have tried recalls 
against other council members and failed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Sher and Furgeson said they are not part of the recall attempt against 
Schultze and Wagner, even though they have had sharp disagreements over city 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was done by somebody from the outside to divide us," Schultze said, 
denying that he was behind any of the recall efforts. He suggested that former 
council member Richard Vineyard, who has announced that he will seek election 
next year, may be behind the recall effort of Navejas, Sher, Furgeson. 
</P>
<P>
Navejas and Schultze have been political foes since the city discovered it was 
experiencing severe financial problems last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Vineyard, who has also often feuded with Navejas in recent years, denied 
Wednesday that he had anything to do with the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It would not be to my advantage," Vineyard said. 
</P>
<P>
Vineyard was the target of a recall effort little more than two years ago. The 
leaders of the movement failed to garner enough signatures.

SIDEWALK GUN SALE WORRIES PASADENA; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS DON'T WANT CITY TO BECOME HUB FOR ASSAULT RIFLES BANNED IN L.A.

<P>
City directors have asked City Atty. Victor Kaleta to investigate what steps 
the city can take to avoid becoming a major distribution point for 
semiautomatic weapons banned in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Kaleta said he will look into "a sidewalk sale" of assault rifles held by a Los 
Angeles gun store in Pasadena last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The rifles were put on sale Saturday outside C &amp; J Arms on Foothill 
Boulevard by Gun Heaven, a Los Angeles store. Telephone callers to Gun Heaven 
heard a recorded message advising them to attend Pasadena's "blow-out sale on 
assault rifles." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Callers Advised 
</P>
<P>
John Butler, owner of C &amp; J Arms, said his company's role was "like a 
distributor," but he declined to discuss the circumstances of the sale or say 
how many rifles had been sold. The recorded message at Gun Heaven on Wednesday 
advised callers to go to Pasadena for assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Director Rick Cole said he generally opposes gun control at the municipal level 
but does not want Pasadena to become "the Hong Kong free-market outlet for 
these assault weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief James Robenson agreed, saying gun legislation should be enacted at 
the state level. "Passing a local ordinance is OK," he said, "but it's just 
kind of pushing the gun dealers from one community to another." 
</P>
<P>
Robenson said police are trying to determine whether any city laws were 
violated by the sidewalk gun sale. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has banned the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons, and 
the county is considering a ban in unincorporated areas. Other cities, such as 
Bellflower and Compton, either have enacted bans or are considering them. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said it doesn't make much sense for cities to take on what should be a 
state responsibility. Not only is it confusing when different rules apply in 
each city, he said, but a violation of municipal ordinances is only a 
misdemeanor. To make possession or sale of semiautomatic weapons a felony would 
require action by the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said that if Pasadena were left as one of the few outlets for 
semiautomatic weapons, it would be "a very wrong signal to give out" to the 
community. Thus, if the state does not act, he said, Pasadena might have to ban 
semiautomatic weapons on its own. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cole said he is not yet convinced that Pasadena is in any real danger 
of becoming a major outlet for assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Kaleta said he will prepare a report that will cover the sale of weapons in 
Pasadena, ordinances that have been enacted in other cities and the legal 
challenge to the Los Angeles ordinance filed in court by Colt Industries Inc., 
manufacturer of the AR-15 assault rifle. The company contends that the Los 
Angeles ordinance is unconstitutional because it intrudes into an area of 
regulation preempted by the state.

INJUNCTION HALTS WORK ON ALHAMBRA BILLBOARD

<P>
In a surprise move, the city last week obtained a temporary injunction halting 
construction of a 78-foot-high business sign just as workmen were about to 
begin installation. 
</P>
<P>
Until the city got the injunction late Friday afternoon, workers and city code 
enforcement officials were locked in a standoff at the site. 
</P>
<P>
The council had previously approved a zoning change allowing installation of 
the free-standing sign in a residential neighborhood, despite vehement 
opposition from nearby residents in both Alhambra and Monterey Park. Residents 
described the sign as a "monstrosity" and an "eyesore." 
</P>
<P>
The sign, planned for the corner of 6th Street and Ramona Road, sits near the 
border between the two cities. Supporting poles for the sign have already been 
put into place. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in emergency session last Thursday, the council decided to re-examine 
whether the sign qualifies for an exemption under the city's sign ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
David and Brad Perrin, who want to install the sign to advertise their Almansor 
Court restaurant, had announced earlier that they would eventually donate the 
sign to the city. City staff had concluded that since the city would eventually 
own the sign and the land it sits on, it could be exempt from height and other 
regulations. On the basis of that report, the City Council originally agreed to 
allow the sign to be installed. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant, completed in 1986 as part of a project of the redevelopment 
agency and Almansor Court Inc., is located on the municipal golf course off 
Mission Road, several miles north of the San Bernardino Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The city also filed a lawsuit Friday against Almansor Court Inc., contending 
that the proposed sign violates restrictions in the city's sign ordinance, said 
Assistant City Atty. Robert Wadden. A court hearing is scheduled Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resident Complained 
</P>
<P>
Workers arrived at the site at 8:30 a.m. Friday to begin installing the sign. 
</P>
<P>
Emmy Lou Creekmur, who lives directly across from the site, called city 
officials to complain. 
</P>
<P>
City code enforcement officials went to the site to ensure that the sign did 
not go up while other city officials went to Los Angeles Superior Court to seek 
the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Perrin, who would not comment on the city's action, eventually notified 
nine workers at the site that the city had obtained the retraining order. 
</P>
<P>
John Austin, a foreman for Carey Sign and Graphics of Anaheim, said the Perrins 
had informed him of the controversy so he was not surprised at the 
court-ordered delay. The Alhambra sign would be one of the largest double-faced 
signs in the country, Austin said. The sign is 50 by 20 feet and, once erected, 
78 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Healthy Size Sign' 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Swormstedt, publisher of Signs of the Times, a sign industry trade 
publication, said such a sign would not set a record, but added, "That's a 
healthy size sign, no question about it." 
</P>
<P>
Most large billboards in California range from 12 by 25 feet to 14 by 48 feet, 
said Stan Lancaster, chief of the state Department of Transportation's outdoor 
advertising branch. 
</P>
<P>
The Perrins are proposing to build another freeway sign in Montebello, 42 by 38 
feet, to advertise their Quiet Cannon restaurant there. 
</P>
<P>
Although pleased with the city's change-of-heart on the sign, residents at an 
Alhambra council meeting Tuesday said there are still questions they want 
answered about why the city initially approved the sign. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to know why it took until Feb. 10 for the City Council's outrage to 
reach a point that it finally acted," resident Jim Wenck said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close to Success 
</P>
<P>
Residents said they will not celebrate for fear they may be premature. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy about it," Clifford Chen said of the council's decision to oppose 
the sign. "We're only reserving our judgment." 
</P>
<P>
The residents had been close to success once before. Based on evidence they 
provided, a state Department of Transportation official notified the Perrin 
brothers Jan. 18 that a state permit for the sign had been issued by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
A land surveyor's report submitted by the residents group showed that the 
proposed site is not within 1,000 feet of a commercial use, as required by 
state law, according to a letter from Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
A supermarket on Hellman Avenue, which a state inspector had determined was 
within 1,000 feet of the sign site, is 1,022.80 feet away, according to the 
surveyor's report, Lancaster said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elation Short-Lived 
</P>
<P>
"They blew it," Lancaster said of his inspectors' initial measurement. 
</P>
<P>
Although construction work on the sign was halted, the residents' elation was 
short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
Early last week, after the Perrins argued that a preschool in Monterey Park 
qualified as a commercial use and was within 1,000 feet of the sign site, 
Caltrans granted them permission to install the sign. 
</P>
<P>
"When we realized that the sign would go up, we had to react," said 
Councilwoman Barbara Messina. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park City Atty. Stephanie Scher said she will be happy to work with 
Alhambra officials in their fight against the sign, which is also of concern to 
some Monterey Park residents.

GROUP FILES LAWSUIT TO HALT GRAND AVE. EXTENSION PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents opposing the extension of Grand Avenue from Chino Hills have tried 
lobbying officials and staging demonstrations in attempts to prevent or delay 
an influx of traffic into Diamond Bar. Now they are going to court. 
</P>
<P>
The Stop Grand Avenue Expressway Committee and five of its members filed suit 
this week against San Bernardino County, seeking an injunction blocking the 
opening of the extension, which is scheduled for late next month. The committee 
is one of two Diamond Bar citizens groups that oppose the extension because 
they believe it will create gridlock in their community. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Avenue now ends at the Los Angeles-San Bernardino county line. However, 
road crews are working rapidly in western San Bernardino County to link Grand 
Avenue with Chino Hills, a community where rapid growth and geographic 
isolation have caused serious traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed Tuesday in San Bernardino County Superior Court, alleges that 
San Bernardino County is to blame for much of Chino Hills' congestion. The 
plaintiffs argue that the county's construction of roads and other 
infrastructure improvements have failed to keep pace with residential 
development as required by the Chino Hills Specific Plan. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30% of the 26,000 homes planned for the Chino Hills are already in 
place, but only 10% of the roadwork envisioned in the Specific Plan to improve 
access to the area has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funnel Commuters 
</P>
<P>
Because of this lag in road construction, the plaintiffs argue, the extension 
of Grand Avenue would funnel thousands of Chino Hills commuters through Diamond 
Bar, which already has enough traffic woes of its own. The suit asks that the 
extension be delayed until other road projects to serve the area are completed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a tenfold increase in traffic because they decided to 
build one road instead of 10," said plaintiff Gary Lawson, founder of the Stop 
Grand Avenue Expressway Committee. "We don't want to be the scapegoat for the 
county of San Bernardino because (officials) didn't do their job." 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County Chief Deputy County Counsel Craig Jordan said his office 
had not been served with the suit and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Solid Ground' 
</P>
<P>
However, San Bernardino County Supervisor Larry Walker, who represents Chino 
Hills, said he has been advised by the county's lawyers that the extension 
project is not in danger. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been assured repeatedly that we're on solid legal ground in every aspect 
of it," Walker said. "The lawsuit may have the positive impact of clarifying 
the issue. There are a lot of clouds over the project. I think it will be a 
good thing to have those issues explained." 
</P>
<P>
Walker said he sees a contradiction in the suit's premise. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand they're saying (San Bernardino County officials) are bad 
because they didn't build the infrastructure, and on the other hand they're 
saying they want to stop an infrastructure project," he said. "I'll tell the 
judge, 'Yes, your honor, you're darned right we're behind in infrastructure. 
Grand Avenue is our first major step toward catching up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gary Miller, founder of the Concerned Citizens for Diamond Bar Traffic Control, 
a citizens committee that has competed with Lawson's group for the support of 
Diamond Bar residents, said he doubted that the lawsuit would be successful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Doesn't Make Sense' 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to go before a judge and say, 'We want Chino Hills to build 
roads, but not this road," Miller said. "I'm for anything that'll work. But 
this doesn't make any sense." 
</P>
<P>
Vivian T. Shallito, attorney for the Stop Grand Avenue Expressway Committee, 
said the suit rests on the county's violation of its own Specific Plan for 
Chino Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"They're straying from the Specific Plan that they worked long and hard on for 
the Chino Hills," Shallito said. "In the plan there were 10 roads to be built. 
Only two (including Grand Avenue) have been done. . . . They're actually 
amending (the plan) by default, and if you amend it you have to start the 
process all over again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two-Lane Road 
</P>
<P>
The suit argues that San Bernardino County is also violating the plan by 
opening Grand Avenue as a two-lane road instead of a four-lane expressway. The 
county is doing this, the suit alleges, as part of its efforts to open the road 
before March 7, when Diamond Bar voters decide whether their community should 
become a city. Some opponents of the extension believe that a Diamond Bar City 
Council would be more aggressive in trying to stop the project than Los Angeles 
County has been. 
</P>
<P>
"They have people working two shifts, seven days a week to get that road 
completed before we vote for cityhood," Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker sharply disagreed with this claim, saying that only a small portion of 
Grand Avenue will be two lanes when the road opens in late March. When 
construction is completed by April 28, the entire road will be four lanes wide 
with a raised median, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Schedule Accelerated 
</P>
<P>
Walker confirmed that the work schedule for construction of the road has been 
accelerated, but said this was to compensate for delays caused by recent rains, 
not to finish the project before Diamond Bar incorporates. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are virtually making stuff up," Walker said of the plaintiffs. 
"The fact that they're blatantly wrong on some basic facts may discredit them 
in their lawsuit. . . . These are people who have decided what happened and 
every fact that comes along that doesn't fit what they believe, they ignore 
it." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that Diamond Bar voters choose whether to become a city, they 
will also be able to elect the first City Council. With the campaign for five 
council seats heating up, some questioned whether the timing of filing the suit 
-- three weeks to the day before the election -- was coincidental. Three of the 
five individuals plaintiffs -- Lawson, Donna Rhode and Benjamin Quan -- are 
running for council seats. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this a lawsuit or publicity?" said Miller, who also is a candidate for the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Walker refused to comment on the plaintiffs' motives, but said: "The fact that 
Diamond Bar people want to use this for politics is not objectionable. When 
they distort the facts, that's objectionable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Slate 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, however, said the lawsuit was not politically motivated and that its 
timing was determined by the need to block the extension project before the 
road opens. But at a news conference Tuesday announcing the filing, the 
plaintiffs urged that voters elect Lawson, Rhode and Quan as a council slate to 
protect Diamond Bar from Chino Hills traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum has not seen the lawsuit and will 
not comment until he has read the complaint, said Judy Hammond, the 
supervisor's press deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum and Walker met Tuesday, but were unable to reach agreement on Grand 
Avenue. Schabarum insisted that mitigation measures such as other roads serving 
Chino Hills be completed before the road opens. Walker argued that Chino Hills 
residents need the road opened as soon as possible, Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of Diamond Bar cityhood complicates the controversy. Schabarum has 
been advised that the county's jurisdiction over Diamond Bar would end 
immediately if voters choose cityhood on March 7, Hammond said. What remains 
unclear is whether Los Angeles County could continue to insist upon mitigation 
measures after jurisdiction over the area changes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he believes Schabarum will not permit the road to open before San 
Bernardino takes steps to alleviate the influx of Chino Hills traffic into 
Diamond Bar. Lawson said his group wants the new City Council, if there is one, 
not Los Angeles County, to negotiate with San Bernardino County,. 
</P>
<P>
"The county of San Bernardino is not complying with the Chino Hills Specific 
Plan, and the county of Los Angeles is sitting idly by," Lawson said. "Two 
county governments are playing God and the people of Diamond Bar don't have a 
say in anything."

QUAINT LITTLE INN BESTS BIG LUXURY CONDOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Old World charm beat out upscale progress this week when the Ventura City 
Council blocked a luxury condominium project that would have dwarfed a quaint 
European bed-and-breakfast inn next door. 
</P>
<P>
Darrik Marten Development, which proposed the Island View Townhouse Project, a 
three-story complex of three swank condominiums on Poli Street, said it would 
have helped revitalize the lagging downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
But Gisela Flender Baida, the German-born owner of La Mer Bed &amp; Breakfast, 
complained that the project would have robbed her two-story inn of its ocean 
view and quiet, homey ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
What might otherwise have been just another routine zoning dispute thus erupted 
into a symbolic battle. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the size of the condominiums did not exceed city zoning standards, 
the council unanimously rejected them as too tall and too bulky to stand next 
to the 99-year-old Victorian structure that has housed La Mer since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's subjective, and I really don't like to do something like that," 
Councilman Don Villeneuve said. "But we have to realize that we have distinct 
neighborhoods where the architectural flavor, the scale, the era represented 
and the historical continuity are all important. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we sent out a message to developers telling them they have to abide by 
architectural guidelines that go beyond just dimensions." 
</P>
<P>
Michael E. Wooten, president of the development company, which won unanimous 
approval for the 6,000-square-foot project from the Planning Commission in 
December, said the message came a little late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"If a zoning ordinance establishes rules for a zone and a landowner goes in and 
presents a project consistent with that zone, it seems reasonable for the 
landowner to expect to have the project approved," Wooten said. "For the city 
to reverse that normal process is not in keeping with good planning practice or 
in good faith with landowners." 
</P>
<P>
For Baida, however, the council decision represented a victory that she said 
meant the difference between economic life and death. 
</P>
<P>
Her five-room inn, which was termed one of 15 top romantic getaways for lovers 
in the Los Angeles Times Travel section Sunday, depends on such intangibles as 
charm, airiness and good cheer for its success, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Donning an innkeeper's apron, Baida told the council: "If this happens and my 
little Victorian landmark gets squished, . . . I might as well commit suicide." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Unanimity 
</P>
<P>
During the 2 1/2-hour public hearing, numerous neighbors and downtown merchants 
sympathized, but many others didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"That parcel is not likely to remain a eucalyptus grove into perpetuity," said 
Larry Matheney, a Ventura Port commissioner, referring to the steep hillside 
lot where the condominiums were planned. "Change is going to occur." 
</P>
<P>
But Bobbye Ming, an uphill neighbor, said change should not come at the expense 
of longtime residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you going to allow the developers to come in here and steal the view from 
those of us who didn't have to steal it from anyone?" she asked the council. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the dispute mirrored a battle that neighbors fought against La Mer 
before its opening in 1985, when they complained that the inn would generate 
traffic problems and threaten the residential flavor of the neighborhood.

HOMART ACQUIRES SITE FOR OFFICE BUILDINGS, PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chicago development company said last week that it has bought land on which 
it will build two office buildings and an outdoor plaza across from the 
Glendale Galleria. 
</P>
<P>
Homart Development Co., one of the nation's largest shopping center and office 
building developers, announced the purchase of 4.23 acres for more than $16 
million. The site is bounded by Broadway Street, Brand Boulevard, Wilson Avenue 
and Orange Street. 
</P>
<P>
The plaza will give downtown shoppers a place to rest and the city a sort of 
town square, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Homart complex, with its pedestrian retail orientation, will provide a 
physical and functional link between the Glendale Galleria and the center of 
downtown," said Barbara Knight, acting deputy director of the city 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The plaza is to have a fountain and occasional live entertainment, such as 
carolers during the Christmas season, Homart officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Homart, a Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. subsidiary, will spend $150 million on the 
complex, said Chris Stirling, a Homart official. Construction is to begin by 
late summer, and the project is to be completed by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The plaza will be between 18- and 22-story office towers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides bringing more tax revenue and jobs, the complex will improve parking 
downtown, Knight said. Its 2,600 parking spaces will be available to Galleria 
shoppers on weekends and holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a positive step," Knight said. "The whole block has been vacated for 
years, and we've been trying to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby merchants have long complained that the vacant lot, surrounded by a 
deteriorating fence, is an eyesore in the heart of the city's retail district. 
But some city officials are concerned that the project will lead to increased 
traffic congestion downtown. 
</P>
<P>
In August the City Council, sitting as the city Redevelopment Agency, approved 
3 to 2 a Homart request to enlarge the office and ground-floor retail space by 
90,000 square feet to a total of 790,000, clearing the way for the purchase. 
Council members Larry Zarian and Ginger Bremberg voted against the enlargement. 
</P>
<P>
Knight said the impact of the increase in traffic will be minimal because the 
developers will be required to include such mitigating measures as restriping 
adjacent streets, adding left-turn signals, and planning traffic circulation in 
and out of the Homart garages. 
</P>
<P>
Zarian disagreed, saying the enlargement will help slow downtown traffic to a 
"near-gridlock" level. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth of our city depends on how much traffic we can handle, not on the 
space available for development," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very good community with a pro-business attitude," Homart's Stirling 
said. "We are committed to Glendale and will continue looking for opportunities 
in the retail and office sectors." 
</P>
<P>
Homart bought the land from the American Trading Real Estate Co., which cleared 
it five years ago and planned to build two office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
American Trading abandoned the plan, citing unfavorable economic conditions and 
disagreements with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Homart, a Chicago-based company, said it has developed 61 U.S. shopping centers 
in its 28 years of existence.

BINGO AT SCHOOL REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time, the school board last week rejected a request to use a 
school facility to play bingo. 
</P>
<P>
The board had agreed to review its summer decision after the Duarte Citizens 
Bingo Committee last month presented trustees with its survey that showed eight 
San Gabriel Valley schools profited from sponsoring bingo. 
</P>
<P>
The Duarte Community and Education Foundation, which raises funds for the 
school district, had been sponsoring weekly games at the City of Hope National 
Medical Center until the October, 1987, earthquake damaged the hall it was 
using. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Bob Packer said the board denied the foundation use of a school cafeteria 
for the activity because of concerns about gambling on school grounds and the 
school's liability for the players.

POLLUTION HEARINGS PLEDGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U. S. Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), who has been elected chairman of 
the House Small Business Committee's subcommittee on environment and labor, 
said one of his first steps will be to hold hearings on ground-water pollution 
in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has been "very slow" to 
deal with the contamination of water wells. He said he intends to summon agency 
officials to "explain to the subcommittee and the people of the San Gabriel 
Valley why the EPA has been dragging its feet when we have known about the 
contaminated ground water for almost 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of San Gabriel Valley wells have been closed since the end of 1979, when 
officials discovered that industrial chemicals had invaded ground water. Since 
then, the EPA has placed four large areas of the ground-water basin on its 
Superfund cleanup list, conducted extensive studies and undertaken water 
treatment projects in El Monte and the Whittier Narrows area, but has not yet 
produced a comprehensive cleanup program.

AN UNBIASED LOOK AT GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is my first letter ever written to the author of a newspaper article. 
</P>
<P>
I did so because I wish to express my appreciation for the first unbiased 
article about gang violence and use of automatic weapons. I refer to the 
article about gang problems in Pomona (Feb. 5, Times). 
</P>
<P>
It is fashionable to say "ban AK-47 assault rifles and cut gang crime." This is 
a simplistic approach to a complex problem. A gun ban will no more stop street 
violence than liquor bans stopped drinking, bans on knives stopped stabbings, 
and controls on spray cans stopped graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Your article explored both sides of the problem.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA; 
</P>
<P>
$810,000 AWARD IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pasadena Superior Court jury has awarded a Cal State University employee 
$810,000 in a lawsuit stemming from the placement of a stop sign on Hellman 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The jury last week awarded Whittier resident Lorenzo Pedrosa the judgment after 
one day of deliberations. Pedrosa had sued the city and the driver who hit the 
car Pedrosa was driving. 
</P>
<P>
Pedrosa was hit from behind in 1983 while stopped at a stop sign on the east 
end of the Hellman Avenue bridge over the Long Beach Freeway. Shortly before 
the accident, the city had installed the stop sign to slow down traffic 
entering the city from the Cal State campus on the west side of the bridge, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Canadian Indemnity, the city's insurance company, said the 
company will appeal the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Pedrosa suffered back injuries and was operated on twice. He has been unable to 
work since the accident, his lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Chong Hun Choi, a co-defendant in the case and driver of the car that hit 
Pedrosa's Jeep, was found to be 95% negligent and the city to be 5% negligent, 
said Robert Hamrick, attorney for the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
During the six-day trial, Michael Piuze, Pedrosa's attorney, presented a 
memorandum in which J. Van Hoven, a traffic engineering technician for 
Alhambra, advised the city not to install the stop sign at the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be difficult to consider this location as anything but unexpected 
(for motorists), therefore it could create problems that don't now exist," Van 
Hoven wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case where the city would not even listen to its own employees," 
Piuze said. 
</P>
<P>
S. Paul Bruguera, a deputy city attorney, said the stop sign did not affect the 
accident. Choi should have paid attention to the road, Bruguera said.

Opponents of City Councilmen John Robertson and Joseph Graffio have failed to

unable to gather a required number of voter signatures on a petition due Feb. 
10.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA; 
</P>
<P>
MALL ORDERED TO EASE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has declared her intention to issue a 
preliminary injunction requiring Plaza Pasadena to ease restrictions on 
political activities in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Miriam Vogel agreed with several objections to Plaza Pasadena rules 
raised by attorney Dale Gronemeier, who represents the Democratic Party of the 
San Gabriel Valley and a citizens group that campaigned in 1986 for a special 
election in Pasadena to establish a strong-mayor form of government. The 
Democrats and the citizens group claim they were illegally restricted from 
circulating petitions and conducting political activities in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
The case, which began three years ago, has produced a series of court decisions 
that have upheld some restrictions on political activities and have struck down 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, attorneys for the plaintiffs and for the Hahn Co., which operates 
the mall, returned to court to argue over the mall's latest rules on political 
activities. Vogel said some of Plaza Pasadena's new regulations were too 
restrictive. For example, although Plaza Pasadena might be justified in banning 
political activities during some shopping periods, she said, a ban from 
Thanksgiving to New Year's Day is not justified. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel instructed Gronemeier to prepare a preliminary injunction based on her 
rulings. Attorney Thomas Leanse, who represents the Hahn Co., said he cannot 
advise his client whether to appeal the decision until the preliminary 
injunction is written and issued. In the meantime, he said, Plaza Pasadena will 
continue to enforce its existing rules. In addition to ruling against Plaza 
Pasadena on most of the contested regulations, Vogel ordered the Hahn Co. to 
pay Gronemeier's law firm $110,000 as an interim award for legal work on the 
case.

PARENTS OF DISABLED CHILDREN RALLY TO SUPPORT FISCALLY AILING CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 200 concerned parents crowded into Ventura City Hall on Tuesday night 
to voice support for a pending state bill that would pump $27 million into 
centers that care for the developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say that without the money, the 21 centers throughout California -- 
including two in Ventura County -- may be forced to close as early as March 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is very nervous," said Allen G. Evans, executive director of the 
Tri-Counties Regional Center, which administers the state's Department of 
Developmental Services for Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
"The whole system is threatened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stalled by Dispute 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which has been amended twice, is stalled in a dispute between the 
Legislature and the governor over whether to borrow the money from another 
state fund or raise it through a tax increase. The centers operate on an annual 
budget of about $100 million and face a $27-million deficit for this fiscal 
year because of a shortfall in anticipated federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's centers in Oxnard and Thousand Oaks offer a broad array of 
services to almost 2,000 local residents who suffer developmental disabilities 
ranging from mental retardation to cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and their families can take advantage of programs that include 
psychological counseling, speech therapy and child development programs. The 
centers also refer clients to licensed residential care homes and provide a 
clearinghouse for hundreds of other services. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been wonderful for me. They've been the light in a room of darkness," 
said Adel Martin of Simi Valley, whose 4-year-old son Daniel is severely 
developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only is it beneficial to my son, it offers support to my entire family. If 
it closes, my son will have no services available," Martin added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Series of Rallies 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's rally was one of a series taking place this week throughout 
California to gain Gov. George Deukmejian's attention and rally support for the 
plight of the regional centers. 
</P>
<P>
The state usually finances 100% of the centers' operations. But it ran into 
trouble this year when an anticipated $27-million reimbursement from the 
federal Health Care Financing Administration was denied. 
</P>
<P>
This left the regional centers with a $27-million deficit in their operations 
budget for the fiscal year that ends June 30. As a result, Evans said, by March 
1, some centers may have to slash 95% of their services and operate on a 
skeleton staff. In the Tri-Counties area alone the deficit is estimated at $1.2 
million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Evans urged relatives to send letters and telegrams to 
Deukmejian asking for his support. An interpreter translated into Spanish. 
Parents carried placards and toted children in their arms; many developmentally 
disabled children also attended the meeting, some in wheelchairs, others 
wearing Special Olympics T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
One of the evening's more eloquent pleas for state funding came from 
21-year-old Kathy Stewart, who lives in a small home for developmentally 
disabled adults in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish the governor would put himself in our shoes and see that our parents 
can't afford to pay for us to stay in places like these all by themselves," 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because people are disabled doesn't mean we don't have rights," she said.

POMOMA RESIDENTS, OFFICIALS SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION TO GANGS

Many people had war stories to share. 
</P>
<P>
Eartha Vernon said her brother was killed in a gang shooting and her 
South-Central Los Angeles neighborhood was an open supermarket for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she said, a lot of the drug trade has moved to other areas -- partially 
because her community banded together and pushed drug sellers out. Vernon, a 
former Pomona resident, said the parents of gang members united to reclaim the 
neighborhood. The parents became more aware of who gang members were, reported 
drug dealings to authorities and refused to remain confined to their homes out 
of fear. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon is a member of Concerned Parents of South-Central Los Angeles, one of 
several groups that attended a conference in Pomona last week on gangs. 
Sponsored by the CPC Horizon Hospital in Pomona, the four-hour program included 
representatives from the clergy, police, and probation, social service and 
community agencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not the Solution' 
</P>
<P>
"Law enforcement has to take the lead in guiding the community, but we are not 
the solution," said Pomona Police Chief Richard Tefank. "The solution is the 
community and working together." 
</P>
<P>
Tefank discussed the history of Pomona's traditional Latino gangs and the rise 
of entrepreneurial black gangs that market cocaine. He cited several groups 
that could work work together to fight gang violence, including parents, the 
county corrections and probation departments, the judicial system and members 
of the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
"Individual people have to say, 'This is what I can do,' " Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. Jack Blair suggested that more churches focus on gang problems in 
Pomona. "We have to understand how desperate (youngsters) are," Blair said. 
"Most of the kids join them for protection. Many of them have no role models." 
</P>
<P>
If there is someone to look up to, it is usually not a good influence, said Leo 
Cortez of the Special Gangs Unit of the Los Angeles County Probation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to youngsters, 8- or 9-year-olds, and they are angry kids, like 
robots," Cortez said. "Their parents and brothers tell them not to like the 
other kids. A lot of the kids are being brainwashed since they were small." 
</P>
<P>
Several Christian groups at the conference outlined programs and plans to keep 
kids out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Teen Outreach, a Pomona Christian community group, and Victory 
Outreach-Pomona Valley, a church and Christian service group, said they will 
continue to counsel gang members. Sister Leticia Gomez, who heads Concerned 
Parents of Pomona, suggested a community "love walk" down 12th Street -- the 
domain of many Latino gang members. In the past year, Gomez has been working 
with the Concerned Parents chapters of South-Central and East Los Angeles, 
sharing their experiences with Pomona families. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Burnett of Pomona Open Door, a nonprofit organization that offers alcohol, 
drug and family counseling, said Pomona had a "fear of coming together" on the 
gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
"They (gangs) are well-organized, we are not," he said. "They have superseded 
us by a couple of years. But we can catch up, we can make a move." 
</P>
<P>
Vernon called the gang problems an epidemic. "I'm interested in the problem," 
she said while passing out Concerned Parents brochures, "I used to live here in 
Pomona, so I know the problems."

COUNCIL PUTS BEAUTIFICATION UNDER NEW DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday established a new department, the 
Environmental Services Section, to help beautify the city. 
</P>
<P>
The new division will clean up graffiti, remove abandoned vehicles and make 
sure that neighborhood yards are maintained. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just another example of what this staff and, modestly, the City 
Council, has done to make this a better place to live," said Councilman John F. 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved a plan to spend $20,000 to get the program off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision followed a staff recommendation. "We need to be 
aggressive and take a pro-active approach," said City Manager David Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay said that while all the environmental services are being performed 
efficiently, the effort will be better coordinated by placing them under a 
single department head. 
</P>
<P>
Until Tuesday's resolution, different environmental services had been performed 
by a variety of city departments: Public Works, Community Development, Fire, 
Police, Parks and Recreation, Planning, Zoning and Management Services. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first tasks of the new department will be to find a name that is 
more "sexy" than Environmental Services, Ramsay said.

IN THE GRIP OF THE GAME; 
</P>
<P>
49ERS ASSISTANT COACH CHEERFULLY CONCEDES HE'S A SLAVE TO BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Basketball has long been Seth Greenberg's addiction, consuming him since he was 
a youngster in Plainview, N.Y., shoveling snow off his driveway court. Now, on 
the verge of 33, he remains in the game's grip, which is tighter than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I picked the college I went to (Fairleigh Dickinson University 
in Teaneck, N.J.) is because the coach practiced seven days a week," said 
Greenberg, who as associate head coach at Cal State Long Beach is Joe 
Harrington's top assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg loves basketball to the extent, he said, that, "maybe it's a vice . . 
. but there are a lot worse vices." 
</P>
<P>
A company that develops shopping centers tried to lure Greenberg and his 
selling ability a few years ago in Florida when he was an assistant coach at 
the University of Miami. "They guaranteed I would make major-league dollars," 
he said. "But I was afraid I wouldn't enjoy it as much as I do this." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get over that feeling you get, like from a win over Vegas," he 
added, referring to Long Beach's victory last season at Nevada Las Vegas. "I 
can't imagine that feeling in another business." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drumming Up Fans 
</P>
<P>
One morning last week, Greenberg was the guest speaker at a class on the 
history and culture of sport. He tried to persuade the students to come to the 
49ers' game that night. As enticement, he diagrammed plays on the chalkboard 
and gave a scouting report on the opponent, University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Although still sleepy at 9 a.m., the students were amused by Greenberg's 
nonstop chatter and jesting, delivered in a voice that affirmed his New York 
upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of them, however, seemed inclined to either attend the game or 
enthusiastically embrace the team, a stance Greenberg perceived as apathy. He 
tried to rouse them from it. 
</P>
<P>
"It would cost $8 a semester for each student to have a new arena built here," 
he said. "That's nothing for what it would do to this campus. How many beers is 
that? I guarantee every person in this room will waste $8 this week." 
</P>
<P>
When that failed to yield a reaction that satisfied him, he told the class: 
"The bottom line is that in the next four years we will be a Top 20 team with 
or without you students." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Enjoys Teaching 
</P>
<P>
Later in the morning, Greenberg taught a techniques-of-basketball class in the 
gym. Wearing a blue warm-up suit, he showed students, many en route to degrees 
in physical education, how to throw a bounce pass. 
</P>
<P>
"They get credit for this," he said afterward, conceding with a laugh that what 
had just transpired, incredulously, was part of higher education. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy teaching," he went on, "but it takes six hours (a week) away from 
watching film, seeing recruits, writing letters . . . things you are evaluated 
on. You take pride in teaching, but if we don't win basketball games we're not 
going to be here very long." 
</P>
<P>
When Greenberg returned to his small office, he picked up the telephone, which 
is what he always does. He dialed a travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
"In Utah, I want a big car because I have to drive through snow," he said as 
arrangements were made for a recruiting trip. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting is Greenberg's specialty, and he immerses himself in it. A day or 
night rarely passes in which he does not visit a high school or see a game. 
</P>
<P>
"A good part of our job is sales, selling a kid on Long Beach and Joe 
Harrington, selling him on how to play the game," Greenberg said. "We work hard 
at developing relationships with a kid, to the point where that kid can't tell 
you no." 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a contingent of top players -- from high schools, junior 
colleges and universities -- who will join the 49ers next fall. 
</P>
<P>
One of them is Frankie Edwards, whom Greenberg recruited out of Millikan High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"He's made me want to go to class; I know he cares about me," said Edwards, who 
sat out this season under Proposition 48, which requires that potential 
Division I college athletes earn a minimum score on entrance examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg's outgoing personality and his relentless style make him a natural 
recruiter, but do not always endear him to everyone in his profession. "Some 
people are offended by my aggressiveness," he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg and Harrington have been friends for 15 years and are both in their 
second season at Cal State Long Beach. The 49ers are 11-11 with five games 
remaining in the regular season. Last year their record was 17-12, with a 
National Invitational Tournament appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"Some head coaches don't allow an assistant any leeway," Harrington said. "They 
run the whole show. I've always let my assistants have a lot of responsibility. 
An assistant has to work hard and have a love for the game and for young 
people. Seth is A-plus in all those. He'll be a very good head coach one day. 
He certainly has paid his dues." 
</P>
<P>
In Greenberg's background are assistant jobs at Miami, the University of 
Virginia and the University of Pittsburgh, and 20 years of experience -- as a 
player, counselor and teacher -- at the prestigious Five-Star Camp in 
Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an excellent coach, a fine teacher and a great organizer," camp director 
Howard Garfinkel said from his home in New York City. "He was an average 
college player; he didn't have great talent but worked very hard at the game. 
You could see he was born to be a coach." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg strives for a head coaching job, and waits patiently for his chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I love working here," he said. "I'd never leave for an assistant coaching 
position. I have as good a relationship with Joe as any assistant has with his 
head coach. I don't feel stifled." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Greenberg does not hesitate to make himself heard at practice. Profanity 
punctuates his tirades. He can ride a player unmercifully. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Great Motivator' 
</P>
<P>
"He's a fired-up guy, a great motivator," said center John Hatten, to whom 
Greenberg has been like a father. "He's got an attitude about him -- if he's in 
a bad mood, look out. He uses abusive language regularly, but that's just part 
of his vocabulary." 
</P>
<P>
Although Greenberg was a 6-foot guard, he works mostly with the 49er big men. 
</P>
<P>
"He's helped my game," Hatten said. "He can score on any of us at will. He's 
very good with fundamental moves." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said that the tough-guy approach is often necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"When they cross the line (to go on the court), you are all business," he said. 
"You have to push and prod and motivate guys in different ways. Off the court 
no grudges are held, they kid me about my bald head. Once practice is over I 
don't have to scold them unless they didn't go to class. Without the 
relationship we develop with them off the court, there would be no way you 
could drive them hard because they would know you didn't care about them." 
</P>
<P>
Being totally involved is a requirement for success in college basketball, 
Greenberg believes. To him, success means getting into the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Such extreme dedication, he said, also requires the right wife. 
</P>
<P>
"He was gone for three days after our first date in Miami," said Karen 
Greenberg, who, as a prosthetist, makes artificial limbs. "You have to get used 
to it quickly. It's his total life, basketball 24 hours a day. The phone rings 
until at least midnight almost every night. It's tough. You have to be pretty 
patient and understanding. There are a lot of high ups and really low downs. 
But I love it." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband said that marriage and becoming a father -- Paige Greenberg is nine 
months old -- have mellowed him. 
</P>
<P>
"It changes how long things stay with me," he said. "In the past there were no 
escapes. Now, we can play poorly or lose a recruit and I can go home and see 
the baby and realize life goes on." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg often gets home from practice at 6 p.m., before Karen has arrived. He 
feeds his daughter and together they watch basketball on TV. It especially 
pleases him that she does not cry and that, like him, she stares at the screen, 
transfixed.

3 CHALLENGERS FOR MIKE WOO'S CITY COUNCIL SEAT FAIL TO QUALIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Three challengers in the race to unseat Los Angeles Councilman Mike Woo -- 
including the two front-runners -- have failed to qualify for the ballot, 
leaving Woo and three relatively unknown candidates in the April 11 contest. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett Kayser, former president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon 
Assns. and the candidate who was expected to give Woo the toughest fight, fell 
99 valid signatures short of the 500 needed to qualify, the city clerk's office 
said Tuesday. Kayser had submitted 598 signatures, but 197 were found to be 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Trias, a former Los Angeles school board member from the Hollywood area, 
fell short by 170 valid signatures, the clerk's office said. Trias submitted 
571 signatures, but 241 were determined to be invalid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Postal Clerk Disqualified 
</P>
<P>
A third candidate, Howard Obata, was also disqualified. Obata, a postal clerk 
who is relatively unknown in the district, submitted 657 signatures, but 284 
were invalid, the clerk's office said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Woo, three candidates qualified for the ballot: Berndt 
Lohr-Schmidt, an attorney who has opposed Woo's efforts to impose restrictions 
on hillside building; Venus De Milo, a computer consultant who ran 
unsuccessfully for mayor and county supervisor, and Zahrina Machadah, a 
business consultant from Beachwood Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify, a candidate must submit 500 valid signatures of registered voters 
in the district. In the cases of Kayser, Trias and Obata, the clerk's office 
said, some of the signatures were of residents outside the district. Others 
signed petitions for more than one candidate or were not registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an incredible disappointment," said Kayser, director of Save Hollywood 
Our Town, a residents group opposed to Hollywood redevelopment. Kayser was 
reviewing the petitions Tuesday afternoon to determine if he will challenge the 
clerk's ruling. He also signed a declaration of intent to run as a write-in 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Slow-Growth Candidate' 
</P>
<P>
"Woo will have a slow-growth candidate against him whether it is my name on the 
ballot or as a write-in," Kayser said. 
</P>
<P>
Trias could not be reached for comment. Obata said he fell short because he 
miscalculated how many signatures he would need to compensate for the invalid 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said the disqualifications -- particularly that of Kayser -- point to a 
general level of satisfaction in the district with his record the past four 
years. Woo represents the 13th District, which includes parts of Sherman Oaks, 
Studio City, Silver Lake and Echo Park as well as Hollywood and Los Feliz. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it means there isn't a large constituency for any candidate who claims 
Mike Woo is too soft on developers," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
With the disqualifications, several City Hall observers speculated that 
Lohr-Schmidt would emerge as the leading challenger. Woo said he welcomed the 
turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a lot of room in the race for a pro-development 
candidate," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Lohr-Schmidt, who rejects the pro-development label, predicted that he will 
defeat Woo. 
</P>
<P>
"The only pro-development candidate on the ballot is Mr. Woo himself," 
Lohr-Schmidt said.

PUTTING THE BLOOM BACK IN NEW HOUSING; 
</P>
<P>
PASADENA TASK FORCE CALLS FOR A 'CITY OF GARDENS' ORDINANCE WITH FLOWERY 
LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city Board of Directors has ordered the preparation of an ordinance to 
require builders to make a central garden the focus of all new apartment and 
condominium projects, with parking well-concealed from passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is based on a planning document called "A City of Gardens" that 
was developed by a team of consultants under guidance from a community task 
force. 
</P>
<P>
City directors embraced the new approach this week even though some builders 
and architects complained that the standards are impractical, will increase 
housing costs and will not produce more attractive housing. Architect Jack 
Corey said he "loves the idea of gardens," but the proposed design standards 
are full of technical flaws and so unworkable that builders will frequently 
file appeals to deviate from the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Director Rick Cole conceded that the standards are imperfect, but said they can 
be corrected through experience. The city needs a new approach, he said, 
because the current code has produced projects that are "absolutely 
unacceptable to any kind of quality of life for the people who live in them or 
have to live next to them." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, if the city allows builders to continue constructing such 
projects, residents will demand a halt to all construction, and the result will 
be a "mindless no-growth policy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Comment 
</P>
<P>
Directors instructed the city attorney's office to prepare an ordinance based 
on the new standards and to circulate it for public comment for four weeks 
before adoption. In the meantime, projects that have already been submitted to 
the city will be allowed to go forward under the old standards. 
</P>
<P>
The new approach is designed to break a pattern of long, narrow multifamily 
units built in rows, with asphalt dominating the open space. The city report 
outlining the City of Gardens standards says such buildings violate the 
integrity of neighborhoods and detract from the city's historic character. 
</P>
<P>
The report says that, "The most noticeable and important quality of Pasadena 
neighborhoods is their overall garden character," with courtyards, lawns and 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
It also says that "Pasadena's residential streets are relatively free from 
dominance by the automobile. Pasadena has a slow and graceful character created 
by trees and buildings. . . . The traditional Pasadena quality depends very 
much on the fact that parking is invisible," placed behind buildings. It says 
that "driveways that are beautiful in Pasadena are like mysterious paths, 
leading through trees or shrubs, to some place in the back. Projects where a 
wide asphalt aisle with parked cars entirely dominates half of a 50-foot lot 
completely lose this character." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed standards would require that all multifamily projects have a 
garden or landscaped court as their focus. The main garden would take up 17% to 
20% of a lot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tile Fountains 
</P>
<P>
Projects would be required to have roofed balconies, tile fountains or other 
attractive features. 
</P>
<P>
The city's planning consultants and Planning Commission had recommended that 
all parking be confined to the rear 40% of a lot. But directors enlarged the 
area where parking might be permitted to the rear 60% of a lot, after Director 
Kathryn Nack said she feared that placing parking far apart from some of the 
residences would be inconvenient and pose security problems. 
</P>
<P>
To offset the increased open space requirements, the new standards would allow 
buildings in some cases to be constructed at the side and rear property lines 
without a setback. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Gardens standards would apply in all the city's multifamily zones 
that allow 16 to 48 units per acre. It would not apply to downtown districts 
that allow more units per acre, nor to projects that involve mixed uses, such 
as retail stores on the ground floor and apartments above.

ST. FRANCIS TAKES OFF AFTER HUMBLING LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Farmer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The St. Francis High soccer team finished the regular season with a 16-1-1 
record -- including a 16-match winning streak that ended last week in a 3-3 
tie. That's a far cry from the school's previous record for consecutive wins 
which, according to Coach Cherif Zein, was three games. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Knights got off to a rather inauspicious start, however, losing 
their season opener, 1-0, to Nogales. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shocker. A real blow," said Zein, whose team missed two penalty kicks 
and outshot the Nobles, 32-4. "I disappeared from town. I drove up to the back 
of places. I wouldn't even go in the post office." 
</P>
<P>
Even crisp new uniforms couldn't help the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked sharp in our brand-new uniforms," Zein said. "But we played like 
maids of honor." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, St. Francis has broken in the uniforms and worn out most of its 
opponents. The Del Rey League champions are the No. 4 seed in the Southern 
Section 3-A Division playoffs and will open the playoffs against Lynnwood today 
at 3 p.m. at St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
Walk this way: To the pitching staff of the Occidental College baseball team, 
the strike zone appears to be a shade larger than a postage stamp. 
</P>
<P>
In their first two games last weekend, the Tigers were outscored, 23-3, and 
walked 21 batters in a pair of losses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the record that upsets me, it's the walks," said Coach Jeff 
Henderson, whose team returns just three starters and includes nine first-year 
players. "We're young, but I didn't expect us not to throw a strike." 
</P>
<P>
And even though the Tigers are issuing free passes, the coach isn't planning to 
hand out walking papers. 
</P>
<P>
"By no means are we in a panic," he said. "We're remaining positive because we 
have the makings of a good ballclub. We're starting to jell a little bit and 
that's a continuing process -- it's not going to happen overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying exam: Occidental runner Michelle Trimble didn't wait long to qualify 
for the Division III track and field nationals for the third time in as many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Trimble, a three-time cross country and two-time track All-American, ran the 
5,000 meters in 17:31.2, shattering the school record by more than 28 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a catch: Trimble doesn't plan to run the race in nationals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to run it once more just to lower the school record even more," said 
Trimble, who missed the record by a second the previous time she ran the 5,000. 
"If I feel like it's my race, then I'll run it." 
</P>
<P>
Trimble hopes to qualify for the 1,500 and 3,000 meters and run those races in 
nationals, which is held May 24-27 in Naperville, Ill. She will get a chance to 
qualify at Occidental on Saturday when the Tigers play host to UC Riverside and 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Ineligible: Crescenta Valley point guard Raffie Eskandarian, who averaged a 
team-high 20 points and 5.6 assists a game, was ruled academically ineligible 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
According to Crescenta Valley Coach John Goffredo, Eskandarian has been under 
duress all season because of an illness in the family. 
</P>
<P>
Add Falcons: To compensate for the loss of Eskandarian, Goffredo brought junior 
Lamar Breeding up from the junior varsity to play against Arcadia last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Breeding says he was calm on the bench but when the coach gave him the nod, he 
felt a twinge of anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't expect to play that much," he said. "The crowd was up and 
yelling and I said, 'Oh no. I hope I don't mess up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Breeding took team-high honors in the loss with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Goffredo was taken aback by Breeding's offensive output. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking in the score book after the game and thinking, 19?" Goffredo 
said. "His play wasn't a surprise, the points were."

FUNDS ARRIVE TO REHAB 15 RENTAL HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Area Housing Authority of Ventura County has received a federal grant of 
$132,000 to rehabilitate 15 rental homes in western Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The money is part of a federal Department of Housing and Urban Development 
project that helps provide affordable housing to low-income families through 
repairs to roofs, plumbing and heating systems and installation of 
energy-conservation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the housing authority has used almost $700,000 in federal and 
local funds to rehabilitate more than 70 homes countywide, spokesman Sam Kent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The funds, which range from grants to loans of 6% or less, are available to 
landlords who rent to low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
The housing authority also owns and operates 278 units of public housing and 
senior citizen housing in Thousand Oaks, Ojai, Meiners Oaks and Camarillo, and 
subsidizes housing for more than 1,100 households in the county, Kent said.

SCARCE FUNDS FOR MOORPARK FREEWAY; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHWAY WIDENING AT LEAST 6 YEARS AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorists who commute on the Moorpark Freeway will encounter rush-hour traffic 
jams for at least six more years before state funds are appropriated to widen 
the four-lane highway, state and county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Despite intense lobbying by Thousand Oaks politicians, the proposed $15-million 
widening of the freeway to six lanes faces tough competition for scarce funds 
from other highway projects, including several in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is there just is not enough money to do it all," said Hunt 
Braly, a spokesman for state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), whose district 
includes Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it won a spot by next year on a state roster of high-priority projects, 
the two-year job would rank so low that construction would not start until 1995 
at the earliest and 1999 at the latest, said Richard Spicer, acting executive 
director of the Ventura County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'By Then Unbearable' 
</P>
<P>
"By then it will be unbearable," said Thousand Oaks Councilman Lee Laxdal, a 
vocal proponent of the widening project. 
</P>
<P>
Already, residents say it can take 15 to 25 minutes in the morning to drive 
down the freeway, a 7.8-mile stretch of California 23, as traffic pours south 
into Thousand Oaks and heads east toward Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid population growth, particularly in Moorpark, is responsible for 
transforming the freeway, which longtime Thousand Oaks resident Joan Dehner 
recalls as a country road, into a morass of traffic during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
Dehner remembers when driving the scenic freeway was a pleasure. Now, "it's 
just bumper to bumper" said Dehner, 33, who works as a financial analyst for a 
local aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1977 and 1987, the number of vehicles on the Moorpark Freeway between 
the Ventura Freeway and Janss Road during peak hours nearly doubled, to 6,400 
vehicles from 3,400 vehicles, according to the California Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Design Capacity 
</P>
<P>
At some points, traffic during rush hour has already reached its design 
capacity of 8,000 vehicles per hour, the figures show. Completion in 1993 of 
the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near the Tierra Rejada Road exit is 
expected to further clog the highway. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark Freeway was built in the late 1970s with a median strip wide 
enough to expand the highway to eight lanes, said Dick Sommerhauser, a Caltrans 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
But last year, the widening of the freeway was ranked least important on a list 
of 10 proposed freeway projects in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"There are problems everywhere," said Jack Hallin, Caltrans chief of project 
development for Ventura County. "Some places it's congested or dangerous 15 
minutes a day, some, 24 hours a day. It's all relative." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Submitted Annually 
</P>
<P>
The list, compiled by the Ventura County Transportation Commission, is 
submitted annually to the state Transportation Commission, which each year 
comes up with a five-year plan to fund projects statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Portions of California 126 between Santa Paula and Fillmore need to be widened 
for safety reasons from two to four lanes at an estimated cost of $17.6 million 
before the Moorpark Freeway widening project begins, Spicer said. 
</P>
<P>
Second on the list is to add two lanes and improve interchanges on the Ventura 
Freeway where it narrows to four lanes near Oxnard Boulevard, Spicer said. That 
project is estimated to cost $40 million, with state and local jurisdictions 
splitting the tab, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In eastern Ventura County, residents have long awaited construction of a 
2.2-mile, $40-million freeway connector between California 23 and the Simi 
Valley Freeway. Construction is to begin in 1990 and end in 1993. The Moorpark 
Freeway now ends abruptly in southern Moorpark while California 118 peters out 
in eastern Moorpark, leaving traffic to wend its way along narrow city streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern About Connector 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks officials are concerned that once the connector is finished, easy 
access to the Moorpark Freeway will mean that even more vehicles will clog the 
highway. Laxdal even threatened that Thousand Oaks might sue Caltrans if it 
built the connector without also widening the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials dismiss the threat of such a suit. Even Laxdal recently 
agreed, at colleagues' urgings, to "put saber-rattling aside" to work with the 
state agency. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Davis and Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) have asked 
Caltrans to conduct a study of the Moorpark Freeway project. The study will be 
completed by the end of summer and will help county officials rank the project 
for the 1990 list, Hallin said.

CAL POLY WOMEN CAN LOCK UP 8TH STRAIGHT TITLE SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With three conference victories last week, perennial power Cal Poly Pomona has 
clinched at least a share of its eighth straight California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. women's basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos can wrap up an undisputed crown with a victory over Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo at 5:45 p.m. Saturday at San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona is ranked No. 2 nationally in NCAA Division II at 20-4 overall and 9-0 
in the CCAA while San Luis Obispo is 11-11 overall and 3-5 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who defeated San Luis Obispo 99-72 in January, have won 25 
straight conference games since a 78-63 loss to Cal State Los Angeles in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing in the way of the Broncos is injuries. Junior center Niki 
Bracken (6-2), who averages 19.4 points and 8.9 rebounds to lead Pomona in both 
departments, injured an ankle against Chapman last week and is considered 
doubtful for Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if we could stay healthy, we would be a pretty good team," Coach 
Darlene May said. "Bracken had been playing outstanding basketball and we're 
hoping the injury doesn't slow her down too much." 
</P>
<P>
Without Bracken, the Broncos still rolled to a 77-48 win over Cal State 
Dominguez Hills last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Kelly Connelly (sophomore center) did a fine job stepping in for her against 
Cal State Dominguez Hills and Cathy Gooden picked up the scoring slack," May 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden, a 5-5 senior point guard, is the only other Pomona player who averages 
in double figures in scoring. An All-American selection last season, Gooden 
averages 15.9 points and 5.5 assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos also start senior Susan Luckinbill (5-9) and sophomore Stephanie 
Coons (5-10) at forward and sophomore Carrie Egan (5-8) at guard. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo has been led by junior guard Jody Hasselfield (5-5), who 
averages 12.5 points, and junior forward Deb Vettel (5-9), who averages 11.5. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona men's basketball team will be trying for its first win of the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. season when it visits Cal State 
Bakersfield at 7:30 tonight and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at 8:05 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona is 6-16 overall and 0-10 in the CCAA while Bakersfield is 17-6 overall 
and San Luis Obispo is 13-9. 
</P>
<P>
With 10 straight losses, Pomona Coach Dave Bollwinkel says he would settle for 
a win of any variety. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the local newspapers referred to us as a Jekyll-and-Hyde team because 
of our periods of excellent play followed by spans of inconsistent play," he 
said. "Personally, I would just like to hide, but the schedule sends us to 
Bakersfield and San Luis Obispo, which gives us the opportunity to accomplish 
one of our second-half goals -- a major upset." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has been led by forwards Nate Macon (6-3) and Forrest Barnes (6-5) and 
guard D. J. Norman (6-1). Macon is averaging 16.5 points, Norman 13.3 and 
Barnes 12.4. 
</P>
<P>
Eight former Cal State Los Angeles athletes and officials will be inducted into 
the school's Athletic Hall of Fame during a banquet Friday night at the Tower 
restaurant in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Among the inductees are three Olympians and one of the most successful high 
school coaches in Southern California. 
</P>

SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFF PREVIEW;

<P>
Bye should not mean a hasty farewell from the Southern Section basketball 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Teams that performed best during the regular season earned the privilege of 
skipping the first playoff round, giving them more time to practice and allow 
injuries to heal. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, this is regarded as an advantage. However, coaches -- most of whom 
are prone to bouts of anxiety, anyway -- aren't sure if their byes are so good. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather there were no byes," said Camarillo Coach John Harbour, whose team 
earned a first-round bye in the 4-AA Division by winning a share of the 
Marmonte League title. "Teams that play in the first round get their playoff 
jitters out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Yet jitters aside, a bye advances a team one step closer to saying hello to a 
Southern Section championship. In addition to Camarillo, county teams that 
begin play in the second round Friday are Buena (5-A), Rio Mesa (4-A) and Santa 
Clara (2-A). 
</P>
<P>
Because only 13 teams qualified for the 2-A playoffs, Santa Clara, the 
top-seeded team, needs to win only three games to give Coach Lou Cvijanovich 
his 10th Southern Section title. When the Southern Section offered teams the 
chance to move up to a higher playoff division in January, several 2-A teams 
fled to the 2-AA. Avoiding the prospect of facing the Saints might have been a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara (20-3) has lost only once on the court, a 39-38 loss to Edison in 
the Estancia tournament last December. The Saints, upset over what they felt 
was poor officiating, declined to return to the tournament and were assessed 
two forfeit losses. 
</P>
<P>
Shon Tarver, a junior transfer from Rim of the World High, has provided Santa 
Clara with consistent scoring, averaging 23 points a game. The Saints also have 
a rugged inside game behind Bubba Burrage (17 points, eight rebounds) and John 
McGill (nine points, eight rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most improved part of Santa Clara's game is the play of its guards. 
The Saints' ability to break a press, in fact, is a work of art -- point guard 
Art Santana, who also averages nine points, five rebounds and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
Channel League champion Rio Mesa (20-4), the third-seeded 4-A team, also boasts 
a top-flight flyer at point guard. Speedy Lester Smith has improved steadily as 
a ball handler and has become an excellent defensive player, according to Coach 
Steve Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
"He handles all the pressure bringing the ball upcourt," Wolf said, "and he 
always guards the opponents' No. 1 player. He's our most consistent player and 
has legitimate Division I quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Forwards Jeff Garner and Eric Thomas give Smith two excellent scorers to feed. 
Garner is the Spartans' leading scorer, averaging 23 points a game, and Thomas 
is a two-time All-County player who finished the league season with strong 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Harbortown may be a financially troubled Ventura resort, but Harbour-town in 
Camarillo is thriving as a school gymnasium. At Camarillo, Coach John Harbour 
gives sophomore son David the green light to shoot from anywhere on the floor. 
Well, anywhere inside 25 feet. The younger Harbour is accurate, averaging 21 
points, and he also has found time to average six rebounds and lead Camarillo 
(17-6) with four assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Frank Dews, who Coach Harbour calls "as consistent a player as 
I've coached," adds a 15-point scoring average. Dews, a returning starter, has 
responded well in several clutch situations. 
</P>
<P>
Buena (19-4) lost three times to Rio Mesa during the regular season, twice in 
league play and once in a tournament. But the Bulldogs are in a different 
playoff division than the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Bulldogs play at a fast tempo and are led by versatile forward 
Adan Valencia and sharp-shooting point guard Jeff Oliver, both starters on last 
year's league championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia, a senior, averages 16 points and 11 rebounds. Oliver, a junior who 
made a transition from off-guard this season, averages 17 points and seven 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Buena, one of 10 5-A teams with a first-round bye, hopes to stay close to home 
when it begins play. The Bulldogs have had more success running the break than 
negotiating through traffic. Santa Ana defeated Buena last season in the 
semifinals after the Bulldogs traveled 3 1/2 hours to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a while to limber up and we had only 21 points at the half," Buena 
Coach Glen Hannah said. "This year, the travel could be even worse because 
divisions aren't laid out geographically." 
</P>
<P>
This season, enrollment was the sole factor in deciding a team's playoff 
division. And the byes the structure created will be cursed or lauded, 
depending upon the outcomes of Friday's games.

FONDA, HAYDEN SEPARATE; CAREER CONFLICTS ARE CITED 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden, among America's most celebrated, controversial and 
uncommon couples, have separated. 
</P>
<P>
The two said Wednesday they are parting on a trial basis after a 15-year 
marriage, a pairing of trench-war politics and global show business. A 
spokesman said the two consider the decision a private matter and neither 
wanted to comment further. The trial separation did not involve court filings, 
the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden, 49, Democratic assemblyman from Santa Monica, for weeks has confided in 
friends that he is deep in self reevaluation -- both in his personal life and 
in his political career. Coincidentally, the news of the separation comes just 
a day after a new statewide poll showed him leading other Democrats for the the 
newly created office of state insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Fonda, 51, Academy Award winning actress and doyenne of the modern video 
exercise craze, has recently returned to California from location in Mexico and 
is finishing post-production work on a film, "Old Gringo," based on the novel 
by Carlos Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Steven Rivers, a long-time confidant of Hayden 
and currently Fonda's publicist. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said the split was the result of increasingly divergent paths, Fonda 
pushing her film and exercise business and Hayden searching to widen his 
political career after six years in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden recites an old political joke on the point: "If Jane and I have an 
evening at home alone together, it is a scheduling mistake by the staff." 
</P>
<P>
One long-time friend of the couple said, "I think it's been leading up to this 
for some time. The difficulty is, No. 1, Jane has made a very strong commitment 
to her career and there was this huge separation. They have been trying very 
hard to keep it together, but Jane went off to Mexico and Canada, and Tom was 
left here on his own. He's going through a mid-life crisis over his career, 
what he's doing and all that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glamour and Purpose 
</P>
<P>
The Fonda-Hayden relationship has been a novel one through the years. Fonda 
brought home glamour, position and money; Hayden contributed politics and a 
sense of civic purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The two labored to bring Hollywood's young cadre of actors and actresses -- the 
so-called Brat Pack -- out of an often self-indulgent world and interest them 
in politics. They were most successful in 1986, when they organized a bus 
caravan of young celebrities that traveled the state on behalf of Proposition 
65, Hayden's successful clean water initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Grubstaked with her money, the two built a 100,000-member political 
organization, Campaign California, formerly the Campaign for Economic 
Democracy. This began after Hayden lost a Democratic primary campaign for the 
U.S. Senate in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Their annual Easter retreat brought together precinct walkers, political 
journalists, old and bruised veterans of the anti-war movement and some of the 
biggest names in cinema. They would gather and sing old tunes like "Puff the 
Magic Dragon." Hayden led religious services on Easter Sunday. Fonda always 
dressed as the Easter bunny. With the separation, this year's retreat was 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Touches 
</P>
<P>
Now millionaires many times over, there has always been a sense of the 
common-person about this pair. They drive ordinary station wagons, she a 
Chrysler and he a faded Volvo. Their home in Santa Monica is decidedly upscale, 
but for a family whose annual income has been estimated in the double-digit 
millions, it would have to be called modest. They own a rustic but breathtaking 
mountaintop ranch near Santa Barbara, just a few ridges south of Ronald 
Reagan's. 
</P>
<P>
Known as just Tom and Jane, they fell in love in 1971 after meeting on stage at 
an anti-war rally. In his recent memoirs, "Reunion," Hayden recalled sitting on 
the floor of Fonda's home, then in Laurel Canyon, and showing slides about the 
Vietnam war. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Hayden had come West after a long and sometimes violent series of 
struggles in the civil rights and then anti-war movements. Fonda, daughter of 
actor Henry Fonda, was a budding -- and, by her later admission, naive -- 
anti-war activist with a ho-hum resume as a Hollywood sex kitten. 
</P>
<P>
"Jane was starting to cry. I kept flipping slides of grotesque young Saigon 
women, talking about the . . . operations performed to turn them into 
round-eyed, round-bodied, Westernized women, transforming them body and soul 
into creatures of our culture. Suddenly I understood why she was weeping: I was 
talking about the image of superficial sexiness she once promoted and was now 
trying to shake. I looked at her in a new way. Maybe I could love someone like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wartime Images 
</P>
<P>
America found some of the images of the twosome hard to forget: Fonda posing 
cheerfully with the North Vietnamese in Hanoi during the war, Hayden the angry 
defendant in the notorious trial of the "Chicago Seven," resulting from the 
police-demonstrator clashes at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
Even to this day, protest sometimes surfaces where the two go. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Galanty, a political consultant and producer of Fonda's workout videos, 
said the relationship had become one of support but not dependence before the 
split. 
</P>
<P>
"When there was political work to be done, Jane did political work. And when 
there was Hollywood movie work to be done, Tom was there for Jane," he said. 
"One did not neglect the other. Tom has never been known as Mrs. Jane Fonda 
except by people who have been aggressively angry at Tom. She was very good at 
helping to raise funds and bringing people into Tom's political life that 
weren't there before. But Tom is able now to galvanize a lot of people on his 
own." 
</P>
<P>
Political associates of Hayden and friends of Fonda say that regardless of the 
separation, each still has a bright future. Fonda will have two films released 
this year, "Old Gringo," and a love story with Robert De Niro called "Stanley 
and Iris." A new workout tape is being filmed next month for release later. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden, meanwhile, is said by an associate to see the latest Field Poll results 
as vindication -- at long last -- that he has gained acceptability enough for a 
run for statewide office. The job of insurance commissioner was created by 
voters last year, and while Hayden has not announced for the position, the poll 
showed him the favorite of 50% of the Democrats. The next closest potential 
challenger was Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn at 26%.

JURORS AWARD $14.5 MILLION TO HUDSON'S LOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER and KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rock Hudson's lover was awarded $14.5 million in damages Wednesday after a Los 
Angeles Superior Court jury found that the late actor and his private secretary 
had engaged in "outrageous conduct" by concealing that Hudson was suffering 
from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The award against Hudson's estate was widely -- but not universally -- hailed 
in the gay community. Several attorneys who handle lawsuits involving AIDS said 
they were surprised by the jury's decision and called it a potential landmark 
case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Outrageous' 
</P>
<P>
"Given the facts in the case, the verdict seems pretty outrageous," said Ben 
Schatz, an attorney with National Gay Rights Advocates in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated three days before voting 10 to 2 that Hudson and his 
private secretary had intentionally concealed from Marc Christian that Hudson, 
who died in 1985, was suffering from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
While jury decisions must be unanimous in criminal trials, civil cases can be 
determined on a vote of at least nine jurors on a 12-member panel. 
</P>
<P>
Christian, 35, did not talk to reporters after the verdict, but he was unable 
to suppress an occasional broad smile. His attorney, Harold Rhoden, said a gag 
order on participants in the case is still in effect, "but I do think I can 
say, 'Thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Rhoden told reporters, "You don't have to have a comment 
from a lawyer to know how elated he (Christian) would be." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the estate and Hudson's private secretary, Mark Miller, 55, did 
not comment on the verdict, but an appeal of the award is a virtual certainty, 
legal observers said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been numerous lawsuits by people seeking damages from 
lovers who gave them a sexually transmitted disease, personal injury lawyers 
said the Hudson case is unique and could set a precedent because Christian has 
continued to test negative for the human immunodeficiency virus that leads to 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
No plaintiff who had tested negative for AIDS had previously won such a 
verdict, lawyers said. The jury will resume its deliberations this morning to 
determine exemplary and punitive damages against Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The key issue in the case was whether Hudson had a legal duty to warn Christian 
that he had acquired immune deficiency syndrome and whether Christian was 
entitled to damages just for being exposed to the virus. The jury found that 
the late actor had such a duty and engaged in "outrageous conduct" by exposing 
Christian to the fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emotional Distress Claimed 
</P>
<P>
Christian said he suffered extreme emotional distress after he learned from a 
1985 television broadcast that Hudson was dying of AIDS. Christian, a former 
bartender who met Hudson at a political fund-raiser, testified that he and 
Hudson engaged in frequent, high-risk sex for eight months after Hudson was 
diagnosed as having the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Christian freely engaged in unprotected sex and never became infected, 
the amount he was awarded seems somewhat hysterical," said the National Gay 
Rights Advocates' Schatz. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts aren't going to resolve this issue. People will have to do it for 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Griffith D. Thomas disagreed, saying that the verdict 
could have a positive effect by reminding people they have a legal duty to warn 
their sex partners if they know they have a communicable disease. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury must have looked at it like the king and his court taking advantage 
of a helpless person," said Thomas, who specializes in gay discrimination 
cases. "Although you could show infliction of emotional damage, I don't see how 
if a man is HIV negative that they could find damages on that basis." 
</P>
<P>
The jury's decision, however, was hailed by several leading gay community 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
Morris Kight, a co-founder of the Gay Community Services Center, said that 
Christian was "exploited" and "should have been informed of Mr. Hudson's 
physical condition. Then he could have made an informed decision on whether he 
should remain with Mr. Hudson or alter their sexual practices." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Value Lesson' 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson, executive director of Being Alive, a coalition of Los Angeles 
residents suffering from AIDS, said his organization's position "is that a 
person who is infected with the virus should not be having unsafe sex, period." 
</P>
<P>
While Kight predicted that the court decision would have "a powerful impact . . 
. as a value lesson to confide in their potential sexual partners," Mark 
Kostopoulos, a spokesperson for ACT UP/LA cautioned that the case could give 
people "a false sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the case sends exactly the wrong message. We first have to teach 
people to practice safe sex -- no matter who they are with or what those people 
say." 
</P>
<P>
During the five-week trial before Judge Bruce R. Geernaert, the press and a 
parade of curious onlookers staked out the courtroom to catch glimpses of 
Hudson's love life, the subject of more than 20 years of rumors and 
speculation. They were not disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Christian testified that he and Hudson dated about 80 times before they had sex 
and often spent the afternoons making love in hotels along the Southern 
California coast. Although Christian said he had up to 15 male lovers before 
meeting Hudson, he said the two men maintained a monogamous, loving 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Christian said that even when Hudson became ill and lost more than 30 pounds, 
he believed the actor's repeated denials that he had AIDS. He told the jury 
that Hudson told him that he was drinking too much and was dieting "because I 
want to look like I did when I made 
</P>
<P>
'Pillow Talk' with Doris Day." 
</P>
<P>
During final arguments Rhoden told the jury that little was known about AIDS 
when the two men lived together and that Christian believed Hudson's denials 
because he was in love with him. 
</P>
<P>
"He engaged in sex voluntarily," Rhoden said. "If they had met today, there 
might be an argument that he should have known better." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, when the men became lovers, Rhoden said, "There was no reason to use a 
condom. There was no reason for Marc Christian to believe he could get AIDS 
from Hudson." 
</P>
<P>
Rhoden contended that Christian, an aspiring musician who lived with Hudson in 
the last two years of his life, was entitled to compensation for the "enhanced 
fear" that he suffered when he found out that his lover had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
However, attorneys for Miller and Hudson's estate portrayed Christian as a 
money-grabbing opportunist who used his relationship with Hudson to further his 
ambitions for an acting career. Estate lawyer Robert Parker Mills told the jury 
that Christian just wanted to make a quick buck from Hudson's will and filed 
the lawsuit to gain publicity. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys also pointed to a series of interviews Christian gave to 
Penthouse, the "Larry King Show," and the "Phil Donahue Show" as proof he was 
trying to cash in on the relationship. Under cross-examination, Christian also 
admitted that he was working on a book about his relationship with Hudson, 
entitled "Between Rock and a Hard Place," but later abandoned the project. 
</P>
<P>
The trial contained several bizarre and sensational revelations about Hudson, 
including Christian's testimony that the actor refused to take him to a state 
dinner at the White House because he feared Nancy Reagan would discover he was 
gay. 
</P>
<P>
Christian also told the jury that minutes after Hudson died of complications 
from AIDS on Oct. 2, 1985, Pat Boone's wife, Shirley, performed spiritual 
incantations over Hudson's body and spoke in tongues trying to remove the 
disease from his body. 
</P>
<P>
Under the best of circumstances, Christian will have to wait at least three 
years before he sees any of his award, legal observers said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Geernaert could rule that the evidence did not support the verdict and 
reduce the award. If he upholds the jury, the case will then begin wending its 
way through the appellate courts.

A U.N. report on the devastation caused by nine years of war in Afghanistan 
paints a stark picture: 
</P>
<P>
Herat province -- 600 of 1,300 villages "seriously damaged or totally 
destroyed," 60% of all trees "cut down for security reasons," 1,123 human limbs 
amputated in the past five years -- "the great majority of the victims children 
below 15 years" -- because of anti-personnel mines, 400 primary schoolteachers 
killed, "the majority of schools destroyed," agriculturalproduction "down more 
than 50% from prewar levels." 
</P>
<P>
Kunar province -- "Major war damage," "majority of population has fled," roads 
in "appalling condition, many of them mined," pine forests "stripped bare," 
education and health facilities "non-existent," "physical infrastructure . . . 
badly run down or destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Paktia province -- "Health situation . . . critical, not a single doctor is 
present," "all schools are closed, the teachers gone," "mines scattered on 
roads and in fields," agricultural output "less than one-fourth prewar levels." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan ended officially at 11:20 a.m. Wednesday 
when Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, commander of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, stepped 
across the border and back into the Soviet Union. A ceremony welcomed him as 
the last Soviet soldier to leave. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15,000 Soviets Dead 
</P>
<P>
For the Soviets, who lost 15,000 men killed and had tens of thousands of others 
maimed, it meant that the war was finally over. For Americans, who funneled 
billions of dollars in arms, ammunition and other supplies to the Islamic rebel 
movement that helped drive the Soviets out, it was a victory. 
</P>
<P>
But for the Afghans, there was no celebration Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to eight Afghans today, and not one of them mentioned the Soviet 
withdrawal," a Western diplomat in Pakistan said. "Today is really an American 
victory. For the Afghans, the war still goes on." 
</P>
<P>
The regime of Afghan President Najibullah, installed and propped up by the 
Soviets, is still in place. The cities, reeling under shortages of bread, fuel 
and other necessities, are under siege by the Islamic guerrillas, who continue 
to pummel them with rocket and mortar fire. The 31 largely rural provinces, 
like Kunar, Herat and Paktia, have been turned into a virtual wasteland, barely 
capable of supporting human life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Million Believed Killed 
</P>
<P>
More than a million Afghans are believed to have been killed. Five million 
others, a third of the population, are refugees in mud-walled camps scattered 
over the border regions of Pakistan and Iran. And according to the U.N. survey, 
the 9 million Afghans still in the country face famine, epidemic and 
starvation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the international attention focused on the impoverished country, 
efforts to prepare it for peace are lagging seriously. The U.N. program for the 
rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan, announced last year, has 
bogged down in diplomatic wrangling and charges of inefficiency and disorder in 
the agency set up to administer it. 
</P>
<P>
According to diplomats representing donor nations, and according to independent 
aid workers and Pakistani officials in Peshawar, which has been Afghan refugee 
headquarters since the war began, Afghanistan is no better prepared for the end 
of the war than it was nearly a year ago, when planning began. 
</P>
<P>
From the U.N. effort to raise more than $1 billion in reconstruction funds to 
the crucial program to clear the many unexploded land mines and shells, the 
project has been plagued by delays and administrative problems, say senior 
diplomats and aid workers. Many fear this will delay the return of what is now 
the world's largest refugee population. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, who was appointed overall coordinator of the U.N. 
program, conceded at a press conference here Sunday that since October he has 
managed to raise just $238 million in cash donations towards the $1-billion 
reconstruction program. 
</P>
<P>
An additional $650 million of in-kind contributions were pledged by the Soviet 
Union, but Sadruddin said the United Nations needs cash to feed the refugees 
and build the roads, bridges, irrigation canals and houses they will need when 
they return. 
</P>
<P>
"If the infrastructure isn't there -- and at this rate it won't be -- the 
refugees will starve when they go back," said one Pakistani refugee official in 
Peshawar. 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. report, the donations received so far "constitute no more 
than a drop in an ocean of need." It said that less than $30 million of the 
pledged donations had been received. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats blamed the U.N. coordinating agency for the shortfall. One, 
representing a country that pledged tens of millions of dollars last October, 
said he has yet to be contacted by Sadruddin's office for the money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Critical of U.N. Staff 
</P>
<P>
Other diplomats and aid workers said the U.N. staff appointed to handle the aid 
effort is "consumed by minutiae," "obsessed by politics" and "more interested 
in the hype than the help." 
</P>
<P>
The agency's critics say its mine clearance program is an example of its 
inefficiency. Estimates of the number of land mines that were strewn across 
Afghanistan by the Soviets and the guerrillas range from 1 million to 30 
million. Experts say it will take months to train enough refugees to make the 
program work. 
</P>
<P>
A number of refugees who tried to go back to their villages from camps in 
Pakistan, after the villages were liberated by the guerrillas last summer, have 
returned to Pakistan missing arms and legs blown off by mines in wheat fields 
and along village paths. 
</P>
<P>
Most refugee officials agree that the mines could be a serious deterrent to 
refugees who may want to go home. Tremendous pressure has been brought to bear 
on the United Nations to start training classes in mine recognition and 
disposal. But as one diplomat complained, "the United Nations is doing 
absolutely nothing to get this program under way." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "If the rebels won the war tomorrow and told the refugees to go home, 
most of them would be back a few weeks later missing their hands and feet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Disposal Experts 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, which has donated $2 million to the mine disposal program, 
has sent 38 U.S. Army detonation experts to Peshawar, and they were joined the 
other day by mine disposal teams from France and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
But still the United Nations has failed to start the program, and the experts 
have been sitting in Peshawar with little or nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats have also criticized Prince Sadruddin for failing to obtain 
mines from the Soviets to use as teaching tools, despite several high-level 
meetings with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
A Western expert said 31 types of Soviet mines are involved and "we need 
hundreds of them to teach these refugees how to get rid of them." He said U.S. 
intelligence agencies have only a small number of the mines. 
</P>
<P>
The critics charge that the U.N. coordinator is preoccupied with an ambition to 
become U.N. secretary general, a post that would require the endorsement of the 
Soviet Union. Sadruddin denies the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about the difficulties in coordinating the huge reconstruction program, 
Sadruddin said: "We face an extraordinarily complex situation. . . . We are 
treading new ground." 
</P>
<P>
He said his role is made all the more difficult because of the United Nations' 
neutral role and its inability to predict who will be in power in Kabul when 
the refugees decide to go home. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most senior Pakistani refugee officials, who had helped to 
coordinate the care and feeding of 3.2 million people, has been sharply 
critical of the U.N. effort. 
</P>
<P>
He said Sadruddin's agency has not built a single storage facility for the 
350,000 tons of wheat the United Nations estimates will be needed in 
Afghanistan if only half the refugees decide to return this year. The U.N. 
agencies involved in the effort, he said, have "made a lot of fuss and 
propaganda but not done any work."

OPPOSITION TO KADAFI GROWING IN LIBYA, ABRAOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi is facing growing resistance to his rule from 
opposition groups both inside and outside Libya, according to intelligence 
sources and Libyan dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no suggestion yet that such resistance seriously threatens his 
power, intelligence sources say there are indications that his regime is deeply 
concerned about the political agitation, which last month erupted into violent 
protests in four Libyan cities and, according to some reports, at least one 
major army base. 
</P>
<P>
"Never before has the dissatisfaction with Kadafi been so evident as it is 
now," said one intelligence source, who monitors Libya closely. 
</P>
<P>
According to the reports filtering out of Libya, clashes between demonstrators 
and security forces took place last month in the coastal cities of Benghazi and 
Surt, where the head of the local branch of Kadafi's Revolutionary Committees 
was reportedly killed. Smaller demonstrations occured in Tripoli and Al Bayda, 
a town northeast of Benghazi. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian military sources said a mutiny also took place at the military base in 
Tobruk, 75 miles northwest of the Egyptian border, but they said they had no 
other details. 
</P>
<P>
Although the unrest appears to have been contained, Libya watchers in Cairo 
consider it to be highly significant that anti-government demonstrations took 
place more or less simultaneously in several Libyan cities. 
</P>
<P>
"One of Col. Kadafi's greatest assets is geography," a senior Egyptian military 
source said. "Libya is a very disconnected country geographically in that its 
population centers are far apart and isolated from each other, and this has 
made it difficult for Kadafi's opponents to coordinate anything. 
</P>
<P>
"But last month we saw demonstrations break out in several places at once," he 
added. "This has never happened before." 
</P>
<P>
Recent interviews with intelligence officials, diplomats and Libyan dissidents 
inside and outside the country suggest that there are several reasons for the 
rise in open dissent. 
</P>
<P>
One was Kadafi's unpopular military intervention in Chad two years ago, which 
is said to have led to a large number of desertions from Libya's 70,000-member 
armed forces. The Chad debacle has come back to haunt Kadafi, the sources said. 
Many of those deserters, together with captured soldiers since released by the 
Chadians, have been reorganized into an anti-Kadafi military force led by the 
former commander of the Libyan forces in Chad, Col. Abdoulgassim Khalifa 
Hafter. 
</P>
<P>
The Libyan "contras," as they are calling themselves, are receiving what is 
believed to be U.S.- and French-assisted training in Chad and have set up a 
radio station that broadcasts across Libya. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Military Success 
</P>
<P>
They have no military success to boast of yet -- hit-and-run guerrilla tactics 
in the open desert are not as effective as in the jungle -- but their presence 
seems to have encouraged other dissidents in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'contra' broadcasts are the most popular radio program in Libya," said one 
student dissident, who could not be identified further because he lives in 
Libya. "Everyone is glad there is an anti-Kadafi force being formed and trained 
now. A lot of people would join them if they could." 
</P>
<P>
The creation of a rebel force has also been an encouragement to the 
long-established but relatively ineffective Libyan opposition in exile. One of 
the exile groups, the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, has allied 
itself with Hafter's forces and now expects to be more effective in opposing 
Kadafi in the future, according to its leader, Dr. Mohammed al Magarif. 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi unintentionally gave another boost to the opposition last year when he 
declared a general amnesty and released about 7,000 prisoners from Libyan 
jails. Many of those freed under the amnesty were political prisoners and many 
of them have since become active again in opposing Kadafi, the student and 
other sources said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Kadafi's moves to curb the influence and excesses of his 
much-feared Revolutionary Committees have given the dissidents slightly more 
room to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
A third and more noticeable factor fueling the current unrest in Libya, 
diplomats say, is a resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism. While Islamic 
revivalism, as its proponents prefer to call it, is not a new phenomenon in 
Libya, years of fierce repression had driven it deeply underground. But with 
the loosening of domestic controls last year, it has resurfaced in a more 
militant form, the diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the clashes with security forces last month involved fundamentalists, 
an Egyptian intelligence official said. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious of these apparently took place in Surt, 230 miles southeast of 
Tripoli, between security forces and members of the Muslim Brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
"According to our information, the troubles began in Surt on Jan. 17 and 
continued off and on for 10 days," the source said. "There were apparently 
several clashes with the Muslim Brotherhood that ended in exchanges of 
gunfire." 
</P>
<P>
Among the casualties during this period were the head of the Revolutionary 
Committees in Surt, his deputy and army captain who, according to the 
intelligence reports cited by this source, were assassinated by the 
fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats who monitor Libya said they could not confirm these reports, 
but they added that they did hear of other demonstrations at about the same 
time on the campus of Fateh University in Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these demonstrations, which involved students from the faculties of 
engineering, science, pharmacology and agriculture, also appear to have been 
fundamentalist-inspired, the diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fundamentalism is finally starting to pose problems for Kadafi, as it has been 
doing elsewhere in the region," the military intelligence source said. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts caution that none of this means that Kadafi's 19-year grip on 
Libya is in danger of slipping.

HONIG WILLING TO SEE PROP. 98 GAINS TRIMMED 
</P>

<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig gave ground in his efforts to 
protect Proposition 98, the voter-approved school funding initiative, telling 
lawmakers Wednesday that he will go along with efforts to revise provisions of 
the California Constitution that are hampering preparation of next year's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Honig's concession came during a hearing of the Senate Revenue and Taxation 
Committee, which is considering a proposed constitutional amendment that would 
revamp the state spending limit approved by voters in 1979 as well as alter 
provisions of Proposition 98, a landmark school funding measure approved in 
last November's election. 
</P>
<P>
The school chief told lawmakers that he considers the proposed constitutional 
amendment "a fair compromise," even though schools would have to give up some 
of the gains they made with Proposition 98. 
</P>
<P>
In endorsing the measure, Honig was attempting to block efforts by a powerful 
coalition of business interests, labor unions and hospital and medical 
associations that hope to undo more of the gains schools made with passage of 
Proposition 98. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Honig's concession, spokesmen for various groups told lawmakers that 
they are still not satisfied and threatened to put together an initiative 
campaign that would put a measure before voters in the June, 1990, primary 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Under consideration by the committee is a proposed constitutional amendment 
that would revise formulas in the original spending limit in a way that would 
allow significantly increased state spending. 
</P>
<P>
There is widespread agreement in the Capitol, voiced by Gov. George Deukmejian 
and both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, that the 1979 spending limit, 
together with Proposition 98 and various other legal restrictions on state 
expenditures, has forced unnecessary budget cuts and hampered their ability to 
keep state programs operating smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
The measure before the committee would allow about $550 million in additional 
spending beginning with the 1990-91 fiscal year. By the end of the 1990s, it 
would free up more than $4.8 billion a year in additional appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
The committee adjourned without taking action on the proposed constitutional 
amendment, authored by Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove). The lawmaker said 
a final version of the measure probably won't be ready for a committee vote 
until May. 
</P>
<P>
A rival proposal was offered to the committee by the coalition of groups that 
have lined up against Honig and public school interests. Members of the 
coalition include the California Taxpayers Assn., the state Chamber of 
Commerce, the California Medical Assn., the Correctional Peace Officers Assn. 
and numerous other groups. 
</P>
<P>
Their complicated proposal, simply put, would make less money available to 
schools than the Garamendi measure. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said that despite the differences, he believes a compromise can be worked 
out "where we all win." 
</P>
<P>
Hours before the hearing, Paul Gann, the author of the original measure that 
created the spending limit in 1979, said he remains opposed to any efforts to 
change the expenditure ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they start hewing away at it, they will cut it up until it's gone," said 
Gann, who placed the blame for the current budget problem on Proposition 98. 
</P>
<P>
Approved by voters last November, Proposition 98 provides that schools receive 
40% of the state general fund budget, provides for annual cost-of-living 
increases for schools and ensures that school districts, rather than taxpayers, 
will be first to receive future tax rebates. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure said during the hearing that Proposition 98 will make 
schools so financially healthy that funding for all other programs financed 
from the general fund -- universities, local governments, health and welfare 
programs -- will decline. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Smith of the California State Employees Assn. said Proposition 98 will 
allow schools to take "an ever and ever greater share of the state budget." 
</P>
<P>
George F. Cate, a lobbyist for the California Medical Assn., said several years 
of budget cuts have led to a gap of about $1 billion between what health 
programs need to continue their current level of services and what the state 
will give them. With schools getting a higher budget priority with Proposition 
98, Cate said, making up for past spending reductions will be all but 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see Proposition 98 completely repealed," Cate said.

BUCKEY FREED ON $1.5-MILLION BAIL AFTER 5 YEARS IN JAIL 
</P>

<P>
A smiling Raymond Buckey, the principal defendant in the McMartin Pre-School 
molestation case, was released on $1.5-million bail from Los Angeles County 
Men's Central Jail on Wednesday night after spending nearly five years behind 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 30, made his way through a crowd of reporters and broadcast news crews 
to his attorney's car without saying a word. The one-time preschool teacher 
rode away with his attorney, Daniel G. Davis, and a private security officer to 
an undisclosed location. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, are in the 22nd month of their 
trial on 65 counts of child molestation and conspiracy involving 11 children 
who attended their family-run nursery school in Manhattan Beach. She is free on 
$295,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders ordered Buckey released last 
week after determining that he had met the $1.5-million bail by pledging real 
estate worth twice that amount, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
He had been jailed since March, 1984, when he was arrested along with his 
mother, grandmother, sister and three other former teachers at the school, 
which has since closed. Charges against all of the defendants, except Buckey 
and his mother, have been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
In ordering Buckey's release, Pounders ruled that he must surrender his 
passport and not have any contact with anyone under age 14 who is not a blood 
relative or accompanied by a parent. The judge also ruled that Buckey stay out 
of the cities of Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach unless he 
receives court permission, and that he be kept under 24-hour guard.

KENTUCKY FLOODS CLOG HIGHWAYS, FORM SEA OF MUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rain-swollen rivers and streams gushed over their banks in Kentucky and 
bordering states Wednesday, flooding roads and homes, closing schools and 
turning farmland into seas of mud. 
</P>
<P>
The storms, which have drenched parts of Kentucky with up to 10 inches of rain 
since Sunday and neighboring Tennessee with almost six inches in some areas, 
were blamed for at least five deaths in the two states, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Flash flood watches and warnings were posted in both states, and some of the 
heavy rains spilled over into Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and West 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Western and central Kentucky were hardest hit by flooding as Rolling Fork River 
overflowed and clogged roads near Boston, 50 miles south of Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said the river was still rising and was expected 
to crest at about 51 feet -- 16 feet above flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
Police said highway travel was hazardous because deep water was sitting on 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
At least a dozen school systems around the state were closed for a second 
straight day Wednesday because of high water. Officials in at least five 
counties said some residents evacuated their homes and moved to higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural forecasters said rain-soaked farmland had become a virtual sea of 
mud in many parts of Kentucky. They warned that flooded fields could cause 
damage to some cereal crops. 
</P>
<P>
In West Virginia, up to four inches of rain fell, spreading floods that closed 
schools or canceled classes in six counties and blocked roads in five counties, 
officials said.

EX-BELGIAN PREMIER SAYS HE NEVER SAW KIDNAPERS

<P>
Former Belgian Prime Minister Paul Vanden Boeynants said Wednesday he spent his 
month as a kidnap victim hooded and handcuffed and never saw his captors' faces 
or heard their voices. 
</P>
<P>
Vanden Boeynants described the kidnapers who abducted him Jan. 14 as 
"professional criminals" interested only in money. He said they were well 
organized and operated with military discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression is that I was in France," Vanden Boeynants said two days after 
he was freed by his kidnapers, who were paid a ransom of hundreds of thousands 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The wealthy businessman said his captors, possibly as many as five, first 
sought a $10-million ransom but reduced the demand after reading a newspaper 
article indicating he was not as rich as they thought. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Vanden Boeynants said he spent almost all his time in 
captivity handcuffed and hooded. The first two weeks were spent under threat of 
a gun, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnapers, calling themselves the Socialist Revolutionary Brigade, used the 
guise of a left-wing terrorist group to mislead investigators and had no 
political motives, said Vanden Boeynants. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't give a damn about politics. We want money," he quoted them as telling 
him in a note. 
</P>
<P>
All communication with his kidnapers was done through such notes, said Vanden 
Boeynants, 69. He said he remained calm throughout the ordeal by repeatedly 
telling himself, "You're not going to die here."

<P>
Heavy fighting flared Wednesday in the Christian heartland of East Beirut, 
apparently the start of a long-expected showdown between the Lebanese army and 
the Christian militia. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials said scores of people were killed in the fighting, which 
went on through the night. 
</P>
<P>
A report from West Beirut quoted a police official as saying that at least 40 
people had been killed. An army spokesman acknowledged that the dead included 
seven military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate cause of the fighting was an incident Tuesday involving members 
of the Christian militia known as the Lebanese Forces. They reportedly attacked 
an army jeep, killing one soldier and wounding four others. The militia then 
set up roadblocks along the main coastal highway leading east from Beirut to 
the Christian heartland toward Juniyah. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pounding Barracks 
</P>
<P>
Army units moved tanks from their bases in the mountains toward the coastal 
highway, pounding militia barracks at Karantina, near the so-called Green Line 
separating East Beirut and West Beirut, and routing Lebanese Forces troops from 
their barracks in East Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke billowed up from burning office and apartment buildings set ablaze by a 
heavy artillery bombardment from army positions in the heights above the city. 
The main coastal highway was closed by army tanks and the roads to Syria were 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the U.S. Embassy 
was hit by shellfire. "While not a target, the embassy compound and two embassy 
residences have been hit by shells," he said, adding that no embassy personnel 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman was quoted as saying that the army appeared to be trying to 
drive the Lebanese Forces from strongholds in the Christian half of the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, the Associated Press said Beirut police reported that the 
Lebanese Forces had staged a night attack on the residence of the army 
commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, in the suburban Rabieh district. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of militia members stormed the hilltop section of posh villas and 
surrounded about 50 troops guarding Aoun's house, the AP said. Neither Aoun nor 
his wife were believed to be in the home seven miles north of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Many political analysts in Lebanon had been predicting as inevitable a clash 
between the Lebanese Forces and the mainly Christian units of the Lebanese Army 
based in East Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun was named premier of Lebanon last year by the outgoing president, Amin 
Gemayel, after Parliament deadlocked on the choice of a new president. He was 
supported at the time by the Lebanese Forces, which are commanded by Samir 
Geagea, a former medical student. Salim Hoss, then acting premier, has also 
declared himself the head of a rival Muslim cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Both Maronite Christians 
</P>
<P>
Like most of their followers, Geagea and Aoun are Maronite Catholics, so the 
battle taking place now is essentially for the leadership of the Christian 
community of Lebanon, which includes nearly half of the country's 3 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The Christian units of the Lebanese army are equipped with American weapons and 
are the most cohesive force in the army. They have about 10,000 troops under 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Forces are heavily armed, including tanks and artillery sold by 
Israel, and field a fighting force of about 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
A stalemate in the government has resulted since the formation of rival regimes 
in the Christian and Muslim communities. If Aoun is victorious in the current 
struggle, it seems likely that he will realize his ambition of becoming 
Lebanon's next president. 
</P>
<P>
The crushing of the Lebanese Forces in East Beirut would be an important 
gesture to Syria, which has opposed Aoun's government in East Beirut. The 
Syrians have sought a withdrawal of Christian militia forces from East Beirut 
as a return favor for the Syrian army's occupation of West Beirut, which ended 
several years of militia anarchy last year. 
</P>
<P>
Geagea was asked on Lebanese television recently whether he would allow the 
Lebanese Forces to be absorbed into the army, thus regaining for the state some 
of its tarnished prestige. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the state," Geagea replied, "and it's the army that should be absorbed 
by the Lebanese Forces." 
</P>
<P>
Aoun insists he is the only legitimate power in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The government has been paralyzed by the failure to elect a new president. 
Lebanese wishing to travel abroad have been unable to get passports because 
there is no universally recognized executive authority in the country.

OIL THAT MAY HAVE PERFUMED KINGS IS FOUND

Near the site where the Dead Sea scrolls were found, archeologists have dug up 
a 2,000-year-old clay flask filled with an oil that might have been used to 
anoint the ancient Israelite kings. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Patrich of Hebrew University unveiled the flask Wednesday and said the 
honey-like oil may be the only surviving sample of a balsam oil used as an 
aromatic body cream or perfume and famous throughout the Roman Empire. 
</P>
<P>
The oil matches a description of an expensive perfume mentioned by the Roman 
historian Pliny. Known as persimmon oil, it was distilled from a bush-like 
plant now believed to be extinct. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-inch-tall flask contains about 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 ounces of the 
well-preserved reddish oil, which dates to the 1st Century BC. It was wrapped 
in palm leaves and carefully concealed. 
</P>
<P>
The persimmon plant, which was different from the modern tree of the same name, 
grew only in the Dead Sea oasis of En Gedi and around Jericho. The ancient 
Israelites guarded the secret formula for making the oil and tried to destroy 
the orchards when Roman legions approached. Pliny's writings indicate the 
Romans took over production, archeologists say. 
</P>
<P>
The flask, buried in a 3-foot-deep pit in the caves at Qumran, 50 miles 
southeast of Jerusalem, was found last year by an archeology team that includes 
an American group of volunteers from the Institute of Judaic-Christian Research 
in Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Hebrew University chemist Zeev Aizenshtat said whatever fragrance the oil once 
had had evaporated in the desert cave, where summer temperatures hover over 104 
degrees.

ATTEMPTS TO FORM INTERIM REGIME DEGENERATE INTO FACTIONAL STRIFE;

SPLIT DAMPENS REBEL JOY AS SOVIETS LEAVE AFGHAN WAR

Flanked by guards posing for the television cameras, a gray-bearded Afghan 
rebel leader proclaimed here Wednesday that the Soviet withdrawal from 
Afghanistan was "one of the most unprecedented events of the last few 
centuries" and that it "defeated communism's philosophy all over the world as a 
whole." 
</P>
<P>
"Allah has given us the honor of breaking the chains of Red imperialism," said 
fundamentalist rebel leader Abdul Rasul Sayyaf in his native Persian, as 
television crews, newspaper and radio reporters from throughout the world 
recorded his victory speech. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the power of faith, the steadfastness, the will and the determination 
of the Afghan nation that forced the Russians to leave our country and change 
their habits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no cheers from the rebels ordered to assemble at the religious camp 
here for what had been billed as a press conference by the Afghan rebel 
moujahedeen. There was no show of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
It was a stage-managed event that belied the deep and growing divisions within 
the rebel movement to which the United States and Pakistan have given billions 
of dollars in arms and aid to help it drive the Soviet occupation troops out of 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, one senior diplomat here noted Wednesday night, the ceremony for 
the last Soviet soldier to cross Afghanistan's border into Soviet territory 
Wednesday morning "was far more jovial than anything you'll see over here." 
</P>
<P>
The desperate attempts of the past several weeks to convene a unified assembly 
of rebel leaders and form an interim government that could assume power in 
Kabul if Afghanistan's Soviet-backed President Najibullah falls have 
degenerated into conflict among the rebel factions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fundamentalists and Moderates 
</P>
<P>
One of the seven parties in the rebels' political alliance has boycotted every 
session of the assembly. Representatives of the Afghan rebel groups based in 
Iran have refused to attend. Prominent rebel commanders and important tribal 
leaders have already left, and even the religious leaders, known as mullahs, 
who were present at the assembly Wednesday voiced strong dissent during the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the disgruntled delegates blame the failure of the assembly, or shura, 
on the deepening split between the dominant fundamentalist parties and the 
moderates in the rebel alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalists are pushing a proposal to name a weak leader to head the 
government, which will continue to be dictated to by the seven party leaders, 
until elections can be held in Afghanistan within six months. Fundamentalist 
leader Ahmad Shah would be prime minister in the interim government. 
</P>
<P>
The moderates object, and senior diplomats -- even some who have supported the 
fundamentalists -- agree that Ahmad Shah already has been "totally 
discredited." 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they keep pushing Ahmad Shah, the shura goes nowhere," said one 
moderate. "As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to give an angry speech tomorrow 
and go home. Let them kill me if they like. The shura is finished anyway." 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference to mark the Soviet withdrawal, Sayyaf, who heads a 
fundamentalist rebel party financed by Saudi Arabia, angrily denied that there 
are any divisions among the moujahedeen. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some kind of imagination as if the moujahedeen organizations are 
divided into two parts," Sayyaf said through his translator. "This is a wrong 
impression." 
</P>
<P>
Reports of the fundamentalist-moderate split are "part of propaganda by the 
pessimists and the enemies of the holy war," Sayyaf said. 
</P>
<P>
Sayyaf did not comment, however, on the fact that when the rebel leaders 
invited questions from the press, the only two leaders on the stage were he and 
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who is considered the most fundamentalist of the alliance 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope Seen in Alliances 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats and analysts who are following the shura closely have all but 
dismissed it as a credible body. Most said the hope for peace in the near 
future hinges on the ability of tribal leaders and regional commanders inside 
Afghanistan to forge alliances that will produce semi-autonomous governments. 
</P>
<P>
"They are already forming unities inside," one said. "Sub-tribes are 
reasserting their relationship with parent tribes. These are stepping stones to 
a loya jirga, the traditional assembly of elders that decides for the nation in 
times of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditional leadership will now be paramount. The rebel commanders will have 
influence but it is influence that will be in a context. It is influence within 
the only thing they know -- the tribe." 
</P>
<P>
Without a unified interim government to pressure Najibullah's regular army, 
most Pakistani and Western analysts said they now believe that the fall of 
Kabul and other major cities will take much longer than the U.S. government 
originally had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kabul regime is very strong, they are well-equipped and they will keep 
their morale up for some time," said Kamal Matinuddin, a retired general and 
director of Pakistan's Office of International Strategic Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Matinuddin's research indicates that the rebel commanders now have all major 
Afghan cities under siege, all key airports are under intermittent artillery 
attack, and all major highways and roads have been completely or partially 
block aded by the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
But 25 of the 31 provincial capitals remain under the regime's control, and 
morale throughout the hard core of Najibullah's military and civilian support 
remains very high, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the fighting will probably continue and that the moujahedeen will 
continue to harass the government forces. 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst said: "But it is really a matter of penetrating as close as 
possible rather than fighting. And that kind of war takes time, a lot of time, 
and a lot of lives."

As the last Soviet soldier left Afghanistan on Wednesday, the United States 
said it will continue to support the Afghan rebels as they try to oust the 
Moscow-backed government in Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
"Our support for the resistance continues," said State Department spokesman 
Charles Redman. "Our goals really haven't changed. Our goals have been to 
support Afghan self-determination, and that will continue to be our goal." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a long-awaited day for the Afghan people, and they can now go on to 
determine their own future," Redman added. He said the United States supports 
efforts to create a broadly based Afghan government but has proposed no 
blueprint. "It is going to have to be a solution found by the Afghan people," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after the last soldier crossed into the Soviet Union, Moscow appealed for 
an immediate cease-fire and an end to arms shipments by all countries. But 
there was no indication the United States would abide by such an appeal. 
Washington has said it would continue sending arms to the guerrillas as long as 
Moscow sends arms to the Kabul regime. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said in Madrid during his tour of North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization countries that "the past 10 years of Soviet 
aggression in Afghanistan are a tragic chapter in that nation's history. I 
think that it would be appropriate now for us to call on the Soviets to assist 
in the reconstruction of Afghanistan." 
</P>
<P>
Former President Jimmy Carter, whose Administration protested the Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan by keeping U.S. athletes out of the 1980 Olympic Games 
in Moscow and imposed an embargo on grain sales, said the Soviet occupation was 
wrong from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December, 1979, was an international 
tragedy," Carter said in a prepared statement in Atlanta. "The heroism of the 
Afghan men and women who fought against foreign subjugation has forced Soviet 
forces to withdraw in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I am proud of the support the United States gave from the earliest day to 
those who offered their lives for freedom," Carter said.

U.S. RESTUDIES HELPING JAPAN BUILD WARPLANE; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH ADMINISTRATION REEXAMINING DEAL THAT CRITICS FEAR WOULD CREATE AEROSPACE 
COMPETITOR

<P>
The Bush Administration indicated Wednesday that it has ordered a reexamination 
of a deal negotiated by the Pentagon last year under which the United States 
would help Japan to build an advanced fighter plane. 
</P>
<P>
Critics complain that the agreement for joint production of the plane -- which 
is called the FSX and is based on the American F-16 design -- could enable 
Japan to acquire American technology that it could use eventually to develop 
its aerospace industry into a commercial competitor of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The delay raises the prospect that the dispute over the FSX will turn into a 
highly charged test of relations between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Ties Cited 
</P>
<P>
The Defense and State departments view the FSX agreement as important to 
maintaining close security ties between the two countries. But the Commerce 
Department and a growing number of congressional opponents are voicing concern 
about the impact of the deal on the future of the American aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials had originally expected to reach an interagency 
agreement by Wednesday to proceed with the FSX project. Before it takes effect, 
the agreement must be submitted to Congress, which has 30 days in which to 
disapprove it. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Administration was unable to reach such an agreement. Instead, 
after a series of meetings last Friday and early this week, the Administration 
announced Wednesday that the National Security Council "has called for an 
expeditious but thorough review of the FSX agreement." 
</P>
<P>
"It will go on for a few weeks," a State Department official said Wednesday. A 
congressional source said he had been told that the deadline for the new study 
is March 10. 
</P>
<P>
The new study amounts to at least a partial victory for the critics of the FSX, 
who had been seeking to persuade the Bush Administration to conduct a 60- or 
90-day review of the FSX deal. 
</P>
<P>
One congressional opponent contended that the State and Defense departments had 
been trying "to ram this through while the new Administration is still 
disorganized." 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between the United States and Japan over the FSX date back 
nearly two years. Originally, the Japanese Defense Agency wanted to build its 
own fighter, even though such a project would have been much more costly than 
simply buying American-made F-16s. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, U.S. and Japanese military officials negotiated what both sides 
viewed as a compromise for joint production of the FSX. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, General Dynamics Corp., the American company that makes the 
F-16, would give Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries its design for the jet. In 
exchange, the United States would obtain any advanced technology that Japan may 
have in the fields of aircraft materials and radar. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics would be guaranteed 35% to 45% of the $1.2-billion development 
budget for the FSX. However, critics complained that the Pentagon failed to get 
any commitments from Japan that the American company will get a share of the 
work when the fighter plane is actually produced. 
</P>
<P>
One Pentagon official termed the FSX deal "a breakthrough in military 
cooperation" between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But a congressional opponent of the FSX deal countered, "Defense is not the 
name of the game here. The name of the game is the development of their 
(Japan's) aerospace industry . . . . This (FSX project) will be a 
super-advanced seminar on how to build a jet fighter, and Japan will be the 
star pupil." 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Omnibus Trade Act gives the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade 
representative a mandate to review military agreements such as the FSX deal and 
to consider their economic and commercial consequences. Until that law was 
enacted, those issues were decided almost entirely by the State and Defense 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials have said repeatedly that they would like to have the FSX 
agreement approved before March 31, the end of the Japanese fiscal year. 
Otherwise, Japanese officials say, the money allocated for the FSX project in 
the Japanese budget this year will revert to the Treasury.

CHICAGOAN BOWS OUT, BACKS SAWYER OVER DALEY

<P>
Mayor Eugene Sawyer, claiming that he is in a virtual "dead heat" with State 
Atty. Richard M. Daley as the Democratic mayoral primary approaches, won the 
endorsement Wednesday of Alderman Lawrence Bloom, who dropped out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom's departure leaves only Sawyer and Daley in the Democratic primary, which 
will be held Feb. 28. Daley is the son of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, who 
dominated city politics for 21 years until his death in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom, who has charged that the Sawyer and Daley candidacies threatened to 
increase racial polarization, praised Sawyer Wednesday for having a "vision to 
unite this city." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Financing Problems 
</P>
<P>
"I will be campaigning for Mayor Sawyer," said Bloom, who added that he has 
watched Sawyer "grow in stature" during the campaign. He said he was dropping 
out because his under-financed campaign could not compete with the television 
commercials of his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer, who is black, was appointed mayor by the City Council in November, 
1987, after the sudden death of Mayor Harold Washington. The former alderman 
badly trailed Daley in the polls at the start of the campaign, but since 
January -- when popular black alderman Tim Evans dropped out to run as an 
independent -- he has been endorsed by most of the city's black political 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom, who like Daley is white, claimed support in both the black and white 
communities. Daley aides Wednesday discounted Bloom's endorsement of Sawyer, 
saying half of his supporters likely will gravitate to Daley. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer said, however, that Bloom's endorsement may sway the large number of 
undecided voters. 
</P>
<P>
A recent poll commissioned by the Sawyer campaign and released this week showed 
Daley leading with 37%, followed by Sawyer with 33% and Bloom with 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Another development that may potentially boost Sawyer's candidacy was the 
announcement Wednesday that a group of Republican supporters are promoting the 
write-in candidacy of former alderman Edward R. Vrdolyak. 
</P>
<P>
Vrdolyak, who led a white faction of the City Council that opposed Washington 
and who blocked most of the late mayor's programs during his first term, has 
until Feb. 24 to officially enter the race as a write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
If the articulate and controversial Vrdolyak enters the race it could 
dramatically change the tone of the campaign, which so far has been 
surprisingly low-key and free of the bile and racial tension that have marked 
recent city elections. 
</P>
<P>
Voters can select either a Republican or a Democratic candidate in the primary. 
One scenario has Vrdolyak siphoning some of Daley's mostly white support, thus 
weakening him and boosting Sawyer's campaign. Then, if Vrdolyak wins the 
Republican primary, he would be the only white candidate in a three-way general 
election with Sawyer and Evans in April. 
</P>
<P>
His supporters Wednesday denied that this was their intention. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no gimmicks, no fast shuffle cards, no parlor tricks," said John 
Ruel, a leader of the campaign to draft Vrdolyak. "We are not concerned with 
the Democratic primary. We're more concerned with the Republican primary. What 
the other candidates do in the other party, that's their business."

A 400-foot luxury liner attempting to dock in the Port of Palm Beach Wednesday 
night hit an anchored Navy ship and tore several holes in the 110-foot vessel, 
the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident involving the Viking Princess and the unnamed naval cargo loading 
craft caused no serious injuries to passengers or crew, Coast Guard Petty 
Officer Jerry Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very small harbor," with only two shipping channels and a small area 
where the cruise liners have to turn around, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Coast Guard utility boats plugged three holes below the Navy vessel's water 
line, and minor flooding was quickly brought under control, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
Some passengers of the Viking Princess were shaken up, but the crew was able to 
care for them without assistance, he said.

L.A. DELAYS BAN ON ASSAULT RIFLES, WILL AWAIT RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles officials agreed Wednesday to hold off on enforcing a ban on 
possession of semiautomatic rifles until March 1, pending a federal judge's 
ruling on an ordinance intended to rid the city of the lethal weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, this is the beginning of the end of this ordinance. 
One step at a time," said a lawyer for Colt Industries Inc., manufacturer of 
the AR-15 assault rifle. Colt filed suit last week challenging a week-old city 
ordinance banning possession and sale of the rapid-firing military-style 
rifles. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William P. Gray persuaded the city to postpone enforcement 
of the ban on possession of the weapons, but he refused to halt restrictions on 
semiautomatic weapons sales. A lawyer for the city said those restrictions are 
needed immediately "to protect the safety of our citizens (and) our police 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great deal of sympathy with the city's concerns, but I also am 
mindful of the constitutional arguments asserted by the plaintiffs," Gray said, 
scheduling a hearing Wednesday to determine whether to issue a preliminary 
injunction blocking enforcement of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The Colt Industries lawsuit was the first of what will probably be many legal 
attacks against a growing move to outlaw semiautomatic rifles in cities across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Although several cities have adopted similar ordinances, many others are 
awaiting the court's ruling on the constitutionality of the Los Angeles 
ordinance before deciding whether to adopt similar bans. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Rifle Assn., which claims 250,000 members in 
California, said Wednesday that it will attempt to go directly to the state 
Supreme Court next week to seek a determination that the growing number of 
cities adopting ordinances controlling the weapons are illegally usurping the 
state's authority in the field of gun regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court could refuse to hear the case directly and send it back to 
the lower courts for initial review. 
</P>
<P>
Those mounting the legal challenges say the proliferation of local ordinances 
will produce confusion among gun owners and dealers until the matter is 
resolved. Already, Colt Industries argues, someone can buy a gun in Culver City 
and take it home to Beverly Hills, but the Los Angeles ordinance would make it 
a crime to go through that city while taking it home. 
</P>
<P>
At least six California cities, including Los Angeles, Compton, Stockton, 
Carson, Gardena and Lynwood, have adopted ordinances barring the sale and 
possession of assault rifles, as has Santa Clara County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Vote Postponed 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a dozen other cities throughout the country, from New Orleans to Boston, 
are considering similar ordinances. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 
postponed a decision this week on a countywide ordinance. A vote is scheduled 
in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
State legislatures are also moving to fill in gaps in gun control and 
registration laws that have historically been directed at handguns or fully 
automatic machine guns. Committees in the California Senate and Assembly will 
consider legislation on Feb. 28 prohibiting selling, distributing or importing 
assault rifles anywhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The control measures have all been proposed in the weeks since Patrick Edward 
Purdy, 24, opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle in a Stockton schoolyard, 
killing five children and wounding 29 others. 
</P>
<P>
In its lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Colt Industries 
claims that the Los Angeles ordinance is "wildly over-broad" and intrudes into 
an area of regulation that is within the jurisdiction of the state, not 
municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, in response papers filed with the court, said the state has 
exclusive jurisdiction only over registration and licensing of guns, not over 
sale and possession. Assistant City Atty. Byron R. Boeckman argued that urban 
areas like Los Angeles have a unique need to control semiautomatic weapons that 
may not be present elsewhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Significant' Interest 
</P>
<P>
"These weapons are an ever-increasing problem in Los Angeles, weapons of death 
and intimidation, and the local interest in their regulation is very 
significant," Boeckman argued. 
</P>
<P>
City attorneys also rejected Colt Industries' protests that the AR-15 is 
designed primarily as a sporting gun for use in target practice. "Assault 
weapons are not used for hunting or target practice but are military-style 
weapons designed for wholesale killing," the city said in its court papers. 
"Their force and magnitude render them inappropriate for anything other than 
war." 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's hearing, Gray said he is not certain that the federal courts 
should intervene in a dispute over state law. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm troubled about whether this court should take jurisdiction," he said. 
"This is a case that strictly pertains to what is the California law, and I 
can't think of any court in the land that is more equipped to handle that than 
the courts of this state." 
</P>
<P>
But the judge set Wednesday's hearing to decide whether to take jurisdiction in 
the case and, if so, to consider the constitutional challenge and determine 
whether a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the ordinance should be 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reasonable Approach' 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with the result," Colt attorney Harry G. Melkonian said of 
the hearing. "The (possession) ordinance is not going to be enforced on Feb. 
22." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James Hahn noted, however, that the judge left the key part of the 
ordinance, the ban on sale of the weapons, in effect. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the judge has taken a reasonable approach to dealing with this, and 
we're confident that we're going to prevail on this issue," he said. "The key 
part of this ordinance is to stop these weapons from being sold in Los Angeles 
and to get them off our streets, and we consider that we won half of that 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Other California cities that are considering bans on possession and sale of 
semiautomatic weapons include Thousand Oaks, San Diego, Burbank, Davis, 
Sacramento, Santa Monica, Hawthorne, Lawndale, West Hollywood, La Palma, 
Glendale, Beverly Hills and Bellflower.

JOINT VENTURE FORMED TO DEVELOP PROPERTY IN PLAYA DEL REY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, Times City-County Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Hughes Properties withdrew Wednesday as the main developer of the late 
billionaire's vast Santa Monica Bay land holdings near Playa del Rey after 
years of bitter political controversy over the future of one of America's most 
valuable stretches of undeveloped urban land. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the firm is forming a joint venture with two high-powered urban 
development firms that have close connections in Los Angeles City Hall -- 
Maguire Thomas Partners and JMB Realty Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas, which is building two high-rises in downtown Los Angeles across 
from the Central Library, will be the managing partner, in charge of planning, 
design and construction. JMB, a Chicago-based firm, owns Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Robert F. Maguire III and James A. Thomas, partners in the firm, would not 
disclose financial details. 
</P>
<P>
But the 900-plus acres are worth hundreds of millions. An inland parcel, 
totaling 70 acres, was assessed by Coldwell Banker at $84 million in an 
undeveloped state and at $107 million if roads were put in. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire and Thomas said in an interview that they had been approached by a 
representative of Hughes Properties several months ago to buy a portion of the 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
But the firm declined, saying that it needed control of all the land to put up 
the kind of development it had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The deal marks an important development in the long fight over the land Hughes 
purchased decades ago, when it was cheap. With the exception of his old 
aircraft factory and airfield, most of the land, extending from the San Diego 
Freeway to Marina del Rey between Venice and Playa del Rey, has remained a 
panorama of open fields and a wetland bird sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
Bitter controversy developed over plans by Summa Corp., parent company of 
Howard Hughes Properties, to build 2,400 hotel rooms, 8,837 residential units, 
5.9 million square feet of office space and a 40-acre marina. Homeowners, part 
of the growing slow-growth movement, objected to the density, and 
conservationists fought to save the bird sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pleased by Development 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles city councilwoman, Pat Russell, was defeated in part because of 
her support of the project, and her successor, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, 
vowed to force Summa to reduce it. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said she was pleased by the entrance of Maguire Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic," she said. "They share some of my concerns about the 
future of the area." 
</P>
<P>
Maguire said he did not yet have specific plans for the development. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he had "a vision." What kind of a vision? "The kind of design 
characteristic of Santa Barbara City Hall," he said, "some of the 
characteristics of that city." 
</P>
<P>
In referring to Santa Barbara, with its low-lying, Spanish-design public 
buildings, surrounded by parks, Maguire seemed to be evoking an image of 
low-rise Mediterranean architecture -- or at least a form of architecture more 
palatable to residents than the Hughes designs. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes architecture in the Howard Hughes Center, an office development off 
the San Diego Freeway, aroused the opposition of residents in the adjacent 
neighborhood. Supporters of former Councilwoman Russell said the design of the 
center, with its high-rise Wang Building, was a factor in her loss. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter's reaction to the deal was evidence that the emergence of the Maguire 
Thomas firm as project boss may help ease opposition in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Power Politics 
</P>
<P>
Summa played power politics. It was a major contributor to the political 
campaigns of all Los Angeles County supervisors, the vast majority of the City 
Council and to Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
But the contributions did not help in the new slow-growth era of politics, and 
when Galanter replaced Russell the firm was weakened at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas, on the other hand, has won approval for major projects in Los 
Angeles, Pasadena, Dallas and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, it was given permission by the city to build the 73-story First 
Interstate World Center and the 52-story Southern California Gas Center in 
exchange for an agreement to help finance the restoration of the downtown 
Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
"It is helpful to deal with a local firm," Galanter said.

LIBRARY VOLUNTEERS, STAFF HARD AT WORK ON 'HUGE JIGSAW PUZZLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a cluttered downtown workroom, Hector Quimby stared eagerly at more than 
10,000 dirty books. 
</P>
<P>
His mission was to clean up the literature -- but his weapon was a damp sponge, 
not a censor's pen. 
</P>
<P>
Quimby, 21, is one of 250 city library employees who, along with more than 400 
volunteers, are busy preparing the temporary home of the Central Library for 
its scheduled opening in mid-spring. 
</P>
<P>
On eight floors of the elegant former Design Center at 433 S. Spring St., 1.8 
million volumes will be housed, mainly in open stacks, until the landmark 
Central Library that was ravaged by two arson fires in 1986 reopens in about 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
The current move, long delayed as authorities dickered over sites and lease 
terms, is massive. While the new locale may be temporary, library officials 
said, it will nonetheless function as the largest public library in the Western 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no Mickey Mouse operation; I don't like to even call it temporary," 
library spokesman Robert G. Reagan emphasized. "It is the Central Library in 
its temporary location." 
</P>
<P>
With thousands of books that were packed in haste after the devastating fires 
arriving daily from three warehouses and two giant refrigeration facilities, 
Reagan compares the effort to making "a huge jigsaw puzzle come together." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the logistical challenge is the fact that librarians still do not 
know exactly which books they will have available to house on their portable, 
metal shelves. The two fires destroyed 400,000 volumes and damaged another 
700,000, so librarians are completing their inventory only as the books arrive 
in hundreds of moving cartons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coordinates Move 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying the shelving should go here, here and here," sighed principal 
librarian Leslie Nordby, who is coordinating the move. "But it's based upon 
nothing. We still don't have a good idea of what was in the freezers." 
</P>
<P>
The library rented the industrial freezers, which usually house frozen foods, 
to prevent mold and mildew from growing in books that suffered water damage. 
Last fall, the books were transfered to a Saugus drying chamber for what 
officials labeled the largest book-drying project ever. That, in turn, has led 
to the colossal cleaning operation. 
</P>
<P>
Trucked to Spring Street on 5-foot-square pallets, the books are moved by 
elevator to a ninth-floor processing center in a former furniture design 
showroom. 
</P>
<P>
For seven days a week since late November, work crews in this nerve center have 
cleaned and catalogued each volume, many of which are curled or sooty from 
water and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them that come in are really black, with a lot of ash deposits all 
over," said library clerk Quimby, whose blue shirt grew progressively dirtier 
as he scrubbed the cover of a volume entitled "Silver Bay Conference on Human 
Relations in Industry 1951-1954." "But this is something you'll tell your 
grandchildren that you were a part of." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beehive of Activity 
</P>
<P>
The block-long processing center, in which stacks of half-opened moving cartons 
stood piled in no discernable order, is a constant beehive of activity. 
</P>
<P>
In one corner, 10 employees and volunteers, several sporting radio headphones 
and surgical masks, sponged spines and covers one afternoon this week. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the brightly lit room, a group of volunteers matched the 
clean books to index cards in the library's imposing shelf list. In cases where 
cards could not be located, they made out new handwritten cards in order to 
complete a full inventory. 
</P>
<P>
Such work is seen as drudgery by most library employees. But the volunteers 
worked with a sense of mission that made the hours pass quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's boring, but so are a lot of things in life," asserted Ellie Shanahan, a 
free-lance fashion stylist who is between jobs. "I believe in books, so I think 
it's important that the library get back in order as soon as possible. And this 
gives me something to do instead of sitting at home waiting for the phone to 
ring." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catching Up on History 
</P>
<P>
The work also gave volunteers a chance to sneak quick peeks inside the eclectic 
tomes, which the other day ranged from a sewage disposal guide to an atlas of 
India. 
</P>
<P>
"You catch up on your history -- I just went through the Korean War with the 
USS Manchester," said Jean Wallace, a retired telephone operator from 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, hundreds of books and magazines fail to make it past the 
processing center. 
</P>
<P>
Those deemed not salvagable by the cleaning crew are placed on wooden book 
carts for a detailed perusal by principal librarians. If a second, cleaner copy 
is already in the library's collection, or, in the case of periodicals, the 
material is available on microfilm, damaged volumes are thrown into the 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a cavalier process," emphasized Pat Kiefer, the processing center's 
co-manager, as she picked up a dilapidated copy of "What Color Is My 
Parachute." The book's cover, once orange, was now black. "I know that we have 
several other copies in better shape," Kiefer explained, before tossing the 
book back in the discard bin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use Shopping Carts 
</P>
<P>
Books that survive the processing procedure are re-loaded into cartons and 
moved, by department and serial number, to the proper floor for shelving. 
There, workers employ shopping carts donated by Vons markets for the final 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's somewhat disheartening not doing your professional work," said Jack 
Vargas, an arts and music department employee as he pored through copies of 
American Painting Contractor magazine. "But what keeps us going is the goal of 
reopening the library." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the only portion of the temporary library open to the public is a 
nine-month-old, 3,000-volume Book Stop on the ground floor, which stocks best 
sellers, travel and children's books. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly one-fourth of the shelving for the full-service temporary library has 
been completed, including the entire history, arts and music collections -- 
housed in an ornate, marble-columned hall on the second floor of the 
60-year-old building. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, a shelving party is scheduled for the children's literature 
section on the ground floor of the temporary library. As always, the library is 
seeking additional volunteers to assist in the task. (Those interested may call 
612-3261.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Depend on Volunteers 
</P>
<P>
"There is a direct correlation between the number of volunteers and the timing 
of the (still undetermined) opening date," Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
With a new building -- rented for $8.3-million for 54 months -- and $10-million 
in new books from the Save the Books fund-raising effort, library officials 
said, they are eager to get off to a fresh start on Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
But they concede that the legacy of the 1986 fires will live on in the campfire 
smell and warped shape of many of the books on the new shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"When people use the library, they'll notice some of the books look a little 
strange," Reagan said. "But they must remember, the books have a history."

EPA AGREES TO DEVELOP PLAN TO CUT BASIN'S AIR POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawsuit to force the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to impose a federal 
clean air plan on the South Coast Air Basin has ended with an agreement by the 
EPA to develop its own plan by the spring of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, scheduled to be officially announced at a press conference 
today, is expected to put added pressure on the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District to approve its own controversial clean air plan, which is 
scheduled for a vote March 17. 
</P>
<P>
If the AQMD acts, and if its plan is approved by both the state and the EPA, it 
could be in effect within seven to eight months, well before the federal clean 
air plan could be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the federal plan would be waiting in the wings if the AQMD 
failed to adopt its proposal, or watered it down. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by the EPA with the Sierra Club and the Coalition for 
Clean Air. It is anticipated that the EPA will draw heavily on the local plan 
in fashioning its own air pollution control strategy. But some sources said 
they hope the EPA will go further and take additional steps where the AQMD 
lacks authority. 
</P>
<P>
In reaching the accord, the environmental groups made clear that their goal is 
to see that the EPA works in partnership with the state and AQMD. One 
government source, who asked to remain anonymous, said the idea is to make sure 
the federal plan includes measures that complement those proposed in the AQMD's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has previously acknowledged that it is legally required by the federal 
Clean Air Act to impose its own plan on the four-county basin if local air 
pollution officials fail to show that their plans will bring the area into 
compliance with clean air standards in time. 
</P>
<P>
But the EPA, reluctant to intervene, has until now hedged on saying when it 
must act. Last year, Mark Abramowitz, of the Coalition for Clean Air, and the 
Sierra Club filed suit in federal court to force the EPA to impose its own 
clean air plan on the South Coast Air Basin -- Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside 
and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
That eventually resulted in the EPA's concession that it did, in fact, have an 
obligation to impose its own plan if local plans missed the Clean Air Act 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD's plan, which would bring the air basin into compliance with federal 
Clean Air Act standards for ozone and carbon monoxide by the year 2007, calls 
for tough new controls on air pollution, including more stringent ride-sharing 
programs, conversion of fleet vehicles to cleaner-burning fuel and additional 
controls on emissions from electrical utilities, oil refineries and other 
stationary sources. 
</P>
<P>
That plan is roundly opposed by business and industry as too costly. Two 
industry giants, the Western States Petroleum Assn. and Southern California 
Edison, have each advanced alternative plans that they claim would meet one of 
the air pollution standards faster and at far less cost.

PICO-KENTER STORM DRAIN EXTENSION OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica and Los Angeles have agreed to build an underground pipe to 
channel contaminated rainwater from one of the area's most notorious storm 
drains deep into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The pipe, which will run 600 feet into Santa Monica Bay, will be an extension 
of the Pico-Kenter storm drain, which empties onto the beach at the western end 
of Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Pico-Kenter has long been considered one of the worst sources of pollution 
among the 64 storm drains that empty into the bay. Pollution from the drain has 
forced officials to close Santa Monica Beach on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The pipe will also have an alarm system to detect illegally dumped petroleum 
and other oil-based toxins. 
</P>
<P>
The pipe and alarm system will cost approximately $580,000. Under an agreement 
approved Tuesday night by the Santa Monica City Council, the cost of the 
project will be split evenly among Santa Monica, the city of Los Angeles and 
Los Angeles County.

FAMILY GETS $35,000 IN BRUTALITY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach City Council has approved a $35,000 settlement for a family that 
sued the city alleging police brutality and illegal entrance of their home by 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
The council, meeting in closed session, approved the settlement for William 
Westland, his wife and his two sons, Assistant City Atty. Robert Shannon said. 
Following a disagreement during a traffic stop, officers allegedly went to the 
Westland home in Long Beach, where a fight ensued and Westland and his sons 
were arrested. Westland also alleged he was beaten by officers en route to 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Westland pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace. But the sons were never 
prosecuted and, as part of the settlement, the city stipulated that they should 
not have been arrested, said E. Thomas Barham, attorney for the Westlands.

EMERGENCY ROOM'S CLOSURE DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at White Memorial Medical Center in East Los Angeles, who have been 
accused by county health officials of closing their emergency room to rescue 
ambulances without justification, said Wednesday that they were preparing to 
reopen just as health officials arrived for their spot check on Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
"We were completing a very busy period and preparing to reopen," they said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital officials acknowledged that eight beds for non-critical patients 
were empty when health officials arrived for the surprise visit. But they 
asserted that during the previous six hours the department had handled 28 
patients, many of whom were in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
They said they believe the hospital has complied with county guidelines that 
govern temporary closure of emergency rooms, but added that they may need 
"clarification."

JUDGE RECOMMENDS PROBATION, EXAM FOR GYNECOLOGIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Beverly Hills gynecologist, author and crusader against excess hysterectomies 
"appears to be an expert of her own creation" who overcharged patients and 
acted "incompetently" in some cases, a state administrative law judge has 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The finding, in the case of Dr. Vicki Georges Hufnagel, includes a 
recommendation that the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance place 
Hufnagel on five years of probation, require her to pass a competency 
examination, take a special medical ethics course and permit another physician 
to review her bills before they are sent to patients. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion of the administrative law judge, Robert A. Neher, is the latest 
development in a state license revocation case against Hufnagel originally 
filed in 1987 as a result of patients' complaints against her. Hufnagel, 
operator of the Institute for Reproductive Health, a Beverly Hills clinic, 
advocates surgical techniques that are an alternative to a hysterectomy. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Hufnagel -- a frequent guest on radio and television talk shows -- 
published "No More Hysterectomies," which was a broad indictment of the medical 
Establishment. In the book, Hufnagel advocated increased use of her own 
techniques, which she calls "female reconstructive surgery." 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion, sent to Hufnagel earlier this month and made available to The 
Times on Wednesday, Neher concluded that Hufnagel oversold her procedures, most 
of which are commonly performed by gynecological surgeons. Neher found that a 
letter to one patient amounted to "an instrument of terror" intended "to coerce 
the patient into returning for several procedures which (Hufnagel) had every 
reason to believe were unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
Neher found that Hufnagel performed procedures inadequately and repeatedly 
overcharged, demanding as much as $21,000 for services that should have cost a 
fraction of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Overblown View' 
</P>
<P>
Testimony in the revocation hearing, Neher concluded, established that 
Hufnagel's "zeal for her personal bill of fare got in the way of sound medical 
judgment in some cases and the standard of care in others. Her overblown view 
of her own knowledge and skill caused her to act incompetently in (still) 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Hufnagel, he concluded, "presents herself to patients, colleagues and (the 
Board of Medical Quality Assurance) as an innovator, a developer of new 
procedures and a crusader on the cutting edge. Rather, she appears to be an 
expert of her own creation, much like the entertainer or politician who begins 
to believe the truth of his own press releases." 
</P>
<P>
Neher concluded that Hufnagel's contention that overbilling resulted from 
innocent bookkeeping errors by her husband, who was acting as her business 
manager, "are found to be spurious." 
</P>
<P>
Hufnagel did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment on the judge's 
finding. 
</P>
<P>
Neher's recommendation is subject to alteration by the full medical board. The 
board is expected to allow Hufnagel several weeks to respond to the judge's 
finding.

L.A. GIVES TENTATIVE OK TO ANTI-SLUMLORD LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED VOLLMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An anti-slumlord ordinance authorizing the city to reduce rent payments until 
repairs are made to such things as clogged sewers and faulty wiring was 
tentatively approved Wednesday by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would give renters a chance to fight for repairs without fear of 
eviction, said Barbara Zeidman, the city's rent control coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basic Problems 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is the latest city measure aimed at landlords who fail to correct 
basic problems in their apartment buildings. Last November, the city enacted a 
law allowing tenants of certain dilapidated apartment buildings to place their 
rents into a special escrow account until repairs are made. 
</P>
<P>
Zeidman said the new ordinance will result in quicker action than the escrow 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new measure, a tenant may complain to the city's Building and Safety 
Department if defects are present in eight specific areas: 1) roofs, windows, 
walls and doors; 2) plumbing and gas lines; 3) hot and cold running water and 
sewer lines; 4) heating; 5) electric lighting; 6) trash cans; 7) floors, 
stairways and ceilings, and 8) the provision of a clean apartment when a tenant 
moves in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Citation 
</P>
<P>
A city building inspector investigating a complaint could cite a landlord, who 
in turn would have 60 days to either make repairs or appeal. Zeidman said that 
if a landlord could show that a tenant was responsible for a defect, no rent 
reduction would be ordered. 
</P>
<P>
She added that a landlord could begin eviction proceedings if a defect was 
tenant-caused. 
</P>
<P>
A special panel, called the Rent Adjustment Commission, would be able to reduce 
the rents of all affected tenants. A landlord may restore the rent to its 
original amount once repairs are made, after giving the tenant at least 30 
days' notice.

5-CITY TASK FORCE CONFISCATES COCAINE AND CASH IN 2 ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new five-city South Bay drug task force has arrested its first suspects and 
confiscated nearly $1 million worth of cocaine. It also has seized more than 
$500,000 in cash and an array of flak jackets and semiautomatic assault rifles, 
it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo Police Capt. Tim Grimmond said officers of the recently activated 
Westside Narcotic Enforcement Team (WESTNET) on Friday arrested Maria Minfa 
Espinoza, 36, at a house in La Puente and Eduardo Torres Castro, 25, at another 
home in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In La Puente, Grimmond said, officers found Espinoza and a child who was 
walking out of the house carrying a package wrapped like a gift. It contained 
$275,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the home, he said, the officers found another $250,000 as well as 15 
weapons -- most of them semiautomatic AK-47s, AK-15s and Uzis. The others 
included automatic pistols and shotguns. All were wrapped as though being sent 
somewhere, Grimmond said, adding that "it's hard to say where." Either that, he 
said, or they had just been delivered. 
</P>
<P>
At the Santa Ana location, Grimmond said, task force members arrested Castro 
and found nine pounds of pure cocaine with a street value of $900,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests, said Grimmond, followed a 15-day investigation into drug deals in 
the South Bay. "This is a very affluent area," Grimmond said. "There is a lot 
of money here and cocaine is the drug of choice. There is so much of it coming 
in." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to stem the flood, the police chiefs of El Segundo, Inglewood, 
Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Palos Verdes Estates began organizing the 
task force last summer and it became operational in mid-January.

SKID ROW SUMMIT CALLED LIKELY TO RESULT IN EASED POLICE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As police and the mayor's staff prepare for a summit today on controversial new 
methods to clean up Skid Row, sources close to the issue say the city will 
attempt to ease the LAPD's hard-line policy slightly, while still backing the 
thrust of the new strategy of confining transients to specific street corners. 
</P>
<P>
City officials including Mayor Tom Bradley have consistently said the police 
actions are in keeping with city policies, but privately some of these 
officials say that some police activities may be too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-January, police have been rousting the homeless from doorways, 
breaking up sidewalk gatherings and reportedly marching the street people to 
missions that are already filled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Matter of Personalities 
</P>
<P>
Some sources say the meeting may well focus on the personalities of the 
controversy as much as the policies themselves. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the debate is LAPD Central Division Capt. Jerry Conner, who 
spearheaded the recent police effort, and Skid Row activist Alice Callaghan, 
who has led the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Conner, known among admirers and critics alike as "Cowboy," is recognized as a 
tough, strong-willed cop unafraid to make controversial decisions. Callaghan, a 
veteran street organizer, is dedicated to defending Skid Row as the community 
of last resort for the poor and routinely takes her case against the police to 
senior city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of human dynamics here," said one city official, adding that 
"much of this is a personal matter (and) I hope they get to it." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is closed to the public and special-interest groups, but is still 
being closely followed by homeless activists and area merchants who have been 
actively lobbying participants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protests Planned 
</P>
<P>
Some activists have told city officials that they intend to begin a series of 
sit-ins and other civil disobedience to protest the police crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
At least one City Council member has also joined the dispute. Robin Kramer, an 
aide to Councilman Richard Alatorre, said the councilman's office has asked to 
be informed of the meeting's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer said the "behind-closed-doors meeting . . . is probably a good place to 
start" for a solution to Skid Row's problems. "We will follow things up if 
legislative action seems appropriate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Area businessmen, who prodded the police into action earlier this year, said 
they are pleased with the results of the crackdown, but are not convinced that 
the methods are entirely proper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Are Concerned 
</P>
<P>
Charles Woo, president of the Central City East Assn., said the policy of 
concentrating the homeless at the shelters may need some fine-tuning. "It 
sounds logical . . . but I'm not sure it will (continue to) work smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
Central City East officials and homeless service providers alike said that the 
city meeting should have included members of the community.

A District Court jury in Las Vegas has found San Diego data processor Howard 
Lee Haupt innocent of a murder charge in the slaying of a 7-year-old California 
boy at a state-line casino nearly 15 months ago. "I'm very pleased that the 
justice system works," a visibly shaken Haupt said after the verdict was read. 
Roxanne Harris, the mother of victim Alexander Harris, sobbed loudly and put 
her head in her hands. The jury rendered the verdict after a five-week trial. 
The Harris boy disappeared Nov. 27, 1987, from Whiskey Pete's casino on the 
California-Nevada border southwest of Las Vegas. His body was found a month 
later, and Haupt was arrested in the case a year ago.

The same destructive process that opened a hole in the Earth's protective ozone 
layer over Antarctica is operating in the Arctic, the head of Canada's ozone 
research team said. Dr. Wayne Evans said there was a "crater" of ozone 
depletion over Scandinavia during the first week of February. The result of a 
thinner ozone layer is increased penetration of the sun's ultraviolet 
radiation, leading to increased skin cancer, eye damage and damage to crops. 
The Canadian research team, operating in the Northwest Territories, discovered 
some ozone depletion in the Arctic in 1986. The ozone problem first gained wide 
attention in 1985 when British scientists discovered a 40% loss in springtime 
ozone levels centered over Antarctica.

Brazil's court of appeals has dropped charges against two Indians who lobbied 
abroad against construction of dams on their land and a U.S. scientist who 
served as their interpreter, a court official announced. Charges against Kaiapo 
tribe leaders Kubei Kaiapo and Paulinho Paiakan were dropped after the federal 
court ruled that they could not be tried. Charges against scientist Darrel 
Posey were also dropped. A $250-million World Bank loan for electrical projects 
on the Xingu River was frozen as a result of the protest.

A quick, 10-word memory test developed by researchers to help identify 
Alzheimer's patients in early stages of the brain disorder has won praise from 
the American Medical Assn. The test, which takes less than 10 minutes, seems to 
be "a brief, efficient and accurate means of predicting Alzheimer's" in elderly 
patients, the AMA said in a statement. The 10 words used in the test are 
chimney, salt, harp, button, meadow, train, flower, finger, rub and book. The 
University of Minnesota researchers who developed the test report that it is 
95.2% accurate in distinguishing elderly people with early signs of Alzheimer's 
disease from those with no sign of mental impairment. Most of the Alzheimer's 
patients were able to recall no more than two of the words when tested on their 
memory of them.

Britain and the United States pressed other nations Wednesday to be more 
vigilant in screening passengers and baggage after the bombing of a Pan Am jet 
over Scotland last December. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals for tighter security were received favorably by most members of 
the 33-nation council of the International Civil Aviation Organization before 
it began a two-day conference here on safety, officials from both Britain and 
the United States said. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States requested the meeting of members of the U.N. 
group after the Dec. 21 air disaster when a bomb ripped apart a Pan Am jetliner 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.

A court in Geneva has agreed to help the Haitian government recover money 
former President Jean-Claude Duvalier put in Swiss banks, legal aides said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A magistrates court, meeting behind closed doors, rejected an appeal by the 
ousted dictator against a court decision last October to provide the Haitian 
government with documents seized in two Geneva banks, the aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Poncet, lawyer for Duvalier, said he will appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Haitian government, accusing Duvalier of embezzlement of public funds, 
asked Swiss authorities in Geneva, Zurich and Lausanne for legal assistance in 
June, 1986. Duvalier's assets in the three cantons have been frozen since 
April, 1986.

More than half of all deaths from drug reactions occur among older Americans, 
Wednesday warning of widespread medication problems among the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the Health and Human Services Department's inspector general 
pointed to improper use of drugs by the elderly, misdiagnoses of their 
conditions by doctors, inappropriate dosage levels and dangerous combinations 
of prescribed drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"A growing body of evidence accumulated over the past 10 years indicates that 
mismedication of the elderly has become a critical health care issue, labeled 
by some as the 'nation's other drug problem,"' said the report by the inspector 
General Richard P. Kusserow. 
</P>
<P>
Americans over age 60, who comprise 17% of the population, account for 39% of 
all hospitalizations and 51% of deaths from drug reactions, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to the report: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1985, an estimated 243,000 older Americans were hospitalized for adverse 
reactions to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Every year, 32,000 elderly adults fracture their hips in drug-induced 
falls. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 160,000 older adults experience serious mental impairment either caused or 
worsened by drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two million elderly Americans are addicted or at risk of addiction to 
tranquilizers or sleeping pills because of daily use for at least one year. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the problems will worsen when government drug payments under 
Medicare begin unless an effective drug-use review system is developed. 
Congress directed the Health and Human Services Department to develop such a 
system as part of the catastrophic health insurance program created under 
Medicare last year. 
</P>
<P>
The drug benefit will begin in 1991, with the government paying part of the 
cost of outpatient prescription drugs that exceed $600 a year for a Medicare 
recipient. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited several weaknesses in the drug therapy delivery system, 
including inadequate information about appropriate dosage levels for older 
people. Most drugs are tested on healthy young adults. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that physicians are untrained in the area of geriatric 
pharmacology, and that many elderly people often fail to take their medications 
as directed.

SIMI VALLEY BUILDS ITS EDGE AT THE LINE, 72-66 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four more for two. It has a certain ring to it. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not as poetic as 'One more for four' -- Simi Valley High's official 
motto for this season that told of its desire to win a fourth consecutive 
Marmonte League title -- and probably not as realistic. But mottoes are really 
only rallying cries. 
</P>
<P>
And by virtue of a 72-66 win over Santa Barbara in the first round of the 
Southern Section 5-AA Division playoffs Wednesday at Simi Valley, the Pioneers 
can go ahead and rally all they want. Should they keep winning, the Pioneers 
have four more playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley will play Long Beach Millikan at a site to be determined by a coin 
flip today. 
</P>
<P>
"Look how far we've come," said guard Steve Carnes, the lone returnee from last 
season's 4-A champion. "People didn't even expect us to win league and now 
we're in the second round of the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
And, interestingly enough, the Pioneers advanced because of their clutch 
free-throw shooting -- an advantage usually enjoyed by playoff-toughened teams. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley made 13 of 17 free throws in the final 1:58, 16 of 23 in the fourth 
quarter and 30 of 44 (68%) in a tightly called game that had 52 calls. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara, the Channel League's third-place representative, was awarded 16 
free throws and made 10. Five Dons fouled out to only one player for Simi 
Valley. Santa Barbara Coach Bob Purdy, who appeared fairly ruffled by the calls 
during the game, was diplomatic afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the refs," he said. "We played rotten." 
</P>
<P>
The Dons had a chance to roll over in the fourth quarter when they trailed by 
13 with 5:10 to play. But an 11-0 run brought Santa Barbara to within 57-55 
with three minutes left before Simi Valley began its free-throw exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Carnes made four in a row, then missed one. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Marciano split a pair with 57 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
George Talledo made good twice with 40 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Marciano made two of four (he missed two technical foul shots) with 33 seconds 
remaining, then added two with 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Carnes finished off the Dons with three seconds left, making two. 
</P>
<P>
"We did get a little tense," Carnes said, "but we got our act together and made 
our free throws." 
</P>
<P>
Carnes finished with 21 points and Marciano, who made five of six three-point 
shots, had 24. Marciano was the picture of confidence halfway through the third 
quarter, pulling up on a fast break to hit his fifth three-point shot of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit a couple with a guy hanging right on him," Purdy said. "Nothing you can 
do about that." 
</P>
<P>
While Carnes and Marciano carried the scoring load, forward Dennis Cook was 
doing a number on Santa Barbara's front line -- namely sophomore center Matt 
Purdy. Purdy, who averages 15 points a game, scored three -- all in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me he's a good scorer," Cook said. "But I figured he couldn't score 
if he didn't get the ball. And I guess I did my job." 
</P>
<P>
Purdy made one of five field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Cook and Marciano actually have some playoff experience. They were added to 
Simi Valley's playoff roster last season and saw limited playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"Two minutes and 43 seconds," Cook said with a laugh. "But I can't be sure." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bob Purdy, who is Matt's father: "Our big guys could've killed them. I 
don't think any of them had more than four points." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley led at halftime, 28-25, again on the strength of its free-throw 
shooting. The Pioneers made 10 of 14. Santa Barbara made four of six. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Perkins, however, led the Dons back. He scored 18 of his game-high 25 
points in the second half, including 12 from three-point range. The Pioneers 
staved off Perkins' run, however, from one-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"Four more for two?" Bradshaw repeated. "That's a good one."

FAITH BAPTIST SQUEEZES PAST L.A. BAPTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After L. A. Baptist High barely squeezed into the Southern Section 1-A Division 
playoffs, the Knights barely missed knocking Faith Baptist from postseason play 
Wednesday night at Faith Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist (17-8), which finished fourth in the Alpha League, had a chance 
to advance to the second round of the playoffs, but Brett Craig's three-point 
attempt from the baseline clanked off the front of the rim as time expired, 
allowing Faith Baptist to escape with a 43-42 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist (18-5) took a seven-point halftime lead but led only 32-29 after 
three quarters. The Contenders faltered slightly in the final period, allowing 
the Knights to tie the score, 38-38, with 3:32 remaining. But the Contenders 
scored the next four points and led, 42-38, with 1:44 left. 
</P>
<P>
Craig then pulled L. A. Baptist to within one with 1:10 to play when he nailed 
a three-point shot from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
After point guard Dave Hairston made a free throw with 44 seconds left to give 
the Contenders a 43-41 lead, L. A. Baptist guard Dave Garcia had a chance to 
tie the score with 10 seconds left but converted only the first of two free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist was led by a team-high 16 points and seven rebounds from 
6-foot-10 center Jason Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist, which beat the Knights, 54-40, in December, fell prey to L. A. 
Baptist's slow pace in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We're usually a fast-breaking team," Contender Coach Dean Lobdell said. "They 
slowed us down a little bit and my guys got pretty tired." 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist took a 10-6 first-quarter lead and increased the advantage to 
20-11 with 2:39 remaining in the half after a 10-5 run sparked by Henderson's 
six points. 
</P>
<P>
Craig, who finished with a game-high 24 points, scored eight of his team's 12 
third-quarter points to lead the Knights' second-half surge. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia had 12 assists for the Knights (17-8). Contender forward Tim Erwing had 
nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Baptist was 17 of 47 (36.2%) from the field and seven of 12 (58.3%) from 
the free-throw line. Faith Baptist shot 34.5% (19 of 55) from the field.

BAYLES' BIG QUARTER PROPELS CRESCENTA VALLEY, 74-65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first half of Crescenta Valley's Southern Section 4-A Division playoff 
opener Wednesday night, it appeared as if Falcon senior guard David Bayles 
would be relegated to a cameo role. 
</P>
<P>
Reasoning that Bayles' poor outside shooting would not help Crescenta Valley's 
cause against the 3-2 press of Newbury Park, Coach John Goffredo sat him down 
58 seconds into the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Bayles' bid for playoff heroics wasn't over. When Newbury Park switched to 
a 2-3 zone in the second half, Bayles caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
Bayles scored all of his career-high 14 points in the fourth quarter as 
Crescenta Valley ran off a late flurry to take a 74-65 win at Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Bayles' timely run and Crescenta Valley's superior balance was more than enough 
to put away the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park forward Wayne Cook scored a game-high 30 points, but his team went 
cold in the final three minutes. He made 13 of 27 field-goal attempts as the 
team consistently looked to him for the big basket. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our No. 1 player and the best athlete I've ever coached," Newbury Park 
Coach Ken Barone said. "So he has to have the green light to shoot whenever he 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Bayles who shot down Newbury Park (13-11). 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 59-58, with 2:55 to play, Crescenta Valley (16-8) mounted a 14-6 run. 
</P>
<P>
Bayles scored eight of the Falcons' points in the run, scoring on a jump shot, 
two layups and a pair of free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Cook tried in vain to answer Bayles, scoring seven of Newbury Park's final 18 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, a senior who will attend UCLA on a football scholarship in the fall, made 
three of six from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, however, was unable to do it alone. Crescenta Valley held a 48-47 lead 
heading into the fourth quarter, but outscored Newbury Park, 26-18, over the 
final eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cook was one of only two Panthers to reach double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Falzone scored 11 for Newbury Park and teammate Amir El Farra added 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
When it counted, Crescenta Valley knocked off Newbury Park with a depth charge. 
</P>
<P>
John Gilmore scored 12 points and teammates Paul Matijasevic and Brian Cortes 
each added 10. 
</P>
<P>
Lamar Breeding, who was promoted from the junior varsity last week, scored a 
career-high 15 points for Crescenta Valley, 13 in the first three quarters to 
keep the Falcons close.

24 YEARS LATER, TARTARS AVENGE BIGGEST LOSS -- TOPPLE SERVITE, 59-52 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It took 24 years, but Torrance High finally avenged the biggest basketball loss 
in school history Wednesday night in the first round of the Southern Section 
4-AA Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance played host to Servite of Anaheim, which dealt the Tartars a 62-60 
loss in the 1965 2-A championship game at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
There was a different ending this time as Torrance parlayed an aggressive 
defensive effort and big fourth quarter into a 59-52 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Tartars (15-10), third-place finishers in the Bay League, advance to the 
second round of the playoffs Friday night at Freeway League co-champion Sunny 
Hills of Fullerton (17-8), which had a first-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance overcame a sluggish performance by opening the fourth quarter with a 
10-0 run to take the lead for good at 48-42. Servite, dogged by the Tartars' 
full-court pressure, did not score until 4:05 had elapsed in the period. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to press a little bit more in the second half," said Torrance Coach 
Carl Strong, who celebrated his first playoff victory in four years. "We tried 
to use the press to get something going, to start a heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
Servite (12-11), which tied for third in the Angelus League, was hurt by 
turnovers (22) and poor free-throw shooting (6 for 18). Torrance made 20 of 30 
foul shots, including 10 of 15 in the decisive fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were fortunate tonight," Strong said. "Free throws won the game. 
They missed theirs and we made ours." 
</P>
<P>
The Tartars needed defense and free throws on a night that their top scorer, 
junior guard Rick Robison, suffered through his third straight poor shooting 
game. Robison led all scorers with 26 points but made only 6 of 20 shots. He 
was better at the foul line, converting 11 of 13. 
</P>
<P>
Center Art Terrill added 13 points and 7 rebounds for Torrance and point guard 
Ray Wang passed off for 10 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Steve Marusich led Servite with 18 points but was held in check after 
scoring 10 in the first quarter. Strong made a defensive switch in the second 
quarter, putting forward Toby Wollard on Marusich. That, along with foul 
trouble, kept Servite's top player quiet the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Servite point guard Chris Johnson, who spent last fall handing off to 
All-American running back Derek Brown as the Friars' quarterback, helped his 
team take a 42-38 lead in the third quarter by scoring 11 of his 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
But Torrance took control by scoring 10 unanswered points to open the fourth 
quarter. Forward Matt Cummins capped the streak by stealing the ball from 
Johnson and hitting a layup. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the Tartars kept Servite at a distance by hitting 6 of 11 free 
throws in the final three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard 91, Long Beach Wilson 70 -- The home-team Vikings exploded for a 
24-11 fourth quarter to pull away from a close game. Center Ed Stokes led four 
Vikings in double figures with 29 points, 18 rebounds and 9 blocked shots and 
had several powerful rebound dunks in the second half when St. Bernard took 
control. Forward Terrell Steen had 9 points in the second half and finished 
with 15 points and 12 rebounds. Forward Juno Armstrong scored 10 points in the 
second half and 13 overall. Guard Marc Raveling added 21 points, and point 
guard Sean Patikas had 9 points and 14 assists as St. Bernard improved to 23-5. 
Sheldon Grigsby kept Wilson (15-13) close with 21 points, including five 
3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune noted of his dominating 6-11 center, "Edward 
(Stokes) seems to be playing meaner now. It's happening at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat 75, West Torrance 51 -- In a 4-A Division game at La Puente, 
visiting West High stayed close for a half but Amat pulled away for an easy 
victory behind star Jason Green. West, an at-large playoff selection, finishes 
at 12-13. Amat improved to 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside 55, San Marino 50 -- The Monarchs, the fourth seed in the 3-A 
Division, built a 15-point lead in the third quarter, then held off a late San 
Marino charge at Morningside. The visitors hit six 3-pointers in the fourth 
quarter to make it close. Morningside (21-4) had three players in double 
figures: Eddie Scott with 14, Chris Vance with 13 and Jeff Crowe with 10. The 
Monarchs led, 29-18, at the half and expanded the lead in the third quarter, 
then pulled in the defense and almost paid for it. San Marino finished at 
14-10. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff 73, Miraleste 53 -- In a 2-AA Division opener at Bellarmine-Jefferson 
in Burbank, free-lance selection Miraleste took an early 11-10 lead, but 
Bell-Jeff switched to a full-court press that forced 14 turnovers in the second 
quarter and the host team took a 30-20 halftime lead. Bell-Jeff forced 32 
turnovers and pulled away in the second half behind center Nick Sanderson's 22 
points. He finished with 30. Scott Klein and David Terrell led the Marauders, 
who finish at 15-6, with 14 points apiece. Bell-Jeff is 20-4. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep 62, Chadwick 53 -- In a 1-A Division opener at Montclair, 
Chadwick pulled to within 1 point in the fourth quarter but fell short. 
Montclair (18-9) led, 28-19, at the half and built a 12-point lead in the third 
quarter, but Chadwick came back behind the shooting of Gary Calissi, who hit 
three 3-pointers on the way to 15 points. Dolphin center Larry Williams was in 
foul trouble much of the game and finished with only 8 points and 8 rebounds. 
The Dolphins finish the season at 8-16.

Redondo 74, California 68 -- In another 4-A Division playoff at Cal High in 
Whittier, Redondo got two late 3-pointers from Ian Martin to wipe out a 60-57 
deficit and outscore the home team, 14-8, in the last three minutes. The Sea 
Hawks hit 25 of 35 free throws, which proved decisive. Martin scored 10 points 
in the fourth quarter and 20 in the game as Redondo improved to 18-8. The Sea 
Hawks' David Dinnel led all scorers with 28 points, 15 in the first quarter. 
Redondo will play host to second-seeded St. Paul on Friday. Cal High finished 
at 16-8. 
</P>

Mary Star 86, Brentwood 77 -- In a 1-A Division game at Brentwood, at-large 
selection Mary Star improved to 17-7 in knocking off the Delphic League champ. 
The Stars took control with a 21-9 third quarter. Five Star players scored in 
double figures led by George Pisano's 23 and Rich Negrete's 21, including three 
3-pointers. Brentwood bows out at 14-9.

points on 18-for-27 shooting to lead the top-seeded Titans to a first-round win 
in the 3-A playoffs at Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
With Lompoc pressuring the Titans' outside shooters, Rolling Hills worked the 
ball inside to Hardy with success. They made only four 3-point shots and didn't 
put the game away until late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play very well," said Rolling Hills Coach Cliff Warren. "But we got 
the ball into John." 
</P>
<P>

the second round Friday night. A coin flip will determine the home team.

NORTHRIDGE SHOOTS FOR 4TH WIN WITH WINLESS MASTER'S ON DECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge baseball team is off to a 3-0 start and with winless 
Master's College visiting Matador Field for a nonconference game at 2:30 this 
afternoon, the streak is likely to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge Coach Bill Kernen is pleased with a pitching staff that has 
surrendered just one earned run in 27 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very good pitching, but it's not surprising," Kernen said. "We've 
played two games away from home in places where balls do not carry very well." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors will get their sternest test of the season Friday when they travel 
to Cal State Long Beach to play the Division I 49ers, who won their first eight 
games this season under former Loyola Marymount and Valley College Coach Dave 
Snow. 
</P>
<P>
Master's disasters: Master's, which is 0-4-1 overall and 0-2 in NAIA District 3 
play, has been tied or in the lead entering the ninth inning in four of its 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a problem in the ninth throwing the ground ball for the final out," 
Master's Coach Pat Harrison said. "We've played some pretty good teams, so in 
one sense it's good to know that we were within one out of winning in four of 
those games." 
</P>
<P>
Mirror, mirror on the ball: Jeff Preston, who plays first base for Master's, 
has hit three home runs in the Mustangs' first five games, and the redshirt 
sophomore from Placerville, Calif., says that he's doing it with mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked a lot on my swing over the fall," said Preston, who is batting 
.357 after missing last season because of a shoulder injury. "We had a lot of 
time inside and a lot of time to swing in front of mirrors and stuff like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Walk this way: To Occidental College pitchers, the strike zone must appear to 
be just a shade larger than a postage stamp. 
</P>
<P>
In their first two games -- both losses -- Tiger pitchers allowed 23 runs and 
21 walks. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal Lutheran, it is the fielders who have failed to get a grip. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen have committed 16 errors in losing three of their first five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
No spring chickens: Coach Chuck Ferrero likes to call it Super Bowl Fever. 
That's the ailment that strikes the handful of out-of-shape and over-the-hill 
hopefuls who show up every spring expecting to take part in spring football 
workouts at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrero turns them away before they step on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have never seen them or heard about them, I turn them away," Ferrero 
said. "They usually don't last more than a day and a half." 
</P>
<P>
Playoff scramble: Regional basketball playoff tournaments for California junior 
colleges will begin Feb. 25, and Valley and Glendale are still in the running 
for a berth. 
</P>
<P>
Under this year's format, four Western State Conference teams will receive 
automatic bids. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica, the top-ranked team in the state, is in first place in the WSC 
followed by Ventura, Oxnard, Glendale and Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the WSC, Southern California, South Coast, Orange Empire, 
Foothill and Pacific Coast conferences will take part in the 26-team, 
three-round Southern regional. The top four teams will advance to the state 
finals March 9-11 in Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Anticlimactic: They might as well do away with the junior college state 
baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
After all, odds are that the winner of this week's annual Casey Stengel 
tournament at Rancho Santiago and Cerritos colleges will be the eventual state 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Cerritos won the Stengel tournament and went on to win the state 
title. College of the Canyons did the same in 1986 and Cerritos did it again in 
1987. Last season, Rancho Santiago won the tournament and finished second in 
the state behind Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (2-2) opens play in the eight-team tournament today against Pima 
(Ariz.) at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Hostile hosts: Cal State Northridge was not a friendly place for the University 
of Manitoba (Canada) volleyball team Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
First, Northridge staved off defeat by coming back twice in the fourth game 
before going on to win the five-game match. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after several Manitoba players retired to the locker room, they were 
forced to stay there for 45 minutes after someone mistakenly locked them 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
"They finally got someone to open the door and it was like, 'Nice hospitality,' 
" Northridge Coach John Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge improved to 3-4 with the victory, but the Matadors are still without 
a win (0-4) in the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. Northridge travels 
to UC Santa Barbara tonight and Stanford on Saturday for WIVA matches. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors will be bolstered by the return of outside hitter Bob Samuelson 
who was reinstated to the team after being suspended last week for disciplinary 
reasons. Samuelson sat out Stanford's sweep over Northridge last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line was miscommunication," Price said. "We talked things out on 
Monday. I think he understands what I need and want from him and he told me a 
couple of things that will help both of us in terms of communication."

<P>
DEFENSIVE EFFORT POWERS BELL-JEFF TO 1ST-ROUND WIN OVER MIRALESTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hawking defense and a high-scoring offense powered Bell-Jeff High to the 
final of the Southern Section 1-A Division playoffs last year. The Guards used 
those same elements to defeat Miraleste, 73-53, in a first-round game of the 
2-AA Division playoffs Wednesday night at Bell-Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 11-10, at the end of the first quarter, Bell-Jeff outscored 
Miraleste, 20-9, in the second quarter. The Guards forced 14 of Miraleste's 32 
turnovers during the period and made 10 of 16 shots from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"We switched up our defenses on them," Bell-Jeff Coach Joe Dunn said. "And it 
seemed to confuse them." 
</P>
<P>
The Guards went from a halfcourt trap to a fullcourt man-to-man defense that 
led to several easy baskets. In addition, Nick Sanderson scored eight of his 
game-high 30 points in the second period after going scoreless in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Nick was forcing some shots early in the game," Dunn said. "But we got our 
double screen in the lane going in the second quarter and he's hard to stop 
then." 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff (20-4), which snapped a two-game losing streak, also outrebounded the 
taller Marauders, 29-22. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson had nine rebounds and guard Chris Dyer had eight to go with 13 points 
and five assists. 
</P>
<P>

Ray McDavid set a San Diego Section record with 10 three-pointers and finished 
with 48 points and 17 rebounds to lead Clairemont High School past Kearny, 
85-84, in overtime in a City Western League game Wednesday at Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
Clairemont had 14 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Facing a box-and-one defense, McDavid, a 6-foot-2 senior guard, made 10 of 11 
three-point attempts and 8 of 11 inside the three-point line. His three-pointer 
with 3 seconds left in regulation sent the game into overtime.

<P>
"We would get down by seven or eight points and Ray would just shoot us back 
into it by canning a couple three-pointers," Clairemont Coach Greg Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny (11-13, 3-6) was ahead most of the game on the strength of 29-of-35 
free-throw shooting. Clairemont (12-14, 4-5) made 9 of 15.

Heidi West, who helped Francis Parker High School to three state division 1-A 
volleyball titles, said Wednesday night she will attend Georgetown University 
on a volleyball scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
West, a 6-foot-1 middle blocker, selected Georgetown over William and Mary. She 
also took trips to Virgina and Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the hardest thing in the world," she said. "I debated for two days." 
</P>
<P>
West, a three-time all-section player, said she choose Georgetown for its 
strong academic reputation and its inner-city environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it would be a bigger challenge going (to Georgetown)," she said. 
"William and Mary is in a small college town. I think after four years it might 
be too safe and too easy and become too comfortable."

'HEADHUNTER' SURVEY; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S HARD TO DRAW EXECUTIVE TALENT TO THE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHACHTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California may be pricing itself out of the competition for top 
corporate talent, according to a survey on executive relocation released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 70% of personnel officers in large Southland companies surveyed by 
Russell Reynolds Associates, a headhunting firm, said it has become difficult 
to recruit executives to jobs in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest reason: skyrocketing housing costs, cited by 90% of the 129 
personnel officers questioned. Traffic congestion and smog are the other big 
deterrents to putting down stakes in the Southland, the survey says. 
</P>
<P>
"This is creating a real inhibition on getting executives and talent outside 
California to move here," said Harry Usher, the former Los Angeles Olympic 
Organizing Committee executive who is Russell Reynolds' managing director in 
Los Angeles. "It's not just the cost of housing or the cost of relocating, but 
it's also the concerns about the quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
The survey of firms with at least 500 employees and $50 million in annual sales 
offers further fuel for the economists, politicians and slow-growth activists 
who have been warning that Southern California may be choking on its own 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the region's population continues to surge, they have worried that a 
shortage of affordable housing, jammed highways and polluted air eventually 
will make the Southland unattractive to migrants from elsewhere in the United 
States and from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
That scenario -- hinted at in the Russell Reynolds survey -- could snuff out 
Southern California's economic advances and send the region into a tailspin, 
these experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"The question I would ask is whether we're robbing ourselves of a needed skill 
base," said David Hensley, director of California forecasting for the UCLA 
Business Forecasting Project, which has warned of a coming day of reckoning for 
the Southland's booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Just given the links between the pricing of homes and growth in the economy, 
we would expect there would be some dampening effect," added Adrian R. Sanchez, 
associate economist at Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. "But 
there's no way of quantifying it or saying when, in fact, the other shoe will 
drop." 
</P>
<P>
The personnel officers questioned by Russell Reynolds said Southern 
California's economic climate and weather still are viewed as attractive by top 
executives weighing job offers here. And nearly half of all top executives 
still are being recruited from outside the Southland -- 16% from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, recruiters say it has become common for executives from other 
areas to turn down jobs because of Southern California's perceived problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lost many candidates due to the fact the cost of living is too high or we 
couldn't make a salary offer that matched the cost of living," said John 
McFarland, senior personnel analyst for Executive Life Insurance Co. in West 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Postage-Stamp Lot' 
</P>
<P>
Headhunters tell stories of spouses -- wives, most often, of male executives 
considering a move to Southern California -- who visit the area on a 
house-hunting trip and are stunned to learn how little their housing dollars 
will buy. 
</P>
<P>
In other regions, Usher said, it's not unusual for a well paid executive to be 
able to live on a half-acre or acre estate without having more than an hour's 
commute to the office. Few areas in Southern California offer that opportunity, 
he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost, emotionally, of coming into a postage-stamp lot . . . can be great," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors reported only a day ago that median home prices 
in Orange County, at $231,200, are the highest in the nation. The Los Angeles 
area, at $191,200, ranked fourth. San Diego, at $157,200, ranked eighth. Prices 
have climbed 20% to 30% or more annually throughout the region since the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Southern California is not the only area where living costs may fast be 
becoming prohibitive. ESL Inc., a Silicon Valley defense contractor, said 
Wednesday that high land and housing costs and clogged freeways in Sunnyvale 
may prompt it to move nearly a third of its operations to less congested 
Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
Companies have adopted a host of strategies to combat the Southland's soaring 
housing costs -- nearly all of them expensive. According to the Russell 
Reynolds survey, a majority of bigger firms pick up at least part of the cost 
of selling executives' old homes and purchasing their new ones, while four in 
10 pay for the services of a relocation consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line: Over a third of relocations cost more than $40,000, according 
to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Most companies, however, have not yet responded to one of the major obstacles 
to executive relocation -- helping spouses find a new job. Fewer than one in 
four offer such assistance, the survey found, though 81% of the respondents 
said it was at least "somewhat" difficult to recruit executives whose wives 
also are professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Another growing problem, according to the survey, is convincing divorced 
parents to relocate to Southern California when the move means leaving children 
behind with a former spouse. The survey also reported that parents with 
children of high school age resist relocating.

$150-MILLION CHARGE BY NORTHROP PRODUCES A FOURTH-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop reported Wednesday that it took a $150-million charge against earnings 
on secret defense contracts, leaving the firm with a loss of $86.1 million on 
sales of $1.73 billion in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The company declined to answer questions about the writeoff except to say that 
it did not occur on the B-2 stealth bomber but on fixed-price research and 
development contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop is currently working on a highly secret program to develop a new 
cruise missile, a program known as the Joint Tactical Missile System (JTACMS), 
it was learned. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop won the program in a competition against Lockheed several years ago. 
Defense industry sources knowledgeable about the program said in interviews 
last year that it has a current value of several billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, reports of cost overruns and delays on the program surfaced last 
year. JTACMS was originally part of another program, known as the Army Tactical 
Missile System, but it was separated several years ago. The Army missile system 
is under development by LTV. 
</P>
<P>
An industry source familiar with both programs decribed the Northrop missile as 
a conventional standoff weapon, meaning that it is a long-range, non-nuclear 
missile. It is not known how it would differ from other cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop said it seeking "an equitable settlement" on money-losing contracts 
and that its $150-million charge could be either reduced or increased. It said 
it has not booked any profit on the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The $150-million charge took aerospace analysts by surprise. In the fourth 
quarter, the company lost money in every business segment. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop took an an undisclosed loss provision in its electronics segment for 
several fixed-price development contracts on electronic countermeasures 
products in the fourth quarter, it said. Earlier in the year, it had taken $12 
million in cumulative provisions in that area. In one bright note, the company 
reported that its long-troubled MX missile guidance program is now profitable 
and deliveries are running ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
For the full year, Northrop earned $104.2 million on sales of $5.8 billion, 
compared to a profit of $94.2 million on sales of $6.05 billion the year 
earlier. But both years were affected by significant non-operating gains and 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
For 1988, Northrop had an operating loss of about $30.9 million, before a 
$135.1-million positive tax adjustment taken in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts had been expecting the company to earn nearly $200 million 
before extraordinary gains in 1988, so the year has been a significant 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities saw a silver lining in 
the disclosure of the $150-million writeoff. 
</P>
<P>
"They are $150 million poorer than we thought they would be, but they have the 
potential for billions in additional business that we didn't know about 
before," he said, not referring specifically to JTACMS.

Chrysler Corp. said an internal audit discovered "irregularities" in its 
facilities management department, and it will take appropriate personnel 
actions to deal with the problems. Chrysler refused to discuss the nature of 
the problems, but a source at the auto maker said the investigation reportedly 
involved kickbacks to suppliers. The facilities management department, based at 
the company's headquarters in Highland Park, Mich., has responsibility for 
everything from orders placed with outside suppliers to running the Chrysler 
headquarters' cafeteria. The company said the audit was begun after its 
internal control systems spotted "some concerns."

Oil imports last month surged to the highest rate since 1980 as domestic 
production fell and consumption rose, reviving fears that foreign producers may 
soon control more than half of U.S. oil supplies, energy analysts said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents major oil producers and 
refiners, said U.S. crude oil production fell to 7.9 million barrels a day, a 
3.4% drop from January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Alaskan production, which in recent years offset declines in other parts of the 
United States, slipped for the second straight month with no major new oil 
fields tapped, the Washington-based group said in its monthly report. About a 
quarter of U.S. oil comes from Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Imports of oil and oil products surged to a rate of 8.2 million barrels a day, 
an increase of 20.6% over the January, 1988, level of 6.8 million barrels. It 
was the first month that imports averaged more than 8 million barrels since 
1980, the API said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase in imports, inventories fell 13 million barrels, or 2.3%, 
with part of the decline the result of higher refinery activity. Refinery 
utilization rose from a rate of 82.8% to 85.4%, the highest monthly level since 
1979.

DOW REVIVES AFTER 5-DAY LOSING STREAK

The stock market's blue chip indicator roared past the 2,300 mark Wednesday, 
snapping a five-day losing streak on strength in the bond market and a stable 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index, which fell slightly Monday and Tuesday after 
losing 45.18 points last week, surged 22.68 points to 2,303.93. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow has now closed higher only two days this month, Wednesday and Feb. 7 -- 
when the key index climbed 26.07 points to a post-crash closing high of 
2,347.14. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange, with Big Board volume totaling 154.22 million shares, 
up from 149.56 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates, which have been climbing of late, pulled back a bit in the 
credit markets Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that evidently encouraged traders to do some selective buying of 
stocks, especially in the blue chip sector and in issues involved in takeover 
rumors and speculation. 
</P>
<P>
In the economic news, the Federal Reserve Board reported a 0.3% increase in 
industrial production last month. 
</P>
<P>
The figure came in slightly below what most analysts had been expecting, and 
thus didn't do much to aggravate the inflation worries that have been dogging 
both the stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
In the closing stages of the session, the market's advance carried the Dow 
index past the 2,300 level, which some chart-watching analysts had suggested 
might be shaping up as a psychological obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's Nikkei 225-share index rose strongly to a record close Wednesday, 
although declines just exceeded advances in the broader market. The Nikkei rose 
166.59 points to a record close of 32,149.48. 
</P>
<P>
On the London Stock Exchange, stock prices closed mixed in slow trading as 
buying interest dried up amid uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates 
and British corporate earnings. The Financial Times 100-share index closed down 
1.6 points at 2,047.5. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures prices broke through an important price barrier and posted 
significant gains after reports that non-OPEC oil producers have proposed 
limiting their output of crude oil by 300,000 barrels a day, as well as rumors 
of contaminated oil stocks in Louisiana.

On other markets, soybeans added modestly to Tuesday's strong gains; platinum 
surged despite a continuing gold slump, and cattle and pork futures were off 
slightly in advance of a government report that traders fear could show too 
many animals are already at feed lots. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil futures settled 83 cents higher in the spot month of March, with the 
contract for delivery reaching $18.25 a barrel. Gains ranging from 29 cents to 
66 cents were registered in the back months at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"The crude (oil) market started off going nowhere, but once it heard an offer 
was on the table for that kind of a cut, it pushed through a lot of resistance 
at $17.85 level," said Peter Beutel of Elders Futures Inc. 
</P>
<P>
A report originating in London said a number of non-OPEC producers ranging from 
Mexico to the Soviet Union have indicated a willingness to cut their combined 
production before a meeting with members of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries set for London sometime next month. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the market stalled again at $18," said Beutel, "and we got a second boost 
from rumors of contaminated stocks in Louisiana. No one pinned it down," he 
added, "but in the absence of being clear, we saw some very good buying."

AT&amp;T said it plans to cut long-distance rates on 1.6% April 1 to offset a 
30-cent increase in local phone bills starting the same day. The changes will 
mark the last step in a cost shift ordered by the Federal Communications 
Commission that reduces prices that long-distance carriers pay local phone 
companies for completing calls while adding a monthly "subscriber line charge" 
to local bills. That charge will increase to $3.50 in April. The FCC must still 
approve AT&amp;T's proposed plan for passing on its cost savings. AT&amp;T said 
rates for interstate calls traveling less than 292 miles would increase 4.7% 
under its plan "to bring prices more in line with costs."

MICROSOFT BUYS STAKE IN MAJOR SELLER OF UNIX SYSTEM SOFTWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Microsoft Corp., already the world's leading supplier of personal computer 
software, announced a deal Wednesday that will allow it to expand its lead. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said that it is buying less than 20% in Santa Cruz Operation, the 
largest independent seller of Unix operating system software. Terms of the deal 
were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Operating systems, which direct the data flow of a computer, vary among 
computer manufacturers. But, increasingly, manufacturers are attempting to 
rally behind just a few systems that will become the standards for the entire 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
In the personal computer industry, the standards so far have been Microsoft's 
DOS and OS/2, used on IBM and IBM-compatible machines, and Apple's proprietary 
Macintosh system. 
</P>
<P>
Unix, much like No. 3 auto maker Chrysler, has run a very distant third, and 
was mostly dismissed as an arcane system mostly for use by engineers and 
accountants with sophisticated computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's acquisition was seen as underscoring two significant shifts in the 
personal computer industry. It demonstrates the growing acceptance of Unix as 
an operating system for the desktop computer, as well as the determination of 
Microsoft, which already provides the operating system used by a majority of 
personal computers on the market today, to take advantage of this new market. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Microsoft's way of saying that it wants to be a software 
conglomerate," said Thomas Friedberg, a Seattle-based analyst with the 
investment firm of Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood. "Microsoft wants to be all 
things to all people." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, most personal computer makers and software publishers have 
considered the complicated and sophisticated Unix system as more suited to 
large, powerful multi-user computers and not independent desk-top personal 
computers used by office workers. 
</P>
<P>
And Microsoft, led by chairman and chief Unix critic William H. Gates, was no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the investment in Santa Cruz Operation demonstrates that such 
an assessment may have been off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Chairman "Bill Gates may rail about Unix not being right for the 
personal computer, but he is an excellent businessman, and if there is a buck 
to be made on it, he will find a way to make it," analyst Friedberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Although analysts said the deal was a sure boost for the participants, they 
noted that it could spell trouble for other companies that have been trying to 
promote Unix systems for personal computers. Although Microsoft has not 
supported the use of Unix for personal computers until now, the company is no 
stranger to the system. In the early 1980s, the company developed its own 
version of Unix called Xenix. 
</P>
<P>
However, in 1981 the company decided to concentrate on its DOS and OS/2 system, 
and it contracted with Santa Cruz Operation to market Xenix.

PEOPLE: CONRAIL NAMES HILLMAN AS ITS ACTING CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conrail has named Stanley E.G. Hillman acting chairman, chief executive and 
president pending the selection of a permanent chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
The move followed the death during the weekend of Chairman Richard D. Sanborn, 
52, who became president of the Philadelphia-based freight railroad last March 
and chief executive Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman, 77, previously was president of Chicago-based IC Industries Inc. and 
chief executive of its Illinois Central Gulf Railroad. IC later became Whitman 
Corp. and the railroad was spun off. 
</P>
<P>
As a director of Conrail since 1980, Hillman was chairman of the search 
committee that selected Sanborn last year and served on the committee that 
recommended Sanborn's predecessor, L. Stanley Crane, in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Conrail, the former Consolidated Rail Corp., was spun off by the government to 
public shareholders in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Conrail said it would move as quickly as possible to find a permanent chief 
executive, but added that there was no time frame for the selection. Some 
analysts said the search could take several months. 
</P>
<P>
"One of (Hillman's) major priorities, if not his major priority, will be to 
look for a successor," said Provident National Bank analyst Andrew Geller. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst Burton Strauss said Conrail was in good shape 
and could weather the sudden loss of Sanborn and the search for a permanent 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
"The company continues to be in fine shape," said Geller, citing Conrail's 
solid freight traffic levels and productivity gains. 
</P>
<P>
The company, whose routes cover the Northeast and Midwest, has been profitable 
since 1981, and faces no major problems, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss said Hillman's selection gave no clue whether Conrail would select a 
permanent chief from inside or outside the company. He declined to speculate on 
possible contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts have said candidates might include James Hagen, a former 
Conrail senior vice president and now a senior executive at CSX Corp.; Santa Fe 
Southern Pacific Corp. Vice Chairman Jonn Schwartz, and Conrail's four current 
senior vice presidents.

COMPUTER FILE: LOGGING PROGRAM RELIVES THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard O'Reilly, RICHARD O'REILLY designs microcomputer applications for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Personal computers allow us to perform many tasks that we could not otherwise 
do. But there is a certain anxiety attached to all that power. What if we lose 
a critical file? It happens. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes files are lost because the computer was turned off before the data 
file was saved and the program that created it was properly closed. At other 
times, some combination of keys were pressed that could not be obeyed by the 
computer and it locked up, preventing the data from being saved. A user error 
or a bug in the program can cause that, too. 
</P>
<P>
Partial data loss may be just as bad, as when a portion of a document or 
spreadsheet is inadvertently deleted. 
</P>
<P>
But a new program for IBM and compatible personal computers can, in some 
circumstances, help you recover from such disasters. Cocoon, $100, from 
Daybreak Technologies, lets your computer keep a log of every keystroke you 
make. Then, if the need arises, Cocoon recreates what you lost by using that 
log to replay the keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind Cocoon is deceptively simple. Just before you enter the program 
you would normally use, you start the log running just by typing the word LOG 
in front of the command you use to start the program, as in LOG 123 to start 
logging a Lotus 1-2-3 session. 
</P>
<P>
From then until you leave the program, every keystroke you make is instantly 
recorded in a special log file on the hard disk. That process continues until 
you exit the program for which you started the log. On my PC/AT compatible 
computer there was no perceptible slowdown in my regular software while the 
keystrokes were being recorded. 
</P>
<P>
You can log keystrokes for any program you have on your hard disk without 
interfering with logs of other programs, as long as each program is stored in a 
separate directory. Cocoon automatically backs up its own log files. 
</P>
<P>
The Cocoon program is known as memory-resident software because once loaded it 
resides in your computer's memory alongside the application program -- word 
processor, spreadsheet, database, etc. -- that you choose to run. It is a very 
compact program, requiring only 10 kilobytes of memory in the log phase and 20 
kilobytes during the recovery phase, so it will run on virtually any IBM or 
compatible personal computer with a hard disk. Floppy disk drives are too slow 
for Cocoon's log to work. 
</P>
<P>
The only application program use that Cocoon cannot log is that of another 
memory-resident program such as Sidekick or Hotline. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of logging keystrokes is simple and it really does work, but there are 
some big potential problems that you need to be aware of. 
</P>
<P>
Because all Cocoon does is record keystrokes, it doesn't know anything about 
the context in which those keys were hit. It can't read your computer screen 
the way you can. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how you can get into big trouble. Say you start Lotus 1-2-3 and then use 
a feature of that spreadsheet program that shows you a list of worksheets and 
allows you to move the cursor to highlight the one you want to open. Cocoon 
will know only how many times you pressed the cursor key, not the name of the 
worksheet file that was highlighted. 
</P>
<P>
If you add or delete another worksheet during that session, the order in which 
those names appears on your screen will change and if you subsequently use 
Cocoon to recover the session, it will open the wrong worksheet. Obviously, 
every keystroke it replays thereafter will damage a good worksheet and leave 
the one you wanted to repair untouched. 
</P>
<P>
You can protect yourself by making sure that you always type file names when 
you are logging a session, instead of pointing with the cursor keys. But that 
may mean you have to change the way you are used to working with your favorite 
software. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem arises if you work with an existing file during a logged 
session, as opposed to creating a new file. Under those circumstances, Cocoon 
will not be able to recreate the session accurately unless it can begin with a 
version of the existing file that is identical to the one you started working 
with. 
</P>
<P>
That means you always should make backup copies of existing files when you 
begin a new logged session and then use the backup if you need to recover your 
keystrokes. Some programs give you the option of making backups when you open a 
file, and some even do it automatically. If your software does neither, you can 
use the COPY command of your operating system to make a backup before you start 
the session. 
</P>
<P>
When working with backups, remember that they have a different name than your 
original file so you'll have to change the name of the backup to that of the 
original before you can successfully recover the session. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing to watch out for: Don't make any intermediate saves of the file 
you are working on while you are logging keystrokes. If you do and you later 
need to recover, the file won't be in the condition it was when you started the 
session. Not making intermediate saves will take some getting used to because 
it is contrary to every safety instruction you probably have learned. Of 
course, you do want to get into the habit of backing up your work either when 
you finish working on a file or before you begin working on it the next time. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, as I wrote this column, my word processor automatically saved my text 
at intervals. That feature prevented Cocoon from working properly unless I used 
it with a backup version of the file. 
</P>
<P>
The authors of Cocoon anticipated these kinds of problems and warn you about 
them in the instruction manual. But they also programmed a way to edit the log 
file during recovery so that you don't execute unwanted keystrokes and ruin the 
very file that you are trying to save. 
</P>
<P>
If you understand the pitfalls and watch out for them, Cocoon works very 
nicely. It is fun to watch it automatically recover the keystrokes because it 
is like having the computer on autopilot. The file is recreated at a brisk pace 
before your eyes. You also can set it for manual recovery in which you have to 
press a key (any key on the keyboard) to instruct Cocoon to recover the next 
keystroke in the log file. The manual mode is a little safer if you're not sure 
if something will go haywire in the recovery process because it can be stopped 
at any point. 
</P>
<P>
A very nice feature of Cocoon is that you can tell it to reconstruct your last 
session up to, but not including, the last keystroke you had typed. If it was 
the last keystroke that ruined things before, you certainly don't want to 
repeat it during the recovery phase. 
</P>
<P>
There are some other uses you can make of Cocoon. It can be used by programmers 
to debug a program by playing back keystrokes used to operate the program they 
are creating and show where they cause problems. The log file also can be used 
to create complex files for programs that allow the use of macros. A macro is a 
way to cause a single key to send a long series of keystrokes to the program. 
</P>
<P>
Another use is to create program demonstrations that can be replayed for others 
to see. 
</P>
<P>
In computing, things are seldom simple. Cocoon is a good example of a program 
works very well and performs a critically important task. But it has to be used 
with skill and care or you could end up with a worse mess than you started 
with.

PUBLISHER-LED GROUP BUYS READER, PLANS NEW LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 10-year-old Los Angeles Reader, the free weekly tabloid that has been 
trying for the past year to regain its earlier momentum, has been sold to a 
group led by its publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Burnside Group, formed by Reader Editor and Publisher James E. Vowell and 
others, will publish the Reader under a license agreement with Chicago Reader 
Inc., which started the Los Angeles paper in October, 1978, Vowell said 
Wednesday. Vowell declined to disclose financial details of the deal but said 
Chicago Reader will hold a small percentage of the new company. Chicago Reader, 
which publishes a weekly under the same name in Chicago, owns the Reader name. 
The independent 129,000-circulation San Diego Reader has a similar licensing 
agreement with the Chicago company. 
</P>
<P>
Other Burnside Group principals include Reader Advertising Director Ron Slack, 
who has also been named associate publisher, and Los Angeles attorney Codette 
Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
Vowell said the change in ownership will be accompanied by a major change in 
the Reader's format, beginning with Friday's edition. The change will include a 
new version of the Reader's backward "R" logo, he said. The paper's size will 
shrink to 11 by 14 inches from 11 by 17 inches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Targets Different Audience 
</P>
<P>
"The shift in size serves several objectives," Slack said in a statement. "We 
wanted to make the paper more graphically exciting and our readers have long 
asked that we enhance the presentation of our excellent cover art. The new size 
also will accommodate our advertisers' longstanding desire for a format more 
compatible with other Los Angeles publications," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The change would make the 65,000-circulation Reader about the same size as the 
L.A. Weekly, which has a circulation of 165,000 in Los Angeles and the San 
Fernando Valley. The Reader is distributed mainly in neighborhoods on the 
Westside of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Vowell acknowledged that advertisers view the Weekly as the Reader's 
competition, but he said the Reader is targeting a different audience. "We 
address a slightly older, more sophisticated audience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Reader would like to see some circulation increases, but Vowell said he is 
"perfectly happy" with the current 65,000 "niche" circulation. "I think we'll 
see an inching up of 5,000 to 10,000 a year. The Reader is an acquired taste. . 
. . Some of our stuff is esoteric." 
</P>
<P>
Last week's edition featured an essay by a female writer on "What Makes a Great 
Lover" next to a story about the battle over the development of the Wilshire 
Tower in the Miracle Mile district. Both the Reader and L.A. Weekly devote 
generous space to the arts and entertainment, and both include personal ads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Banned 'Phone Sex' Ads 
</P>
<P>
Vowell, who was the Reader's first editor, returned to the publication last 
year after a four-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim period, according to some in the publishing industry, the Reader 
lost some of its momentum because it had difficulty developing a clear identity 
in the Los Angeles mix of "alternative" publications. 
</P>
<P>
The Reader also lost revenue last year when it banned ads for sexually oriented 
telephone services. That move cost the company about 20% to 25% of its revenue, 
Vowell said. The ban on such ads continues, but he said the paper has made a 
lot of progress in the past year in recouping that revenue. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say whether the paper has ever been consistently profitable but 
predicted that, "It's going to be profitable next month." For the longer term, 
he said, "we are taking a number of steps to put us at break-even or a profit." 
</P>
<P>
Through affiliated companies, Chicago Reader holds a 48% interest in the East 
Bay Express in Berkeley and 100% of the Washington City Paper. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Roth, publisher of the Chicago Reader, said the previous owners sold to 
Vowell's group because "of the realization that James could maybe do a better 
job."

CASTLE &amp; COOKE PROFIT JUMPS IN YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Castle &amp; Cooke Inc., the Los Angeles-based holding company for Dole Food 
Co. and Oceanic Properties Inc., Wednesday reported 1988 income from continuing 
operations of $112.3 million, up from $88.9 million in 1987. Revenue in 1988 
rose to $2.47 billion from $1.86 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter of 1988, the company reported income from continuing 
operations of $19.4 million, compared to $19.3 million in the fourth quarter of 
1987. Revenue increased to $589 million from $425 million. Revenue growth in 
1988 reflects both increased sales from established company products and the 
impact of operations acquired in late 1987, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
Dole Food Co. reported record operating results in 1988, with solid 
performances from each of its major product lines. Results from Dole's fresh 
fruit division were particularly strong. Dole's fresh vegetable operations also 
reported good results for the year. The packaged foods division showed 
substantial improvement over 1987 in all segments of its business. 
</P>
<P>
OPI which manages the company's real estate development activities, reported 
higher earnings for the year with continued sales growth among its residential 
development projects.

A jury says Wells Fargo Bank overcharged its credit card customers $5.2 million 
in fees for making payments late and exceeding credit limits. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court verdict reached Tuesday, in the first of several similar 
suits against major banks, entitles holders of MasterCard and Visa cards from 
Wells Fargo between July, 1982, and May, 1987, to $4.1 million in refunds for 
late-payment fees and more than $1 million for over-limit fees.

DUSTING OFF CROWN FOR ANOTHER ERA OF TV ROYALTY

<TEXT>
<P>
Are there any women in America today who would jump at the chance to be Queen 
for a Day? 
</P>
<P>
Dan Enright of Barry &amp; Enright Productions pondered that question as he 
pieced together a pilot for a new "Queen for a Day Show" in his Century City 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to be careful that women would not feel demeaned or exploited," 
Enright said of the show, which has yet to be picked up for syndication. "We 
felt, in these times, that the criteria should be: What has this particular 
woman done to benefit others?" 
</P>
<P>
In the pilot show, an announcer still asks the magic question and the audience 
still explodes with applause. But the throne, red velvet cape, four-dozen roses 
and host Jack Bailey are gone. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome -- to the new 'Queen for a Day Show!' " the announcer booms. "The show 
that makes dreams come true. And, now, here's our host -- Monty Haaaall!" 
</P>
<P>
In somber tones, Hall explains that the first candidate's world "came crashing 
down on her, suddenly and brutally" in 1985 when an airplane in which she was 
riding crashed into a mountain. Hall sat with the candidate, a burn victim who 
aids other burn victims, on a couch in a comfortable living-room setting. The 
woman's wish was for money to see her through more plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The second candidate had adopted 30 children and requested several water beds 
and a bus because she wanted to adopt more children. 
</P>
<P>
The third woman founded Mothers Against Gangs in Chicago after her 17-year-old 
daughter was fatally shot by gang members four years ago. The woman asked for 
sports equipment and educational materials to help keep youngsters off the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty pre-selected audience members considered the candidates and voted, using 
IBM selector modules. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gift Certificates 
</P>
<P>
"And with 27 votes, it's candidate No. 1!" the announcer says. The new queen's 
wish for more plastic surgery is granted and she also receives gift 
certificates to Macys department store. 
</P>
<P>
The potential audience for the show, said Enright, who has also produced "The 
Joker's Wild," "Tic Tac Dough" and "Concentration," are those who watch such 
programs as "Divorce Court," "People's Court" and "Crimes of Passion." 
</P>
<P>
Several former winners from the original show were present in the audience as 
the pilot was filmed. Although they feel much of the glamour has been 
eliminated in the new version, they said they're anxious for the show to air in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid, since we're all older queens now, that there won't be any of us 
left," said Rose Krause, a widow who was granted a piano for her two daughters 
in 1958. "So we want the new show to come on. We need some younger members so 
the club won't die." R. DANIEL FOSTER

ACLU SUES FOX HILLS MALL OVER RESTRICTIONS ON ACTIVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday sued a company belonging to one 
of Southern California's leading shopping center magnates for allegedly 
refusing to let peace activists hand out leaflets at a Culver City mall. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that managers of the Fox Hills Shopping Mall in Culver City 
denied members of the Westside Sane/Freeze access to the mall, violating their 
rights to exercise free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Sane/Freeze is a group campaigning for a ban on nuclear testing. Its 
coordinator, Andrew Tonkovich, said he applied for permission last November to 
distribute leaflets at the mall and to talk to shoppers but was turned down 
because his cause was "political." 
</P>
<P>
Tonkovich and ACLU attorney Robin Toma said the mall's policies allow people 
into the mall to register voters or circulate petitions but won't permit people 
advocating nonpartisan political issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The mall's policies violate the California Constitution because they 
arbitrarily discriminate among speakers based on their message," Toma said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox Hills Shopping Mall is owned by the San Diego-based Ernest W. Hahn Co., 
which owns numerous malls throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Malls Sued 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the firm were not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Toma said two other Hahn-owned malls have been sued for allegedly restricting 
activists' ability to canvass customers. 
</P>
<P>
In Culver City, Fox Hills manager Joanne Sudjin Brosi said she was unaware of 
the lawsuit but that the mall does not deny access to groups that want to 
campaign for political causes. 
</P>
<P>
"We go by the letter of the law," she said. "We are private property, we do 
have merchants, so we can't have people that disrupt business. . . . (But) as 
far as not allowing access, if it is of any political nature, we cannot deny 
access." 
</P>
<P>
She said the company receives several applications a week from people who want 
to promote political causes, and the applications are usually granted. 
</P>
<P>
In its suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, the ACLU is seeking a 
preliminary injunction to allow Sane/Freeze members to "engage in peaceful 
political expression at the mall." 
</P>
<P>
The suit also asks the court to declare as unconstitutional the rules that the 
mall management asks users to obey. Toma said the rules, such as restricting 
politicos to certain areas and requiring a $75 deposit, are "unnecessarily 
burdensome." 
</P>
<P>
Tonkovich said his group frequently visits malls, libraries, supermarkets and 
schools to speak on the arms race. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to talk to people and educate them on the arms race," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Big Following' 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a presence in malls all over the Westside," Tonkovich said. "We are 
really anxious to get our message out. We have a big following in the Culver 
City area and want more in areas where we don't. It's hard to get the message 
out when you are denied access." 
</P>
<P>
Toma said the state Supreme Court, in a landmark decision in 1979, established 
that Californians have free speech and petitioning rights in privately owned 
shopping malls.

RIVALS SAY YAROSLAVSKY DUCKING DEBATES IN 5TH DISTRICT ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's opponents in the April 11 primary 
accused him of ducking debates at a news conference outside his City Hall 
office Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental activist Laura M. Lake, transportation consultant Ryan Snyder and 
political consultant Jack McGrath said Yaroslavsky owes 5th District voters an 
explanation of his record. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
List of Forums 
</P>
<P>
"Zev has said he was ready to campaign, but we want to know when he's going to 
show up for some debates," Lake said. "He's afraid to face his own 
constituents." 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Lake released a list of five scheduled forums and said 
Yaroslavsky has not committed to any of them. A Yaroslavsky spokeswoman said 
the councilman is still considering how to budget his time, but his opponents 
charged that he is stalling. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said Yaroslavsky is giving voters the impression that he has something 
to hide. "If he is not coming out and talking to the voters, we have to wonder 
if he is concerned about his record," said Snyder, who also released a detailed 
political position booklet Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, a former Yaroslavsky campaign manager and aide who is running as a 
write-in candidate, said the councilman is alienating the people who put him in 
office. "If you don't come out and meet your makers, we will not put up any of 
your lawn signs," McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Slade, vice president of the Roscomare Valley Homeowners Assn., joined the 
three at the news conference. Slade said Yaroslavsky has failed to return 
numerous telephone calls concerning a candidates forum the organization is 
sponsoring on March 16. 
</P>
<P>
Roscomare Valley homeowners have tangled with Yaroslavsky over development of 
the Hoag Canyon area. Slade, who acknowledged that he is supporting Lake, said 
Yaroslavsky has a responsibility to participate in campaign-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows a tremendous lack of respect," Slade said. "And it's a sad 
commentary on the 5th District. He (Yaroslavsky) has absolutely ignored us." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Krotinger Wolf, Yaroslavsky's spokeswoman, called Wednesday's City 
Hall press conference a "publicity stunt." She denied that the councilman is 
ignoring anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"We will participate in debates as his schedule permits," Wolf said. "He has 
been speaking to community groups before January, after January, and will 
continue to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Since Yaroslavsky often schedules his appearances on short notice, Wolf said it 
is still possible he will participate in one or more of the forums cited by 
Lake. Despite his critics' charges, Yaroslavsky enjoys the support of most 
community leaders, Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers agree that Yaroslavsky probably has little to fear in the 
election, but over the past several days he has called press attention to two 
high-profile events within the district to counter the charges being leveled by 
his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday he attended the dedication ceremony for a federally subsidized 
50-unit housing project for senior citizens at 1450 S. Wooster St. Maxwell 
Kaufer, president of the Menorah Housing Foundation, credited Yaroslavsky with 
helping to make the project a reality. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 9, Yaroslavsky joined homeowners in the Carthay Circle area at a press 
conference in which he announced that a developer had agreed to rehabilitate a 
run-down home in the area and rebuild another that was illegally demolished. 
John Baldoni, president of the Carthay Circle Homeowners Assn., said 
Yaroslavsky helped protect the area from commercial encroachment. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf said Yaroslavsky is constantly working on similar constituent problems, 
but his opponents contend that the councilman has lost touch with the voters 
and is more responsive to the developers behind the area's massive commercial 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Lake and McGrath have aligned themselves with 5th District residents who blame 
Yaroslavsky for traffic congestion, commercial encroachment on neighborhoods 
and other growth problems. Snyder went a step further on Wednesday by releasing 
a 20-page booklet that details the city's numerous problems and his solutions. 
Snyder said the booklet is the product of a yearlong study by a dozen urban 
planners who donated their time to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't fault Zev for everything," Snyder said. "Many forces have shaped our 
destiny. But I have to say that things are not going well." 
</P>
<P>
In his booklet, "Solutions for a Bright L.A.," Snyder says his first priority 
as councilman would be the creation of Traffic Management Organizations, 
associations of employers and building owners who would meet to discuss 
ride-sharing and other transportation ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder opposes Metro Rail and other rail lines on the grounds that they are too 
costly and are unlikely to attract enough users, but says he would support 
car-pool lanes on freeways, better bus service, better transportation plans for 
bicyclists, and other measures. 
</P>
<P>
On housing, Snyder called for new laws making it tough to demolish low-cost 
units, strengthening rent-control laws to prevent automatic increases on 
vacated units and transferring slum properties to nonprofit housing 
organizations, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder favors better police protection and says he would allocate some funds 
for citizen patrols. He also supports environmental efforts to protect Santa 
Monica Bay and would downzone mountain areas to prevent housing development. He 
would also establish a merit-demerit system to grade the performance of city 
management personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said he hopes to distribute about 25,000 copies of the booklet.

3 OF WOO'S CHALLENGERS FAIL TO QUALIFY FOR APRIL BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three challengers in the race to unseat Los Angeles Councilman Michael Woo -- 
including the two front-runners -- have failed to qualify for the ballot, 
leaving Woo to face three relatively unknown candidates in the April 11 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett Kayser, former president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon 
Assns., who was expected to give Woo the toughest fight, fell 99 valid 
signatures short of the 500 needed to qualify, the city clerk's office 
announced Tuesday. Kayser had submitted 598 signatures, but 197 of them were 
found to be invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Trias, a former Los Angeles school board member from the Hollywood area 
who was considered a leading contender because of his name recognition in much 
of the district, fell short by 170 valid signatures, the clerk's office said. 
Trias submitted 571 signatures, but 241 were determined to be invalid. 
</P>
<P>
A third candidate, Howard Obata, was also disqualified. Obata, a postal clerk 
who is relatively unknown in the district, submitted 657 signatures, but 284 
were invalid, the clerk's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Woo, three candidates qualified for the ballot: Berndt Lohr-Schmidt, 
an attorney who has opposed Woo's efforts to impose restrictions on hillside 
building; Venus De Milo, a computer consultant who ran unsuccessfully for mayor 
and county supervisor, and Zahrina Machadah, a business consultant from 
Beachwood Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify, a candidate must submit 500 valid signatures of registered voters 
in the district. In the case of Kayser, Trias and Obata, the city clerk's 
office said, some of the signatures were of residents outside the district, 
residents who signed petitions for more than one candidate and residents who 
are not registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an incredible disappointment," said Kayser, who lives in Echo Park and 
is director of Save Hollywood Our Town, (SHOT), a residents' group opposed to 
Hollywood redevelopment. Kayser was reviewing the petitions Tuesday afternoon 
to determine whether he will challenge the clerk's ruling. He also signed a 
declaration of intent to run as a write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"Woo will have a slow-growth candidate against him whether it is my name on the 
ballot or as a write-in," Kayser said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Miscalculation 
</P>
<P>
Trias could not be reached for comment. Obata said he fell short because he 
miscalculated how many signatures he would need to compensate for the invalid 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I calculated a 21% error rate," he said. "I didn't know that I was off that 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Woo said the disqualifications -- particularly that of Kayser -- point to a 
general level of satisfaction in the district with his record the past four 
years. Woo represents the 13th District, which includes parts of Sherman Oaks 
and Studio City as well as Hollywood, Los Feliz and parts of Silver Lake and 
Echo Park. "I think it means there isn't a large constituency for any candidate 
who claims Mike Woo is too soft on developers," Woo said. "Those who claim the 
SHOT constituency is a massive constituency in Hollywood need to look at the 
numbers again." 
</P>
<P>
Kayser, who finished fifth in a field of six candidates in the 1985 election, 
blamed his inability to qualify for the ballot on an election consultant he had 
hired to collect signatures. Kayser said the consultant had promised to obtain 
between 100 and 200 valid signatures, but failed to submit any before the Feb. 
4 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"This was really a shock to me," Kayser said. 
</P>
<P>
With the disqualifications, several City Hall observers speculated that 
Lohr-Schmidt would emerge as the leading challenger. Woo said he welcomed the 
turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a lot of room in the race for a pro-development 
candidate," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Lohr-Schmidt, who rejects the pro-development label, predicted he will defeat 
Woo. 
</P>
<P>
"The only pro-development candidate on the ballot is Mr. Woo himself," 
Lohr-Schmidt said.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY; 
</P>
<P>
SIGN SIZE LIMIT CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week slightly increased the maximum size of political 
signs allowed on residential property. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the council introduced an ordinance limiting signs to 4 square 
feet. But last week, Councilman Richard Alexander said that a standard size 
political sign is larger than that. 
</P>
<P>
The council Monday night agreed to increase the maximum allowable size sign to 
4.3 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Ed Little, who spoke at the meeting, said large political signs 
constitute "pollution" in residential neighborhoods. He described a sign made 
of three 4-by-8-foot boards that he said stood in his neighbor's front yard and 
insulted him. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman James Boulgarides warned that the ordinance would cut off a 
means of peaceful citizen protest and would limit First Amendment rights. "I 
think this (ordinance) is a form of political censorship," Boulgarides said. 
</P>
<P>
Another speaker, resident Tom Hammons, suggested applying the same size limits 
to business properties. Mayor Paul Jacobs and Councilman Steven Gourley agreed 
to introduce such an ordinance soon.

SANTA MONICA WEIGHS ASSAULT-WEAPONS BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDRA SMITH, Community Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An emergency ordinance banning the sale and possession of rapid-fire assault 
weapons in Santa Monica will go before the City Council in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously Tuesday night to instruct the city attorney to 
prepare the ordinance. Three other motions regarding firearms also were passed 
unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David Finkel proposed the motion, which he placed on the agenda the 
morning after a gunman killed five children with an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle 
at a Stockton elementary school last month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Scourge of Country' 
</P>
<P>
Finkel called semiautomatic weapons "the scourge of the country," and he urged 
Santa Monica to join a statewide effort to ban them. 
</P>
<P>
"We can either sit back and let the debate die out, or add our voice," he said. 
"The more cities that act out, the more likely the state will do something." 
</P>
<P>
Two people spoke against the proposed ban at the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica resident Thomas E. Locke, a member of the National Rifle Assn., 
argued that instead of outlawing semiautomatic guns, the city should seek 
stiffer penalties for people who injure or kill others with them. He also 
proposed stricter background checks on potential purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
"People are abusing arms," Locke said, "but there's also a need to protect 
ourselves from criminals. Let's not restrict our right to bear arms, but the 
right for criminals to use them." 
</P>
<P>
E. Bruce Jochim, owner of one of Santa Monica's two gun stores, also opposed 
the ban. He urged the enactment of a 15-day waiting period for the purchase of 
semiautomatics. A mandatory 15-day waiting period exists for the purchase of 
handguns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the firearms," Jochim said. "It's the people." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ban, two motions included instructions to the city's 
lobbyist to study joining a statewide lobbying effort to strengthen firearm 
control laws in California. A final motion suggested gun and violence 
prevention programs for youths. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Christine Reed said that although she supported a ban on 
semiautomatic and automatic weapons, she had doubts about the constitutionality 
of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want my vote to be construed as instructing the city to go about 
questioning the Second Amendment (right to bear arms)," she said. "I don't mind 
having a battle with the NRA, I just don't want to have a battle with the 
federal Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Robert M. Myers said the emergency ordinance would probably be drawn 
up by the next council meeting Feb. 28.

KINGS BURNED IN LOSS TO BRUINS, 7-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky tried to get the attention of the officials and inspire what was 
left of his team by scraping Dale DeGray's blood off the ice and offering up 
the shavings on the blade of his stick. 
</P>
<P>
Getting no reaction from the officials, Gretzky slammed his stick back to the 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
He was frustrated that there would be no power play to pay for the cut in 
DeGray's mouth; frustrated that he had played another game with Bruins on top 
of him and had only one assist to show for his efforts, and frustrated that the 
Kings were going to lose the Bruins again. 
</P>
<P>
If it weren't for Boston, the Kings' slump would be over. The Kings went into 
their game Wednesday night with only one defeat in their last five games -- a 
loss at Boston. And they lost to Boston again, 7-3, before a sellout crowd of 
16,005 in the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Not a very good way to open a four-game home stand. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the cause of his obvious frustration, Gretzky addressed first 
things first. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating that we've been playing poorly," Gretzky said. "They've 
played two pretty good games against us, and they shut us down." 
</P>
<P>
Boston Coach Terry O'Reilly said that his game plan was simple. "The plan was 
to stay with Gretzky and put three guys on him at all times. The other two guys 
could handle their other four on the ice." 
</P>
<P>
And it worked. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings wrapped up the season series with Boston at 1-2, as their record 
dipped to 30-23-5. Boston is 24-24-11. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a game-misconduct call after the injury to DeGray was more 
frustrating to the Kings in light of the call that sent Mike Allison out of the 
game just 1:25 into the third period. Ray Bourque took a stick to the mouth, 
and Allison was hit with a five-minute high-sticking call and the automatic 
game misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Allison said: "I slashed his stick just as he was backhanding the puck. His 
stick came up and hit him. My stick wasn't even high. But that's the rule this 
year. That's what's been happening. It's an automatic call, so I can't argue 
with it. . . . I just don't understand why they didn't make the same call when 
Dale DeGray was hit." 
</P>
<P>
The officials told Gretzky they didn't see that one. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Krushelnyski of the Kings also was ejected just 56 seconds into the third 
period, presumably for something that he said, though Krushelnyski said he had 
"no idea" why he had earned his game misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help the Kings to play the third period without Allison and 
Krushelnyski. 
</P>
<P>
But Gretzky thought that the Kings might still have a chance if they had been 
given a power-play opportunity with the game still at 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not. Boston is a very good defensive team, and three goals is hard to 
make up. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were already down, 4-1, early in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
King Coach Robbie Ftorek pulled starting goalie Glenn Healy as soon as Bernie 
Nicholls scored the first of his two goals to make it 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Rollie Melanson made his first appearance in the net for the Kings since last 
October. Melanson was sent in to replace Healy at 8:21 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Healy had played 28:31 and had given up four goals on 11 shots. The loss was 
Healy's. 
</P>
<P>
Melanson, who was called up New Haven on Feb. 6 and was with the Kings at all 
stops on their last trip, has not played for the Kings since an Oct. 17 game at 
Calgary, which he lost, 11-4. Melanson had sprained a knee in the Kings' 
opener, a victory over Detroit, and had not played again until the game at 
Calgary, when he reinjured the knee. 
</P>
<P>
Melanson played 31:29 and gave up three goals on 19 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Healy, asked if he had been replaced because of an injury, said that the only 
thing hurt was his ego. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave up too many outnumbered attacks," he said "We didn't play our game. 
Boston is a very patient team that really waits for their opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Melanson gave up the fifth goal to the Bruins at 15:45 of the second period to 
Bob Joyce on a two-on-one breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Hawgood, also taking advantage of a two-on-one situation, scored the 
Bruins' first goal against Healy on a shot from the top of the left circle at 
2:39 of the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls tied it for the Kings at 9:34. But Randy Burridge and Ray Bourque 
scored to give the Bruins a 3-1 lead before the end of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Former King Bobby Carpenter, traded to the Bruins Jan. 23 in the deal for Jay 
Miller and Steve Kasper, scored his first goal for Boston at 3:09 of the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter was trailing Greg Johnston, who had fired a shot that Healy stopped 
with his chest. The puck dropped just a few feet from Healy, who had come out 
of the crease to meet the attack, and Carpenter picked up the loose puck and 
put it in an open net. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls again closed the gap to two goals on a shot from the left circle after 
taking a pass from Luc Robitaille that had been deflected by a Bruin stick. 
</P>
<P>
Cam Neely scored the first goal of the third period to put the Bruins ahead, 
6-2, at 8:02. The Kings didn't answer that goal until 14:57 when Kasper scored. 
</P>
<P>
Kings Notes 
</P>
<P>
With Bernie Nicholls' first goal Thursday night, the Kings extended their 
scoring streak to 230 games, the longest current scoring streak. They are tied 
with Quebec for the second-longest streak in National Hockey League history. 
Calgary holds the record, scoring in 264 straight games. . . . For Mike 
Allison, a second high-sticking penalty this season means that he will miss the 
game Saturday night against Quebec as he serves an automatic one-game 
suspension. . . . The season's 16th sellout at the Forum Wednesday night 
doubled the Kings' previous record of eight sellouts set during the 1984-85 
season.

PISTONS ACQUIRE AGUIRRE IN TRADE FOR DANTLEY, PICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Aguirre, the Dallas Mavericks all-star forward, was traded Wednesday to 
the Detroit Pistons in exchange for all-star forward Adrian Dantley and a No. 1 
draft pick in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would also give the Pistons second-round draft picks in 1989 and 1991 
if the Mavericks reach the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
The trade reunites Piston guard Isiah Thomas and Aguirre, who grew up together 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited, I'm gone to join Isiah," Aguirre told the Associated Press. 
"We've dreamed of being on the same team since we were in grade school. Finally 
it comes to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to get out of here as soon as I can. I'm gone." 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons are hoping that with Thomas as a motivator, the moody Aguirre can 
help them reach the National Basketball Assn. finals for the second straight 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was the leading scorer in Maverick history, Aguirre had worn out 
his welcome after eight stormy seasons at Dallas, where he alienated his 
teammates and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"The fans in Dallas were great, but I was misunderstood by the press," Aguirre 
said. "I had a great relationship with the fans." 
</P>
<P>
But the same cannot be said for his relationship with his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
When the trade was announced, the Mavericks expressed relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday was Valentine's Day and today should be an all-day party," Sam 
Perkins, Maverick forward, told reporters. The Mavericks will miss Aguirre's 
offensive spark, but not his emotional outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Blackman, Maverick guard said: "It's a big shame. Mark can be such a 
great player when he wants to be and he can make you so much better. But if he 
doesn't want to be here, it takes away from us." 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks were rocked by dissension in January, during which they had a 
4-11 record. Aguirre's attitude was generally blamed for the worst month in 
team history. He clashed repeatedly with Coach John MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark's attitude made it difficult for the team," MacLeod said. " It was a big 
problem. We think Adrian Dantley will be a great asset to this team. We're 
going to get him the ball a lot, more than he got it in Detroit. He's the kind 
of player who wants the ball when the game is close in the fourth period. He 
has produced many times in those situations." 
</P>
<P>
Can Detroit handle the explosive Aguirre? Aren't the Pistons worried about his 
disrupting the team chemistry? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to prejudge anybody," Detroit Coach Chuck Daly said. "I've heard 
all these things about Mark, but we heard the same things about Dantley and 
Adrian has been very professional. 
</P>
<P>
"Aguirre is a major league offensive player. He can shoot the three-pointers 
and run the floor and he's a pretty good passer, too. He's the same type of 
player as Dantley, and he's four years younger. That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
Dantley, who reportedly clashed with Daly and Thomas, was not happy with the 
trade, which had been widely anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't talk right now, but I will later," Dantley told Detroit reporters. "I 
told you (the trade) was just going to be a matter of time. It has nothing to 
do with basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the trade involved a personality conflict, Dantley said: "It's a 
management decision. Players do not have any input." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Economic considerations may also have been a factor. Dantley earns $1.2 million 
and Aguirre earns a reported $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, Maverick owner Donald Carter had agreed to renegotiate with Aguirre, 
promising him $1.4 million, beginning next month. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre is expected to join the Pistons at Sacramento for a game against the 
Kings tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas will start Terry Tyler in place of Aguirre for tonight's game against 
Miami and work Dantley into the lineup slowly.

LEARY WINS ARBITRATION DECISION; 
</P>
<P>
HERSHISER HEARING SCHEDULED FOR TODAY AS TALKS REMAIN STALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON EDES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dodger pitcher Tim Leary, in his first turn at bat in arbitration, hit a home 
run Wednesday when he won his case and was awarded a salary of $670,000, more 
than tripling his 1988 earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger efforts to sign Orel Hershiser to a multiyear contract, meanwhile, still 
appeared fruitless, with time running out. While the Dodgers' other pitchers 
head for spring training today in Vero Beach, Fla., Hershiser is scheduled to 
remain behind for an arbitration hearing in a Los Angeles airport hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser's agent, Robert Fraley, spoke with Dodger officials Wednesday, but 
most of his time was spent preparing for today's hearing, which will be 
conducted before arbitrator Stephen Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser is believed to be seeking more than the $7.5 million Boston's Roger 
Clemens agreed to in a three-year deal Wednesday, but the main obstacle to a 
multiyear deal remains contract language regarding a possible owners' lockout 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser wants a guarantee that he will be paid in 1990 regardless of a 
possible lockout. The team wants an arbitrator to make that decision. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser is seeking $2.425 million in arbitration. The club is offering $2 
million. Win or lose, the National League's Cy Young Award winner will receive 
a minimum raise of $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of the few folks who believe he needs to have a hearing," Fraley said 
this week. "Because win or lose, I believe there will be a better deal out 
there next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of language is really silly. The team is not willing to do for Orel 
what it has done for other players, for some reason. That's a little foolhardy, 
I think." 
</P>
<P>
Leary, 30, had a 17-11 record with a 2.91 earned-run average and struck out 180 
batters in 228 2/3 innings last season, numbers that apparently swayed 
arbitrator Anthony Sinicropi to rule in his favor. The Dodgers had offered 
$525,000 to Leary, who didn't hurt his case by batting .313 last season with 
three game-winning RBIs. His agent, Dennis Gilbert, and attorney Steve 
Schneider prepared his case. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam Fernandez (the Dodgers' counsel) called to congratulate us," Gilbert said. 
"A class act. Both sides agreed Tim had a great year. We only disagreed on the 
money. Tim's position on the whole thing was he was going to pitch for the 
Dodgers in 1989, regardless of what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Leary sat in on Wednesday's hearing but did not play an active role. 
</P>
<P>
"I was excited, I'll tell you," Leary said of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a matter of picking the right number. If I'd picked a million, for 
example, I would have lost. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hard-nosed business, no fooling around. You get edgy. I was edgy. It's 
intensely competitive. (But) you get paid on the back end. They knew I had an 
outstanding year. If I'd been making a million last season, I think they would 
have been satisfied. So there's no hard feelings."

Missouri basketball Coach Norm Stewart is not likely to return to the team this 
season, a doctor said, adding that Stewart's prospects for beating cancer were 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
"His chance for a complete cure could be as high as 90%," said Walter Peters, 
the surgeon who operated on the 54-year-old Stewart, removing about a third of 
Stewart's colon. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart collapsed last Thursday as the team was flying to Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
and after spending the night in the hospital there he was returned to Columbia, 
Mo., for further tests. Doctors began treating him for bleeding ulcers, then 
discovered he also had the cancerous tumor in his colon.

An internal investigation has been launched at Prairie View A &amp; M 
University in Prairie View, Tex., where striking football players have refused 
to return to the field until the head coach is fired. 
</P>
<P>
Percy Pierre, Prairie View A&amp;M's president, announced the investigation 
after meeting privately with 55 of the striking football players who have 
claimed the football coach is blocking their education. 
</P>
<P>
Players, who began their strike last week, also have charged that Coach Haney 
Catchings has put them through unsafe drills, held frequent six-hour practices 
and threatened to suspend scholarship funds if athletes did not produce on the 
field.

A rape charge against shortstop Jose Uribe of the San Francisco Giants was 
dismissed in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Uribe, 29, was accused by a woman of drugging her, threatening her with a gun 
and raping her. He had denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of the case was recommended by Jose Francisco Rodriguez, district 
attorney at the province of San Cristobal. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to indict or bring him to prison because there is no 
guilt," said Rodriguez.

SCOTT OSTLER: THEY'VE COME OFF THE STREETS TO MAKE THINGS WORK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler

<TEXT>
<P>
The exercise studio sits in a little section of Santa Monica where trendiness 
meets desperation. The upscale studio is some kind of converted garage, and the 
big corrugated tin door is usually lifted open, allowing in the breezes from 
off the Pacific Ocean a block away. On the sidewalk, marchers in the passing 
parade look in. Some stop to watch the action, nodding in time to the pounding 
rock music that you just can't work out without. Eardrums need exercise, too. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the spectators are street-type people, dazed and down and out, not in 
Beverly Hills, but close. Most of the exercisers appear to be nearer the 
opposite end of the socioeconomic scale. 
</P>
<P>
"We see the people walking by," says Kim Haves, director of Main Street Dance 
and Exercise Studio. "The diversity (between the exercisers and the spectators) 
is huge." 
</P>
<P>
An awkward situation. What to do? Main Street decided to offer workouts for the 
homeless, which I thought was pretty hilarious when I heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
Shades of Marie Antoinette! The people are hungry? Let them do abdominal 
crunches. 
</P>
<P>
This is a perfect example, it seemed, of why the rest of the world makes fun of 
Southern California. This is a perfect example of why Southern Californians 
make fun of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, I was slightly wrong, a unique development. 
</P>
<P>
The Main Street staff doesn't herd bag ladies and winos in off the street and 
have them dance around to "Sledgehammer." 
</P>
<P>
What they do is offer free workouts to "transitional" homeless, which means 
people who have entered recovery-type houses in order to begin putting their 
lives back together. If exercise is good for the body and soul, a theory that 
is the foundation of all sports except Clipper basketball, why should only the 
well-to-do have access? 
</P>
<P>
The program was inspired by a thief. About a year ago, Main Street hired a 
recovering street-type person to work at the studio. He was a sterling 
employee, except for his sticky fingers. He ripped off several thousand bucks 
from the studio safe, almost bringing the mom-and-pop type operation to its 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
This incident, instead of turning Main Street management's hearts against 
society's rubble, turned attention to the problem right outside the open garage 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Main Street owner Lisa De Mondesir contacted local social-aid programs, and she 
and her small staff instituted the fitness classes for the homeless. They also 
started a dance class for battered women from a local shelter, and a physical 
theater workshop for runaway teens and recovering addicts, taught by Kim Haves' 
husband, Stefan. There are about 35 regulars in the three programs. 
</P>
<P>
It's all financed by contributions from corporations, local businesses, and 
even from some of the Main Street workout regulars. The classes are taught by 
the studio's instructors, working free. 
</P>
<P>
Only in Los Angeles, world capital of two breeds: the homeless and the fitness 
snob. The twain have met to sweat. 
</P>
<P>
One recent evening, four men and two women from the nearby halfway house were 
huffing through an hour-long workout. They were all wearing new shoes and 
workout outfits, donated by Reebok and earned by faithful attendance at two 
months' worth of classes. 
</P>
<P>
At hour's end, the exercisers staggered off the floor with the kind of tired 
exhilaration you see in a team that has just won a big game.

"I stopped coming here for a while," said Martin, a hipster-surfer type. "I was 
going out with the same girl I used (drugs) with. When I started working out, 
she thought it was a joke. She laughed at me, and it was embarrassing. I 
figured she must be right, that it was a joke, so I stopped coming. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I came back. Now, when I talk to people, I don't look at the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Martin was into heroin and pills. He did time in a youth detention center for 
attempted murder. He said he merely fired a warning shot over the head of 
someone who was threatening him. Like others in the class, Martin seemed like a 
person with a lot of energy in need of an outlet.

"Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna explode," said Caryn. "I come down here and 
let it out. What did I do to let it out before? Use. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't work out, I go crazy. It's my new addiction." 
</P>
<P>
It took some recruiting to pry most of these people from the relative safety of 
their transitional home and into a dance and exercise class. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, personally, I could never picture myself in a crowd like this, 
dancing!" Gilbert said. "Before, I'd rather make a fool of myself in a bar, 
flat-face on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley, a man who spent most of the last couple of years living in streets and 
alleys after the breakup of his family, said, "This makes me feel like part of 
the community, getting back in tune with people." 
</P>
<P>
Funny, but it turns out that Stanley works out for the very same reason Jane 
Fonda works out. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps you get comfortable in your skin," he says.

Unseeded Jimmy Arias overpowered 13th-seeded Robert Seguso Wednesday for a 6-2, 
7-6 upset victory in the second round of the Volvo indoor championships at 
Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth match of the tournament, including three qualifiers, for 
Arias, who fell from the top tennis rankings after reaching No. 5 in the world 
in 1984. He is ranked 107th. Seguso is No. 36. 
</P>
<P>
"I returned serve well and that always boosts my confidence," Arias said. "I 
put pressure on his serve and he was struggling to hold. That's tough pressure 
for a big server like Seguso." 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Andre Agassi, ranked No. 3 in the world, defeated Jim Pugh, 6-2, 
6-3. Second-seeded Jimmy Connors beat unseeded Jason Stoltenberg of Australia, 
6-3, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Boris Becker of West Germany lost the first set to unseeded Ronald 
Agenor of Haiti, but rebounced to score a 6-7, 6-2, 6-1 victory in the first 
round of the $492,500 Stella Artois indoor championships at Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round matches, John McEnroe routed Carl-Uwe Steeb of West 
Germany, 6-3, 6-2, and Guy Forget of France surprised Anders Jarryd of Sweden, 
6-7, 6-3, 6-4. In second-round matches, Christian Bergstrom of Sweden defeated 
Milan Srejber of Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 and West German Eric Jelen upset 
seventh-seeded Jonas Svensson 6-4, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf, No. 1 women's player in the world, dominated Carling 
Bassett-Seguso, yielding only 16 points in a 6-0, 6-0 victory, and advanced to 
the quarterfinals of the $300,000 Virginia Slims of Washington tournament at 
Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Kelesi also advanced with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Isabelle Demongeot of 
France.

UC Irvine, which has won three of its last four games, will face the University 
of the Pacific, which has a nine-game losing streak, at 7:30 tonight in a Big 
West Conference basketball game in the Spanos Center. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific has won only once in 11 Big West games and has a 5-16 overall record. 
Irvine (9-12, 6-6) beat the Tigers, 90-88, Jan. 21 when center Mike Doktorczyk 
made all 12 shots from the floor and scored 28 points. Doktorczyk is hampered 
by a severe thigh bruise, but probably will play tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters' new inside threat, Ricky Butler, scored 20 or more for three 
consecutive games before being triple-teamed by Cal State Fullerton Saturday 
night. He was held to 13 points as Irvine lost, 78-75. JOHN WEYLER

CONDITIONS ARE EXCELLENT FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND

<P>
Conditions in the mountains of the Southland and the High Sierra are ideal for 
the big Presidents' Day weekend, which normally signifies the start of spring 
skiing. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, skiers will find packed powder, relatively crisp 
temperatures and, if all goes well, plenty of sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
California snow depths range from three feet on up -- to as high as 12 feet in 
the north -- and all systems appear to be go everywhere at least through 
Easter, March 26, and probably well beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie Heuga, the Olympic bronze medalist at Innsbruck, Austria, in 1964, will 
be at Snow Summit Saturday, along with many of his friends for the next stop on 
the Jimmie Heuga Express. 
</P>
<P>
The event is one of 22 in North America this season, which are expected to 
raise about 45% of the budget for the Jimmie Heuga Center for the physically 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Express' format, each host resort recruits as many co-ed teams of 
three skiers each as possible, in an attempt to ski more than a total of 1 
million vertical feet on a designated run on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
To participate, each team must raise a minimum of $1,000 in tax-deductible 
sponsorship donations. Then, the team at each resort that accumulates the most 
points -- a combination of dollars raised and vertical feet skied -- will earn 
an expenses-paid trip to the Heuga Express Championship finals April 5-9 at 
Vail, Colo., where the center is located. 
</P>
<P>
Teams are still being formed for the Snow Summit event, and more information is 
available by calling (213) 697-8941. 
</P>
<P>
The Express' other California stops are at Mammoth Mountain Feb. 24 and Squaw 
Valley March 10. 
</P>
<P>
Snow Summit will also be the site of the Vuarnet Vertical Airshow Sunday, when 
some of the nation's top snowboard competitors will display their skills. 
</P>
<P>
The field is headed by Santa Monica's Bert LaMar, a two-time World Cup champion 
in the sport, which is kind of a combination of skiing and surfing. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
World Cup ski racing resumes Friday, after a break for the World Alpine Ski 
Championships at Vail, Colo. The men will compete in a downhill, super-G and 
giant slalom at Aspen, Colo., and the women will go in a downhill and a super-G 
at Lake Louise, Canada. ESPN will show the Aspen races at 5 p.m., PST, on 
Friday, and 2:30 p.m., both Saturday and Sunday. . . . The U.S. Pro Tour will 
stop at Angel Fire, N.M., Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Badami, chairman and president of Alpine Meadows of Tahoe, which also owns 
the Park City Ski Area in Utah, said this week that his company "is nearing 
completion of the environmental impact statement" for the new Galena resort, 
near Reno, which it plans to open for the 1991-92 season. . . . Richard 
Steadman, one of the world's foremost orthopedic surgeons, is considering an 
offer to head a new sports medicine center in Vail, but said this week that any 
decision "is at least a year and a half away." He added: "For the remainder of 
this season and all of next, at least, I will continue to be at South Lake 
Tahoe." 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Nelson, former U.S. ski team star, was chief of course for the women's 
giant slalom at Vail last Saturday, becoming the first woman to have this 
responsibility in a world championship race.

CLEMENS AGREES TO $7.5-MILLION DEAL FOR 3 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
CONTRACT GIVES RED SOX PITCHER THE HIGHEST AVERAGE ANNUAL SALARY IN BASEBALL

<P>
Baseball's top salary reached another record Wednesday when Roger Clemens, a 
two-time Cy Young Award winner, avoided arbitration and agreed to a three-year, 
$7.5-million contract with the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens will get a $300,000 signing bonus, $2.2 million this season, $2.5 
million in 1990 and $2.5 million in 1991. In addition, he can earn $350,000 per 
year in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
The average annual salary of $2.5 million is the largest in baseball history, 
though Clemens will receive only the sixth-highest salary for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But more records may be broken today. Orel Hershiser, the National League Cy 
Young winner and the most valuable player of the playoffs and World Series, is 
scheduled for an arbitration hearing in Los Angeles with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser is asking for $2.425 million, which would be the highest salary for 
this year and an arbitration record if he wins. The Dodgers are offering $2 
million in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the players won all three arbitration decisions issued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger right-hander Tim Leary was awarded $670,000 by arbitrator Anthony 
Sinicropi rather than the $575,000 offered by the team. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati left-hander Danny Jackson was awarded $1.15 million by Thomas 
Roberts, rather than the $865,000 offered by the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
And New York Mets outfielder Len Dykstra was awarded $575,000 by Frederick Reel 
rather than the $455,000 offered by the club. 
</P>
<P>
Players have won five of the eight cases decided. Texas Rangers outfielder Pete 
Incaviglia and Red pitcher Tom Browning had their cases heard Wednesday. In 
addition to Hershiser, Cincinnati outfielder Eric Davis and San Diego Padres 
right-hander Walt Terrell are to go before arbitrators today. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens said he was happy to avoid arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel like going to arbitration because I've heard a lot of negative 
things coming out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens had asked for $2.36 million in arbitration, and Boston had offered $1.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Including a prorated share of the signing bonus, Clemens will get $2.6 million 
each in 1990 and 1991, the highest baseball salary ever. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his salary, Clemens would get a $100,000 bonus for winning the 
Cy Young Award and $50,000 for finishing second. He would get $100,000 for 
winning the American League most valuable player and $50,000 for finishing 
second or third. He would get $50,000 if he is MVP of the AL playoffs and 
$100,000 if he is MVP of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"While it may represent the highest salary per year ever earned in baseball, 
that's not going to last too long in my opinion," said Randy Hendricks, one of 
Clemens' agents. "I believe that salaries are going to continue going up." 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly's $2.5 million in 1990 with the New York Yankees was the previous 
high in yearly salary. Eddie Murray of the Dodgers will get $2.8 million in 
1991, but $500,000 is deferred without interest, lowering its present-day value 
substantially. 
</P>
<P>
At four years, 142 days of major league service, Clemens reached $2 million 
faster than any other player in history, beating Minnesota's Kirby Puckett by 
five days. Clemens is 78-34 in his major league career and won Cy Young Awards 
after going 24-4 in 1986 and 20-9 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
For the Red Sox, the key was getting a three-year deal. Clemens would have 
become eligible for free agency after the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to commit him to this ballclub for three years and hopefully many 
more," Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman said. "He's a major part of our 
ballclub. Equally important, it proves that Roger wants to stay. It's a long 
contract and a big one, so it took some time. We're buying out a year of free 
agency and two years of arbitration. Based on what Gooden got and Hershiser is 
looking for, we felt this was in the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Gooden signed a three-year, $6.7-million deal with the Mets last week. 
Hershiser is asking for $8.3 million over three years from the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens' contract was agreed to more amicably than his last one. In 1987, 
Clemens held out and agreed to a two-year deal only after the intervention of 
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I'm just looking to bigger and better things," Clemens said. "I've tried 
to perform at the top level of all the pitchers in the league. I always knew if 
I did the job, everything off the field would take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP 1989 SALARIES 
</P>
<P>
The highest-paid baseball players in 1989. Salaries were obtained by The 
Associated Press from player and management sources and include prorated share 
of signing bonuses. Jim Rice's contract includes income deferred without 
interest, which is discounted to reflect present-day value:

CALCAVECCHIA IS GOLFER TO BEAT AT SAN DIEGO

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They used to call this thing the San Diego Open. Then it was the Andy 
Williams-San Diego Open. Then a furniture maker shared the title with Williams 
for two years. Then a car company got its name in the billing for three. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 it became the Shearson Lehman Brothers-Andy Williams Open. Then 
Shearson Lehman Brothers changed its name to Shearson Lehman Hutton. Then last 
November, Andy Williams dropped out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
So welcome to the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open, the tournament in which the 
sport is golf but the name of the game is names. 
</P>
<P>
It's the tournament between Hawaii and Florida on the PGA Tour, and it begins 
today on the beaten municipal paths of the North and South courses at Torrey 
Pines Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Where you play doesn't matter," says Mark Calcavecchia, the tour's leading 
money winner this year. "A win is a win whether it's in Abilene or the nicest 
course in the world." 
</P>
<P>
This is not Abilene. The maintenance people here have redone 52 bunkers on the 
South Course, where the pros will play Saturday and Sunday. And according to 
John Walter, the course manager, the greens on the South Course have been cut 
to 5/32nds of an inch and and are moderately fast to fast -- right where the 
PGA wants them to be. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia has already won twice on the tour this year. And after winning the 
Nissan Los Angeles Open two weeks ago, he bought himself a Porsche 930 Turbo 
Carerra. He also bought his wife, Sheryl, a BMW 750IL. Then he made plans to 
buy a house in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"I spend money as fast as I get it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If he wins the $126,000 first prize Sunday, his earnings, just seven weeks into 
the 1989 season, will be a whopping $484,952.

FLAMES WIN RECORD 8TH STRAIGHT

<P>
The Calgary Flames make themselves at home wherever they are these days. 
</P>
<P>
Theoren Fleury and Joe Mullen scored 14 seconds apart in a four-goal 
second-period rally at Winnipeg to lead the Flames to a 6-1 win for a 
club-record eighth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames, on their way to the best overall record for the second consecutive 
season, have won the last four on a trip that began after the All-Star game. 
They are unbeaten in the last 12 games, one of them a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Their 40th victory gave the Flames 90 points, a lead of eight over Montreal, 
the leader in the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
As it has throughout the trip, the Flames' defense was overpowering. They 
limited the Jets to 18 shots. Goaltender Rick Wamsley lost his shutout when 
Dale Hawerchuk scored his 29th late in the second period after Calgary had 
scored four goals. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had suffered a broken nose and seven stitches in his face after 
being hit in the face by a stick in the first period, Calgary captain Lannie 
McDonald acknowledged the club is roaring into the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"This trip, the boys have stuck to the game plan," he said. "We played four and 
won four. It's nice to go home with that kind of record. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been fun to be a part of this team. I've missed 25 games because of 
injuries, but when I've had a chance to play I feel I've given this club the 
kind of leadership that wins championships." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 4, Minnesota 2 -- Coach Jacques Demers has been after playmaker Adam 
Oates to shoot more often. Oates took his advice in this game at Detroit and 
had a goal and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
The victory enabled the Red Wings to build their lead in the Norris Division to 
nine points. 
</P>
<P>
"Jacques has been on my case about not shooting," said Oates, who has 15 goals. 
"But I still have to play my own game. If I think about it too much I'll miss 
the passes." 
</P>
<P>
Gerard Gallant scored his 33rd goal to give the Red Wings a 3-0 lead and enable 
the line of Gallant, Steve Yzerman and Paul MacLean to reach a club-record 115 
goals. The old record for a line was 114 set by Frank Mahovlich, Alex 
Delvecchio and Gordie Howe in 1968-69.

Buffalo 5, New Jersey 3 -- Sean Burke, the Devils' young goaltender, had been 
playing extremely well and the Devils were moving up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
But Burke found out early in this game at Buffalo that this wasn't his night. 
Just 2:39 into the game, he knocked the puck into his own net for a Sabres' 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the Sabres, winning for only the second time in seven games, turned 
power-play goals by Mike Hartman, Mike Foligno and Christian Ruuttu into 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Toronto 2 -- Paul MacDermid had a goal and two assists at Toronto 
to lead the Whalers to their third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers outshot the Maple Leafs, 38-28. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 7, Washington 4 -- Dirk Graham's second goal of the game 40 seconds 
into the last period broke a 3-3 tie and the Blackhawks went on to end the 
Capitals' eight-game road winning streak. DAN HAFNER

Publishing sure makes for strange bedfellows. Strange and interesting 
bedfellows. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Author Kitty Kelley 
</P>
<P>
In his office on the 14th floor, Michael Korda fiddles with his pink power tie, 
swivels in a desk chair and stares out at the granite canyons of midtown 
Manhattan. The editor in chief of Simon &amp; Schuster and best-selling author 
grimaces when told of Kelley's comment, but then smiles and gestures 
expansively with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have used her exact words perhaps, but yes, I guess that's true 
about publishing," Korda says. "That's certainly the situation I'm looking at 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The Situation. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to dog Korda these days, even as he sets out on a national book tour 
to promote "The Fortune," his latest blockbuster novel. Never mind that his 
influence at the nation's largest publishing house continues to grow, or that 
his niche as New York's flashiest and most successful editor seems more secure 
than ever. The question that's got publishing powers wagging their tongues is: 
How is Korda, 55, going to edit Kelley's decidedly unauthorized biography of 
Nancy Reagan while also editing the forthcoming memoirs of Ronald Reagan? How 
will he keep the peace with Kelley -- whose gut-punching books about Frank 
Sinatra and Jackie Onassis have sparked intense controversy -- and The Reagans, 
newly arrived in Bel-Air? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the situation requires on my part a certain tact and decent 
behavior," Korda says, choosing his words carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"Because clearly, whatever Kitty would tell me about what she's doing I would 
have to be absolutely sure not to pass it on to the Reagans. And vice versa, 
whatever the Reagans might tell me I'd be sure not to pass on to Kitty Kelley." 
</P>
<P>
Korda shifts uncomfortably in his leather seat and shoots a glance at several 
fat manuscripts piled high on a table behind his desk. When the phone rings, he 
tells a secretary to hold all calls except for author Larry McMurtry (of 
"Lonesome Dove" fame) and literary agent Irving (Swifty) Lazar. Slowly, with 
some reluctance, he returns to The Situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, no doubt there will be problems. No doubt there will be tension," he 
says. "To put the books by Ronald Reagan and Kitty Kelley in the same 
publishing house, and then under the same editor . . . well, no, you don't see 
that every day." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Reagans have declined comment on The Situation. And beyond her 
statement about the publishing industry, Kelley, too, refuses to discuss the 
matter. But her telephone answering machine provides a tantalizing clue of 
things to come: Before the beep, callers hear a few bars of Sinatra singing 
"Nancy with the laughing face." 
</P>
<P>
The problem surfaced last month, when Simon &amp; Schuster announced a 
publishing coup: Without fanfare, the company had purchased the rights to 
Reagan's memoirs and a book of collected speeches for about $5 million. The 
speeches are due out next year, with the memoirs to follow at some undetermined 
date. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the giant publishing firm had acquired the rights to Kelley's 
forthcoming book on Nancy Reagan. On each occasion, Richard E. Snyder, chairman 
of Simon &amp; Schuster, announced that Korda would be editing the Reagan 
books. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Korda, a short, nattily attired wisp of a man with curly blond 
hair, came as no surprise. During a 30-year career, Korda has edited some of 
the nation's biggest fiction best sellers and earned a reputation for spotting 
the Big Hit long before other publishing companies. As a rival editor put it: 
"When it comes to kitsch and the mass-market blockbuster, Michael is, quite 
simply, the best. No one is better attuned to what Americans will want to 
read." 
</P>
<P>
Or what they will buy. 
</P>
<P>
During his climb to the top at Simon &amp; Schuster, the English-born Korda has 
edited books by Jackie and Joan Collins, Harold Robbins, McMurtry, Mary Higgins 
Clark, Ted Morgan, Shirley Conran, Clive Cussler and Peter Forbath. He has 
worked on books by Graham Greene and Joan Didion, Henry Kissinger and Richard 
Nixon, and edited Richard Rhodes' "The Making of the Atomic Bomb," which won 
last year's Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Korda has won recognition as a writer, uncorking self-help 
best sellers like "Power" and "Success" in the 1970s, and glossy, romantic 
novels like "Queenie," based loosely on the life of actress Merle Oberon, which 
was made into a television miniseries. Born into the Korda family -- a trio of 
wealthy and talented Hungarian brothers who produced successful motion pictures 
dating from the silent era -- he also wrote "Charmed Lives," a best-selling 
chronicle of his family's career in show business. 
</P>
<P>
As his press clippings have grown, Korda has become a New York celebrity in his 
own right. Unlike most editors, who are not well known, his name pops up 
frequently in gossip columns and he is a regular at trendy restaurants around 
town like the Four Seasons and Rao's in Spanish Harlem. Although his passion 
for motorcycles has dimmed in recent years, Korda once posed for the cover of 
New York magazine in racing leathers with a cigar in his teeth. Nowadays, he 
spends weekends riding horses with his English wife, Margaret, on their farm in 
Upstate New York. They also have homes in Manhattan, West Palm Beach and Santa 
Fe, N. M. 
</P>
<P>
Korda, who says his reputation for snaring best sellers obscures a private 
passion for books on history and poetry, has his pensive, brooding moments. But 
he is more often an animated raconteur who loves the sound of his own laughter. 
Asked about his life outside publishing, Korda zigzags in a breathless 
monologue from Central European politics to Truman Capote's early years to a 
discourse on Hollywood's inflated egos. Hands flapping, he concludes with a 
scathing impression of Merv Griffin when he was a television talk show host, 
and then laughs uproariously. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I talk too much, I do, I talk much too much," he confesses. "I love 
to talk." 
</P>
<P>
If Korda's flamboyant character has irritated some rival editors, it hasn't 
hurt him at Simon &amp; Schuster. When Snyder announced that his chief editor 
would be working on the new Reagan books, it seemed initially like two more 
feathers in Korda's cap. But now, some literary observers believe that the 
joint assignments -- glamorous though they may be -- could become a publisher's 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd feel very uneasy about it, because it's really unexplored territory," said 
Aaron Ascher, publisher of Grove Press. "There could be a clash of loyalties, 
to the extent that an editor has to show loyalty to an author. Here, you'd have 
to show allegiance to two writers who are truly working at cross purposes. It 
might be difficult to pull this off." 
</P>
<P>
Another prominent editor, who asked that his name not be used, speculated that 
Korda -- and Simon &amp; Schuster -- could experience difficulties if Kelley's 
book comes out first. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, Kitty Kelley's book is not likely to be too flattering, if the 
past is any guide," the editor said. "And if she's into print first, saying 
awful things about Nancy Reagan, it could be awkward, especially if the same 
editor is working on the President's book. The timing is key here." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Lynn Nesbit, Kelley's agent, said her client's book 
would "probably" precede the President's by a few years. While Korda insisted 
the timetable is not clear, he agreed there could be "complexities" if that 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's clear to me, it will either be a magnification of the problem or a 
simplification. I could give you many ideal scenarios and I could also give you 
one very un-ideal scenario," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Korda stressed that Simon &amp; Schuster got involved with the Kelley book 
first. As he sees it, that makes all the difference in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Already Owned Kelley 
</P>
<P>
"No publisher would be stupid enough to become the President's publisher for 
his memoirs and then go out and buy Kitty Kelley's book," Korda said. "That 
would seem like gouging an esteemed public figure in the eye unnecessarily. 
But, on the other hand, if you already own Kitty Kelley and you go out and buy 
Ronald Reagan, then you can't be expected to not publish Kitty Kelley. I think 
everybody understands that." 
</P>
<P>
At rival Random House, which is publishing historian Edmund Morris' authorized 
biography of Ronald Reagan, publisher Joni Evan declined to comment on Korda's 
potential conflict. But other observers predicted he will manage the task with 
flair. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael's very professional, and I know he will be a good ambassador between 
both camps," said Elaine Markson, a New York literary agent who has worked with 
Korda. 
</P>
<P>
"As an editor, you're sometimes like a priest in a confessional: You hear 
everything a writer has to say. But you don't pass it on; you keep the 
confidence, and I'm sure Michael understands that. He'll be able to do this 
without hurting anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Even Korda's critics offer grudging praise. An editor who has clashed bitterly 
with him in the past said that if anybody can handle such a task, it's the 
wunderkind of Simon &amp; Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Michael's very inhibited by convictions, and this is another 
glamorous situation for him, which he likes," said the editor, who asked not to 
be identified. "He probably thinks he's the only publisher in New York who can 
pull this off." 
</P>
<P>
Korda maintains it is not unusual for publishing houses to produce books with 
sharply differing viewpoints. Simon &amp; Schuster, for example, published 
works by Henry Kissinger and William Shawcross, who hold deeply conflicting 
views on American involvement in the Vietnam War and Cambodia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the company had a reception for former President Richard Nixon, and 
Korda said it was entirely proper that executive editor Alice Mayhew, who 
worked on books like "All the President's Men" and "The Final Days," was in 
attendance. He says there was nothing unusual about the fact that he had edited 
books by Jackie and Joan Collins, despite a certain amount of sibling rivalry 
between the two women. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Korda concedes that the Reagan books posed a different problem. 
Something new. A most peculiar situation. 
</P>
<P>
"How it will work out, I have no idea," he finally says, with a shrug. "I 
assume nobody cares, or nobody minds, or everybody simply says, that's life."

RECORD COLD, RECORD-HIGH UTILITY BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent record cold weather in Southern California may set another kind of 
record for consumers next month -- in utility bills. What can you do if you've 
got a $200 gas or electric bill that you just can't pay all at once? There are, 
happily, some options. 
</P>
<P>
And some monetary assistance for low income families. 
</P>
<P>
All three utilities -- Southern California Gas Co., Southern California Edison 
and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power -- report that they will work 
with their customers on a case by case basis to make special arrangements in 
paying gas or electric bills during this period. Representatives of each 
utility, though, stress that customers call company service representatives as 
soon as possible to work out a payment plan, not wait until they receive a 
turnoff notice. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to call us as soon as they're aware it (their bill) is an 
unmanageable situation," said the DWP's James Derry, director of consumer 
services. "We have a lot more latitude in setting up a payment schedule if they 
don't wait until the last minute or until the guy is at the door to shut off 
the electricity." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Southern California residences are heated by gas, but residents 
in those communities with all-electric homes are likely experiencing their own 
brand of skyrocketing heating costs. 
</P>
<P>
As a gas company spokesman notes, the principle is simple: "higher gas usage 
translates into higher gas bills." 
</P>
<P>
To get a handle on yours, check out the therm usage box on your gas bill this 
month to see how many units your household is consuming. If you use more than 
62 therms of gas a month in the winter, the rate per unit after that increases 
from 37 cents a therm to 78 cents. That can add up pretty fast. 
</P>
<P>
Electric bills also can creep up more quickly than you realize during unusually 
cold winter weather, especially if you're using one of those small, portable 
electric heaters that doesn't have a thermostat. 
</P>
<P>
"We have this problem a lot with some of our elderly people," Derry said. "To 
save on heating bills for the whole house or apartment, they'll get one of 
those small portable heaters without a thermostat, and then it runs constantly 
16 hours a day. They weren't aware, and then they come in with a much bigger 
bill. It happens every winter when it gets cold. Once we tell them what's 
caused the bill to be higher, we rarely have a repeater. 
</P>
<P>
"We advise them to look for the energy rating on the heater and get one with a 
thermostat so they can set it at a given level and it won't run constantly," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
One way Southern California Edison has of helping with large bills, especially 
for its elderly or disabled customers, is a program called "third party 
notification." 
</P>
<P>
"A customer can ask us to notify a third party if their bill becomes past due," 
explained Suzanne Hughes, supervisor of consumer affairs for Edison. "We send a 
copy to the designated person who can remind them to pay it or assist with the 
payment. A pretty large percentage of our customers are using the program." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Billing Plan 
</P>
<P>
All three utilities also offer an option called a "level pay billing plan" to 
customers. What this does is average out your bills over a 12-month period so 
you won't have a $150 bill one month and a $35 one the next. You can join one 
of these plans anytime in the first few months of the year, providing you have 
been a customer for one year. That's so the company has criteria by which to 
set an average figure for your bill. 
</P>
<P>
If your bills seem way too high -- even considering the cold weather -- you 
should call your utility and request a home energy examination of your house to 
find out what you can do about conserving energy and lowering your bill. That 
service is free from each of the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
And if you are a low-income senior citizen, handicapped or disabled person or a 
family at poverty level income, you may not know you actually can get some 
monetary help from each utility's assistance fund for low income customers. 
</P>
<P>
All are administrated by United Way through 127 service agencies in Southern 
California, among them the Salvation Army, Lutheran Social Services, Catholic 
Charities, Chinatown Service Center and the Retired Seniors Volunteer Program. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify, you must appear in person at one of the designated agency offices, 
have a past due bill or turnoff notice and be able to show figures stating your 
total household income, either monthly or annually. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, you cannot receive assistance if you have income over certain limits 
set by the federal government. For example, if you're single, you can't have 
income of more than $625 a month or $7,501 a year; for a family of four, the 
limit is $1,262 a month or $15,145 in a year. 
</P>
<P>
If you are receiving State Supplemental Income (SSI), you automatically qualify 
for assistance and do not need to have a past due bill. And handicapped or 
disabled persons who are unable to go to one of the agencies' offices may 
authorize a friend or relative to appear for them. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum payment you can get from any of the utility assistance funds is 
$150 per household per year. Once you qualify, you get a voucher that will pay 
the specific bill. But according to United Way officials, there is a limited 
amount of money available for utility bill assistance and the money goes fast 
because there are so many people who need it. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Southern California Edison gave assistance to 8,860 households; 
Southern California Gas Co., 6,828; DWP, 891. Of course, that number of 
households translates to several thousand people, considering the fact that a 
household served is usually composed of one to five people. 
</P>
<P>
"We always run out of money, because this is a huge problem," United Way's Sal 
Perrotta said. "These funds are virtually a drop in the bucket, but they do 
help these agencies who wouldn't have any other way to assist the people who 
need help." 
</P>
<P>
Funds are gathered through customer contributions to all three utilities. 
Southern California Edison matches its customer contributions dollar for dollar 
from shareholder funds; the Southern California Gas Co. contributes $250,000 in 
addition to whatever its customers have given. But the DWP is not permitted to 
match contributions to its Project Angel (Assist Neighbors by Giving Energy for 
Living), because it is a rate-payer-owned utility, run by the City of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Both Southern California Edison and the gas company began their assistance 
programs this month, but the DWP probably will not begin its annual Project 
ANGEL program until mid-April -- because that program only kicks in after 
customer contributions have reached $100,000. This year, that will probably be 
in mid-April and again in October. 
</P>
<P>
"That's given away in an eight-hour day at five centers throughout the city," 
Derry noted. 
</P>
<P>
For additional information about the SoCalGas Gas Assistance Fund, call the gas 
company office number listed on your bill; for Southern California Edison's 
Winter Energy Assistance Fund, call its 24-hour Action Line at (800) 952-5062. 
For Project ANGEL assistance, call the DWP Hotline in your area: Metropolitan 
Los Angeles, (213) 481-5800; San Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles, (818) 
984-3303; Harbor, (213) 639-9442. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on assistance with utility bills that you may get from 
federal or state programs for low income families, call Info Line, California's 
largest information and referral service. 
</P>
<P>
Ask about the Energy Crisis Intervention Program that is funded with money from 
the federal government and administered by the state. And families on SSI or 
Aid to Dependent Children may want to ask about another government plan, Home 
Energy Assistance Program. 
</P>
<P>
Info Line telephone numbers are: Los Angeles, (213) 686-0950; West Los Angeles, 
(213) 551-2929; LAX area, (213) 671-7464, South Bay/Long Beach, (213) 603-8962; 
San Gabriel Valley, (818) 350-6833; Burbank/Glendale, (818) 956-1100; San 
Fernando Valley, (818) 501-4447; Antelope Valley/Santa Clarita Valley, (800) 
422-1535; all other areas, (800) 242-4612. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers living outside Los Angeles also might want to check with their own 
city governments to see if there are any utility assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Pasadena, which has its own department of water and power, just 
started a utility assistance fund for its customers in February. It's called 
Project APPLE -- Assisting Pasadena People with Limited Emergencies. 
Information: (818) 405-4409.

CONDOM TEST STIRS NEW CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most major condom brands perform satisfactorily in tests more rigorous than 
those required by the federal government but failure rates differ sharply among 
brands, according to a Consumer Reports study to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which included laboratory tests of 16,000 prophylactics and a reader 
questionnaire, supported the view that top-rated condoms protect users against 
AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, as well safeguarding against 
unwanted pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Generic Vulnerability 
</P>
<P>
But the study unintentionally touched off a new scientific debate about the 
generic vulnerability of latex rubber condoms, which some researchers have 
suggested might have pores large enough for the viruses of some sexually 
transmitted diseases to pass through. 
</P>
<P>
And it reaffirmed researchers' observations that condoms fail at different 
rates, depending on the type of sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS "is one of the major public health problems of the current decade," said 
R. David Pittle, technical director of the Consumers Union, which ran the 
condom tests for Consumer Reports. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the condoms did quite well in this test," he said. "Some did better 
than others. I think it's important for the public to know that there is a 
large number of these that give you about as good protection as any." 
</P>
<P>
The Health Industry Manufacturers Assn. praised much of the Consumers Union 
study but criticized publication of condom ratings. Norman Estrin, vice 
president of the trade group, which represents condom manufacturers, also 
contended that several condoms receiving low ratings in Consumer Reports were 
identical to higher-rated models. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Estrin said the No. 2 ranked condom, LifeStyles Extra Strength 
lubricated, was identical to one with a similar name that ranked next to last. 
Estrin said several condoms marketed under private labels ranked higher than 
identical brand name products; he declined to name these, citing industry 
confidentiality agreements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Air Inflation Test 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Reports tested 40 models of condoms, all but eight of which performed 
satisfactorily in an air inflation test, which is required in many foreign 
countries and generally is considered to be stricter than the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration tests. Consumers Union also used a test in which condoms 
are filled with water, then evaluated for leakage -- the method the FDA uses to 
judge whether condoms may be sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
All the condoms tested by the Consumers Union were made of latex, though lamb 
membrane condoms are widely sold. But unanswered questions about lambskin 
condoms, their permeability and the possibility that they permit passage of the 
AIDS and hepatitis viruses led the group to exclude them from their tests, 
results of which are to be published as the cover feature in the March Consumer 
Reports. 
</P>
<P>
In its tests, the Consumers Union reached conclusions that are contradicted by 
research conducted at UCLA about the porosity of at least two brands of 
condoms. Consumers Union found that all latex condoms did not have pores that 
might allow viruses to pass through. 
</P>
<P>
But in federally funded research at UCLA, results of which were obtained by The 
Times under the Freedom of Information Act, researchers found that the Gold 
Circle condom, made by Circle Rubber Corp., and the LifeStyles Conture condom, 
manufactured by Ansell Americas Inc., did have such pores. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have cautioned that the possible role of porous openings in condoms 
-- either latex or lambskin -- in the spread of AIDS, hepatitis or other 
sexually-transmitted diseases remains strictly a theoretical one. 
</P>
<P>
A UCLA spokesman declined to comment on the new research results obtained by 
The Times. Federal funding for the UCLA research was cut off by the National 
Institutes of Health late last year because of concerns for the safety of the 
project, which proposed to test condoms for effectiveness against AIDS in 
actual intercourse among gay men in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a reader survey, the Consumers Union found that condom breakage rates 
over all were significantly higher in anal sex than in vaginal intercourse. 
(Anal sex more than vaginal intercourse has been associated with AIDS 
transmission.) One condom of every 165 breaks during vaginal intercourse, while 
the ratio is one of 105 in anal sex, the reader survey found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test Accuracy Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Reports declined to recommend that consumers not buy condoms ranked 
low in its study. Pittle said the group did not issue unequivocal ratings 
because researchers remain unsure of the extent to which lab tests accurately 
predict how a condom will perform during sex. 
</P>
<P>
The Consumers Union ratings largely coincided with the still unpublished UCLA 
rankings of 31 condom brands. The UCLA rankings were obtained by The Times last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
While the two studies differed in their selected products, the Gold Circle Coin 
condom, made by Circle Rubber, ranked No. 1 in the Consumer Reports ratings and 
No. 4 in the UCLA study. (The Gold Circle Coin is different from the Gold 
Circle condom.) Only 13 condom models were tested by both UCLA and Consumers 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Ramses Non-Lubricated condom, by Schmid Laboratories, was rated No. 4 by 
the Consumer Reports but No. 2 in the UCLA study. 
</P>
<P>
Big discrepancies were recorded in the two different tests for a heavily 
promoted product, the Mentor condom, distributed by Mentor Corp. of Goleta. Its 
advertising boasts Mentor has a significant safety advantage. The Mentor ranked 
No. 1 on the UCLA test. But it recorded a failure rate more than triple the 
acceptable level in the Consumers Union tests. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Reports suggested its readers choose products from the top of its 32 
ranked condom models meeting its minimum safety requirement, which permits up 
to 1.5% of condoms in a given batch to break when filled with 15 liters of air 
-- enough to inflate a medium-sized balloon. 
</P>
<P>
The Mentor condom and six other models fell into a second category in which 
tested products failed as much as 4% of the time. Two other condoms, the 
LifeStyles Extra Strength with Nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide coating), and the 
LifeStyles Nuda Plus, recorded failure rates of more than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Mentor Corp. declined to comment on the Consumer Reports article, 
which they had not seen. 
</P>
<P>
Ansell, in a statement late Wednesday, charged that "Consumer Reports does not 
understand condoms." Noting that the magazine published a condom survey a 
decade ago, Ansell said the magazine "got the story wrong again." Ansell 
claimed the Consumer Union relied on flawed statistical methods and incorrect 
testing procedures. It noted the consumer group included an Ansell product, the 
LifeStyles Extra Strength with nonoxynol-9, that had been recalled six months 
previously.

CARTOONISTS DRAW A NEW LINE FOR BUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an uncharacteristically kind and gentle move, editorial cartoonists across 
the United States this week hammered the tips of their pens into plowshares and 
declared a seven-day moratorium on ridiculing President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The love fest got rolling on Monday in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury." In that 
strip, fictional editorial cartoonist Harvey Foote complained that he and his 
colleagues felt left out of the honeymoon the media traditionally extends to a 
new President. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the strip featured the forged signatures of eight well-known 
cartoonists (". . . and a lot of other guys") who had, in fact, responded to a 
Jan. 30 "Dear Colleague" letter from Trudeau. To help the new President "get a 
handle on the vision thing," they agreed to grant him a honeymoon of "no less 
than seven days." 
</P>
<P>
The President could not be reached for comment. But informed sources within the 
cartoon community hinted that the whole thing may be a joke -- a snide 
subterfuge designed to lambaste the Commander-in-Chief with faint praise. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the spirit of the day, at least two nationally syndicated 
cartoonists drew semi-saccharine valentines to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Auth, cartoonist for the Philadelphia Inquirer, catalogued the new 
President's attributes on a valentine: "Genuine war hero, loving husband, 
terrific father, great outdoorsman, true egalitarian, and a seer of potential 
in Dan Quayle." 
</P>
<P>
But Auth conceded that exuding such warmth made him uncomfortable. "It felt 
very strange to be doing something so positive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he doubts that Bush got a chance to see his panegyric. "I heard . . . 
that when (the President's staff) gives him the Inquirer, they cut my cartoons 
out because he dislikes them so much." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that's true," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Conrad of The Times penned a heart-encircled coupon entitling Bush to one 
"kinder, gentler editorial cartoon." 
</P>
<P>
Others took the cease-fire more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"I arranged my career to go along with it," said Doug Marlette. "That's how 
committed I am to it. I'm not doing any cartoons this week," he said, adding 
that he is taking advantage of the time off to make the move this week from the 
Atlanta Constitution to New York's Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can They Control Themselves? 
</P>
<P>
Marlette worried, though, that some of his colleagues may lack the 
self-discipline to make it through seven days without presidential satire. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have people go off the wagon because it's such a temptation," he said. 
"When Nixon went out (of office) we were all calling each other like Alcoholics 
Anonymous, trying to get through the withdrawal." 
</P>
<P>
Conrad is one who couldn't restrain himself. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, the honeymoon is over today," he said on Tuesday, 
even though his signature appeared on Trudeau's declaration of amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't trust these cartoonists," said Mike Peters of the Dayton Daily News, 
who also signed the Trudeau pact. "I've got two Bush ideas on my desk right 
now, trying to decide which one I'll do." 
</P>
<P>
"We're an attack medium," Ben Sargent of the Austin American Statesman said. 
"We have to be critical of those in power." 
</P>
<P>
Sargent, like some of his colleagues, dislikes the present trend in which 
cartoonists flock together to address issues -- even in jest. In this case, 
Trudeau sent the letter to nine cartoonists and asked them to spread the word 
to others. The cartoonists were told 'If we take part, we'll get mentioned in 
'Doonesbury,' " Sargent said. "Well rippity do dah!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Are Not Amused 
</P>
<P>
There are indications, however, that the public may not view a Bush-cartoonist 
honeymoon as a laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Danziger, whose editorial cartoons appear in the Christian Science 
Monitor, said that he has already received "a bunch of letters from people" who 
are angry that he began lampooning Bush so soon after he was inaugurated. 
</P>
<P>
"They immediately call up and accuse me of being a Democrat. Which I'm not," he 
said. "I voted for Bush." 
</P>
<P>
When Nixon was elected to a second term, Herblock of the Washington Post gave 
him a honeymoon of sorts by offering him a free shave. Then, for a couple of 
weeks he drew the President without the stubble he'd been portrayed as having 
throughout the previous four years. 
</P>
<P>
Cartoonists aren't hopeful that Bush will be as much fun as Nixon. But they 
aren't fretting, either. While some remain wistful for what they see as the 
halcyon hilarity of the Reagan regime, most are convinced that the Bush bash 
has only just begun. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried for the profession," said Dan Wasserman, cartoonist for the 
Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Treasure Chest' 
</P>
<P>
Bush, he said, "has got a hard act to follow. Reagan was probably the best 
thing cartoonists have had since Nixon. But . . . this is a guy of such weak 
convictions that the constant disparity between what his lips are saying and 
what his hands and feet are doing is going to be a treasure chest for 
cartoonists." 
</P>
<P>
Marlette agrees. Bush's rhetoric is already riddled with the sort of "tag 
lines" -- "a thousand points of light," "read my lips," -- that make 
cartoonists giddy. And the way the "spin doctors" and "handlers" in the Bush 
camp concoct 20-second sound bites is just "playing right into our hands," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush has already been fun," Marlette said. "A year ago he had the wimp factor 
and I drew him trapped in a package of weenies. Then he turned out to be a hot 
dog." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, "I think he's designated all the weenieness to Dan Quayle," he said, 
echoing the general cartoonist clamor of delight over Bush's selection of a 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"The next four years are going to be terrific," Peters said. "We thought 
Watergate was our Camelot. Then we saw those Bambi eyes on Dan Quayle. . . . We 
shouldn't just give Bush a honeymoon. We should give him a Nobel Peace Prize 
for giving us Dan Quayle." 
</P>
<P>
Among the cartoonists who aren't licking their chops in expectation are those 
who backed the President. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad Bush won," said Dick Wright of the Providence Journal-Bulletin. "But 
for me it would have been better if Dukakis had won. I'd have had four years of 
glory."

SWITZER, SOONERS CIRCLING THE WAGONS 
</P>

<P>
More successful than any other college football coach the last 16 years, Barry 
Switzer suddenly finds himself defending a program hit by more serious 
incidents in a more compressed time frame than any program in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a fighter," he said this week in his office. "I've always been a fighter. 
I'm going to get things in shape. My total mission is to regain the respect of 
the university. . . . God, what a price to pay for what a few people have 
done." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI's arresting quarterback Charles Thompson Monday on charges of allegedly 
selling 17 grams of cocaine to an undercover agent in the athletic dorm was the 
latest in a series of unrelated events the last two months. Other serious 
incidents: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dec. 19 -- The NCAA placed the Sooners football program on three years' 
probation. It charged Switzer with failing to "exercise supervisory control." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jan. 19 -- Starting cornerback Jerry Parks was suspended after being 
charged with shooting with intent to injure teammate Zarak Peters in an 
athletic dorm. Parks is home in Texas awaiting his preliminary hearing and is 
not enrolled in school. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feb. 10 -- Nigel Clay, Bernard Hall and Glenn Bell were suspended from the 
university for two years after being charged with first-degree rape stemming 
from a Jan. 21 complaint at the athletic dorm. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 20, a sophomore, became the fifth player suspended, several hours 
before being formally charged. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Oklahoma players were charged with destroying a hotel room before 
the Jan. 2 Florida Citrus Bowl loss to Clemson and four Sooners coaches were 
accused of causing about $500 damage to furniture at an Orlando, Fla., country 
club. 
</P>
<P>
All of this follows publication of "The Boz: Confessions of a Modern 
Anti-Hero." 
</P>
<P>
In that autobiography, former all-America linebacker Brian Bosworth said NCAA 
rules were routinely broken at Oklahoma and steroids "were about as common as 
Anacin." 
</P>
<P>
Bosworth said cocaine was free-based on game days and one player interrupted a 
snowball fight with some blasts from an Uzi machine gun. Switzer, his former 
star wrote, "just turns his back." 
</P>
<P>
Switzer this week said Bosworth "exploited and embellished for obvious monetary 
reasons. You've got to recognize Bosworth for what Bosworth was. And what he 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Of the latest incidents, Switzer said: "I want to get them handled right now. 
We've got four, five, six people who need to be out of here. . . . Let's get 
(the investigations, reforms and penalties) done right now and get on down the 
road." 
</P>
<P>
The day that rape charges were filed against three players, the school's 
regents approved sweeping changes in academic standards, written rules of 
conduct and dorm security for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer spoke about most of the important matters: 
</P>
<P>
On Thompson: "Kids over there (in the dorm) had to know that Charles was doing 
that. Yet they wouldn't come tell me." Switzer said Thompson had been picked up 
on shoplifting charges while in high school. 
</P>
<P>
On the shooting: "He (Parks) shoots a guy he's been raised with. They came up 
together. I'm at the hospital and you know what the guy that's been shot 
(says)? 'I don't hold a grudge. I want to call Jerry.' 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a guy lying in the bed. Bullet goes down (a few inches) and he's dead." 
</P>
<P>
Switzer on Switzer: "I've been at this 30 years. It's the only thing I know and 
I like. I've had to deal with a lot of situations that aren't good. I've been 
at the top (three national championships); I've been at the bottom; I've been 
at a lot of places in between. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had experience at all of 'em, so I know basically how to handle all of 
'em. All you've got to do is ask the good kids here in this program. I can't 
let those (bad apples) that are down in that jailhouse now answer to Barry 
Switzer. And for Barry Switzer to be responsible for 'em. No way in my mind can 
I accept that. 
</P>
<P>
"Barry Switzer's future is my players, my athletes, the ones who walk in here 
and say: 'Hey, I love you, coach. Stick your hand across this desk. I'm worried 
about you. I'm thinking about you.' " 
</P>
<P>
OU on Friday named former Olympic hurdler Thomas L. Hill as assistant athletic 
director for academic standards. Since 1985, he had been at Tulane, which 
dropped basketball after a point-shaving scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's duties include checking prospective recruits to see if they meet OU's 
academic standards, evaluating their character and potential for success. Hill 
will work with the recruits the Sooners sign. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't put the bumper of the car over here and another part over there and 
expect the car to run," Hill told local reporters. "I've already had some 
conversations with Coach Switzer. I just thought aloud about some things, and 
he has already taken those ideas and begun to implement them. He has been 
willing to go further than I suggested." 
</P>
<P>
Some have suggested Switzer has bent too far with players, given too many 
second chances. He responded: "We had a meeting the other day and somebody said 
just that: 'We wouldn't be having these problems if (one of the players charged 
with rape) hadn't gotten a second chance.' 
</P>
<P>
"The player caught himself and said: 'But I'm glad he does (give second 
chances). He gave me one.' " 
</P>
<P>
Switzer was asked to look across his desk and see a prospect's mother where a 
reporter sat. The mother had read all the recent newspaper stories and also 
Bosworth's book. Why should her football-brilliant son attend Oklahoma? 
</P>
<P>
The coach countered by saying those who follow Oklahoma closest know it best, 
that the father of a recently signed tight end had just reconfirmed his 
loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
Probation limits OU to 18 scholarships instead of 25. Switzer said 15 prospects 
have been signed, 10 of whom were on the Sooners' preferred list of 18. 
</P>
<P>
He said if those charged with rape are guilty "I want 'em locked up, behind 
bars. They're animals. I want 'em caged up, because I have a 19-year-old 
daughter." He added that campus officials told him 19 rapes allegedly took 
place at OU last year. 
</P>
<P>
The business with his assistants at the Orlando-area country club also involved 
Clemson aides, he said. He admitted the Sooners caused the damage but that it 
amounted to "horseplay." 
</P>
<P>
He said the bill arrived Tuesday.

CARSON COACH STEAMS OVER CAGE PLAYOFF MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The L.A. City Section's longstanding policy of determining playoff spots before 
the end of the regular season has at least one basketball coach up in arms. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Park, coach of Carson's girls team, says it is unfair that the Colts, 
ranked second in the City by The Times, will probably face top-ranked Crenshaw 
in the second round of the 16-team 4-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Try to figure that out," said a disgusted Park. "Why should we have to play 
them so soon? I can see playing them at the Sports Arena (in the semifinals or 
final), but to play them in the second round? That's asinine." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the CIF Southern Section, which determined playoff pairings after the 
regular season, the L.A. City athletic office released its playoff brackets 
last week. The brackets were filled according to league finish (Metro No. 1 vs. 
Mid-Valley No. 2), and the appropriate teams were later placed in those spots. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, the Pacific League champion, is seeded No. 2 and at the bottom of the 
4-A bracket. Crenshaw, which tied Washington for the Southern League title but 
lost a coin flip and became the league's No. 2 playoff entry, is matched in a 
first-round game directly above Carson, meaning the highly regarded teams will 
meet in the second round if both win playoff openers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
This situation seemingly could have been avoided if the City had taken more 
time setting up the bracket, but an administrator said the section has no plans 
to change the system. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. City athletic specialist Lee Joseph said the section predetermines playoff 
spots according to league finish in order to give coaches a chance to scout 
first-round opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that's been done for years," Joseph said. "It's for scouting 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Concerning Carson's complaint, Joseph said: "I'd definitely like to see 
Crenshaw and Carson meet in the semifinals, but it's one of those things. I 
have no problem with our system." 
</P>
<P>
Park believes Carson (17-3), which beat Crenshaw and Washington during 
conference play, deserved the No. 1 seed in the playoffs after Crenshaw lost to 
Washington last week. But, because it was predetermined that the Southern 
League's No. 1 entry would be the top seed, that honor went to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's girls are enjoying their best season, mainly because of the 
exceptional play of junior forward Lala Lesa and senior guard Diane Miyake. 
</P>
<P>
Lesa is averaging 15 points and 15 rebounds a game while Miyake averages 15 
points and is among team leaders in rebounds, steals and assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts, whose only conference loss came against Dorsey when three starters 
were out with the flu, opens the L.A. City 4-A playoffs at 5:30 p.m. Friday at 
home against Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches are critical of the City Section's boys 4-A Division bracket where 
powerhouses Crenshaw (17-2) and Westchester (15-5) will meet in the second 
round if they get past Friday's openers. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester is ranked second in the L.A. City by The Times while Crenshaw is 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
However, City sports specialist Lee Joseph says he likes the possible early 
match-up. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I don't think it's a bad draw," he said. "Westchester has talent, 
but they haven't been playing up to capabilities. So why should I care about 
them?" 
</P>
<P>
Steve Carroll wanted a smooth break-in as Bishop Montgomery football coach, but 
this wasn't what he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The school weight room, which Carroll called "about the classiest thing we have 
on campus," was burglarized early Friday of equipment worth an estimated 
$6,272. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody backed a truck up and took about one-third of the weight room," said 
Carroll, who was named the Knights' coach two weeks ago. "We had just gotten a 
lot of new equipment and they took most of it. They pretty much knew what to 
take." 
</P>
<P>
He said half of the school's elaborate dumbbell set was stolen, along with 
barbells, benches, weights and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said Bishop Montgomery is asking for donations to help replace the 
stolen equipment, which the school spent several years acquiring. 
</P>
<P>
"We sunk a lot of money into that room," he said. "The bad thing about it is 
that it hurts the kids. It will cost us a lot of money, but in the long run it 
ends up costing the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about the burglary or wishing to make donations can 
contact Carroll at school at 540-2021. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills basketball Coach Cliff Warren, whose top-seeded Titans opened the 
Southern Section 3-A playoffs Wednesday night, says there is no clear-cut 
favorite for the division title. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very competitive and very balanced," he said. "I've seen every team that 
has been ranked (in the top 10) and anybody can beat anybody. It's like the Bay 
League. There are at least 12 teams that can win it all." 
</P>
<P>
Warren, who guided Rolling Hills to its third straight Bay League title, rates 
La Canada, Morningside, Estancia of Costa Mesa, Savanna of Anaheim and 
Brea-Olinda among the top contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Burton, former freshman basketball coach at Rolling Hills, partially 
credits Warren for his success as the first-year coach at Fullerton High. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton finished the regular season with a 16-6 record and tied for the 
Freeway League title under Burton, 23, the youngest head basketball coach in 
Orange County. He said he was drawing technical fouls at Rolling Hills until 
Warren took him aside. 
</P>
<P>
"He said I had to calm down or I couldn't coach at Rolling Hills anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Burton coached Rolling Hills' freshmen to winning records during the 1986 and 
'87 seasons and is remembered with fondness by his former mentor. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had any serious problems with Chris," Warren said. "We had to calm 
him down a little bit, but he was a great coach for us." 
</P>
<P>
Because of first-round byes, the number of South Bay teams opening the Southern 
Section girls basketball playoffs tonight was cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne, West Torrance, Bishop Montgomery, St. Bernard and St. Mary's Academy 
of Inglewood will play first-round games at 7:30 tonight. Morningside, Palos 
Verdes, North Torrance, Inglewood and Chadwick received passes into Saturday's 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne (16-9) will play host to Channel Islands (20-7) in a 5-AA Division 
game. In 4-A, West (16-6) is at home against Pioneer (13-10) and Bishop 
Montgomery (13-8) entertains Buena Park (11-10). In 3-A, St. Bernard (12-10) is 
at home against Lompoc (15-8) and, in 2-AA, St. Mary's plays host to Notre Dame 
Academy (7-9). 
</P>
<P>
Morningside (25-1) and Palos Verdes (22-3), ranked No. 1 in the state in their 
divisions by Cal-Hi Sports, are the top seeds in the 5-AA and 4-A playoffs. 
Palos Verdes will play host to West on Saturday if the Warriors win tonight. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Leo Hand, former head football coach at Servite High of Anaheim 
and St. Anthony of Long Beach, has been named the new coach at Serra. Hand 
replaces Joe Griffin, Serra athletic director, who stepped down after one 
season . . . Jeff Beaumont, the new baseball coach at Mira Costa, is looking 
for a coach for the Mustangs' junior varsity team. Anyone interested can 
contact either Beaumont or Athletic Director Herb Hinsche at 379-9895 . . . The 
Southern Section girls soccer playoffs open today with six 4-A Division games 
involving South Bay teams. In the most attractive match-up, Bay League champion

On Monday, Jerome Price was an ineligible standout guard for University City 
High's boys' basketball team. He had participated in the Gus Macker 
three-on-three basketball tournament Jan. 28-29. 
</P>
<P>
To do so was a CIF no-no under Rule 600. Or was it? 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Superior Court Judge William C. Pate granted a temporary 
restraining order against the CIF until a hearing could determine if there was 
any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, La Jolla limited Price to 11 points and seven rebounds, and those 
were team highs as the Vikings downed University City, 69-44. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, coupled with Mission Bay's 57-51 loss to USDHS, gives La Jolla 
(15-8 overall, 7-2 in league play) a one-game lead with one game to play in the 
City Western League. Mission Bay (14-7, 6-3) is in second place. University 
City (15-9, 5-4) is in third. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla, assured of at least a tie for the title, can win it outright with a 
victory over last-place USDHS Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of complaining about the Price situation, La Jolla Coach Rick Eveleth 
said before the game, "We hope to play U.C. at full strength." 
</P>
<P>
They did, though it was the Vikings who were at full strength. All five 
starters had good games, led by senior guard Adam Kleid's 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
"He dictated the tempo," Eveleth said. "This is the finest game he's played all 
the way around for us." 
</P>
<P>
Erick Litch added 11 points and eight rebounds and David Berteaux 10 points. 
Kyle Kupiec had nine points and eight rebounds and sophomore forward Craig 
Woodall had eight points and a game-high 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
With Kleid scoring 15 points in the first half, La Jolla took a 30-23 lead. 
Price, who made the first basket of the game on a 17-foot jump shot, had just 
three points. 
</P>
<P>
In their first meeting Jan. 24, La Jolla had led the Centurions by 13 in the 
third quarter before losing in overtime. There would be no letdown Wednesday, 
however, as La Jolla dominated the second half, 39-21. 
</P>
<P>
After Price made two free throws with 3:04 left in the third quarter, La Jolla 
led, 40-33. The Vikings then went on a 17-2 run, including 12 in a row, to 
giving them a 57-35 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the City Western League: 
</P>

USDHS 57, Mission Bay 51 -- Anthony Massa scored nine of his team-leading 15

(14-7, 6-3).

San Diego 75, Crawford 68 -- Milton Miller scored 26 points and Andre Letchaw 
added 14 to lead No. 5-ranked San Diego (16-4, 7-2) past host Crawford. San 
Diego led by as many as 17 points in the fourth quarter, but Crawford (15-8, 
5-4) rallied to within 71-67 in the final minute. James Clark put the game away 
with four free throws. Chris Johnson had 18 points and Tracy Halton added 17 
for Crawford.

Serra 63, Madison 61 -- Madison had the ball with 1 second left and the score

fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado League 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista 62, Escondido 55 -- Rancho Buena Vista Principal Alan 
Johnson, expecting problems, had said RBV would not play in this game after 
athletes from the two schools engaged in a melee following a wrestling match 
last Thursday at Escondido. But Johnson changed his mind before the game and 
Rancho Buena Vista (11-13, 7-6) won. The only problem came early in the fourth 
quarter when the lights in Escondido's gym went out for 15 minutes. Todd 
Fellars, who scored a game-high 31 points, hit a three-pointer to snap a 47-47 
tie just before the lights went out. Escondido, which never caught up after the 
lights came back on, got 27 points from Brooks Barnhard, but fell to 11-11, 
6-7. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside 70, San Marcos 47 -- Fred Dunn scored 24 points and Jerry Garrett

Fallbrook (11-12, 6-5) played slowdown but was plagued by turnovers. 
</P>
<P>

McGill added 14 as visiting Orange Glen (8-15, 4-7) won its third in a row.

OSCAR BIDS POPULAR AMONG THEATER OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Movie theater owners, managers, bookers and others attending the annual ShoWest 
convention here emerged smiling Wednesday from a breakfast where the Academy 
Award nominations were announced. 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't just because they didn't have to wake up at 5:30 a.m. to find out 
the results. Instead, there was an almost audible shared sigh of relief that 
this year's Oscar contenders were almost entirely made up of "commercial" and 
not "arty" films. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to see that most of the films that were nominated are commercial 
enough to play in all markets," said Bradford Bills, owner of Independent Film 
Services of Kansas City, Mo., echoing the sentiments of many of his fellow 
conventioneers. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, you can't take a picture like 'Gandhi' or 'The Last Emperor' and 
expect to throw it into a rural farming community or a suburb situation." 
</P>
<P>
That's certainly not the case with 'Rain Man,' which is playing in many of the 
movie houses run by these members of the National Assn. of Theater Owners 
(NATO). 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's already been coming out to see 'Rain Man' and now this is going to 
bring even more people out," predicted Bob Bagby, an executive with the B and B 
Movie Co. of South Ferry, Mo., who like other theater managers expect a 
box-office bonanza from Wednesday's nominations. Generally, the ShoWest 
attendees predicted that the Oscar announcements would mean a 25% 
across-the-board rise in business for the nominated films. And what's 
fortuitous for them is that most of these movies are playing in their theaters 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter to us if the winner is 'Rain Man' or 'Working Girl' or 
'Mississippi Burning,' " Bagby explained. "We'll still be very happy because we 
have them on all our screens!' 
</P>
<P>
Again with box office in mind, a few conventioneers hoped "Mississipp Burning" 
would come away with the best picture Oscar if for no other reason than that -- 
in the words of one theater owner -- "it needs the business more than "Rain 
Man" does.' " 
</P>
<P>
One surprise for attendees was the failure of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" to 
garner a best picture, best director or best actor nod. Some agreed with the 
academy's snub. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the technical achievements of the film, it well merited anything 
that it got," explained Tina Carpenter, manager of UA Theaters in West Palm 
Beach, Fla. "But as far as being the best film, it wasn't the best picture I've 
ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Conley, head film buyer for Cinemark Corp. in Dallas, Tex., which owns 400 
screens nationally, also believed that "technically, it's great. But I just 
don't think it's that artistic a film acting-wise or in any other vein." 
</P>
<P>
Others likened the Academy's treatment of "Roger Rabbit" to what happened to 
"E.T.," another huge hit at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's typical of the academy," noted Gayle Smith, owner of the Movie Park 
Drive-in in Siloam Springs, Ariz. "Usually, the movies which the public likes 
best aren't best picture winners. The people who do the nominations are not in 
touch with the public. Maybe it's because they're all rich." 
</P>
<P>
Some names that were missing from the best actor and best actress categories 
caused hardly an eyebrow to raise here. No one seemed to like Bette Midler in 
"Beaches" while William Hurt and Kathleen Turner failed to impress in 
"Accidental Tourist." 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God, Hurt didn't make it," exclaimed Bradford Bills, owner of 
Independent Film Services of Kansas City, Mo. "It was another typical 
performance from him and I'm so sick of seeing him nominated." 
</P>
<P>
There was general agreement that Dustin Hoffman was a shoo-in for best actor, 
and theater owners credited his performance as the main reason for the film's 
success with audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"And it redeemed him after the catastrophe of 'Ishtar,' noted Robert Heyl, 
owner of the Wyoming Theater Co. in Torrington, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
One lone dissenter was Otto Settele, owner of Rosa Theaters in Waupaca, Wis., 
who was hoping Tom Hanks will win. "Hanks is a very popular star right now," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Is that the only reason? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Settele admitted, laughing, "I'm coming out with the 'burbs' on Friday, 
and a Hanks Oscar could help business." 
</P>
<P>
Other ShoWest conventionerrs, however, had academy politics and not their 
bottom line in mind when they predicted a Glenn Close or Jodie Foster victory 
for best actress. 
</P>
<P>
"Glenn Close will get it because she should have gotten it for 'Fatal 
Attraction' and the academy always apologizes the next year," explained 
Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradford Bills believes the academy will honor Foster "because it was a 
role that stretched her beyond what she's done before. And I think they would 
like to see her win to encourage her to go on and do bigger and better things." 
</P>
<P>
Most conventioneers thought Sigourney Weaver deserved an award -- but couldn't 
make up their minds if she deserved it in the best actress or best supporting 
actress category. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Griffith's performance in 'Working Girl' was another favorite although 
some thought the film itself too small in scope for an award. 
</P>
<P>
"She deserves a lot of credit," maintained Ted Conley. "But, knowing how the 
academy works, I just think it's a little bit before her time." 
</P>
<P>
And, speaking of academy politics, most ShoWest attendees agreed with the 
inclusion of Martin Scorsese in the best director category for "The Last 
Temptation of Christ." Even those whose theaters had decided not to show the 
movie because of the controversy it had created, like Doug Kinney, manager of 
the Douglas Theater in Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
"I was glad to see it (nominated)," Kinney said. "I thought that was a nice 
little touch."

DOUMANI DONATION SETS UCLA ON ART-COLLECTING PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A stark white seaside house -- widely praised as a jewel of contemporary 
artistic collaboration -- has been bequeathed to UCLA. World Trade Bank 
chairman Roy Doumani and his wife, Carol, have agreed to donate their unusual 
Venice residence to the university upon their deaths and have established a 
$2-million endowment for maintenance of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Total value of the Doumani gift is estimated to be between $7 million and $10 
million, though the donation has not been formally appraised, according to UCLA 
press officer Karen Mack. The house, designed by sculptor Robert Graham, at 4 
Yawl St., is worth about $3 million to $4 million. Graham's figurative 
sculptures and an array of functional works by other artists, also included in 
the gift, are valued at $2 million to $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Doumani gift, announced at a Wednesday morning press conference, 
"symbolizes the university's re-dedication to the arts" and signifies a newly 
"intensified partnership between the university and the Los Angeles art 
community," said Andrea Rich, vice chancellor of academic administration. Rich 
noted that the announcement came in the midst of a major reorganization of the 
university's art department that includes the creation of two "brand new 
schools," one for fine art, the other for film, television and theater. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be on the cutting edge of art," Rich said. "We've been a little 
sleepy in the area of collecting in the past. This announcement symbolizes our 
desire to get into the collecting business." 
</P>
<P>
The donation is also "the first step" in a proposed campaign for the arts, said 
Alan Charles, vice chancellor of public relations. "No goals for the campaign 
have been established. It's only a gleam in our eye, but it will be the next 
major step for the university." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA officials denied that the Doumani gift is an attempt to make up for the 
loss of Norton Simon's collection, valued at more than $750 million. (Simon 
early in 1987 announced an "agreement in principle" to donate his extraordinary 
collection to UCLA if the university would maintain his museum in Pasadena and 
build a new structure in Westwood for part of the collection. Negotiations 
reportedly broke down a few months later, but another year passed before the 
deal was officially pronounced dead.) 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of talk" about potential gifts to the university, Roy 
Doumani said. "This isn't the Norton Simon collection, but we hope it may open 
up new avenues for further gifts of this sort to the university. It may take 
something like this to break the logjam." 
</P>
<P>
The Doumanis are long-time active supporters of the university. Roy Doumani, a 
1958 graduate of UCLA, is a member of the UCLA Foundation Board of Trustees and 
co-chair of the Annual Fund Campaign Steering Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The couple will continue to live in their Venice house, but they will make it 
available to the university for arts activities and events. "It will be an 
active part of the campus," Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Doumani said the house will probably be used for small symposia and other 
programs that would benefit from the art-filled home's environment. Edith 
Tonelli, director of UCLA's galleries, said she plans to bring classes to the 
residence, where students can study "Southern California art in a space where 
they are surrounded by it." 
</P>
<P>
The two-story, 7,500-square-foot residence faces the ocean, just north of the 
Marina del Rey channel. Graham's design is essentially a big white rectangle 
divided in half by an interior stairway. Dark, grid-framed windows, mosaic 
pools and metal grills accent the clean-lined exterior. One-of-kind 
architectural components and functional art fit unobtrusively into the light, 
airy interior space. 
</P>
<P>
The Doumanis originally asked Graham to make a sculpture for a new house they 
planned to build, but he astonished the couple by asking to be their architect. 
Though he had no architectural experience, he argued persuasively and work 
began in 1978. The 4 1/2-year project was fraught with problems, but the 
alliance between a novice architect and art-sensitive patrons worked. The 
Doumanis describe a painfully slow, sometimes frustrating but ultimately 
rewarding experience as they gave up working with conventional contractors and 
searched for builders and craftsmen who were willing to be creative. 
</P>
<P>
Graham had planned to involve only two other artists, David Novros and Billy Al 
Bengston, in the project. As it turned out, Bengston's influence is 
particularly strong. He provided inlaid kitchen and dining room cabinets, 
bedroom furniture, mosaic pools, metal grills and an engraved glass balustrade, 
while Novros painted a fresco and designed stained glass windows for the 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually several other artists also created unique works for the residence. 
Terry Schoonhoven painted trompe l'oeil murals of a cloudy sky and an opening 
window. Eric Orr built a kinetic water sculpture that creates a rippling 
movement on a skylight. Joanna Pousette-Dart designed a mosaic wall for a 
roof-top deck. Among furnishings are a metal-collage door by Tony Berlant, a 
painted metal armoire by Tom Holland, fabrics by Gretchen Corners and a glass 
table by DeWain Valentine. Except for Oriental carpets, the Doumanis have put 
few ready-made objects in the house, preferring to commission unique functional 
art. Carol Doumani noted that Graham had persuaded the couple to avoid art that 
merely "decorates" and to work with artists who would create works that are 
"structural and permanent." 
</P>
<P>
Have they ever regretted their decision or the fact that it has led to life in 
a fishbowl? 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely not, the Doumanis insist. "This is home" as well as a public trust, 
Roy Doumani said, noting that he is relieved to know that the house will be 
properly cared for in the future. "Who is better prepared to do that than the 
university?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been offered a fortune for it," he said, "but we would like to see the 
house remain the way the artists made it, and we can't do that if we sell it."

NO MOVE WEST, SAYS RATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Rather, while discussing CBS' increased emphasis on coverage of Japan and 
the Pacific Rim, was asked if he thought the day might come when a network news 
program such as his would move West permanently to better cover the East. 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely, he said, although "I've urged us to do this for years, to move 
to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm the only person around there who believes it's a practical idea," he 
added. "Some people laugh at me, and others call for the guys in the white 
coats from Bellevue." 
</P>
<P>
Relocating from New York doesn't seem to be in the cards, he said, noting that 
it would cost a lot of money. Another important reason: New York is still the 
home of the networks' parent corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"Power," he said, "is in direct proportion to proximty.....With the corporate 
network headquarters in New York, it makes a lot of sense for the news 
divisions, all three, to remain headquartered there."

CBS PLANS EXTRA COVERAGE OF BUSH'S STATE VISIT TO JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY SHARBUTT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Correspondents and news anchors from the three major TV networks and CNN will 
be traveling to Japan next week to cover President Bush's visit for the state 
funeral of Emperor Hirohito. 
</P>
<P>
But CBS News is going its rivals one better for the outing, Bush's first 
foreign trip as chief executive. The network will spend more than $2 million to 
originate much of its weekly news programming in Japan in what anchorman Dan 
Rather described Wednesday as "the most ambitious (news project) CBS has 
undertaken in peacetime." 
</P>
<P>
All next week, CBS plans to broadcast from Japan the "CBS Evening News" that 
Rather anchors and "CBS This Morning." In addition, the prime-time news program 
"48 Hours," also anchored by Rather, will air from there next Thursday, when 
the emperor's funeral services begin. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's "Sunday Morning" news magazine also will come from Tokyo, with "Face 
the Nation" originating the following Sunday from Beijing -- the second of 
Bush's three stops while in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
ABC won't be doing as much as CBS but, starting Monday, its "World News 
Tonight" will have Asian-segment anchoring and reporting by anchor Peter 
Jennings all week from Japan. He'll also anchor the Asian segments during 
Bush's stops in Beijing and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Koppel will stay home in Washington, although his "Nightline" will air 
reports from Bush's trip, as will ABC's "World News This Morning" and "This 
Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
NBC, whose "NBC Nightly News" on Wednesday began a three-part series on Japan's 
social, political and economic changes, has a somewhat more modest effort 
afoot. The network says Tom Brokaw will anchor his "Nightly News" from Tokyo 
next Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Brokaw also will anchor next weekend's newscasts from China, and contribute 
reports for that weekend's "Sunday Today." 
</P>
<P>
CNN, meanwhile, is dispatching anchors Bernard Shaw and Mary Alice Williams, 
plus three other correspondents. Its live telecasts of the funeral services for 
the emperor are slated to start at 5 p.m. PDT Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' Rather, Charles Kuralt of "Sunday Morning," and Kathleen Sullivan and 
Harry Smith of "CBS This Morning," are among 15 correspondents and at least 55 
other staffers making the trip for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The number of CBS personnel could double with local hires of interpreters, 
pages, couriers and other support troops. 
</P>
<P>
Why so many? Part of the reason is that CBS -- saluted here Wednesday at a 
luncheon held by the Japan Society -- is handling the American TV pool coverage 
for Bush's trip, and would need a larger support staff anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But another reason is that the Jan. 7 death of Japan's 87-year-old Emperor 
"puts a period to the postwar era," Rather said in an earlier interview in 
which he sounded the CBS expedition's "what's next?" theme -- officially called 
"U.S.-Japan: Dawn of a New Era." 
</P>
<P>
In coming months, he said, a lot more of CBS' reporting will be looking to 
Asia, the continuing Pacific Rim story, and what happens "in the new postwar 
era" in which Japan is an economic superpower. 
</P>
<P>
"So we think the emperor's funeral is a good starting point for bringing the 
audience's attention, our own attention, to . . . what's next" in 
American-Japanese relations, from financial to cultural, he added. 
</P>
<P>
During a question-and-answer session at Wednesday's lunch, he credited CBS News 
President David Burke as coming up with the idea for the special coverage and 
noted that it would cost $2 million "at the minimum." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a gamble for us. . . . We have more chips on the table than our 
competitors," he said. However, he added, if it works, "I think we will do this 
kind of thing in the future" in other areas of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Next week's coverage will have one unique aspect that is part of efforts by the 
Big Three networks to build overseas markets at at time when increased 
competition has reduced their audience at home. 
</P>
<P>
Many Japanese television viewers will be able to see what CBS, ABC and CNN 
newscasts are reporting about their emperor's funeral and their country. 
</P>
<P>
Rather's "Evening News" has been aired by the Tokyo Broadcasting System since 
October, 1987, usually at 5:30 a.m., with a dual audio channel providing 
versions in English and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Some news reports from Jennings' "World News Tonight" -- but not the complete 
program -- now also are shown in Japan. They are broadcast by the NHK network 
to homes equipped with satellite dishes that can receive the direct-to-home 
satellite signal aired by NHK, according to an NHK official here. He said NHK 
plans to start airing the full half-hour program later this year. 
</P>
<P>
CNN's newscasts are available in 50,000 hotel rooms in Toyko, on "several 
thousand" cable-equipped homes in Japan, and also on the Asahi television 
system in Tokyo, a CNN spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's newscasts are not yet shown in Japan, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"CBS Evening News" executive producer Tom Bettag, discussing broadcasts of 
Rather's program in Japan, frankly admitted that "we are trying very hard to 
promote those (overseas) relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"I think American television, and particularly American television news, is 
having a lot of impact internationally. . . . We're shown in a hell of a lot of 
countries and have remarkably strong ratings."

EL SEGUNDO DEFIES L.A. SEWER LAW; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS CLAIM LIMITS ON USE COULD STIFLE DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even though their city has been served with a lawsuit by the city of Los 
Angeles, El Segundo officials said last week that they will ignore a law that 
aims to limit El Segundo's use of Los Angeles' beleaguered sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit filed last week in Los Angeles Superior Court, Los Angeles 
claims that El Segundo -- and Beverly Hills, Burbank, Glendale and Culver City 
-- have failed to file reports on how many new building permits they have 
issued and, as a result, how much new sewage will be generated by the projects. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, under laws it passed last year, is temporarily seeking to curb 
growth in Los Angeles and in surrounding cities that contract with it for 
sewage treatment. The laws limit 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$20,000 Fine 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Assistant City Atty. John Haggerty said last week that each city 
could face a $20,000 fine for failing to file a report. The suit seeks a court 
order forcing the cities to comply with the requirement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the cities' concern that Los Angeles, by limiting the number of 
building permits they can issue, could stifle development within their 
boundaries. The cities maintain that Los Angeles has no jurisdiction over them 
and that the longstanding contracts they hold with Los Angeles to treat their 
sewage are still valid. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I guess we don't feel they have the right to unilaterally cancel a 
contract," El Segundo City Manager Fred Sorsabal said. 
</P>
<P>
Sorsabal and city attorneys in Culver City, Burbank and Glendale said their 
cities have no intention of filing the building permit reports. 
</P>
<P>
Since the lawsuit was filed, Beverly Hills officials have indicated that they 
will file the report, Haggerty said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permits Limited 
</P>
<P>
Under an ordinance passed last year, the Los Angeles City Council limited the 
number of building permits issued throughout that city to ensure that new 
development adds no more than 5 million gallons to the average daily amount of 
sewage treated each year. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, Los Angeles passed a similar ordinance designed to limit the 
amount of new construction in the 27 separate cities and agencies that are 
connected to the sewer system. The ordinance allows the cities and agencies to 
add a combined total of 1 million gallons to the average daily amount of sewage 
treated each year. 
</P>
<P>
The new laws are designed to remain in effect until Los Angeles' sewage 
treatment capabilities are expanded, perhaps by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Haggerty said the five cities named as defendants in the lawsuit sent a letter 
to Los Angeles soon after the second ordinance was passed. The cities stated 
that they had a contractual right to use the city's sewage system up to certain 
levels. Those levels are spelled out in each city's separate contract with Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Safety 
</P>
<P>
However, Haggerty said, Los Angeles maintains that because of the crisis facing 
the sewage treatment system, it is within its right to "infringe on contractual 
rights" for public health and safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel they should have the same limits imposed on them as we have imposed on 
ourselves," Haggerty said. 
</P>
<P>
Haggerty said Los Angeles has no evidence that the cities are disobeying the 
ordinance by generating too much new sewage. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in El Segundo and Culver City maintain that their cities are being 
unfairly penalized for the rampant growth that has occurred in Los Angeles in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Davis, city engineer for Culver City, said that city has "been very 
conscious" over the years not to exceed the sewage limit established in its 
contract with Los Angeles, and typically has been far below it. 
</P>
<P>
"Going back to 1970 or so, our growth rate as far as sewage treatment has only 
averaged half of 1% a year," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like we bought into a bus going someplace and we have our seat 
paid for, and the bus driver says, 'I promised this seat to my cousin and 
you'll have to get off now,' " Davis added. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Culver City, population 40,778, will pay Los Angeles $2.3 million 
this fiscal year to treat its sewage and will also contribute $1.8 million for 
capital improvements to the Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant. 
</P>
<P>
In El Segundo, population 15,420, officials said the city's contract with Los 
Angeles calls for treatment of up to 2.75 million gallons per day of sewage. 
Since July, 1988, the most the city has had treated on a given day has been 2.3 
million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Figures on how much El Segundo pays Los Angeles to treat its sewage were not 
immediately available.

20 NEW OFFICERS IN INGLEWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG RAIDS TO HELP PAY FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inglewood, a city that has fought crime with some success in past years, will 
have 20 additional police officers on the streets by summer. 
</P>
<P>
And until revenue from a new tax assessment district becomes available at 
year's end, drug dealers will help foot the bill for those new officers under a 
funding scheme worked out last week by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The additional officers will come aboard during a period when statistics show 
that the city has experienced a decrease in violent crimes and an increase in 
property crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Inglewood voters overwhelmingly approved the property tax assessment 
to fund a $1.4-million, 20-officer task force against gangs and drugs last 
November, the assessment will not go into effect until the new fiscal year 
begins July 1, and revenue will not be collected until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment will cost the owner of a single-family home about $45 a year. 
Apartment buildings will be assessed on a sliding scale beginning at $53 a 
unit. Commercial properties will be assessed on the basis of frontage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Borrow From Fund 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Feb. 7 approved the financing scheme for the immediate 
hiring of new patrol officers, who will replace veteran officers being assigned 
to the task force. The city will soon borrow about $649,000 from its water fund 
to pay for salaries, hiring and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
That loan will be repaid with funds the city is owed by the federal government 
for property and assets seized by Inglewood police during drug busts, officials 
said. More than $683,000 is expected this year in such reimbursements, thanks 
to a new federal law that allows money and assets seized from drug dealers to 
be turned over to police departments for anti-drug operations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great idea, making the drug dealers pay for it," said Councilman 
Anthony Scardenzan, a longtime proponent of more police officers. "I love it." 
</P>
<P>
The 20 new officers will increase the 187-officer department by more than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
The new police will include trained officers transferring from other 
departments and local residents being sought in a recruitment drive in 
Inglewood, officials said. Ten will be hired in March, three each in April and 
May, and four in June. 
</P>
<P>
Because some of the newly hired officers will have to be trained at police 
academies and in the field, the anti-drug task force of veteran officers will 
probably not reach full strength until August, said Deputy Chief Robert Gavney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Street Crime Targeted 
</P>
<P>
The plainclothes "crime suppression" task force, as it has been named, will 
consist of 17 officers, two sergeants and a lieutenant. It will fight 
street-level drug and gang activity throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
City and police officials are enthusiastic about the beefed-up police presence. 
Capt. James Butts said the unit will provide a vigorous new show of force in 
areas where gang members congregate and intimidate residents. The task force 
will work with the department's gang intelligence unit in targeting gang 
members with undercover operations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to do all it takes to fight the perception of crime levels as well 
as crime itself," Butts said. "When we have all the officers hired and in 
place, there should be a greater perception of safety." 
</P>
<P>
Although gangs and drugs are still a problem, crime has declined since the 
beginning of the decade, when Inglewood earned a bad reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"The key thing is that we have this downward trend through the decade," said 
police crime analyst Michael Easley. "The overall trend is down." 
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Police Department last week show slight decreases in 
violent crimes against people -- murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault 
-- in 1988. Burglary declined as well, but property crimes -- grand larceny, 
auto theft, arson and petty larceny -- increased. 
</P>
<P>
Although total crimes rose from 7,753 in 1987 to 7,966 in 1988, violent crimes 
decreased by 3% last year to 1,833, the lowest number in the decade, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the worst of Inglewood's high-crime era, in 1981, police reported 10,933 
total crimes and 2,266 violent crimes. Murders peaked that year at 55, compared 
to a recent annual average of about 29. 
</P>
<P>
Robbery declined last year from 973 to 965, aggravated assault from 797 to 746 
and burglary from 1,908 to 1,722, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Easley said an assertive police presence is more likely to affect those types 
of crimes than murder or rape, which are harder to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
Murders in Inglewood decreased from 32 in 1987 to 30 last year; rapes decreased 
from 100 to 92. 
</P>
<P>
Property crimes overall increased about 5% last year, from 5,851 to 6,133, 
police said. Grand larcenies rose from 821 to 881, auto thefts from 1,795 to 
1,846, incidents of arson from 93 to 133 and petty larcenies from 1,234 to 
1,551. 
</P>
<P>
Easley said the new task force should reduce violent and property crimes by 
cracking down on drug-dealing street gangs. But he cautioned against expecting 
an automatic decrease in crime statistics, saying more police activity may lead 
to more crimes being reported.

PROFESSOR ACTS FOR REAL IN FILM ON BOMB PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNETTE KONDO, Kondo is a free-lance writer in San Gabriel.

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Customs officer at LAX had three questions for David Politzer: What's 
your occupation? What were you doing in Mexico? And, what's in the box? 
</P>
<P>
Politzer answered: "Physicist. Filming a movie. Fire hydrant." 
</P>
<P>
The customs official accepted that. After all, Politzer, a theoretical 
physicist at Caltech, had been in Mexico to be in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
But a fire hydrant as carry-on luggage? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's made of fiberglass," said Politzer, mischievously grinning at the 
canary-yellow hydrant sitting in a corner of his Caltech office. "It was given 
to me by the set designer." 
</P>
<P>
Politzer, unlike the hydrant, was no stage prop. In the film, "Fat Man and 
Little Boy," he and several other real-life scientists create what Politzer 
calls "background verisimilitude." 
</P>
<P>
Casting Director Nancy Foy said hundreds of scientists were interviewed, but 
Politzer "intrigued us because of his personality and he was able to speak 
easily about his work." Real scientists like Politzer, she said, give the film 
"a sense of reality." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Newman and Dwight Schultz are the film's stars and portray Gen. Leslie R. 
Groves and scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Groves and Oppenheimer helped 
develop the atomic bomb in the 1940s at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Television Star 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, a well-known New York stage actor, also starred in the television 
series "A-Team" as "Howling Mad" Murdock. Director Roland Joffe co-wrote the 
film with Bruce Robinson. Joffe's previous films include "The Killing Fields," 
written by Robinson, and "The Mission." 
</P>
<P>
Don Levy, director of production publicity for Paramount Pictures, said the 
film depicts the development of the atomic bomb and the relationship between 
Groves and Oppenheimer. "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" were the names given the two 
bombs dropped by the U.S. military on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
The film is scheduled for release in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Politzer, 39, a resident of Altadena with his wife, Mary, and two sons, is 
eagerly awaiting the film's premiere. In the meantime, the easygoing and 
youthful professor has returned to his teaching routine. 
</P>
<P>
The lean and boyish Politzer, wearing jeans, a sweater, wool socks and clogs, 
recently talked about his debut in pictures. His office features the usual 
clutter of academia: a wall of books, a chalkboard, a paper-stacked desk and 
well-used cocoa and tea tins, not to mention a jar of sea monkeys. But two 
banjos and the hydrant make it seem like home. 
</P>
<P>
It all started early last May, when an astronomer friend from the Mt. Wilson 
observatory called to tell him a movie about the atomic bomb was being filmed 
and a casting director was looking for scientists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Human Dilemmas' 
</P>
<P>
Politzer, a native New Yorker who has taught at Caltech for 12 years, was 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
Foy liked what she saw. She had Politzer go to Joffe's Beverly Hills home, 
where the two men discussed science, weapons and the atomic bomb. Two hours 
later the screenplay was delivered by messenger to Politzer's doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
After reading the script, Politzer was very enthusiastic about the film. "He 
(Joffe) would portray scientists as real people, not bizarre or weird or mad," 
Politzer said. "The film focuses on human dilemmas." 
</P>
<P>
Joffe later asked Politzer to play the role of Robert Serber, a scientist and 
Oppenheimer colleague. Foy said Politzer bears a strong resemblance to "a young 
Serber." Serber, now 79, remembers meeting Politzer about 10 years ago. At that 
time Serber was head of the physics department at Columbia University in New 
York City and had offered Politzer a job that he declined. 
</P>
<P>
Serber, now retired in New York, describes the years at Los Alamos as the most 
stimulating of his life. "The place was always jumping with the greatest 
physicists in the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Politzer, who would not have taken the role had it conflicted with his class 
schedule, was not teaching last fall term when filming began. In October he 
boarded a plane for his first visit to the film site in Durango, Mexico. In the 
course of the next three months he worked on the film for about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
When Politzer arrived at the Los Alamos set in Mexico, his first impression was 
that it looked just like the photographs he had seen in books. "It was huge, 
five streets filled with buildings, not backdrops, but complete buildings," he 
said.

At the crack of dawn every day, the cast was driven to the set, 40 minutes 
outside the rural town of Durango. In addition to Politzer and a biotechnology 
expert, there was a group from Stanford University composed of two graduate 
physics students, two graduate psychology students and a psychophysics 
professor. Several professional actors, Politzer said, would tap into this 
scientist pool for advice and background information. He remembered when Newman 
came up to him to talk about X-ray lasers and particle beam weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, Politzer has six lines, in which he describes the inner workings 
of the bomb to Newman. Politzer however, said that he doesn't know if the scene 
will be in the final edited version. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Newman) could produce this intensity of a scene over and over again," 
Politzer said. "He told me to pretend that he was a student of mine." 
</P>
<P>
Days on the set were long and often stretched out by delays between scenes, 
Politzer said. Filming would often continue until 6 or 7 at night. After work, 
Politzer would pull out his harmonica to join the cast and crew in impromptu 
jam sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Last month Politzer returned to his permanent role as professor. He said it is 
unlikely that he will ever act again. Surprisingly, the film experience did not 
satisfy his scientific curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into it wanting to see where the magic comes from. And it's like 
magicians," Politzer said with an impish smile. "Up close it's even more 
mystifying."

A 'SPECIAL YEAR' FOR CORSAIRS' CAGERS; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA COACH BUILDS A TITLE CONTENDER ON QUICKNESS, DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"We have a chance to have a very special year," says John McMullen, Santa 
Monica College men's basketball coach, in this season's game program. 
</P>
<P>
It has been special and could get better. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs, ranked first in the state by the Junior College Athletic Bureau, 
had won 27 games, the most earned victories in school history. Last year's team 
finished 27-8, but the wins included a forfeit that was originally a loss. 
</P>
<P>
SMC was 12-0 in the Western State Conference Southern Division at the start of 
the week after last Saturday's runaway 100-73 victory over Los Angeles Valley. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen said that Valley, the division's second-place team, may not have been 
ready for the game. He said the Monarchs' point guard had quit the team and 
that, without him, Valley wasn't able to handle SMC's quickness. 
</P>
<P>
Not many teams have been able to keep pace with the Corsairs. 
</P>
<P>
SMC has lost only to Los Angeles City, Golden West and Cerritos. The Corsairs 
avenged their loss to Los Angeles, lost to Golden West on a shot at the buzzer 
and lost to Cerritos on the road in December, when Cerritos was No. 1 in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen's players "are very quick and athletic," said Phil Matthews, coach of 
Ventura. The Pirates, who won the 1987 state championship under Matthews, 
entered the week leading the WSC Northern Division and ranked 12th in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"They have great athletes, most of them sophomores," said Matthews, whose 
Pirates lost a road game to the Corsairs, 83-66, in their only regular-season 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"They know exactly what John wants them to do," he said. "They play hard, are 
well coached and well disciplined and can play with anybody on the junior 
college level." 
</P>
<P>
What McMullen wants is quickness, aggressiveness and tough defense. The 
Corsairs have done what their coach has ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Eight SMC sophomores played for last year's team, which advanced to the 
quarterfinals of the state tournament before losing to Merced by 5 points. Five 
of the eight are guards and a sixth plays guard and forward. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen does not have many big men; no player is taller than 6 feet, 6 inches. 
Two big men who were sophomores last year, 6-6 all-state forward Cortney Able 
and 6-9 forward Brian Preiss, gave the Corsairs a strong inside game. 
</P>
<P>
Without a dominant inside game this season, McMullen went to a three-guard, 
two-forward offense that is quick to attack -- even quicker to defend. 
</P>
<P>
The other night against Valley, the Corsairs took the Monarchs out of the game 
in a hurry. SMC's full-court press forced Valley into a rash of turnovers, 
which the Corsairs generally converted into fast-break baskets. In about six 
minutes, SMC got out to an 18-1 lead en route to what turned out to be an 
insurmountable 50-26 halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight sophomores, six were scoring in double figures through 28 games, 
led by guard Von Shuler's 16.8 average. Averages for the others were 
all-conference swingman Keith Amerson, 12.9; forward Kemo Patrick, 12.4, guard 
Troy Batiste, 11.2; guard DeShawn Pullard, 10.7, and forward Mark Day, 10.1. 
You can't have much more balanced scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Five of them got used to winning at Crenshaw High School, which has won nine 
Los Angeles City championships and three state titles in Coach Willie West's 18 
seasons. The ex-Cougars are Pullard, guard Terry Clark, Batiste, Patrick and 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
The uninitiated might think that the Crenshaw alumni are so used to winning 
that all McMullen would have to do is put their names in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Matthews of Ventura doesn't buy that theory. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews says that most California community college teams have good players 
"but John has taken those players and molded them into a cohesive unit that has 
done what he has wanted them to do." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of McMullen's regulars are from Crenshaw. Leading scorer Shuler is from 
Dorsey High and Amerson from Hamilton. The first players off the bench are 
sophomore guard Mike Sheehan from New Jersey and freshmen forwards Mark Moton 
of Sacramento and Chris Cook from Venice High. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen, whose 11-year record of 213-123 gives him more victories than any 
other SMC coach, said this may be his best team. 
</P>
<P>
"We are playing much more aggressively and with greater quickness this year," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we really do it with defense, more than trying to outrun people. 
Everything is based on shutting the other team down. We have greater quickness 
than any other team I've had, which lets us put a lot of defensive pressure on 
other teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We use quite a bit of both man-to-man and zone. We put on the press and keep 
it on." 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs' last two conference games are at 7 p.m. Saturday at College of 
the Canyons and at home against Bakersfield at 7 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Unless SMC takes a nose dive, it will win the WSC championship and thus earn a 
bye in the first round of the Southern California playoffs beginning Feb. 25. 
As conference champions, the Corsairs would open the playoffs Feb. 28 at home. 
The state semifinals and finals will be played March 9-11 at Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
If the Corsairs get to Santa Clara, they should be favored to win, and that 
would be the best performance by any of McMullen's teams since the 1981 squad 
advanced to the semifinals of the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
If the Corsairs win the state title, it would be only the second time that one 
of the men's basketball teams has done it. In 1972, the Corsairs were state 
champions under Coach Bobbie Dye, now head coach at Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
That would make it a very special year, indeed.

BROWN IS CHARGED IN PLOT TO KILL PRESENT WIFE, 2 D.A. AIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim businessman David A. Brown, already awaiting trial on suspicion of 
orchestrating his wife's 1985 murder, was charged Wednesday with plotting to 
kill his current wife and two members of the district attorney's office to 
thwart his prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 36, allegedly agreed to pay a fellow Orange County Jail inmate at least 
$30,000 -- and perhaps hundreds of thousands more -- to kill the three after 
the inmate's release. Prosecutors said they tape-recorded the agreement over 
the telephone after a third inmate tipped investigators to the plot. 
</P>
<P>
The three alleged targets are all central to Brown's prosecution on charges 
that he masterminded the killing of his wife, 24-year-old Linda Brown, and set 
up his teen-age daughter to take the blame. That trial is to begin March 29 in 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alleged Targets 
</P>
<P>
The three targets of the alleged plot are: Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey 
Robinson, who is prosecuting the case; Jay Newell, a district attorney's 
investigator who has been tracking the case since the crime, and Patricia 
Bailey, who married David Brown after the slaying of her sister -- Linda Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Bailey also is charged with murder in her sister's death but has now 
agreed to be a key witness against her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, 21, when told about the new charges against Brown, said in jail 
Wednesday: "I expected something like this from him. I don't put anything past 
him now." 
</P>
<P>
In this new twist to a case that already has had its share of bizarre turns, 
Orange County prosecutors on Wednesday brought a criminal complaint against 
Brown charging him with conspiracy to commit murder, arson and perjury. His 
arraignment on the new charges was continued Wednesday until March 3. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Early, one of Brown's attorneys, said: "This is a complete surprise. I'm 
completely in the dark, and until we get reports, we'll know very little of 
what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shaken by New Charges 
</P>
<P>
Early said that he met with Brown for a few minutes before the arraignment and 
that the defendant appeared somewhat shaken when informed of the new charges. 
The attorney added: "I didn't even ask him whether or not (the charges) were 
true." 
</P>
<P>
Brown's father, Arthur, learned of the new allegations as he and Brown's young 
daughter waited at County jail to visit the inmate. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know anything about it, and I don't want to hear about it," the elder 
Brown said. "I think it's all a bunch of bull, and Patty Bailey's the real 
culprit in all this." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charge that while in jail, Brown met Richard Steinhart, 36, a 
Huntington Beach resident facing narcotics charges, and contacted him dozens of 
times in the last month to arrange the killings of Robinson, Newell and Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
The following account of the events are contained in court papers given Tuesday 
to Judge Ragnar R. Engerbretsen, who cut off Brown's access to phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
In early January, an inmate contacted investigators and said he had overheard 
Brown and Steinhart plotting the killings. Confronted by Newell, Steinhart then 
allegedly admitted to the plot and agreed to assist in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taped 25 to 30 Calls 
</P>
<P>
Newell then listened to and taped several of the 25 to 30 telephone calls that 
Brown made from County Jail to Steinhart, who was in custody at the Huntington 
Beach Jail until his release in early February. 
</P>
<P>
In those taped conversations, prosecutors allege, Brown described Robinson, 
Newell and Bailey and agreed to pay Steinhart $10,000 for each of their 
killings. Brown also told Steinhart that he had buried $500,000 in the desert 
and that Steinhart could dig it up and keep $200,000 for his own expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who started a lucrative firm that specialized in retrieving data from 
damaged computer systems, collected $835,000 in insurance money after the 
killing of his wife in 1985, prosecutors have charged. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Brown had arranged to have $600 placed in the glove compartment 
of his car in his Anaheim Hills driveway for Steinhart to use to buy guns. And 
on Feb. 13, Brown -- convinced by Steinhart that Robinson and Newell had been 
killed -- had his brother deliver $11,000 in cash to Steinhart in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also expected that Patricia Bailey would soon be killed, prosecutors 
allege. Steinhart had told Brown, falsely, that he had arranged for a woman to 
be arrested and then kill Patricia Bailey in the women's jail for the price of 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arson Plan Alleged 
</P>
<P>
Capping off the alleged scheme, prosecutors say, Brown arranged that Steinhart 
"should burn David Brown's motor home and house in Anaheim so that it would 
appear that David Brown was also a target of someone," and Steinhart would then 
help Brown escape from jail. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also allegedly contacted Sally Jacobs, an undercover agent posing as a 
jail inmate, to have her tell authorities after Patricia Bailey's death that 
Bailey had admitted to her that she lied in her story against Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey testified that Brown convinced her and his daughter, Cinnamon Brown, 
that Linda Brown had to be killed. Cinnamon Brown, 18, who has now admitted 
shooting her stepmother, has spent the last 3 years in a California Youth 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
A former girlfriend of Steinhart, who asked not to be identified, said 
Wednesday that Steinhart told her tht he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam and a 
martial arts specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said that she saw Steinhart several days ago in Huntington Beach and 
that he told her that he was released from jail on protective custody because 
he was "a witness to something." 
</P>
<P>
Steinhart, who has not been charged in the case, could not be reached for 
comment. Robinson, the prosecutor who was allegedly targeted in the plot, said 
that he took extra precautions in recent weeks to protect his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real pleased with the way (the district attorney's office) was able to 
handle all this," he said.

COUNCIL VOTES TO SEEK POLLUTION MONITORING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Clemente City Council members, concerned about the effect of increased 
traffic on the air, voted Wednesday to seek a pollution-monitoring station in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city will ask the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) to 
install a station to "keep track of whether the air quality degenerates or 
remains the same in this region," said James S. Holloway, community development 
director. 
</P>
<P>
An AQMD monitoring station in San Juan Capistrano was closed down in 1978 
because its results were similar to those of the district's El Toro station. 
</P>
<P>
A monitoring station in Laguna Beach at the mouth of Laguna Canyon was 
discontinued in the mid-1970s because "it was not really showing any high 
levels of ambient pollutants that were areawide," said William Kelly, an AQMD 
spokesman. "It basically was picking up exhaust from the cars on the canyon 
road." 
</P>
<P>
The closest monitoring stations to San Clemente are in Costa Mesa and El Toro. 
But their distance from the city makes it "impossible to measure actual air 
quality in San Clemente" or to track "trends in air quality over time," 
Holloway wrote in a letter to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's desire to try and protect our air quality into the future, and 
to do that you'll have to do a lot of planning," Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said installation of a new station would cost the AQMD $100,000 and 
operation would cost $100,000 a year.

UNION CHIEF WILL BOYCOTT OCTD EXCELLENCE BRUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leader of the union representing the Orange County Transit District's 700 
bus drivers says she will personally boycott OCTD's motivational Drive for 
Excellence program, featuring Rams Head Coach John Robinson, claiming that it 
is a waste of taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Smith, general chair of Tustin-based United Transportation Union Local 
19, said that the one-day brunch program scheduled for March 5 at the Red Lion 
Inn in Costa Mesa is "an absurd expenditure" of taxpayers' money. "I have no 
intention of attending and most of the drivers I've talked to won't attend 
either," she said. 
</P>
<P>
An OCTD official strongly defended the "Drive for Excellence" program, saying 
that union members participated in developing it. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the expenditure for the program, which OCTD officials said is 
intended to help improve communication and boost morale, is an "insult" to 
drivers because the money would be better spent on cost-of-living adjustments 
in bus drivers' paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is typical of OCTD," Smith said. "They would rather spend money on fluff 
like this than take care of drivers' real needs." 
</P>
<P>
Drivers currently have no cost-of-living adjustment provisions in their 
contract with OCTD. Talks for a new contract are at least a year away. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Keith, an OCTD public information officer, said the one-day program is 
expected to cost $20,000, including Robinson's $4,000 speaking fee. She said 
the program will involve follow-up activities to be planned and budgeted later. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really an effort to show coach operators that we want them to be our 
front-line sales force with the public, and we're willing to help them with 
whatever they need to be good at it." 
</P>
<P>
Keith said that only about 150 drivers had made reservations for the brunch, 
with another 50 to 100 expected to attend.

THE LOSER IN CYPRESS VOTE TO PRESS SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
BUT MAYOR PRO TEM OFFERS TALKS FOR LESS CONTROVERSIAL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Officials of Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises Inc., the losers in Cypress' 
special election Tuesday, vowed Wednesday to pursue a $125-million lawsuit 
against the city, but the mayor pro tem said he hopes to come up with a 
compromise plan to avert that suit. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park hopes to recoup legal fees spent and money lost from a proposed 
sale of its property around the Los Alamitos Race Course, company spokesman 
Donald M. Robins said. That sale had been contingent on voter approval of a 
zoning change for the property to allow the development of Cypress Downs, a 
business and recreation complex. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Pro Tem John Kanel said he will propose at a Feb. 27 City Council 
meeting that a committee be formed of residents, city officials and Hollywood 
Park representatives, who would formulate a less controversial plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Talking' 
</P>
<P>
"We need to sit down and do some real talking," Kanel said. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park representatives are interested in such talks, said company 
official Marjorie L. Everett. But a lawsuit still will be pursued, she said, 
because of the company's financial responsibility to its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
A leader of the community group that helped defeat the zoning change Tuesday 
said the Feb. 27 meeting should emphasize community participation. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely want to see upgrading at the race track," said Joyce Nicholson, 
president of Concerned Citizens of Cypress for Greenbelt and Open Spaces 
Preservation. But "we want the community to have a say." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson said she would like to see a golf course, cultural arts center, 
sports complex and hotel built on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress Downs would have included a business park, office complex, a hotel, 
retail and commercial shops, and 31 acres for churches and schools on one of 
the largest remaining open spaces in northwestern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park initially filed its federal lawsuit in Los Angeles on Oct. 27, 
1987, after the City Council rescinded a zoning change that would have allowed 
a business park development on land designated for public or semipublic use. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit sought $125 million in damages as a result of losses incurred when 
the company could not sell its property to SDC Co. of Newport Beach, as 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
That same year, the company filed another lawsuit challenging Measure D, an 
initiative requiring a public vote on any zoning changes on land that had 
already been designated for public or semipublic use. As a result of that 
lawsuit, Orange County Superior Court Judge Tully H. Seymour said that the 
council should not have rescinded the zoning change and ruled that Measure D as 
applied to this case was invalid. The city appealed the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Company and city officials agreed to drop all litigation if voters in Tuesday's 
special election approved SDC's development plans. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan was soundly defeated by a vote of 6,061 to 3,043. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the city's appeal is pending, City Atty. Jerry M. Patterson said. 
"It will continue to be processed." 
</P>
<P>
SDC Co. spokesman Jim Watson said that the city is the real loser because it 
faces huge legal costs and a possible judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the city has a tough challenge ahead of them, which means the citizens 
are going to suffer," he said. "Hollywood Park is forced into a box to pursue 
litigation." 
</P>
<P>
SDC has several projects under way in Southern California, totaling about 2 
million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
"We move on," Watson said. But the loss was "obviously a disappointment."

IRVINE CITY MANAGER IS REMOVED IN 'TRANSITION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mayor doesn't call it a firing. 
</P>
<P>
The city manager won't call it a resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, in classic Irvine jargon, it is a "transition." 
</P>
<P>
But whatever you call it, Irvine's first and only city manager, William 
Woollett Jr., will no longer hold that job come Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pleas of about a dozen residents, the council in a closed session 
early Wednesday morning removed Woollett, 60, from the city's top 
administrative post, effective Aug. 1, amid criticism that the new council 
majority was playing power politics. 
</P>
<P>
Under the "transition plan" that Woollett submitted under pressure, he will 
continue on from Aug. 1 to Nov. 1 as "city manager emeritus" to work on special 
projects, and the council may vote to retain him beyond that date. The plan was 
approved by the council in a 5-0 vote, Mayor Larry Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a firing," Agran said. "We could have taken action unilaterally" and 
dismissed Woollett immediately, he said. "When you're fired, you don't submit 
the terms of your firing." He described the closed session, which lasted until 
about 1 a.m. Wednesday, as "friendly and respectful." 
</P>
<P>
But Woollett, who has been city manager since the city incorporated 17 years 
ago, said before the closed session that his hand was forced. 
</P>
<P>
The transition plan "is predicated on the fact that the council wants another 
city manager. That's very important. They are terminating me. I am not 
resigning," Woollett said Tuesday. (He was not available for comment 
Wednesday.) "If the City Council said, 'What do you want to do,' I'd like to 
stay for the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
In a city known for its pretty street names and bureaucratic euphemisms (the 
police chief's title is also "director of public safety"), the term "transition 
plan" did not mask the heated feelings at the council meeting Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Calling Woollett's removal a transition "is like asking (executed murderer) Ted 
Bundy to participate in an after-life experience," one resident told the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Others charged that Agran and the new council majority are playing power 
politics. Woollett helped form the city and is responsible for its growth and 
success, they contended. 
</P>
<P>
"You, the new political power gang, are saying, 'It will be our way,' " said 
resident Ray Quigley, who was a member of Irvine's first City Council. "What a 
chilling message . . . what political arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
Another resident called the mayor a "socialistic dictator." 
</P>
<P>
In a memo 2 weeks ago, Agran asked Woollett to write two "transition plans," 
one that would have him stay on in an "emeritus" position and the other that 
would not. Woollett's contract is due to expire July 1, but the city manager 
asked for an extra month, Agran said. Agran said in the memo that it was the 
"sense of the council" that it was time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, who is not an Agran ally, pointed out 
Tuesday night that the council had never before discussed Woollett's removal, 
"formally or informally." 
</P>
<P>
Agran said the City Council began talking about a transition plan 5 years ago, 
when Woollett was ill and there was concern that he would not be able to return 
to his job. Also, the council wanted to be prepared as Woollett approached 
retirement age, Agran said. "This is just a continuation of the process." 
</P>
<P>
But Agran's differences with Woollett appear to be pressing the issue now. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, after city elections produced a council majority sympathetic to 
Agran's slow-growth leanings, the council sat down with Woollett and "indicated 
we wanted to prepare for new city management." Woollett at that time asked for 
2 more years, Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
The new council members have brought "a new progressive agenda for the city" on 
such issues as open space, traffic concerns and recycling, the mayor said, 
adding: "The city is clearly ending one phase of development and beginning a 
new phase." City management should reflect that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a city in transition," Agran said. Irvine has grown from a small 
community to a city of more than 100,000 and one of the 200 largest 
municipalities in the country, he said. "We are a complicated organism 
involving commercial and industrial and an agricultural economy. It's very 
clear that we're going to need new approaches to complicated problems, such as 
transportation and air quality. That's the evolutionary stage in which the city 
finds itself," Agran declared. 
</P>
<P>
Agran added that the council did not discuss specific reasons with Woollett in 
the closed session. 
</P>
<P>
The council postponed until its next meeting further discussion on whether to 
promote Paul Brady, assistant city manager, to the post or whether to recruit a 
new city manager from elsewhere.

POLICE CHASE, CAPTURE SUSPECT IN PURSE-SNATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Huntington Beach man, chased by officers after he reportedly snatched a 
76-year-old woman's purse, jumped from a moving car and ran, police said, 
abandoning his girlfriend in the car. 
</P>
<P>
The chase began when the man grabbed the purse at Warner Avenue and Mount Eden 
Street in Fountain Valley and got into a stolen car, police said. He then led 
police on a chase for a mile through congested traffic until he suddenly jumped 
and ran, leaving the young woman in the rolling vehicle. Police chased him 
through residential areas and Mile Square Park. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Matthew Marr, 20, was arrested on suspicion of robbery, burglary and 
possession of stolen property, Police Lt. Mike Hanrahan said. The girlfriend 
was arrested and then released.

DAVIS FORMS UNIT TO STUDY GOVERNOR RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
State Controller Gray Davis took another measured step Wednesday toward 
becoming a Democratic candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think California is ready for a governor who isn't afraid to stand up and 
fight the insurance companies, oil companies and banks when they step over the 
line," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
With that, he issued a brief statement saying he was forming an exploratory 
committee to assess his chances as a candidate for governor in 1990. This was 
his second careful move toward the gubernatorial race, having earlier this year 
filed the legal papers necessary to raise funds for an exploratory campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The cautious nature of Davis' actions came despite advice from some quarters 
that he should act more boldly -- to barnstorm the state or otherwise try to 
stir up some excitement. After all, these backers said, he is the underdog, 
trailing three other contenders in the polls, and has nothing to gain by being 
low key. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Ready to Gamble 
</P>
<P>
But in an interview, Davis said he is not ready to gamble his political career 
just yet and so would go slow through the fall and maybe up until the first of 
next year. At that time, Davis would have to decide firmly whether to seek the 
governorship. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to aggressively communicate my message for the next several months 
and measure how people respond to it," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
His early message has three elements. 
</P>
<P>
Foremost, Davis offers himself as a new-breed Democratic Populist. He was the 
only potential candidate for governor to back Ralph Nader's Proposition 103 
insurance reform in 1988 and was a vocal backer of the campaign to bar oil 
drilling in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
"I have fought for working Californians and won. A lot of people talk a good 
game but don't deliver." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pushes 'Volunteerism' 
</P>
<P>
Davis also said he is determined to become a champion of "volunteerism." In 
these times of fiscal restraint, Davis argues, government is overlooking the 
potential benefits of citizen involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Davis is now trying to capitalize on the years from 1975 to 1981 when 
he was chief of staff to former Democratic Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only candidate who has spent any time in the governor's office. I've 
spent 7 years there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A relentless fund-raiser and disciplined campaigner, Davis went from the 
governor's office to the state Assembly to the position of controller in 5 
years.

L.A. POLICE CHIEF SAYS GOP FOES WANT UNITY FOR WILSON 
</P>

Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said Wednesday that some Republican 
Party leaders who hope to unite the party behind a 1990 gubernatorial candidacy 
by U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson are trying to discourage Gates from pursuing the race. 
</P>
<P>
"Some (GOP politicians) have told me, 'You are sabotaging the Republican 
Party,' " Gates said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who formed a gubernatorial exploratory committee last month, also said: 
"I have told them I am not going to stop exploring this no matter who gets in. 
I really have something to say." 
</P>
<P>
A letter by state Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin) and other Republican elected 
officials is being circulated this week urging Wilson to run for governor in 
1990 and asking Republicans to get behind Wilson to avoid a divisive primary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Time for Amateurs' 
</P>
<P>
Similar efforts to draft Wilson are expected at this weekend's state GOP 
convention here, where Wilson will be the keynote speaker. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no time for amateurs," Doolittle's letter says. "Pete Wilson is a 
dedicated, experienced statesman (who can) effectively lead our state." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, just reelected to the U.S. Senate, has decided to run for governor, 
according to friends. He is expected to announce the decision soon. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his solid Senate record since 1983 and, before that, the high marks 
he got as San Diego mayor, Wilson is seen by many GOP elected officials as 
their best chance to hold onto the governor's office now that Gov. George 
Deukmejian has announced he will retire after two terms. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson backers want him to get the GOP gubernatorial nomination unopposed so 
that he will be in a strong position when the Democrats come out of what is 
expected to be a heated primary. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has never run for elective office, Gates, police chief since 1978, 
is offering himself as a man with executive experience in a tough job and as 
someone who pledges to carry on the particular interest in law and order issues 
espoused by Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gates Sees Asset 
</P>
<P>
When he announced the formation of his exploratory committee, Gates said the 
fact that he is not an elected official will help him at a time when some 
politicians in Sacramento have been under investigation by the FBI for 
accepting campaign contributions and honorariums in return for specific help on 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"That line (in the Doolittle letter) about this not being a time for amateurs 
was directed at me, not at Peter Ueberroth," Gates said with a rich chuckle 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, who retires as baseball commissioner next month, has said he might 
run for the GOP gubernatorial nomination if Wilson does not. 
</P>
<P>
Gates had not planned to attend the GOP state convention, which starts Friday, 
but he has changed his mind, according to adviser Eric Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Rose and others around Gates were steaming Wednesday when told of the Doolittle 
letter. "We elect governors in California; we do not anoint them," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Davis Signed Letter 
</P>
<P>
One of the most interesting signatures on the Doolittle letter was that of 
state Sen. Ed Davis of Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was Gates' predecessor as Los Angeles police chief, and the two have 
conferred often over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"I signed that letter for Wilson without reading it," Davis said Wednesday. 
"But I do think Pete Wilson would make a good governor. I also think Daryl 
Gates would make a good governor. I want to see us have a good Republican 
primary, and may the best man win."

HOLMQUIST, BOYD TOP CANDIDATES AT CHAPMAN 
</P>

<P>
Dave Holmquist of Biola College and Bob Boyd of Riverside College are early 
front-runners for the men's basketball coaching job at Chapman College, a 
Chapman athletic department source said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The school stopped accepting applications Tuesday, and a seven-member committee 
is expected to make its decision by March 15. 
</P>
<P>
Holmquist has won five National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District III 
championships at Biola. In 1982, Biola won 39 consecutive games before losing 
to South Carolina Spartanburg in the NAIA championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy it here (at Biola), but I might like a new challenge," Holmquist said. 
"We've won 25 games here for eight years in a row and there are times when I 
feel I might like to try to do that somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Boyd took the job at Riverside for one season, after Dave Waxman took a year's 
sabbatical. Boyd has coached at USC, Mississippi State and Seattle University, 
as well as Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
He met with Bowman two weeks ago to discuss the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I've expressed my interest in the job and all that's necessary is for me to 
send in a formal resume," Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the others being considered are Bob Schermerhorn, interim coach at 
Arizona State and former UC Irvine assistant, and Rich Prospero, Chapman 
interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some discussions with Walt about the selection process and what my 
chances were," Prospero said. "I've just been taking things one day at a time. 
But, I really don't know where I'm going to be come April." 
</P>
<P>
Prospero has guided the the Panthers to a 12-11 record (5-5 in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn.), despite numerous distractions. 
</P>
<P>
Prospero replaced Lindsay Strothers as interim head coach two days after 
Strothers replaced Kevin Wilson. Wilson was fired the day before Thanksgiving, 
one game into the season. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman also has an opening for a women's basketball coach. Bowman said the 
committee will make that selection by late March of early April.

<P>
Anyone wondering why he or she paid $5 to see the Southern Section 4-AA 
first-round playoff game between Mission Viejo and Tustin high schools 
Wednesday night might take consolation in the fact that, as a fan, a bad game 
can be easily forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
But it's tough for a coach to forget, even when he walks away a winner. Mission 
Viejo Coach Bob Minier knows the feeling, especially after watching his Diablos 
settle for a 51-46 victory over Tustin Wednesday night at Mission Viejo High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is we played good the first half, but tonight we just played 
terrible in the second," Minier said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some of the credit for Mission Viejo's troubles must go to Tustin, 
which, after trailing, 32-22, at halftime, came out in the second half with a 
frenetic, full-court press. The Tillers forced nine turnovers in the third 
quarter, throwing the Diablos off their favored slow-tempo game. In that 
quarter Tustin outscored Mission Viejo, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Had Tustin -- which played without standout guard Cheavly Ly, who was taken out 
of the game midway through the first quarter and did not return because of 
disciplinary reasons -- been able to capitalize on offense, the Tillers might 
be meeting Inglewood (15-8) in a second-round game Friday night. But Tustin 
shot only 30% in the game, including a 3-for-16 (19%) effort in the third 
quarter. Mission Viejo shot 47.5% in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Tanner scored 14 points and Greg Amaya 11 to lead Mission Viejo (12-12). 
Jason Moore had 16 points to lead Tustin (13-13). 
</P>
<P>
Torrance 59, Servite 52 -- Host Torrance overcame a sluggish performance by 
opening the fourth quarter with a 10-0 run to take the lead for good at 48-42. 
Servite, dogged by the Tartars' full-court pressure, did not score until 4:05 
had elapsed in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Servite (12-11) was hurt by turnovers (22) and poor free-throw shooting (six 
for 18). Torrance (15-10) made 20 of 30 foul shots, including 10 of 15 in the 
decisive fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance's Rick Robison led all scorers with 26 points, but made only six of 20 
shots. He was better at foul line, converting 11 of 13 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Steve Marusich led Servite with 18 points, but was held in check after 
scoring 10 in the first quarter. ROB FERNAS Cajon 52, Kennedy 50 -- Eric 
Culberson hit a 17-foot jumper with 2 seconds left for the victory. Culberson's 
shot was set up when point guard Amar Washington took an inbounds pass with 7 
seconds remaining, drove to the basket and passed the ball out to Culberson. 
The playoff victory was the first in Cajon's 19-year history and spoiled a 
10-point comeback by Kennedy (18-8) in the fourth quarter. Jim Barker's 
three-point shot with 49 seconds left cut Cajon's lead to 50-48. Tom Deep then 
tied the score with 41 seconds left, was fouled on the play but missed the free 
throw. Cajon is 16-9.

Huntington Beach High School played four quarters of frenetic, fast-break 
basketball and stunned Santa Ana, 89-62, in a first-round Southern Section 5-AA 
boys' basketball game Wednesday at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers (13-11) will play fourth-seeded Lakewood (21-6), a 70-41 winner over 
Alhambra, on Friday. The site will be decided by a coin flip today. 
</P>
<P>
With point guard Andy Thompson leading the charge, Huntington Beach got its 
transition game on track. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers jumped ahead, 10-2, after 3 minutes of play. They hit six of their 
first eight shots while the Saints made only one of five shots. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach hit 11 of 21 shots in a furious first half. 
</P>
<P>
"They shot the lights out," Saint Coach Greg Coombs said. "It was very direct. 
Get the rebound, take it out, bang, bang, bang." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Drake of Huntington Beach hit 12 of 13 shots to lead all scorers with 24 
points. "He was nails tonight," Oiler Coach Roy Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach scored points three ways: quick, fast and in a hurry. 
Thompson, who had 14 points and eight assists, continually streaked up court to 
lead the Oiler offensive onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," Thompson said. "I love to go like that. It's my game. If somebody 
pressures me at half court, I've got to take it to the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson did not slow even after a nasty second-quarter collision with Santa 
Ana's Oscar Wilson that had him icing his back and hand to stop the pain. 
Thompson said he planned to have X-rays on his right hand after the game. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach never trailed and led by as many as 16 points in the first 
half. But the Saints, unable to work the ball inside, went outside and hit 
three three-point baskets to come within 42-36 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's departure with his third foul 5 minutes into the second quarter 
further crippled the Saints inside, and they were ineffective the rest of the 
way. Wilson ended the night with five points. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, the Oilers broke open the game, outscoring Santa Ana, 
24-7. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected them to have a little more of an inside punch, but I think their 
foul trouble hurt them." Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Chauncey Woolridge led Santa Ana (19-8) with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 82, Montebello 76 -- The Barons survived a fierce 
fourth-quarter rally at Montebello. Derick Corcoran's three-pointer with 42 
seconds left in the third quarter put Fountain Valley ahead, 67-47. 
</P>
<P>
Behind senior center John Brown, who had 32 points, Montebello (18-6) battled 
back in the final quarter. After the Barons (19-6) missed their fifth 
consecutive one-and-one free-throw attempt, Montebello had a chance to tie the 
score but Fountain Valley forward Mike Merli stole a pass that was intended for 
Brown. Tom Weaver, who was forced to return to the game after sitting out most 
of the fourth quarter with a sprained ankle, hit two free throws with 16 
seconds remaining to make the score 80-76 and clinch the victory.

SANTA ANA VALLEY RALLIES, BUT CAN'T OVERTAKE GAHR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a game dominated by turnovers, Gahr High School built a small lead over 
Santa Ana Valley and then held on for a 84-79 victory Wednesday in the first 
round of the Division 5-A Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Before a sparse crowd at Gahr, Santa Ana Valley (12-12) fell behind by nine 
points, 44-35, at halftime and then pulled to within two points late in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Gahr (17-8), which committed 21 turnovers, built an 11-point lead midway 
through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons came back again, pulling within 80-76 with 1:10 left. But a layup 
by Rod Summers and two free throws by Mark Charbonnet put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley, which committed 18 turnovers, was led by Bryan Singleton with 
25 points and Chuck Steen with 23 points. Eddie Martinez scored 20 points to 
lead Gahr, which will play at Irvine Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 56, Dana Hills 52 -- Ted Pelonis scored the final five points as the 
Seahawks (18-8) held a second-half rally at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
Pelonis hit two free throws with 22 seconds left in the game to clinch the 
victory after Dana Hills pulled within two, 54-52. Pelonis finished with 15 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fedden scored 10 of his 18 points in the third quarter as Dana Hills cut a 
30-22 halftime deficit to 42-39. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills (15-14) outscored Ocean View, 6-2, at the start of the fourth 
quarter to take a 45-44 lead. But Todd Norman, who had 21 points, hit two free 
throws to give Ocean View the lead for good, 46-45, with 5:14 left.

<P>
Los Alamitos High School rallied to defeat visiting El Toro, 72-71, in a 
first-round Southern Section 5-A playoff game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos (12-14) allowed El Toro to race to a 27-17 first-quarter lead, but 
started to play better defense and capitalized on El Toro turnovers the rest of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
"We turned the ball over six straight times to start the second quarter and 
that let them back in it," El Toro Coach Tim Travers said. "(Mike) Wilson hit 
that big three that hurt us a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's three-pointer to give Los Alamitos a 70-67 lead came only 40 seconds 
after Brent Overbeek's free throw with 2:08 left tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (3-13) took the lead again, 71-70, after baskets by Dan Somers and 
Khari Johnson (who finished with 28 points and 21 rebounds). But Robert Conlisk 
hit from in the key with 35 seconds left to give Los Alamitos the victory. 
Conlisk finished with a game-high 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We slowed down the tempo and stayed with what we wanted to do," Los Alamitos 
Coach Steve Brooks said. "The defense kicked in in the second half."

WALKER SCORES 37 AS BREA-OLINDA WINS EASILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS KAISER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brea-Olinda High School junior forward Keith Walker knows there's a long road 
ahead to reach his goal of a Southern Section 3-A boys' basketball 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
So even though he scored a game-high 37 points to lead the Wildcats to a 73-44 
victory over La Sierra in a first-round game Wednesday, he's not that thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
"Our season's not over yet," he said. "So I won't be happy unless we've won it 
all. I'll get a little happier each game (we win)." 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats, who play San Dimas on Friday, got off to a fast start Wednesday 
on the strength of Aaron Charlton's three-point play and Walker's two 
three-point baskets for 9-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Charlton finished with 16 points and Craig McPhee contributed 11 rebounds for 
the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
The closest La Sierra got in the first half was at 22-16 when 6-8 center Keith 
Greeley sank two free throws midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda (20-7) used a zone defense to shut down the inside game of Greeley, 
who was limited to 14 points, 11 below his season average. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually we don't do that," Walker said of the double, and sometimes 
triple-teaming on Greeley, who will attend USC. "But I've played against him 
before, so I knew he was big and strong." 
</P>
<P>
Greeley missed his first four shots and made only five of 19 field-goal 
attempts in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Walker was 14 of 28 from the field four of nine from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda opened up a 46-31 lead after three quarters after an 11-3 run to 
close out the period. Walker, whose season high was 42 points against El 
Dorado, had six points in the spurt. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats maintained a comfortable lead through the final quarter. They 
never allowed the Eagles (15-8) to get any closer than 12 points, and closed 
out the game with a 14-0 streak.

FULLERTON HITS KEY FREE THROWS DOWN STRETCH FOR 67-63 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Green hit four free throws in the final quarter and Fullerton High School 
defeated Pioneer, 67-63, Wednesday in a first-round Southern Section 4-A 
playoff game at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Green scored six of his 13 points in the fourth quarter. Chris Rubal clinched 
the victory with a free throw with 23 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer (12-11), a fourth-place team from the Whitmont League, trailed, 43-32, 
at halftime, but started the second half with a 9-1 spurt and eventually tied 
the score, 55-55, with 50 seconds remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But the Titans failed to score in the final two minutes and lost an opportunity 
to tie the score when they turned the ball over. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Bach led Fullerton (17-6) with 17 points. Pioneer was led Matt Armstrong, 
who had 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will play at Artesia Friday night.

CORONA DEL MAR STOPS EL DORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Corona del Mar High School put the brakes on El Dorado's high-scoring offense 
and scored a stunning 61-43 victory Wednesday night in Placentia in the opening 
round of the Southern Section 3-A division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (16-9) opened a 9-0 lead and trailed only once, stopping El 
Dorado's 14-game winning streak with a fine defensive effort. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado had scored 80 or more points in seven games and averaged 78.1 points 
per game during its winning streak, but its fast-breaking offense was reduced 
to a half-court game. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado (20-5) made only 16 of 58 shots, and center Matt Luke was the only 
effective player offensively with 13 points and 9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't be disappointed with our season, but I was disappointed with this 
game," said Wayne Carlson, El Dorado coach. "They took us out of our game and 
then we lost our poise. Give them credit, they're tough." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of El Dorado's opponents, Corona del Mar did not play a transition 
game with the Golden Hawks, trading baskets in a blistering pace. Instead, 
Corona del Mar played tenacious, man-to-man defense and set the pace with a 
slower tempo. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar methodically wore down El Dorado in the third quarter, 
outscoring the Golden Hawks, 18-6, as El Dorado managed to make only a single 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar guard Matt Cwiertnia limited Mike Renaud, El Dorado's leading 
scorer with a 16.4-point average, to only nine points. Center Brian Spratt 
contained Luke, the county's leading rebounder with a 13.5 average, and led all 
scorers with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Matt Herrington was instrumental in cutting off El Dorado's outlet 
passes, continually preventing fast-break opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Orris, Corona del Mar coach, said he smelled an upset as early as Sunday 
when the pairings were announced. 
</P>
<P>
"I sensed they were nervous when I realized they didn't like their draw," Orris 
said. "I think they were looking over their shoulders. We limited them to a 
half-court game, and they got frustrated right from the start." 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado's frustration reached it a point where two players were accessed 
technical fouls in the third quarter as the season was slowly slipping away. 
Corona del Mar opened a 38-28 lead with 27 seconds remaining in the third 
quarter and it was apparent an upset was in the making. 
</P>
<P>
Spratt sealed the victory in the final quarter, scoring 11 points before Orris 
cleared his bench with 1:18 remaining. At that point, El Dorado had scored only 
38 points. 
</P>
<P>
"A great defensive effort, and a great team effort," Orris said. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar advances to play Laguna Hills Friday at a site to be determined.

Savanna 91, Azusa 70 -- Sophomore forward Mustapha Abdi scored 35 points and 
had 13 rebounds to lead the Rebels at Savanna. The Rebels (24-2), champions of 
the Orange League, will face Trabuco Hills on Friday in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Abdi's 17 first-half points help Savanna take a 42-27 halftime lead. The Rebels 
outscored the Aztecs, 22-11, in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (15-9) cut the lead to, 46-36, on a basket by Lord Noble with 4:30 
left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Abdi and center Tim Tillman sparked a 10-4 run to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman scored 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels' 91 points were the most by the team since 1967. Abdi's 35 points 
was the second highest in school history. Van Bye scored 43 in 1967. 
</P>

Noble led the Aztecs with 24 points. Tony McGee, Azusa's leading scorer, was

REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS FOR WELLS FARGO;

TOWER IN KOLL CENTER PLANNED

<P>
Wells Fargo Bank gave the Koll Co. a boost when it said it would move into a 
planned 16-story building just north of the San Diego Freeway in Koll Center 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The bank signed a 15-year lease for nearly $30 million, and the building will 
now be called Wells Fargo Tower. 
</P>
<P>
That will make Koll's lenders happy, since they can be assured of one large 
tenant even before the $85-million building has been built. Construction starts 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
The bank took 71,000 square feet of space on floors 7 through 9. 
</P>
<P>
The bank will consolidate its regional offices -- now in the Irvine Co.'s 
Newport 
</P>
<P>
Center -- and other operations near John Wayne Airport. Altogether, nearly 300 
employees will move. 
</P>
<P>
The building -- designed by local architects Langdon Wilson Mumper -- will be 
the fourth tower Koll has constructed in the business center, which extends on 
both sides of the freeway. The giant Newport Beach-based developer plans to 
build three more office towers, one more low-rise office building and a third 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Koll's partners on the new tower -- scheduled for completion in April, 1990 -- 
are Hart Advisors Inc. of Hartford, Conn., and Columbia Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn. in Beverly Hills. MICHAEL FLAGG

APARTMENT-BUILDING FRENZY MAY BRING TROUBLE FOR LANDLORDS, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So many apartment complexes are planned and under construction in Orange County 
that some owners could be in for trouble just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
That's the conclusion of the latest annual study released by Research Network 
Ltd., a Laguna Hills consulting firm. The findings are based on a recent survey 
of 82,000 of the estimated 177,000 apartment units in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the county's apartment market looks strong and vibrant on the 
surface," said Pamela Wooldridge, a Research Network consultant, "a deeper look 
finds several indicators that the good times may soon come to an end." 
</P>
<P>
For renters, that means apartments will probably be easier to find in most 
cities and that rents will not go up much, if they do at all. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, nearly 16,000 units were either under construction or 
in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
That figure is a record for the county, the firm said. If all of those units 
are built, the owner of a new apartment complex may have a tough time filling 
it up with tenants. The owner of an older complex may have problems keeping 
tenants. And both could have a tough time raising rents. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometime this year we're going to get to a place where we can use the term 
soft to describe the market," said Matt Disston, another Research Network 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
That view runs counter to the prevailing wisdom, which sees buying rental units 
in Orange County as a good move because vacancies are expected to become 
scarcer and rents, therefore, would soar. 
</P>
<P>
The tax reforms enacted 2 years ago removed some major tax incentives to build 
apartments, and high land costs in the county make it more difficult to build a 
complex that renters could afford. 
</P>
<P>
Pension funds, insurance companies and foreign investors are said to be 
scouring the county for complexes to buy. Hardly anyone is selling. 
</P>
<P>
But unless those investors can find a well-occupied building in one of the few 
cities where rents are rising faster than inflation, they may be severely 
disappointed, Disston said. The apartment construction boom of the last few 
years has continued unabated, and average occupancy rates have dropped from a 
tight 99% in 1985 to 96.9% last year, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
Those situations will "aggravate the current market situation even more, and 
will certainly take the shine off the investment value of apartment development 
as we move into the 1990s," Wooldridge said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if inflation is factored in, rents have actually dropped across the 
county over the last year, the survey found, and a similar drop is expected 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the findings: 
</P>
<P>
* While actual monthly rents rose from an average of $702 in 1985 to $725 last 
year, inflation-adjusted figures show a drop, from the equivalent of $802 to 
$758. 
</P>
<P>
* Whether rents went up or down depended on the city. Even after adjusting for 
inflation, rents were higher for most units in Irvine, Newport Beach, Rancho 
Santa Margarita, Stanton and Seal Beach. They were flat or fell everywhere 
else. 
</P>
<P>
* Last year, developers built 6,700 apartment units, a record for the county. 
That represents a 15% increase over 1987, although it is close to the figure 
for 1986. The researches project that about the same number will be built this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
* The greatest number of units -- 1,800 -- were built in the unincorporated 
areas of the south county, where the majority of the county's undeveloped land 
is. Costa Mesa was second with 900 units. "The city's redevelopment has been 
pretty successful, and it's been actively pursuing apartments," Disston said. 
Placentia was third with 800 units. 
</P>
<P>
* Occupancy rates for the north county used to be lower than those for the 
south, but this time the situation was reversed. The reason is probably that 
north county's generally lower rents drew more tenants, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
* The cities with the highest average occupancy rate were Brea, with 98.8%; El 
Toro, 98.1%; and Cypress, 97.9%. Lowest occupancy rates included Laguna Niguel, 
94.1%, and Mission Viejo, 94.2%.

MICRO D TO LOSE 2 KEY EXECUTIVES IN MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two top Micro D executives will leave the Santa Ana computer products 
distributor after its merger with Ingram Industries Inc. is completed, the 
company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations of Vice Chairman Harold L. Clark and Godfred P. Otuteye, 
senior vice president and chief financial officer, were voluntary, Micro D 
Chairman Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy said. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys came to me in December and said that if the (merger) went through, 
they both wanted to kick back a little bit," Lacy said. 
</P>
<P>
Otuteye's resignation is effective March 10, while Clark's last day will be May 
1. 
</P>
<P>
The positions have been filled, Lacy said, but the company will not name the 
successors until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Micro D agreed last month to be acquired by Ingram, a Nashville-based 
conglomerate, for $43.9 million. Ingram plans to merge its Buffalo, N.Y.-based 
computer distribution company with Micro D. The new company, to be 
headquartered in Santa Ana, is expected to have sales of about $1 billion in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, a specialist in rescuing troubled corporations, joined Micro D as an 
executive vice president in 1984. He was recruited by company founder Lorraine 
Mecca to help stem losses at the company. He was promoted to president and 
chief operating officer in 1985 and to vice chairman in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Clark "came on board at a time when every move we made was critical to our 
ability to stay in business and, under his leadership, we've seen this company 
come to dominate the distribution business," Lacy said. 
</P>
<P>
Micro D earned $8.2 million on revenue of $553.4 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he has no immediate plans after he leaves the company besides taking 
some time off. "I need to take a few months off for some rejuvenation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Otuteye joined Micro D in 1983 as chief financial officer and was promoted to 
senior vice president in 1985. He was chiefly responsible for overseeing Micro 
D's initial public stock offering in 1985 and rounding up new investment for 
the firm as it grew rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and Otuteye have been large holders of Micro D stock. Before the merger 
agreement, Clark owned 40,000 shares and Otuteye owned 115,000. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Ingram will pay $14.75 for each Micro D share it doesn't 
already own.

With American Stores Co.'s purchase of Lucky Stores still entangled in a legal 
mire, a retail specialist's report this week cautions that its stock offers 
little potential to appreciate in price. 
</P>
<P>
The analyst, Edward F. Comeau of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York, cites 
American's stalled purchase of Lucky as one reason why the supermarket and drug 
company's earnings are likely to lag. 
</P>
<P>
American, which is moving its headquarters from Irvine to Salt Lake City, 
agreed to pay $2.5 billion last year to acquire Lucky. The plan was to combine 
Lucky and American's Alpha Beta chain under the Lucky banner. That move has 
been held up since September, when a federal court blocked the combination of 
the two chains -- a temporary ruling that is on appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Until the merger problem is resolved, Comeau writes, American "will lose $60 
million to $70 million in synergistic benefits." If the merger takes place, 
Comeau says, "the synergistic benefits initially would be offset by the 
lowering of Alpha Beta's gross margin to conform with Lucky's 'Everyday Low 
Price' program." 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he predicts, "a meaningful contribution to earnings would not be 
likely until 1990 at the earliest. Our 1990 earnings estimate of $5.50-$6 per 
share . . . is based on somewhat optimistic assumptions." 
</P>
<P>
Despite American's high leverage and spotty earnings over the past several 
years, however, Comeau noted that the stock price is receiving some support 
from the company's strong cash flow -- estimated at $16 per share in 1989 -- 
and high estimated private-market value of $80 to $110 per share. 
</P>
<P>
American's shares, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, closed Wednesday at 
$56.50 each. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the shares are more fairly valued in the $45-$50 range, given the 
company's earnings outlook and associated risks," the analyst concludes.

POP BEAT/MIKE BOEHM: CLUB TO KEEP OFFERING LOCAL BANDS DESPITE PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Coach House's recent experiment in offering regular showcases for Orange 
County rock bands has not been an immediate hit, but the club will continue its 
efforts to devote one or two nights each month to local talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still going to keep doing this and build something up," said Nikki Sweet, 
who is in charge of local bookings at the concert club in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday's show, featuring the Squids, Cactus Jack and Black Daphne, was low 
on attendance and high on hassles, according to Coach House officials. Kraig 
Black, the club's stage manager, said that only 70 paying fans turned up and 
that unruly behavior led to some Squids fans being ejected or barred from 
entering. 
</P>
<P>
A band from Garden Grove whose act features frat-rock music and comical stage 
antics, the Squids arrived in a chartered bus with about 60 fans, according to 
guitarist Dan Moran, the Squids' leader. Moran said Tuesday that "one bad apple 
made a scene, and she's never coming on a bus ride with us again." 
</P>
<P>
But Black said that there were problems with about 30 people in the Squids' 
entourage and that Moran may have missed some of the trouble while preparing to 
go on stage. Problems included fans smuggling booze into the club, 21-year-olds 
buying alcoholic drinks for minors, abusive language toward club personnel and 
littering the parking lot with beer bottles and cans, Black said. Eventually, 
he said, the club called sheriff's deputies to clear the parking lot and to 
make sure that the fans who had been barred or ejected remained on the bus 
until the show ended. 
</P>
<P>
Three previous local-band nights since December had gone better, Sweet said, 
with no similar incidents and with attendance ranging from 100 to 200. 
</P>
<P>
In booking acts that are not proven draws at the 380-seat Coach House, the club 
-- which according to Sweet faces nightly overhead costs of $2,300 -- is 
relying on the bands to help sell tickets in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of discouraging when it doesn't happen," Sweet said. But the Coach 
House will try again on March 12 with an Orange County band night featuring the 
Slim Beats and the Slugs. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet emphasized that the Coach House is not running the sort of "pay-to-play" 
arrangement that some Hollywood clubs follow, in which bands have to buy 
tickets for the privilege of being booked. All bands playing the Coach House 
are being paid, Sweet said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coach House's comparatively isolated location in southern Orange County 
doesn't lend itself to the sort of walk-up clientele that has helped Bogart's 
in Long Beach succeed with frequent local band bookings, Sweet said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Coach House has been charging $8 a ticket for local band nights, 
several dollars more than fans usually have to pay to see the same groups at 
Bogart's or at Night Moves in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE ACTION: Huayucaltia, a Latin American folk group that is part of the 
politically oriented nuevo cancion movement, will play Saturday from 2 to 4 
p.m. Saturday at Tower Records, 23811 El Toro Road in El Toro. . . . Tiny Tim 
will tiptoe through the tulips April 11 at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano, on a bill with the Del Rubio Triplets.

TOYING WITH THE LIMITS OF PHOTOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENA DONOHUE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One hundred and fifty years ago, France's Joseph Niepce and Louis Daguerre and 
England's William Fox Talbot elaborated on the 13th-Century camera obscura to 
give birth to photography. In a cleverly subversive anniversary celebration, 
the Long Beach Museum's "Enlarging the Repertoire: Jerry Burchfield and 
Charlene Knowlton" (through March 5) toys with the conventional limits of 
photography. 
</P>
<P>
We expect photos to be small; these artists make mural-size works. Photography 
is a record of actual events in time; these artists create contrived realities 
using state-of-the-art techniques as accomplices. "Pure" photography should 
involve subject, camera and a keen eye; this work results from lots of props 
and a multimedia approach. 
</P>
<P>
Burchfield, a widely exhibited fine-art photographer and former co-director of 
the BC Space photo gallery and laboratory in Laguna Beach who now teaches at 
Cypress College, spent a good decade mastering every possible trick to help 
photographers hawk their wares. This he decided was anything but a "record of 
truth," so he abandoned the camera, the staged shoot and the darkroom for what 
he calls a spontaneity and higher truth more akin to the goals of painting. 
</P>
<P>
Burchfield works with sheets of chemically sensitized Cibachrome paper joined 
to make huge photo "canvases." He places bodies, skeletons, toys, debris and 
necklace charms directly on the treated paper. Working in total darkness, he 
then traces objects with a flash light. Dense objects register as dark, 
detailed stencils in intense hues. 
</P>
<P>
Other objects let light through and have an ethereal transparency. Light limns 
poignant war toys ("Above and Below"), temple-like geometries ("Refuge") or 
life-size marauding consumers ("Commodification/ 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers"). 
</P>
<P>
Themes are contemporary -- parenting, gratuitous violence, commercialism, 
isolation -- but the smoky violet, purple, blood-red atmospheres, the shadowy 
afterimages and pockets of intense light give works the same transcendent feel 
of Ron Cooper's light torsos. Especially fine is "Last Supper," with 
Burchfield's squatting wife, his infant and human bones invoking archetypal and 
temporal cycles. 
</P>
<P>
Trained as a painter, Knowlton makes photo-environments. She paints masked, 
nude models with her own monochromatic, geometric designs, places them in front 
of her large painted abstractions, photographs the whole scene, then enlarges 
the print to mural size. Using wax, oils and dry pigments in blacks, whites and 
browns, she paints primitive markings back onto the mural print, binding all 
levels of information -- hands-on, replicated, contemporary, native -- into one 
ambiguous whole. 
</P>
<P>
Knowlton uses photography to translate her message into the language of today's 
media culture. "People are trained to believe photos," she says. She wants the 
almost life-size photos of masked, hunched nudes and Western cars to collide 
with abstract marks, thwarting quick cultural generalizations and suggesting 
connections between tribal art and contemporary art, non-Western cultures and 
our own world view. 
</P>
<P>
The strategies in "Enlarging the Repertoire" aren't new. In the '20s, 
Pictorialists used soft focus and cropping to push the limits of photography 
into fine art. With 60 years of photo technology and anything-goes art to draw 
upon, Burchfield and Knowlton pull in painting, happenings, performance art and 
conceptualism. If you take your photography with nothing on it, you will learn 
something from this show; if you welcome a good helping of deft 
experimentation, you are in for a treat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enlarging the Repertoire: Jerry Burchfield and Charlene Knowlton" runs 
through March 5 at the Long Beach Museum, 2300 E. Ocean Ave. Long Beach. Museum 
hours: noon to 5 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday. (213) 439-2119.

'LI'L ABNER' PLAYS IT BIG, BOISTEROUS

<P>
"Peanuts" made its way to the stage. Even characters in "Doonesbury" have found 
theater life. Now if someone could only figure out how to put "The Far Side" 
under lights. 
</P>
<P>
But it was "Li'l Abner" that started it all. Al Capp's popular comic strip hit 
Broadway in the late 1950s as a hee-hawingly loud musical, winning audiences 
with its combination of hokum and satire. Norman Panama and Melvin Frank's 
adaptation was such a favorite, it was turned into a movie in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
At the Newport Theatre Arts Center, director Tim Nelson does the customary in 
bringing this bunch of backwater misfits to life -- meaning the performances 
are almost painfully boisterous and unbridled, the colors are right out of the 
Sunday comics, and the tempo hardly ever relaxes. 
</P>
<P>
The production has the requisite movement. Trouble is, the show stumbles as 
much as it strides, especially when the ensemble finds center stage. 
</P>
<P>
The leads don't always do right by their big numbers, either, but at least they 
generate the necessary flavor and make obvious what these very obvious 
characters are all about. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Gale is properly muscle-bound and muscle-headed as the archly good hero of 
all the silliness. He's the hickest of the hicks, a guy whose only worry before 
the government declares Dogpatch, U.S.A., a missile-testing zone is whether he 
can avoid the marrying grasp of the ample Daisy Mae. 
</P>
<P>
As Daisy Mae, Jennifer Simpson is lovable enough; Sarah Ann Crawford and Robert 
Hopkins as Mammy and Pappy Yokum are plenty goofy, kind of like Ma and Pa 
Kettle on diet pills; and Ron Samson bellows at the right thug-ish pitch as 
Earthquake McGoon. 
</P>
<P>
What has redeemed "Li'l Abner" over the years are its swipes at bad politicians 
and bureaucratic incompetence, and its portrait of Big Business as purely 
despicable. Jim Reiss as the money-mad General Bullmoose holds up his end of 
the satire, as does Ron Lipp as the opportunistic Senator Phogbound. 
</P>
<P>

FOR ART MUSEUM, NO MONDAVI MONEY TILL ALL WINE IS SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Ninety-nine bottles of wine on the wall. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, about 7,200 bottles -- 600 cases -- of wine remain to be sold in a 
partnership venture between the Newport Harbor Art Museum and the Robert 
Mondavi winery in Oakville, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
One dollar from every sale of "Museum Chardonnay" (actually the winery's 1984 
Chardonnay as specially labeled for sale in coastal Orange County) will be 
donated to the museum for its building fund and operating budget. But the 
museum will only receive the money after every bottle is sold. 
</P>
<P>
The program started in December with 1,200 cases of wine, about half of which 
remain on retailers' shelves. Each bottle costs about $10. A green, orange and 
purple neckband on each bottle reads in part: " . . . as you appreciate the 
subtle beauty of Robert Mondavi Museum Chardonnay, you'll also support the 
visual arts in Orange County. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor is the only museum in the country to which Mondavi is donating a 
portion of wine sales. Why would a Napa Valley winery care about supporting the 
visual arts in Orange County? Because, according to a Mondavi spokesman, 
Southern California is a major consumer of wines -- and because the Robert 
Mondavi Wine and Cultural Center will open in Gateway Center in Costa Mesa in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,100-square-foot center, with a walled garden, will be open only to 
corporations and professional associations, to whom it will offer concerts and 
food festivals along with other cultural and wine-related activities. Founder 
Mondavi explains in a written statement that his winery views "wine as an 
integral part of our culture, heritage and the gracious way of life."

Because of incorrect information supplied to The Times, a story in Thursday's 
Calendar incorrectly described the timing of a Robert Mondavi donation to the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum. In fact, the winery will give a check representing 
$1 per bottle of sales of its 1984 "Museum Chardonnay" in a ceremony in August 
to mark the opening of its new 11,000-square-foot Robert Mondavi Wine and 
Cultural Center in Costa Mesa's Gateway Center.

LIFE ON WHEELS: HERE'S A THRIFTY TRAVEL TIP: TAKE A EUROPEAN VACATION TO YOUR 
NEW CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You've heard of going out of town to find a good deal on a new car? Phil and 
Jean Lansdale of Corona del Mar take it a step further. They leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
Seven times in the last 20 years, the Lansdales have traveled to Europe to pick 
up their new vehicles: four Mercedes-Benzes, an Audi, a BMW and a Volkswagen. 
Each time, they saved enough to pay for the vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"I would recommend it to anyone who's buying a European import," Jean Lansdale 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Although a handful of import dealers promote the concept with modest ads or 
incentives such as air fare or accommodations, European delivery remains for 
the most part a well-kept secret. Some import manufacturers would like more 
people to know about it, while others do not encourage it. 
</P>
<P>
But reluctantly or enthusiastically, nearly all offer the option. 
</P>
<P>
Each plan is a little different, but in general, you can save about 10% off the 
list price of a European import if you're willing to pick it up there. Because 
you can drive the car during your visit to the Continent, you save the cost of 
car rental or other transportation as well. 
</P>
<P>
And if your schedule allows a long, leisurely trip, you can save even more. "If 
you use the car in Europe for more than 90 days, you can save the 6% California 
sales tax," says Harry Taylor, European delivery specialist for McLaren's BMW 
in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
But there are disadvantages. If you want to dicker over the price, you might be 
better off buying from a dealer's stock. With that 10% already lopped off the 
top, there's much less room for negotiation, and some companies simply won't 
budge even a penny. 
</P>
<P>
Specifics vary, but here's an overview of how European delivery works: 
</P>
<P>
You go to a U.S. dealer, order the car and pay a deposit of $250 to $2,000, 
depending on the car. 
</P>
<P>
That first step must take place several months in advance so the car can be 
built to specifications, although less choosy buyers can be accommodated in as 
few as 3 weeks if they are willing to take a vehicle that is not made to order. 
</P>
<P>
The balance is due about a month before the pickup date. That means the whole 
transaction is handled in this country, in U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Then, passport and invoice in hand, you fly to Europe, go to the factory and 
pick up the car. 
</P>
<P>
When you're ready to return home, you take the car to one of many drop-off 
points and get back on the plane. Four to 6 weeks later, you pick up the car 
from the same dealer with whom you started. 
</P>
<P>
With a few exceptions, you don't have to worry about such details as European 
registration and insurance or getting the car through U.S. Customs. Nor will 
you have to get the vehicle retrofitted to meet U.S. standards; the 
manufacturer will take care of installing the catalytic converter and whatever 
else is required here. In all cases, the cars available for pickup in Europe 
through dealers here are exactly the same as those sold in the United States, 
right down to the warranty. 
</P>
<P>
Some dealers have specialists who handle all their European deliveries, which 
can make the process smoother yet. 
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturers, such as Saab, subsidize European delivery so dealers don't 
lose on the deal. "It's mostly a marketing thing," says Jim Vickers of Beach 
Imports in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But other manufacturers will not subsidize. Taylor says his dealership makes 
less money on a European delivery, "although we don't have to purchase the car 
and pay interest expense, which we do on a car that sits on the lot." 
</P>
<P>
And with Peugeot, "the dealer does not make a dime," according to Jeff Greco of 
Anaheim Stadium Peugeot. "But if someone buys a car through us, they're 
probably going to have it serviced at our center. It goes beyond the initial 
sale." 
</P>
<P>
The few European car manufacturers that don't offer European delivery tend to 
be at the high end of the scale: Ferrari, Maserati, Aston-Martin and Alfa 
Romeo, for example. The same goes for the low end: Nobody goes to Yugoslavia to 
pick up a custom-made Yugo. 
</P>
<P>
But if you're interested in something between those two extremes and your 
passport's in order, keep reading for a brief brand-by-brand rundown: 
</P>
<P>
* Mercedes-Benz: Orders must be placed about 3 months in advance, according to 
Jack Stinson, European delivery specialist at the House of Imports in Buena 
Park. A $2,000 deposit is required, with the balance due 35 days before 
delivery. You pick up your car at the factory in Sindelfingen, West Germany, 
just outside Stuttgart. You'll get a free night at a hotel in either Stuttgart 
or Sindelfingen, and Mercedes-Benz also pays your cab fare from the airport. 
The next morning you'll get a tour of the factory, including a movie on how the 
cars are made, and a free breakfast and lunch. Stinson will help with travel 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
* BMW: Order as far in advance as possible, at least 3 months, although a 
limited selection is available 4 to 6 weeks in advance. The deposit is $500, 
and the balance is due 1 month before delivery. You pick up your car at the BMW 
factory in Munich. At McLaren's BMW, specialist Harry Taylor will refer you to 
a travel agent for help with your arrangements. A factory tour is available. 
</P>
<P>
* Porsche: Order 4 months in advance. The deposit is $1,000, with the balance 
due 1 month before delivery. You pick up your car at a Porsche factory, either 
in Stuttgart or Zufenhausen, West Germany. A tour of the factory is available, 
and some customers also get to try out their new wheels on one of Porsche's 
test tracks, says Campbell Porsche salesman Ishmael Martinez. Travel 
arrangements are up to you, although special incentives are sometimes offered 
in connection with the Porsche Festival in May and June. The car is dropped off 
in Concord, Contra Costa County, although it can be delivered to the dealer in 
Orange County for an extra $565. 
</P>
<P>
* Volkswagen: Order as far in advance as possible, but there is no specified 
length of time, according to Dietrich Meisner of Commonwealth Volkswagen in 
Santa Ana. The deposit is $250, with the balance due 30 days before delivery. 
Pickup for most models is at the Volkswagen factory at Wolfsburg, West Germany. 
Campers and Vanagons are not available this way. VW Foxes and Golfs are not 
made in West Germany, so they are also not available for European delivery. 
Travel arrangements are up to you. 
</P>
<P>
* Audi: Order at least 90 days in advance. The deposit is $1,000, with the 
balance due 30 days before pickup. The factory is at Neckarsulm in southern 
West Germany, said Dan Molloy of Campbell Audi in Buena Park. Travel 
arrangements are up to you. 
</P>
<P>
* Jaguar: European delivery is permitted but not encouraged by the company, 
according to John Plummer of Bauer Jaguar in Anaheim and Don Moothart of 
Newport Imports. If you do pick up your Jaguar at the factory in Coventry, 
you'll save "only about $1,000," according to Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
* Peugeot: Cars are available in as little as 3 weeks after order, although the 
selection is better with more lead time, according to Greco at Anaheim Stadium 
Peugeot. The deposit is $500, with the balance due 1 month before pickup or at 
time of order if it is less than 30 days before pickup. Pickup is at an airport 
or the Peugeot factory in Paris. A tour of the factory can be arranged. There 
is no flexibility on prices, and travel arrangements are up to you. 
</P>
<P>
* Saab: Order 8 to 10 weeks in advance for the best selection. The deposit is 
$500, with the balance due 30 days before pickup, which is at the Saab factory 
in Gothenburg, Sweden. The car will be delivered to Long Beach, and customer 
must take it through U.S. Customs, although import duties are prepaid. A 
factory tour is available; travel arrangements are up to the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
* Volvo: Order about 90 days in advance. The car must be paid for at time of 
order, and the price is preset, according to Frank Romano of Earle Ike Imports 
in Irvine. Travel arrangements to factory in Gothenburg are up to the buyer. 
Shipping from Sweden is free; from other European ports, there is a charge of 
$500 to $600. A factory tour is available.

DISCOVERY: FUNHOUSE AT OLD WORLD VILLAGE LIKE 'TWISTED' CARNIVAL FOR ADULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's probably only one way to become immediately comfortable with the 
Funhouse, Huntington Beach's Friday night-only nightclub at Old World Village. 
Go into a dark room, pull all the shades and put a tape of "The Cabinet of Dr. 
Caligari" on the VCR. Watch all of it. Then go straight to the Funhouse. 
</P>
<P>
After 90 minutes or so of watching the pioneering silent psychological horror 
film -- in which everything appears both misty and garish and none of the sets 
contains a right angle -- the Funhouse ought to look pretty familiar. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a carnival for adults but kind of twisted and scary," said Gary 
Tesch. And Tesch, 29, ought to know. A nightclub disc jockey from Long Beach, 
he is the prime mover behind the Funhouse and the one who early last year 
brought together a small team of artists and prop men who shared his slightly 
skewed vision of a good time. 
</P>
<P>
The result is the conversion of the covered, cavern-like beer garden of the Old 
World Village restaurant into a multiroomed, black-lit, bizarrely decorated 
dance hall/midway/maze. 
</P>
<P>
The simple act of arriving at the Funhouse offers a big clue of things to come. 
Each person admitted must negotiate a maze constructed of darkly painted cloth 
partitions (and, said Tesch, the layout of the maze is changed weekly). 
</P>
<P>
On arrival in the main section of the club, visitors are surrounded by high 
fabric walls painted with such stylized figures as carnival freaks, acrobats 
and various leering faces. A fog-making machine puffs to life occasionally, 
filling the air around the exit of the maze with strawberry-scented clouds. 
From time to time, projections of cartoons and other features are shown on the 
walls and, in an adjacent room, various adult carnival games are offered for $1 
per play. 
</P>
<P>
(The games are uncommon, and anyone who would be put off by a dart throw in 
which the targets are the derrieres of mannequins -- one of the actual games, 
and typical of the rest -- might want to give that part of the club a miss.) 
</P>
<P>
Holding it all together is Tesch, who plays music that is anything but 
homogenous. Heavy metal often gives way to doo-wop, which in turn gives way to 
reggae. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, said Christian Cucnar, general manager of the restaurant and beer 
garden, generally is 20-ish and punk to varying degrees. And, he said, during 
the 4 hours the Funhouse is open each Friday, more than 500 people routinely 
show up. 
</P>
<P>
The Funhouse is almost more a state of mind than a location, since it is put up 
every Friday afternoon and taken down every Saturday morning, leaving the rest 
of the week for wedding receptions, dances and private parties in the beer 
garden. During Oktoberfest, which is celebrated there from mid-September 
through mid-November, the Funhouse takes a 2-month hiatus. 
</P>

HEART ASSN. GALA: FUN, AEROBICS, DONATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA MARIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the high society workout of the season, a cardiovascular romp-and-stomp 
and cash-flow bonanza for the local chapter of the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
We give it a 10, and you could definitely dance to it. 
</P>
<P>
As they have for the past 2 years, organizers of this season's "Heart to Heart 
Gala" imported a New York dance troupe to entertain during dinner on Saturday 
at Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But entertain isn't quite the right word -- although the dancers put on an 
elaborate show between dinner courses that included five costume changes and 
choreographed routines to songs ranging from Gershwin to Andrew Lloyd Webber. 
</P>
<P>
What they did was entreat, invite, cajole and otherwise hijack members of the 
fancy-dress audience onto the dance floor for aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a group that just wants to have fun," said gala chairwoman Tina 
Schafnitz, who wore a red-and-black Gildas gown made especially for the party, 
with one black and one red opera-length glove and one black and one red shoe. 
</P>
<P>
After cocktails and a browse around the silent auction room, the 350 guests 
entered a darkened dining room filled with billowing smoke and a full-blast 
recording of the theme from "2001." 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, the dance floor was packed -- the tuxed and gowned party-goers 
doing the boogie-woogie with dancers in Spandex. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so much better than most of these kinds of parties, which are so 
boring," said Diane Clark, slightly winded from an energetic bop with her 
husband, Jim. "Usually by halfway through the meal, you're wondering how 
everybody at the table can get up and leave without making a scene." 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through a dinner that included salmon en croute, vichyssoise, filet 
mignon and white chocolate mousse, guests were hitched together in a rumba line 
shimmying through the tables to the tune of "Locomotion." 
</P>
<P>
The $200-per-person benefit was completely underwritten by Tom Siffermann and 
Dirk De Young of Woodview Development Corp. Lee Ann Siffermann, Tom's wife, was 
vice chairwoman of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Net proceeds, including money from the silent and live auctions, were estimated 
at $85,000, according to Schafnitz. Mingling with local notables were "L.A. 
Law" stars Michael Tucker and Jill Eikenberry. Tucker's cousin, Mark Miller, is 
president of the Orange County chapter of the American Heart Assn.

ANN CONWAY: VALENTINE'S DAY HAS PARTY-GOERS GETTING TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cupid, you're such a cutie. Nothing like a few well-placed arrows to get the 
party scene crammed with candlelight suppers and women decked out to halt 
heartbeats. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It all began Saturday night with the gala opening of Opera Pacific's "Norma," 
starring Dame Joan Sutherland, one of the most heartbreakingly romantic operas 
ever to hit the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Before the show, more than 200 members of Opera Pacific's Guild Alliance swept 
into a sold-out gourmet supper at Ambrosia restaurant, just a heartbeat away 
from the Center, to dine on a Druid-theme feast. (Norma, you see, was a Druid 
priestess who had the rotten luck to fall hopelessly, madly, gaga in love with 
a confused cad.) 
</P>
<P>
On the menu: English country salad with hearts (what else?) of palm, prime ribs 
of beef, La Scala baked potato and a candy-box array of chocolates. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding were co-chairwomen Carole Follman, in a poufy black dress aglow with 
glitter, and Nancy Sorosky, seductive in swirls of red on black satin. 
</P>
<P>
David DiChiera, general director of Opera Pacific, acknowledged feeling "just a 
little bit nervous" about opening night. "In opera, there are so many things 
going on; it's almost like trying to balance a mathematics equation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't seem at all concerned about the diva's Orange County debut. "Dame 
Joan Sutherland is probably the great bel canto artist of the century. I don't 
think there is anybody who has had such an illustrious, significant career who 
is alive today." 
</P>
<P>
Other sartorial showstoppers: Regina McGrath, whose regal opera gown was inlaid 
with zillions of black and gold sparklers (and whose crown of braids was dotted 
with gold beads); Gayle Dvorak, a walking valentine in a dress smothered with 
flirty red spangles; and Helen Reinsch, who kept her ankle-length chinchilla 
coat draped over the back of her wing-back chair. ("I'm not letting it out of 
my sight," she said, adding that the breathtaker was a surprise from husband 
Harry. "He's so good to me!") 
</P>
<P>
Also in the crowd: Ed and Floss Schumacher, chairwoman of the OP board; Erich 
Vollmer, executive director of the Orange County Philharmonic Society, and gala 
committee chairwomen Laila Conlin (guild president), Susan Beechner, Wanda 
Gwozdziowski, Ruby Lloyd, Louise Prell, Connie Quarre and Jean Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
Bleeding hearts: Across town that night, former New York Yankees manager Billy 
Martin was swinging on the dance floor with his wife, Jill, at a party keyed to 
the Valentine's Day Massacre rather than to lace-edged valentines. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of "Godfather VIII," this year's blast (fake guns were all over 
the place) at the Balboa Bay Club, came when Martin, a BBC resident, 
transferred his "Godfather" status to Santa Margarita Co. VIP Tony Moiso, who 
was attending with his moll Melinda. 
</P>
<P>
Jill eschewed hearts and flowers for the mob, choosing to spin around the dance 
floor in a backless black leather sheath and a veiled cocktail hat the size of 
a caviar tin. 
</P>
<P>
Billy (who kept trilling "Vooooolare! Ohhhhhh! Oh!") was the life of the party, 
which featured such candlelight fare as veal Marengo, tutti-frutti and 
Florentine cookies. 
</P>
<P>
"Men just love this party," said Ileane Doolin, there with her husband Nick. 
"They're such little boys!" 
</P>
<P>
Puttin' on the Ritz: It was two days until their first anniversary, but Lois 
and former astronaut Buzz Aldrin were beaming like newlyweds when they strolled 
into the Ritz restaurant in Newport Beach on Sunday for the Ritz Brothers' (a 
tribe of Ritz regulars) Valentine's Day dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Their secret for a successful first year? "Love!" Lois said. 
</P>
<P>
"Love?" Buzz said. "That's not very original." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I just love you!" Lois said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Buzz said he needed a minute to think about it. "You know how I like to come up 
with thoughtful quotes," he said with a wink. Eyes glued to the floor, he 
pondered the question for a few seconds, then looked up and said: "The secret 
to a good first year is mellow glitter. Yes, mel-low glit-ter." 
</P>
<P>
At the Ritz, red tapers lit up the faces of guests such as Mary and James 
Roosevelt; Dori and Jack deKruif; Marilyn and Dick Hausman; Charlene and Hans 
Prager; Diane and Jim Slemons; June and Bob Wian (he founded Bob's Big Boy), 
Ron Soderling with Gail Showalter, Noddie and Bill Weltner, and Norman and 
Candy Suits, who said she had already gotten her valentine: "Today! A new red 
Jaguar!" 
</P>
<P>
Date with an Angel: Ask an angel how to celebrate one of the year's most 
romantic days and she'll tell you: "Take a trip to Venice!" Or so it seemed on 
Monday when members of the Angels of the Arts, the all-female support group of 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center, and their spouses floated into the 
Four Seasons Hotel to celebrate Valentine's Day with fare prepared by chefs 
from the Hotel Cipriani in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
In town to cook up a storm all week at the hotel's Pavilion restaurant, the 
chefs -- including some from Italy's Splendido and Villa San Michele hotels -- 
performed their culinary premiere for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
And such a performance. Out of the kitchen: scampi salad, eggplant tortellini, 
veal rosette with baby artichokes, puree of potatoes with white truffles -- all 
served with Santa Sofia Valpolicello Classico (1985), of course. 
</P>
<P>
Overseeing it all: Natale Rusconi, the suave managing director of Hotel 
Cipriani in Venice, the Hotel Villa San Michele in Florence and the Hotel 
Splendido in Portofino; and Peter Hinzmann, manager of the Pavilion restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Among those on the guest list: Judy and David Threshie; Pat and Dick Allen; Kit 
and Stephen Toth; Susan and Timothy Strader; Dotti and Glenn Stillwell, and 
Ygal and Sheila Prell Sonenshine.

The Paramount Unified School District has offered teachers a 2% salary 
increase, Supt. Richard B. Caldwell said. In a Feb. 9 story about teacher 
contract negotiations in several Southeast school districts, The Times 
incorrectly reported that the Paramount district had offered its teachers a 5% 
salary increase. Caldwell said a 5% salary increase already has been accepted 
by classified and management employees. Negotiations with teachers remain at an 
impasse.

Under the new federal plant closing law, 17 companies notified California 
officials of plans to lay off workers. All but three -- Restaurant Enterprises

TOP BLACK ACTIVISTS OUST WINNIE MANDELA

Leading anti-apartheid organizations said today that they wanted nothing more 
to do with Winnie Mandela, the black activist mired in controversy over the 
alleged brutal conduct of her bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy Morobe, the publicity secretary of the United Democratic Front 
anti-apartheid coalition, told a news conference: "The community shall have 
nothing to do with any of Mrs. Mandela's actions from today onwards." 
</P>
<P>
Morobe spoke after reading a prepared statement that said: "The Mass Democratic 
Movement hereby distances itself from Mandela and her actions. 
</P>
<P>
"We call on our people, especially the Soweto community, to dissociate 
themselves from the actions of Mrs. Mandela in a dignified manner." 
</P>
<P>
The Mass Democratic Movement is an umbrella title for anti-apartheid groups, 
most of which have been banned by Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
The statement charged that in recent years Mandela's actions had increasingly 
led her into conflict with various sections of the anti-apartheid movement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that Mrs. Mandela has abused the trust and confidence that 
she has enjoyed over the years," it added. 
</P>
<P>
"We are outraged at Mrs. Mandela's complicity in the recent abductions and 
assault." 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from Mandela on the group's action. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was the harshest criticism yet of Mandela, wife of jailed 
nationalist leader Nelson Mandela and herself a symbol of anti-apartheid 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
Morobe referred to the alleged abduction last month of four black youths by 
members of Winnie Mandela's bodyguard squad, which until recently were called 
the Mandela United Football Club. The body of one of the youths, "Stompie" 
Moeketsi Seipei, was identified at a government mortuary Monday and police have 
started a murder investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, in the few public statements she has made, denied she was at home when 
the four were abducted to her house on Dec. 29. But she has defended the 
abduction, saying the four were taken to protect them from sexual abuse at a 
Methodist church residence where they were staying in Soweto. 
</P>
<P>
The church has denied the charge, and the anti-apartheid leaders made their 
denunciation of Mandela at the Central Methodist Church in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela has been widely criticized by community leaders in Soweto for not 
disbanding the 30-strong group of bodyguards.

Britain froze its diplomatic relations with Iran today as Iranian Muslim 
fundamentalist leaders said suicide squads are preparing to carry out the 
"death sentence" imposed on novelist Salman Rushdie and his publishers by the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
United News of India and the British Broadcasting Corp. said telephone callers 
threatened to bomb British planes to India unless Rushdie, whose novel, "The 
Satanic Verses," has outraged many Muslim fundamentalists, appeared in public. 
Two airlines, British Airways and Air Europe, said they are taking the threat 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Britain, which reopened its embassy in Tehran in December for the first time in 
eight years, condemned the threats and announced that it has frozen plans to 
"build up further our embassy." 
</P>
<P>
Iran's lone diplomat in Britain, Mohammed Basti, was summoned to the Foreign 
Office in London to discuss the situation and emerged defiant, telling 
reporters that Khomeini's "decree or verdict" was delivered "after careful 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do particularly with your country," the charge d'affaires 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Totally Unacceptable' 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office called Khomeini's statement "totally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that Muslims and others may have strong views about the contents 
of Mr. Rushdie's book," it said in a statement. "However, no one has the right 
to incite people to violence on British soil or against British citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Britain maintains three diplomats and support staff in its Tehran embassy. It 
had planned to send in more representatives as part of its normalization of 
relations with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
British news media said the Indian-born Rushdie is hiding with his wife, 
American novelist Marianne Wiggins, under police guard. Press Assn., the 
domestic British news agency, said Rushdie's first wife, Clarissa Luard, also 
has been given police protection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Put On Our Shrouds' 
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, said religious figures in the northwestern 
Iranian city of Rezaiyeh declared in a statement: 
</P>
<P>
"We have already put on our death shrouds and pledge to carry out the imam's 
(Khomeini's) death sentence against Salman Rushdie and his publishers in the 
United States and Europe." 
</P>
<P>
An Iranian cleric Wednesday offered up to $2.6 million for Rushdie's murder, 
and the author canceled a U.S. promotional tour that was scheduled to begin 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department said today that it is appalled by the death 
threats against Rushdie and denounced such actions as "completely 
irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said he did not see how "this in any way 
could improve the prospects" for U.S.-Iranian relations. Pakistan's government 
demanded that the United States and Britain ban the book and that all copies of 
it be destroyed. Six people died in Pakistan during a weekend riot over the 
book.

Raymond Buckey walked into court today a free man for the first time in nearly 
five years, smiling but refusing to discuss the mass molestation charges 
against him in the McMartin Pre-School case. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey was released on $1.5-million bail Wednesday night as reporters and 
photographers swarmed around him. Today Superior Court Judge William Pounders 
likened Buckey's jail exit to the televised slaying of President John F. 
Kennedy's killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby in 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
"It was certainly a circus," said Pounders. 
</P>
<P>
He asked the jurors, who have been admonished to avoid all news coverage of the 
2-year-old trial, if they had seen the release on late-night television news 
shows. They assured that him they had not. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the presence of the jury, Pounders deplored the fact that word of 
Buckey's release had leaked out and said he had tried to keep it a secret for 
Buckey's protection.

Foreign Ministry officials said one of the moujahedeen rockets landed outside a 
house in the western district of Khair Khana. Two girls and a boy were killed 
and two other children were injured. Another hit a minibus, killing the driver 
and two passengers south of Kabul airport, while a third rocket killed a 
3-year-old child and wounded a woman, they said. Also today, the foreign 
minister said the government has asked the United Nations to set up outposts 
along the border with Pakistan to check the flow of arms to Muslim guerrillas.

Solidarity and Polish government negotiators agreed today that the banned union 
could re-emerge as a national movement if it agreed to back government economic 
and political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
A communique issued after government-opposition talks on union pluralism said 
both sides agreed that provisions of a 1982 law that restrict unions to 
representing individual branches of industry should be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
The law should be amended "to make it possible for trade unions freely to 
create their own organizational structures," the communique said. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity's demand for legalization with the national structures it had during 
its period of legality in 1980-81 has been a key issue since talks opened last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The union owed its strength then to a national organization grouping workers 
from every branch of industry and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
However, government officials expressed doubts before the talks about letting 
Solidarity re-emerge as a mass movement capable of again challenging the 
Communist Party's monopoly of power. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exactly what we wanted to get," Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz 
said of the communique. "The opening of possibilities for Solidarity to exist 
in the shape it wants has in fact been agreed." 
</P>
<P>
However, the communique said its legalization depended on the success of the 
"round table" talks in forging a national agreement to back economic and 
political reforms and calming mounting labor unrest. 
</P>
<P>
The decision followed a similar agreement Wednesday that farmers' trade unions 
suppressed in 1981, including Rural Solidarity, would also be allowed to 
reemerge. 
</P>
<P>
The communique announced other concessions to Solidarity's demands on the 
manner and form of its re-emergence. 
</P>
<P>
It said the 1982 union law should be changed to allow registration of national 
unions by a single legal act. Solidarity had said conflicts could arise if each 
union cell had to seek registration.

DETAINEES END HUNGER STRIKE AFTER S. AFRICA PROMISES MANY RELEASES

Political detainees ended a mass hunger strike today after the South African 
government, fearing a situation "too ghastly to contemplate," indicated that it 
will free most of the 1,000 prisoners held without trial, their lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to suspend our hunger strike," more than 300 strikers in 
Johannesburg's main prison, Diepkloof, and in city hospitals said in a 
statement issued through lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the prisoners had been starving themselves for 24 days and were risking 
serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Johannesburg prisoners said Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok 
indicated during intensive talks this week that he will reconsider the cases of 
each detainee around the country and will release many of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received indications from the minister that perhaps the majority of 
them will be released," lawyer Kathleen Satchwell told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent compromise solution avoided grave suffering to prisoners and 
headed off a major political crisis for Pretoria. Neither side claimed a total 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fall Short of Demands 
</P>
<P>
The reported undertakings by Vlok fell short of demands by the hunger strikers 
that they should be released immediately and unconditionally and for an end to 
detention without trial. 
</P>
<P>
"It will not advance our cause to say they have lost and we have won, (but) we 
are glad we have got to where we have got," said Anglican Archbishop Desmond 
Tutu, who issued a statement in Cape Town after the meeting that appealed to 
the hunger strikers to suspend their protest. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Vlok told the church leaders that he agreed with them that the death of a 
hunger striker would have consequences 'too ghastly to contemplate.' " 
</P>
<P>
However, the strikers in Johannesburg, who took food at 7 a.m., said in a 
statement that they do not feel their action has been fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, an important victory has been won. We have succeeded in our 
principal objective -- to highlight the desperate plight of detainees and to 
protest arbitrary detention," they said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a victory for negotiation," a spokesman for Vlok, who asked not to be 
named, said in Cape Town. He acknowledged that the hunger strike hastened a 
review of detainees' cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fast Began Jan. 23 
</P>
<P>
The first group of strikers began their fast Jan. 23. They said they had no 
alternative because, under emergency laws, Vlok could hold them indefinitely 
without bringing them to court or even giving a reason for continuing to jail 
them. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether more than 100 detainees at Port Elizabeth's St. Albans 
prison, who stopped eating about 10 days ago, had ended their protest. Lawyers 
representing them were due to meet Vlok later today. 
</P>
<P>
Churchmen who saw Vlok, including heads of the country's Roman Catholic, 
Reformed, Methodist and Anglican churches, said they will watch to ensure that 
he honors his assurances to free a substantial number within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The six-member church delegation that met with Vlok included the Rev. Allan 
Boesak, who had fasted since Monday in solidarity with the hunger strikers. He 
said he is suspending his fast for two weeks because of the prospect of 
widespread releases.

Capt. James A. Freyer, the presiding judge, said there was not enough evidence

Balian, 48, of Los Angeles, also is charged with ordering crewmen to prevent

Edelman and Bernhard Manko of Lighthouse Point, Fla., were arraigned in front

YEUTTER TO BE A 'WARRIOR' FOR GLOBAL TRADING -- BUSH

<P>
The United States will pursue free and fair global trade relentlessly, 
President Bush pledged today, touting Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter 
as a hard-nosed warrior for those goals. 
</P>
<P>
At a swearing-in ceremony for Yeutter at the Agriculture Department, Bush 
praised the man who served as an aggressive and successful trade ambassador 
under President Reagan. At Bush's request two months ago, Yeutter agreed to 
take the Cabinet position, a lifelong goal, rather than leave government. 
</P>
<P>
Today's half-hour session was a formality because Yeutter took the oath of 
office within hours of his Senate confirmation Feb. 8, but it gave Bush an 
opportunity to discuss the future of world trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture is one of the most difficult areas in our trade talks," the 
President said. "Agriculture is an area where we attach extraordinarily high 
priority in international discussions." 
</P>
<P>
Trade reform talks are deadlocked at the moment because of disagreements about 
agricultural trade. The European Community opposes a U.S. proposal for 
worldwide elimination of uneven farm subsidies and trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
"Fair, free and open world markets -- that's what we want," Bush said. "That's 
what we're working for, and in the end that's what we're determined to get." 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter, who has been working quietly in his new job, promised Bush and the 
department's employees to lead "a team at the top . . . that will be strong, 
competent and energetic." 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter has yet to announce his selections for top jobs in his department, or 
even to name a press secretary. His most significant decision in his first week 
was how many extra acres of soybeans and sunflowers farmers will be allowed to 
plant under a provision of the drought relief law.

Former Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci will become a director of Kaman 
Corp., a defense and industrial hardware supplier when he is approved by the 
board later this month, the firm announced today. Since leaving office Carlucci 
has joined the boards of three other government contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Kaman's board will vote on Carlucci's nomination at its next meeting Feb. 28, 
said Kaman spokesman J. Kenneth Nasshan. Carlucci stepped down as defense 
secretary when President Ronald Reagan left office Jan. 20, ending a 30-year 
career in government. He recently took a job in the Washington office of the 
Carlyle Group, a merchant banking and investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman denied that Carlucci was sought for whatever influence he may 
have with the Pentagon. "Everyone understands what federal laws and guidelines 
allow," Nasshan said. 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving government service, Carlucci has been named to the boards of 
Westinghouse Electric Corp., Ashland Oil Inc. and Bell Atlantic Corp., all 
government contractors. Kaman's outside directors receive annual retainers of 
$10,000, plus fees of $600 for each meeting they attend.

BEN JOHNSON'S STEROID USE TOLD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ben Johnson's personal physician has said the disgraced Olympic sprinter took a 
banned steroid on one occasion four months before the Seoul Olympics last year, 
the Toronto Star newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jamie Astaphan, in a telephone interview from the Caribbean island of St. 
Kitts, said Johnson was depressed last May by a hamstring injury that 
threatened to end his rivalry against Carl Lewis for the 100 meters Olympics 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
"He bought stanozolol or somebody bought it for him in Toronto," Astaphan told 
the newspaper. But immediately after taking it Johnson suffered "violent muscle 
spasms." 
</P>
<P>
"He was immediately brought to me and I nursed him back to top condition," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan said Johnson was not on stanozolol when he beat Lewis in a 
world-record time of 9.79 seconds for the 100 meters gold, a medal taken away 
from him when he then tested positive for stanozolol use by Olympics officials. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he could be certain, Astaphan replied: "I must admit that even though 
I am his personal physician, there's no way I can keep a constant check on him. 
</P>
<P>
"But it would not make any sense for an athlete to go back on a drug which a 
few months previously could have ruined him for life." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has said he never knowingly took performance-enhancing drugs. Astaphan 
has denied he ever prescribed such drugs to Johnson or other athletes on 
Canada's Olympics team. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnson scandal prompted Canada to call an inquiry into drug use in amateur 
sport that resumes hearings in Toronto next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commission counsel Robert Armstrong said it was "totally irresponsible that Dr. 
Astaphan made such statements outside of the commission and not under oath 
where they are available to be tested by cross-examination."

DAVIS SIGNS WITH CINCINNATI FOR $1.35 MILLION PLUS INCENTIVES

<P>
Eric Davis and the Cincinnati Reds, who feuded in public over the outfielder's 
contract negotiations, agreed early today to a one-year contract worth $1.35 
million, a raise of $421,000. 
</P>
<P>
Reds owner Marge Schott, Davis and Eric Goldschmidt, Davis' agent, reached the 
agreement during a meeting in New York, where they were scheduled to go before 
arbitrator Raymond Goetz this afternoon. Davis can make an additional $200,000 
in incentives. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I should have let it go to arbitration, but I felt this would be good 
for Eric and good for the Reds," Schott said. "This was a guy who felt like 
nobody was on his side. I wanted to show him differently." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who made $899,000 in base salary last year and $30,000 in bonuses, had 
asked for $1.65 million in arbitration. The Reds had offered $1.15 million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his salary this year, Davis would get $100,000 for winning the 
Gold Glove, $30,000 for making the All-Star team, $25,000 for winning the 
Silver Slugger award, $20,000 for being named to the Sporting News post-season 
All-Star team and $25,000 for being named the Reds Most Valuable Player by the 
Cincinnati chapter of the Baseball Writers Assn. of America.

GATES REPRIMANDS AIDE FOR USING LAPD FILES FOR POLITICAL RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FREED and WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said Wednesday that he has reprimanded 
his second-in-command, Assistant Chief Robert L. Vernon, for using a Police 
Department computer to research the backround of a political candidate in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon, Gates said, intended to give to his Pasadena neighbors a computerized 
printout of newspaper stories and other publicly available documents relating 
to Michael Zinzun, a former Black Panther who is running for Pasadena's Board 
of City Directors. 
</P>
<P>
At Vernon's request, the Police Department's Anti-Terrorist Division last week 
printed out 50 documents -- 156 pages in all -- and gave them to Vernon. 
However, LAPD officials alerted Gates, who intervened before Vernon could pass 
on the data, according to the chief. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Judgment Was Poor' 
</P>
<P>
"While his motives were pure, his judgment was poor," Gates said of Vernon, a 
34-year department veteran who has been considered a leading candidate to 
eventually become chief. 
</P>
<P>
The rebuke comes at a time when Gates' interest in politics has stirred 
speculation on who might succeed him as chief, and department sources said the 
Zinzun matter would not help Vernon's chances. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said he intends to ask that Vernon, 55, repay the Police Department for 
having printed out the articles on Zinzun. The bill is expected to be more than 
$300. 
</P>
<P>
Zinzun played a central role in the dismantling of the LAPD's Public Disorder 
Intelligence Division (PDID), the forerunner of the Anti-Terrorist Division. 
The PDID came under fire for illegally spying on lawful citizens, and Zinzun 
was a plaintiff in a civil action against the unit. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Zinzun condemned Vernon's action as "obvious misuse of taxpayer 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
Gates said he intends to discuss the matter with the Los Angeles Police 
Commission, the civilian board that oversees the department. 
</P>
<P>
"The system worked in this case," Gates said. "I verbally reprimanded Bob 
(Vernon) and we'll look at whether we'll formalize that. We have returned the 
stuff that was printed out to the files." 
</P>
<P>
Gates said he did not know why Vernon's neighbors wanted the information on 
Zinzun. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon did not respond Wednesday to telephone messages left by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
A devout Christian and a lay minister in a fundamentalist church, Vernon in 
1987 was accused by some in the Police Department of giving promotional 
preference to fellow Christians. He strongly denied those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Regulations 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police regulations expressly forbid department personnel from using 
police resources for other than official purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The department's manual states: "All official files, documents, records and 
information held by the department . . . shall be regarded as confidential. 
Employees shall not disclose or permit the disclosure of . . . information 
except as required in the performance of their official duties." 
</P>
<P>
Zinzun's Los Angeles-based organization, the Coalition Against Police Abuse, 
was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties 
Union. The suit alleged that the PDID unit had spied illegally and kept files 
on hundreds of citizens. Some of those files had been removed by a PDID 
detective who was channeling the data to an ultra-right-wing organization. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the city settled the ACLU lawsuit for $1.8 million and PDID was 
disbanded. In its place, the 45-member Anti-Terrorist Division was formed. 
Strict guidelines limiting access to the division's files were established at 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
The unit, according to its desciption in the department manual, is responsible 
for collecting and analyzing information on "individuals and organizations 
which plan, perform, threaten, or attempt unlawful acts which can reasonably be 
expected to result in death, serious bodily injury, significant disruption to 
the public order, or significant property damage. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called 'Outrageous' 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Paul Hoffman, an ACLU attorney who helped prepare those 
guidelines, called Vernon's use of department resources for personal reasons an 
"outrageous" violation of accceptable police conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the concerns I have is if he would so something that stupid just for 
his neighbors, what kind of information would he dig up for somebody with some 
real political clout," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Zinzun, 40, is one of three candidates for a seat on the seven-member Pasadena 
Board of City Directors. His opponents are grocery store manager Gretchen 
Sterling and real estate broker Chris Holden, the son of Los Angeles City 
Councilman Nate Holden. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Holden, a candidate for mayor of Los Angeles and a strong ally of the 
Police Department, said Wednesday that he had no knowledge of Vernon's attempt 
to secure information about Zinzun. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Holden did not return telephone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demands Apology 
</P>
<P>
"This is how the PDID affair began," Zinzun said, "first one little thing, then 
another." He demanded a public apology from the LAPD, and called for expansion 
of the unit's guidelines "to make sure this doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Zinzun also called on the Police Commission to investigate whether Vernon or 
any other LAPD officers have used police records for similiar purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The response from Commission Chariman Robert M. Talcott was noncommittal: 
</P>
<P>
"We will be receiving a full and complete briefing on the subject matter (in 
closed session) at next Tuesday's meeting and review the materials at issue," 
Talcott said. "At that point, we will make a decision as to how the commission 
might proceed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agrees to Settlement 
</P>
<P>
Zinzun, who has been defeated soundly twice before in seeking election to 
Pasadena's board, was in the news a year ago when he agreed to a $1.2-million 
out-of-court settlement with Pasadena police. 
</P>
<P>
Zinzun had alleged that he was beaten and falsely arrested in a June, 1986, 
fracas at the Community Arms low-income housing complex in northwestern 
Pasadena. During the scuffle, Zinzun was struck in the face, allegedly by a 
police flashlight, and lost the sight in his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
He is seeking to represent a district that is adjacent to the one in which 
Vernon lives.

A headline in the Metro section on Feb. 16 read: "Gates Reprimands Aide for 
Using LAPD Files for Political Research." As noted in the story, the "files" 
were not actual police files, but were newspaper articles and other publicly 
available documents stored in a commonly used computer data base. The material 
was retrieved for Assistant Chief Robert L. Vernon via a computer at police 
headquarters.
