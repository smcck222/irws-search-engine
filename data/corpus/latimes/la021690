METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 HAWTHORNE MINISTERS OPPOSE LEGAL GAMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal by former Hawthorne Mayor Guy Hocker to legalize gambling in the 
city generated strong opposition this week when two Hawthorne ministers urged 
the City Council to reject the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor Bruce Chamberlain of Hope Chapel and the Rev. Earl Thornton of Del Aire 
Assembly of God Church told the council that they oppose gambling because it 
can lead to other problems, such as higher crime rates, lower property values, 
and increases in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Chamberlain said the Ministerial Assn. of Hawthorne and Lawndale 
voted unanimously to oppose Hocker's plan. 
</P>
<P>
After the two ministers spoke Hocker urged the council to place a measure on 
the ballot and allow voters to decide whether they want to legalize gambling. 
</P>
<P>
The council took no action on Hocker's proposal.

<P>
If you have the feeling that we Southern Californians are besieged with 
problems -- traffic, air quality, crime and the limitations of oat bran, etc. 
-- take heart. 
</P>
<P>
A group is unveiling plans today for "a heavenly community" somewhere in L.A. 
-- a "Maharishi City of Immortals" that is "noise-free, pollution-free, and 
free from crime and anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
Even free of Medflies? Perhaps the Maharishi Heaven on Earth Development Corp. 
will address that issue at its afternoon press conference at the Century Plaza 
Hotel. Invited to ascend to M.C.O.I. are any "top developers and community 
leaders" who wish "to participate" (another way of saying "invest") in a 
community of nontoxic houses, transcendental meditation schools and "perfect 
health and prevention centers." 
</P>
<P>
Prices for a piece of this heaven range from about $300,000 to, well, the sky's 
the limit. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. has the honor of being one of 15 communities where the corporation hopes 
to build a City of Immortals. None are planned in Orange County, probably 
because that region is already blessed with Irvine, whose official motto is: 
"Another Day in Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, a 21-foot-tall, 48-foot-long sand sculpture of 
famous European buildings recently opened in the Santa Anita Fashion Park mall 
in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Constructed by Todd Vander Pluym , founder of Sand Sculptors International, the 
work depicts such landmarks as Big Ben, St. Peter's Cathedral and Heidelberg 
Castle. 
</P>
<P>
It's on display for the rest of the month -- come rain or shine. As the mall's 
program notes, it's the world's largest indoor sand sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Of Medflies and malathion: A car spotted crawling insect-like through the usual 
Ventura Freeway jam the other day bore the bumper sticker, "Friends Don't Let 
Friends Spray Pesticide." 
</P>
<P>
Or something like that anyway. It was hard to read through the car's haze of 
exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
Is First Interstate having second thoughts about the giant "I's" that it 
recently tacked to the crown of the otherwise majestic 73-story tower? 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the Downtown News has published numerous letters from Civic 
Center workers who said they were angry about a skyline marred by a "company 
billboard." One reader even complained that he'd "nearly been blinded by the 
sun reflecting off those shiny gold" I's. 
</P>
<P>
Well, they can't complain about the FIB tower depicted in a large, First 
Interstate ad placed in this week's Downtown News. The crown is devoid of 
"I's." 
</P>
<P>
The Greater L.A. Press Club kicked off its 44th year the other night in its 
current domicile, the L.A. Equestrian Center in Burbank (please, no jokes 
comparing the products of horses and reporters.) 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, the guest speaker, ticked off many of the 
club's highlights, including the night the cops seized the organization's slot 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
KTLA-TV newsman Stan Chambers, the emcee, recalled the anything-could-happen 
days of live TV, as exemplified by the time bandleader Spade Cooley delivered a 
lead-in for what was supposed to be a baby food commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"Mothers, if you're having trouble with your kids, listen to this message," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast then cut away to the studio, where an announcer added: 
</P>
<P>
"Feed 'em Snairol! It'll kill the little pests."

CSUN FACULTY DEBATES PLAN TO OUST ROTC PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE ARMED FORCES' BAN ON HOMOSEXUALS IS CITED AS THE REASON. BUT A 
TECHNICALITY DELAYS A VOTE UNTIL MARCH.

A proposal to kick military training programs off the Cal State Northridge 
campus appeared to have widespread support among faculty members Thursday, but 
when the issue was to be voted on the Faculty Senate did not have a quorum. 
</P>
<P>
If the Reserve Officer Training Corps is ousted from CSUN at the senate's March 
meeting, it would be the first time the program has been barred from an 
American college campus since the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, students urged an end to ROTC programs as 
part of a groundswell of anti-military sentiment. But this time the issue is 
discrimination, specifically the U.S. Department of Defense's continued refusal 
to allow homosexuals to join the military. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking about that discrimination, faculty Secretary/Treasurer John 
Clendenning said: "We cannot have it. . . . If it exists anywhere in our 
university, we must ferret it out and stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two students participate in Air Force, Navy or Army ROTC programs at 
CSUN, according to spokesmen for the three branches. Eleven students have ROTC 
scholarships that cover tuition and books. 
</P>
<P>
Although homosexuals may take ROTC classes, they may not serve in the armed 
forces after graduation, which Air Force Capt. Robert Feliz said is required 
for those who receive ROTC scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three service branches, only the Air Force sent a representative -- 
Feliz -- to speak against the proposed policy Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"By throwing ROTC off the campus, the policy is not going to change," said 
Feliz, an ROTC instructor. "What will change is the community's access to the 
program." 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force is the only branch that actually teaches ROTC classes -- such as 
American Defense Policy and Development of Air Power -- on the CSUN campus. The 
Army and Navy ROTC participants must travel to the UCLA campus in Westwood for 
similar courses. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's Lesbian and Gay Alliance objected to the expansion of ROTC last year, 
prompting a review of the entire program by a subcommittee of the faculty's 
Educational Policies Committee. Before studying the expansion request, the 
subcommittee determined that the program violates campus anti-discrimination 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"All the other issues concerning ROTC were considered moot at that point," said 
Prof. Lawrence Littwin, subcommittee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The policy considered by the senate Thursday would allow current students to 
complete their studies. But the military program would not be mentioned in the 
next printing of the college catalogue, and no new students would be allowed to 
enroll. 
</P>
<P>
Navy and Army ROTC representatives at UCLA, contacted by telephone, declined to 
comment on Thursday's faculty discussion, which ended when a roll call counted 
54 members, one short of a quorum. 
</P>
<P>
"Our students are important to us, of course," said Maj. Jay Farrar of the Navy 
ROTC. "But until it's an issue that has to be addressed, we're not involved." 
</P>
<P>
The ROTC runs 37 programs on 15 California State University campuses, said Anne 
Ambrose, a spokeswoman for the university system. Ambrose said she knew of no 
similar anti-ROTC movements at the other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of a general move toward offering military training at high 
schools and colleges, several campuses nationwide have become increasingly 
concerned about the military's policy on homosexuals. A special faculty 
congress at the University of Wisconsin voted in December to bar ROTC, but that 
vote was overturned earlier this month by university regents.

CHP TO BOOST SCREENING OF BUS DRIVERS; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: BACKGROUND CHECKS WILL HAVE TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE LICENSES ARE ISSUED.

<P>
The California Highway Patrol, prompted by mounting concern over the safety of 
children who ride to school on buses, announced Thursday that the agency will 
tighten the application process for school bus drivers to obtain licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rengstorff, chief of enforcement for the CHP, told the Assembly 
Transportation Committee that beginning June 1, 180-day temporary licenses will 
no longer be issued to drivers employed by school districts and private school 
bus companies. 
</P>
<P>
Under the CHP plan, developed during the past few weeks, applicants for permits 
to drive school buses will be licensed only after fingerprint and background 
checks are completed. Currently, drivers who pass state tests are given 
temporary six-month permits to allow them to drive while the checks are being 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Rengstorff said authorities are targeting school bus drivers because "there 
just seems to have been numerous instances where contractor-employed applicants 
have been involved in serious bus incidents." 
</P>
<P>
In recent incidents two bus drivers employed by Laidlaw Transit, the nation's 
largest private school bus contractor, have been arrested on suspicion of 
driving school buses while drunk. A third Laidlaw driver was arrested for 
carrying a loaded gun in his bus. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's chairman, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), said he called 
the hearing to examine the procedures used by Laidlaw, other bus companies, 
school districts and state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something seriously out of whack" in the system, Katz said. He cited 
the recently discovered criminal backgrounds of some school bus drivers, 
allegedly faulty procedures of state authorities in licensing drivers and the 
poor accident record of private school bus operators. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw officials defended their practices, saying the company has instituted a 
comprehensive driver safety program. 
</P>
<P>
But Katz said that based on CHP figures the accident rate for all private 
school bus contractors is significantly higher than the rate for drivers 
employed directly by school districts. The Los Angeles school district employs 
1,300 drivers, and the remaining 1,500 who transport the district's students 
work for private firms, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A specific breakdown of the accident rate for Los Angeles schools was not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
According to 1987-88 school year figures for the entire state released by 
Katz's office, drivers employed directly by school districts were involved in 
nearly seven accidents per million miles compared to almost 11 accidents per 
million miles for private bus companies. A spokesman for Katz said those 
figures -- the most recent available -- were for buses that carry 20 passengers 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
Spike Helmick, deputy CHP commissioner, confirmed the disparity, suggesting 
that one reason is that drivers for school districts tend to keep their jobs 
longer than do drivers for private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints about school bus drivers have risen in recent months, following the 
arrests of two Laidlaw Transit employees accused of driving buses while drunk 
-- one in the San Fernando Valley and the other in San Diego. Laidlaw is paid 
about $20 million a year by the Los Angeles Unified School District and is its 
largest bus contractor, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In January, a Laidlaw driver, Harold Keith Lone, was arrested in Encino as he 
prepared to pick up students at Lanai Elementary School. A breath test showed 
Lone had a blood-alcohol level of 0.27%, more than three times the legal limit 
of 0.08%. Authorities have said that Lone obtained his job by using an alias to 
hide a lengthy criminal record, including five drunk driving convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a school bus driver transporting Clairemont High School 
students in San Diego was charged with drunk driving after his bus rear-ended a 
pickup truck, injuring three people, according to the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Katz said he was also concerned about another San Diego case in which 
Laidlaw driver Victor H. Gomez in 1987 allegedly kidnaped a 5-year-old girl 
from a school bus and molested her. A civil lawsuit filed by the child against 
Laidlaw is pending. San Diego police said Gomez remains a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's hearing, Katz expressed shock that Gomez still has a valid 
license to drive a school bus. Bill Gengler, a spokesman for the Department of 
Motor Vehicles, confirmed that his agency "had not suspended or revoked" 
Gomez's license because "we had no information from law enforcement or other 
sources that would allow us to act." 
</P>
<P>
Katz complained about the DMV's "business-as-usual approach" in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Laidlaw and other private bus contractors "are not 
acknowledging their responsibility to develop a better procedure of screening 
the drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Daley, vice president of operations for Laidlaw Transit's Van Nuys-based 
operation, acknowledged that when he joined the office "substantial 
improvements were needed." 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw has improved its checking of applicant references and training since 
Katz's committee had a similar hearing in 1988, Daley said. "We feel our 
procedures have been corrected in a responsive manner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Daley described the latest arrests of drivers as "isolated" but said they 
pointed up the need to improve staff training to detect drug and alcohol abuse 
among drivers. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to discourage problems, Laidlaw officials asked the committee to 
adopt criminal sanctions against drivers who lie about their background on 
employment applications, including a mandatory six-month jail term and a 
$10,000 fine for violations.

LOCKHEED TO PAY FINE FOR AIR POLLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
EMISSIONS: THE $1-MILLION PENALTY IS THE LARGEST IN THE AQMD'S HISTORY. IT 
SETTLES 6,750 ALLEGED VIOLATIONS. 
</P>

Lockheed Corp. agreed Thursday to pay a record $1-million fine to settle 
allegations by air quality officials that Lockheed's paint-spraying activities 
at its Los Angeles area plants violated anti-smog rules. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District said it was the biggest penalty 
in the 10-year history of the El Monte-based agency. The fine came seven months 
after Lockheed paid a record $1.5-million penalty to the U.S. Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration to settle 440 alleged violations of workplace 
safety rules at its local plants. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD cited Lockheed, a Calabasas-based aerospace and defense systems 
concern, for about 6,750 alleged violations after a seven-month inspection of 
its facilities last year, said Peter C. Mieras, an AQMD deputy prosecutor. 
About 6,000 of the violations concerned Lockheed's inadequate record-keeping 
procedures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Record keeping is important, Mieras said, because Lockheed operates under rules 
that allow the company to use some coatings and solvents the hydrocarbon 
emissions of which exceed normal AQMD limits. Lacking correct records, the 
agency can't monitor whether Lockheed is operating legally, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 750 alleged violations occurred when paint spraying by Lockheed 
workers emitted more hydrocarbons than Lockheed's records showed, Mieras said. 
</P>
<P>
When released into the air, the hydrocarbons in paints and solvents mix with 
nitrogen and sunlight to cause ozone -- the major component of smog. In recent 
years, the AQMD has clamped down on the Los Angeles furniture industry because 
its heavy use of coatings and solvents is a major contributor to smog. 
</P>
<P>
"Fumes from paints are not an insignificant source of pollution for us," said 
AQMD spokesman Tom Eichhorn. He said fumes from evaporating paints and solvents 
emit 11 times as much reactive hydrocarbons as all the oil refineries in the 
basin. 
</P>
<P>
Besides paying the penalty, Lockheed agreed to adopt better record-keeping 
procedures and to acquire state-of-the-art painting equipment that would meet 
AQMD standards on paint-related emissions. 
</P>
<P>
"Lockheed has assured the district that it wants to protect the environment and 
is committed to complying with district rules," Dale Daniels, Lockheed 
executive vice president, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed said the AQMD and OSHA citations were not related. But the findings of 
both agencies focused on plants in Burbank, Palmdale and Rye Canyon near 
Valencia that are operated by Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., the company's 
aerospace unit. Some of Lockheed's work at those facilities involves classified 
projects for the Pentagon, including production of a top-secret stealth fighter 
jet that is supposed to evade enemy radar. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD typically inspects industrial companies once a year for possible 
violations of anti-smog rules. But the AQMD was unable to enter Lockheed's 
classified areas until a year ago because its inspectors had not yet received 
security clearances, Mieras said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lockheed penalty eclipsed the previous record AQMD fine of $335,000 levied 
last October against Gary Lazar, the owner of 160 gasoline stations where 
gasoline pump nozzles failed to keep gasoline fumes from escaping into the air.

EX-AGENT GIVEN PROBATION FOR WRITING BAD CHECKS;

CRIME: A REPORT SAYS LLOYD BLOOM IS "NOT CRIMINALLY ORIENTED OR ANTISOCIAL" AND 
SEEMS CONTRITE.

Former sports agent Lloyd Mitchell Bloom, who was convicted last year of 
illegally signing college athletes to professional sports contracts, was 
sentenced Thursday to three years probation for writing $14,300 in bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom, 30, of Malibu, who originally faced nine counts of issuing checks for 
insufficient funds, entered a no-contest plea to one count before Van Nuys 
Superior Court Judge Raymond Mireles. 
</P>
<P>
Mireles also sentenced Bloom to one year in jail but stayed the sentence on 
condition that Bloom make full restitution to his victims, including his former 
accountant, a moving company and two other companies. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin D'Agostino had requested a sentence of 
three years in prison, but Bloom's lawyer, Ronald S. Miller, asked for 
leniency. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom was labeled in a probation report as a "wheeler-dealer, a salesman and 
would-be entrepreneur . . . lacking a vital ingredient . . . sound judgment and 
business know-how." But overall, he is "not criminally oriented or antisocial" 
and appears contrite, the probation report said. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of court, Bloom said he is now an actor's manager whose clients include 
Ken Wahl, star of the "Wiseguys" television series. He said he is producing a 
movie in which Wahl is starring. 
</P>
<P>
The probation report quotes Bloom as saying he hired an accounting firm after 
suffering financial troubles as he struggled to pay legal fees for the federal 
trial, which also prevented him from working. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom at first failed to pay the accounting firm, then paid with checks that 
bounced, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom was convicted in June, 1989, along with Norby Walters, 58, of 
racketeering and mail fraud for secretly signing college athletes to 
professional sports contracts before the athletes' college eligibility expired, 
and for using an organized-crime boss to intimidate athletes and entertainment 
figures who sought to end their business relationship with him. 
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to three years in prison but is free while the case is under 
appeal.

TORRANCE SHOOTING BRINGS LIFE SENTENCE

<P>
A jealous husband has been sentenced to life in prison for shooting and nearly 
killing a Torrance business executive whom he suspected of having an affair 
with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Superior Court Judge John Shook meted out the sentence and a $10,000 
fine Wednesday to Henry Ngo Wu for the shooting last April of Jonathan Baron, a 
37-year-old vice president of a tax processing firm. 
</P>
<P>
Wu, 33, will be eligible for parole in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Baron has been confined to a wheelchair since he was shot in a parking 
structure next to the offices of CCH Computax Inc. at the corner of Torrance 
and Hawthorne boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Wu stalked Baron because he believed that Baron was having an affair with his 
wife, Wai Wu, who was also a Computax employee, according to testimony at Wu's 
trial last month. 
</P>
<P>
Wai Wu and Baron have both denied that they had an affair.

One cannot escape the feeling that President Bush headed in the wrong direction 
in the effort to address the drug problem by traveling to Colombia. Rather that 
going there to tell foreign presidents what to do to their countries to solve

where both the problem and its solution ultimately are to be found.

<P>
Sure, cocaine production in the Andean nations is part of the problem. The very 
fact that Bush and the presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru had to huddle 
in a colonial fort at the heavily guarded Colombian naval academy in Cartagena 
vividly suggested the extent to which those three nations have serious problems 
with the drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
But despite all their concerns, many Latin Americans resent the heavy hand of 
the gringo superpower to the north; they resent the hypocrisy of being asked to 
divest themselves of one of their few cash-rich crops; they fail to understand 
the dispatching of troops and ships to waters off the Colombian coast when the 
real drug battlefront is the cities of America, where drug traffickers control 
too much territory, terrorize too many frightened Americans and hook too many 
future mothers and present children on cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it might have been more effective for the President to hold the drug 
summit in Watts, or in Bedford-Stuyvesant in New York City, or even in 
Washington, D.C., not that far from the White House, where the city's mayor was 
indicted on Wednesday for drug use. For the point cannot be driven home too 
strongly that international trafficking will not more than marginally wind down 
unless the lucrative market in illicit drugs is dried up by some genius 
combination of enforcement, education and rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to deplore the Cartagena summit. Hardly. The very agenda items -- 
crop substitution, increased U.S. aid, the unfortunate U.S. export of 
drug-processing chemicals, the use of the U.S. military in the drug war and 
other initiatives -- were well worth discussing. But while Colombia is 
certainly close to the problem, it is also far away from it: The most important 
front is here. We won't taste the fruits of victory in fighting drugs until we 
blame foreigners less for the problem and do more to clean up our own act at 
home.

THE KOREANIZATION OF SOUTH KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter set off something of a panic in the 
Republic of Korea when he proposed -- though he never carried out -- a 
unilateral cut in U.S. military forces there. By contrast, Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney's new agreement with Seoul to withdraw up to 5,000 Americans over 
the next few years seems unlikely to raise even a ripple of concern. Times have 
changed, and one big sign of that is South Korea's growing self-confidence, 
based on its increasing economic, political and military strength. It helps, 
too, that its enemy on the divided peninsula, the Communist north, now finds 
itself more internationally isolated than at any time in its history. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of renewed military aggression from the north will remain especially 
credible so long as Kim Il Sung lives and remains in charge. Kim is the 
Soviet-installed dictator who has held near-absolute power for more than 40 
years. He's almost 78 now, but there's no reason to think he has abandoned the 
goal of a reunified Korea that led him to invade the south in 1950. In an 
effort to establish the Communist world's first dynasty and to ensure that his 
aims would be pursued, Kim has named his son as successor. Others in North 
Korea -- in the military and higher echelons of the Communist Party -- no doubt 
have ideas of their own about how the succession should be handled. The point 
is that North Korea remains militarily powerful and intensely committed 
ideologically. Given what has gone before, its potential for aggression must 
continue to be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
What's different now is that North Korea, should it risk war, can no longer 
expect to get the human and material help from the Soviet Union and China that 
it could count on in 1950. At a minimum, the foreknowledge that it would be on 
its own must limit any aggressive planning; probably it forces the rational 
assessment that war-making is simply out of the question. The trouble is that 
Kim, who has fostered an almost Pharaonic cult of personality, and who seems to 
believe in his own infallibility, can't be counted on to behave rationally. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why even after cutbacks take place, the United States will keep about 
38,000 troops in South Korea, where they are likely to stay so long as the 
South Koreans want them and Washington calculates the threat from the north to 
be serious. The troop reductions agreed to in Seoul do nothing to diminish 
American dedication to South Korea's defense. They are instead recognition of 
the changed nature of the threat that has occurred, and of the enormous recent 
progress South Korea has made.

COLD WARRIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Schneider's commentary on President Bush's State of the Union address 
(Opinion, Feb. 4) becomes the convoluted, conservative ideology of the American 
Enterprise Institute, of which he has been associated for many years. 
</P>
<P>
On the front page of the Opinion section we were gleefully treated to both 
Henry Kissinger's ramblings about Europe's future, and Schneider's own 
assessment that "Bush can say he is his own man" for promising to plant a 
billion trees a year to beautify the country. 
</P>
<P>
Does it matter at all to The Times in-house political pundit that Bush has no 
comprehensive environmental programs for cleaning America's streams and rivers, 
and the air we breathe; that Bush does not take seriously regulating business, 
implementing conservation programs, reducing acid rain and global warming. 
</P>
<P>
But Schneider was at his ideological best when he stated that, "The United 
States is no longer pre-eminent in power, wealth or leadership. Our values are 
winning the Cold War, but we have lost our ability to control or even influence 
major events in the world." The Cold Warriors can never give credit to Mikhail 
Gorbachev's perestroika and political reforms for a thawing of East-West 
tensions. To them, it will always be the capitalist model that brought down 
communist repression. 
</P>
<P>
But, to say that the U.S. no longer influences and controls events in the 
world, with the recent events in Panama, is simply to pardon the excesses of 
the American empire with events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Bloc.

DID THEY DO THE RIGHT THING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All right, all right, so maybe it's not as important as perestroika or global 
warming, but we live here and we take the Academy Awards seriously. Well, sort 
of seriously. Seriously enough to be a little worked up about what our 
President might call this Spike Lee thing. 
</P>
<P>
Now, when director-writer Lee's brilliant exploration of American race 
relations, "Do the Right Thing," was passed over by the jury at Cannes in favor 
of the equally brilliant exploration of yuppie sexuality, "sex, lies and 
videotape," we weren't surprised. After all, if you ask a Frenchman to choose 
between a story of techno-seduction and one about a race riot at a pizza 
parlor, you don't have to be Roland Barthes to know which way he's going to 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the cultural imperatives operating in the deliberations of 
our own Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are a trifle murkier. 
Surely, the academy cannot have been influenced by the fact that Lee's deal 
with Universal Studios virtually forced him to make his film as a nonunion 
production. Nor could any of the academy members have been turned off by his 
sometimes rather abrasive personality. Heck, if tact were the price of 
admission to Hollywood, Morton's would be empty every night. Similarly, no one 
could have been offended by the assertive social attitudes expressed in Lee's 
movie. If that were the standard, nobody would ever sit through another Wagner 
opera or read a poem by Ezra Pound. 
</P>
<P>
No, it's got to be something else. Race? Well, Danny Aiello was nominated as 
best supporting actor for his role in "Do the Right Thing." Of course, he was 
the white guy. Then there's the fact that "Glory," one of the finest films ever 
made about the American Civil War, also was snubbed by the academy. 
</P>
<P>
As Cardinal Newman said of his conversion: Cumulative probability leading to 
subjective certainty.

LIMITING TERMS OF ELECTED OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now, Henry, you know very well that incumbents cannot lose once they have 
entrenched themselves long enough to amass a war chest and build a political 
barter system. 
</P>
<P>
You also know that many non-voters are not satisfied with the representation 
they have; they are just convinced that the incumbent cannot be defeated 
because he has the support of the moneyed special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans have faith in democracy. It's today's politicians they mistrust. 
So the movements to limit tenure.

LIMITING TERMS OF ELECTED OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article states that Hyde has been in the House of Representatives for the 
past 26 years, and bemoans the increasing interest in limiting terms of office. 
</P>
<P>
I have shocking news for Hyde: Professional politicians are not what democracy 
is all about. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde states, "People who advocate this proposal accept the logical fallacy that 
'new is better' and must believe that elective office is the one vocation where 
experience is an obstacle to good performance." 
</P>
<P>
Wrong! What should be said is that long terms in office are obstacles to the 
distribution of power. 
</P>
<P>
Good performances have always been found in the countless dictatorships that 
have plagued the world during the last few thousand years. Of far more 
importance in a democracy is the distribution of power, which tends to reduce 
corruption, and tends to create efforts aimed at the betterment of all people 
rather than just helping special interests. 
</P>
<P>
He states: "A mandatory revolving door for elected officials would only 
strengthen the grip of the permanent bureaucracy." This statement defies both 
fact and logic. We do not need "representatives for life" any more than we need 
"presidents for life." Sunset laws for public offices will do a great deal 
towards reducing the corruption so prevalent today, and we should adopt them.

TRUMP TALK BETRAYS THE WAY WE ARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN GOODMAN, Ellen Goodman writes a syndicated column in Boston. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talking about celebrities is a way of talking about ourselves, or at least our 
values. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Trumps. In the '80s, Donald Trump represented a boyish, open-faced, 
unabashed, go-for-it love of the Great More, the Eternal Bigger. As a 
celebrity, he was living proof to Americans that an unexamined life was 
probably a prerequisite for making money. 
</P>
<P>
To say that the Trumps had it all was something of an understatement, and 
understatement was not the Trump style. He was the one who renumbered the 
floors on his Tower to make it 10 stories higher. Don and Ivana had more than 
$1.7 billion, three children, 345 rooms in all their houses to call their own. 
They weren't shy about it. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, Americans have used the Donald Trumps to air their ambivalence 
about wealth in a country in which everybody calls themselves middle class. To 
some, Donald was, as Ivana said before the split, "the people's billionaire." 
To others, he was, as Spy magazine wrote, "the short-fingered vulgarian." 
</P>
<P>
As for the missus, some saw Ivana as a poor girl from Czechoslovakia who found 
love, marriage and money in America. Others saw her as the rich lady who 
considered herself thrifty because she bought $3,000 designer dresses 
wholesale. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, in a 50-room apartment high above Fifth Avenue, the Trumps seemed 
wholly removed from the more pedestrian problems of life. They got to glitter 
and the rest of us got to debate the cost and value of the glitter. 
</P>
<P>
Now they get to suffer, thereby fulfilling the great American hope that money 
can't buy happiness. Under the guise of gossip, we can watch the celebrated 
split as we watched their celebrated lives -- at a safe distance. 
</P>
<P>
Add a lot of zeros to the checkbook and this sounds like any marital 
partnership unraveling, any couple you know revising the story of their 
marriage with hourly bulletins. Take away the public-relations men and the 
lawyers and it sounds like our friends pushing us to choose between the Bride's 
Side or the Groom's Side. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the question this time is whether it's dreadful to be married to a 
woman who has her carpet vacuumed before she steps into the room. Or to be 
hooked up to a man whose social outlook is, "Even if the world goes to hell in 
a handbasket, I won't lose a penny." Donald Trump once described his work style 
this way: "Boom -- like a cobra." In this celeb match, we are asked to choose 
between the mongoose or the cobra. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, in some way, the media care and maintenance of the Supercelebs, 
the fascination with their Triumphs and Trials, is the way Americans talk out 
the mores and morals of society. If future historians want to know what we were 
like, they'll go to the People files, not to Foreign Policy. Leave them a note 
to look under "Trump, Donald and Ivana."

SOUTH AFRICA THE AGENDA; 
</P>
<P>
COMPROMISES BLACKS MUST MAKE; 
</P>
<P>
IF NEGOTIATIONS FAIL, CONFLICT WILL BE UNCONTROLLABLE. THE COUNTRY WILL BE 
ISOLATED, IMPOVERISHED -- A TYPICAL AFRICAN STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLEM de KLERK, Willem de Klerk is a professor of communications at Rand 
Afrikaans University. He is also the elder brother of South African President 
Frederik W. de Klerk. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since President Frederik W. de Klerk's speech Feb. 2 at the opening of 
Parliament, South Africa's political development has definitely shifted toward 
a new process. 
</P>
<P>
This new process means a number of things: recognition by the government of the 
African National Congress as a prominent representative of the black people; an 
irrevocable commitment by the government to negotiations for a new 
constitution; the removal of obstacles to negotiations, which will soon receive 
attention (the total lifting of the state of emergency and release of political 
detainees still imprisoned); general voting rights in a unitary state, and the 
disappearance of all discriminatory laws. 
</P>
<P>
There is a positive expectation that the ANC will be prepared to enter into 
negotiations. They are obviously very careful, attempting to avoid being 
perceived as moderate, which could estrange them from their power base. I 
expect considerable negative rhetoric by the ANC about negotiations. 
Everything, however, will move toward a negotiation table, which will hopefully 
become official in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The agenda for the negotiation process will basically involve five matters: 
</P>
<P>
Group rights. The race-group classification of the National Party must be 
abolished and replaced by a one-man one-vote system. On the other hand, the ANC 
must cease its rejection of group rights. In addition to the Charter of Human 
Rights, group rights must be secured in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
Democracy. The view expressed by black people (one-party systems, absolute 
state authority, drastic restrictions) is unacceptable. They will have to 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
State form. The ANC wants a unitary state, whites a decentralized federation or 
Swiss canton system. A compromise is essential. 
</P>
<P>
Economic system. The two poles are the capitalist free-market system as opposed 
to the Marxist-socialist system. Despite the failures of socialism in Eastern 
Europe and Southern Africa, the majority of black people believe in socialism. 
We know that this will mean the economic and political downfall of South 
Africa. We must try to negotiate a compromise on a kind of mixed economy. A 
free-market form, however, must dominate. To accomplish this, serious 
negotiation is essential. 
</P>
<P>
Transition time. Whites are focused more on process politics and gradual 
change. Within this framework, the phasing in of the post-apartheid era and the 
phasing out of the apartheid era will take about 10 years. Black politicians 
are far more impatient. They want to complete the post-apartheid phase by 1992. 
It is obvious that a compromise must also be reached here. 
</P>
<P>
Will we ever reach this compromise? We have no other option. It will, however, 
take time. 
</P>
<P>
The possibilities of compromise are promoted by the following factors: The 
decline of communism and socialism in Eastern Europe; pressure from the East, 
the West and Africa on the ANC and the South African government to compromise; 
peace initiatives in Southern Africa (Angola, Mozambique and Namibia), and the 
economic realities of South Africa, which force all groups to search for 
political solutions. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that blacks and whites are too deeply embroiled in ideologies is not 
conducive to compromises. Our politics have not yet become sufficiently sober 
and pragmatic. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party, which represents 30% of the white votes, is fanning 
white emotions. This could give rise to outbursts of white terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
I expect that 1990 will be a very tense year in South Africa, for whites as 
well as non-whites: a period of demonstrations, violence, aggressive rhetoric, 
polarization and confrontation. This, however, will be the prelude to 
negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
If negotiations succeed, a new South Africa may well be a state with one 
Parliament and government representing all the people; a state with a 
constitution that provides checks and balances for minority groups that are not 
racial minorities, but political minorities formed into political parties by 
free association; a state with a free-market economy with adequate measures for 
the elevation and incorporation of the black masses; a state that is a 
non-racial democracy, based on the values of Western democracy. 
</P>
<P>
If negotiations fail, the conflict will become uncontrollable. The country will 
become isolated and impoverished and experience the suffering of a typical 
African state. 
</P>
<P>
The mobilization of all international and national influences to ensure 
successful negotiation is therefore a matter of life and death.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN FOUND STABBED IN POLICE PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 44-year-old man was critically injured Thursday morning when he apparently 
stabbed himself shortly after leaving a Los Angeles police station in 
Northridge where he had spent the night in the lobby, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tarzana man was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills after 
he was found at 6:50 a.m. in the parking lot behind the Devonshire Division 
station at Etiwanda Avenue and Devonshire Street, Detective Michael Brandt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said the man was found on the ground next to his car by a police officer 
who had driven into the parking lot. The injured man had a knife or some other 
sharp instrument pushed through his throat, Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said the incident was being investigated as a suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The man walked into the lobby of the police station at 1 a.m. and asked the 
front desk officer if he could stay there until morning, when he had an 
appointment at a nearby psychiatrist's office. The desk officer allowed him to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer gave him a newspaper and he sat in the lobby and read it," Brandt 
said. "He seemed to be OK. There was no indication at the time that anything 
was wrong, that he was upset or suicidal." 
</P>
<P>
The man left the station at 6:30 a.m. and was found 20 minutes later.

AFTER 32 ATTEMPTS AGAINST BRUINS, CAL FINALLY LOVES L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
BRUINS: BEARS END 30 YEARS OF FRUSTRATION IN LOS ANGELES AS THEY GET FIRST 
VICTORY IN PAULEY PAVILION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The California Golden Bears showed early on Thursday night at Pauley Pavilion 
that they would not be daunted by the failures of their predecessors, who 
hadn't beaten UCLA in Los Angeles in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd got on us from the get-go," said Cal's Roy Fisher. "But in the 
second half, it was like, 'Who's up now?' " 
</P>
<P>
It was the surging Golden Bears, who limited the Bruins to 41.2% shooting and 
won, 79-71, in front of 10,788. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Cal's first in Pauley after 25 consecutive losses -- "Never 
won, never will," the Bruin students had chanted -- and their first over the 
Bruins in Los Angeles since Feb. 20, 1960, ending a streak of 32 losses. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, all the stunned Bruin student section could offer in response was a 
half-hearted jab from a forlorn fan: "About time." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Smith scored 22 points and Fisher scored 21 for the Bears, who won for 
only the third time in their last 63 games against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"That's as sweet a victory as I've had since I've been at Cal," said the Bears' 
fifth-year coach, Lou Campanelli. 
</P>
<P>
Said UCLA's Mitchell Butler, after the Bruins lost for the first time in 12 
games at Pauley this season: "It's pretty embarrassing. I think we were 
laid-back and complacent. That can happen after winning at home all the time." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, which lost for the third time in five games, never led after Bill Elleby 
made a three-point shot from the left wing to give Cal a 49-46 lead with 13:05 
left. The Bears, who made 50.9% of their shots, twice increased their lead to 
11 points before UCLA rallied in the last few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Bruins to 16-6 overall and 9-4 in the Pac-10, costing them 
a chance to gain ground on first-place Oregon State, which lost at Washington, 
66-57, and fell to 11-2 in the conference.

Cal (18-6, 9-4) moved into a third-place tie with UCLA. The Bears are hoping to 
land a berth in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1960, when they 
lost to Ohio State in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they weren't intimidated," said UCLA's Don MacLean, who made only 
five of 14 shots and was limited to 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in a 106-97 victory over the Bears at Berkeley, MacLean contributed 
27 points and 12 rebounds and said afterward of Campanelli, his coach last 
summer at the Olympic Sports Festival: "I don't think I'm going to let him beat 
me for the next three years. I'm going to make sure of that." 
</P>
<P>
But MacLean, who didn't like the way Campanelli used him at the Sports 
Festival, wasn't the only Bruin who struggled. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Tracy Murray made only five of 17 shots after making four of 18 last 
Saturday at Arizona, and Darrick Martin made only four of 11. 
</P>
<P>
Murray and Trevor Wilson led the Bruins with 13 points each. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman center Brian Hendrick scored 13 points and took eight rebounds for 
Cal, and Elleby scored 11 points in 26 minutes off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the first half, the Bears put together an 8-0 run, including a 
pair of layups by Smith, to take a 28-21 lead. 
</P>
<P>
They led at halftime, 34-29. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA made only 33.3% of its shots in the half after making just 39.2% last 
Saturday at Tucson in an 83-74 loss to Arizona. The front line of MacLean, 
Murray and Wilson was a combined five of 18 from the field in the first 20 
minutes and was limited to 14 points, including seven by Murray. Murray also 
took eight rebounds in the first half, but only one in the second. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we came in here thinking about the streak," Fisher said. "But 
the crowd let us know when they started their chant. Hey, I've only lost to 
these guys twice. I didn't care about the streak." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Since spraining his right wrist in a fall against USC Feb. 1 at the Sports 
Arena, UCLA's Trevor Wilson has made only 10 of 33 free throws. Said 
commentator Al McGuire during NBC's telecast of last week's UCLA-Arizona game: 
"Even with a sprained wrist, you should shoot better than that." But UCLA Coach 
Jim Harrick said this week that he considered giving Wilson this week off to 
recuperate. "To me, he's not even remotely the same player (since the injury)," 
Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Don MacLean is on pace to surpass Sean Elliott of Arizona as the Pac-10's 
all-time leading scorer. With at least six more games to play this season, the 
6-10 sophomore has scored 1,015 points in 53 games at UCLA. Elliott scored 
1,077 points in his first two seasons at Arizona.

LAKERS LEAVE DOOR AJAR; KINGS CAN'T GET THROUGH 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There might be a temptation to devalue the Lakers' victory Thursday night 
because it came against the Sacramento Kings and because the Lakers did not 
play that well. 
</P>
<P>
But considering that they played a road game one night after a draining 
double-overtime loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, the Lakers' 101-92 victory 
was at least competent, if not overly impressive. 
</P>
<P>
They won despite making only 13 field goals in the second half. They went 11 
minutes 34 seconds in the second half without a field goal but did not lose the 
lead. They also saw a 14-point lead with 2:29 left dwindle to six points and 
had to sink a succession of free throws to stave off the last-place Kings. 
</P>
<P>
And, given the Lakers' recent penchant for losing leads, Coach Pat Riley called 
a timeout with 20 seconds to play and his team leading by 10 points . . . just 
to make sure. 
</P>
<P>
Those negatives aside, the Lakers (36-12) did manage to get another road 
victory, always an achievement in the NBA. They maintain the league's best 
record and improved their road record to 14-9. 
</P>
<P>
That was enough to satisfy the Lakers, experienced enough to know that any 
victory is a good victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I have yet to see an ugly baby or an ugly victory," Laker center Mychal 
Thompson said. "We'll take them any way we can." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, often the Lakers' most severe critic, seemed more relieved than pleased 
by the victory. He is as concerned as anyone about the Lakers' recent habit of 
squandering leads. Both Riley and his players say it stems more from defensive 
deficiencies than offensive stagnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Again Thursday night, the Lakers were outrebounded. This time, Sacramento held 
a 47-41 edge. The Kings had 16 offensive rebounds, and the Lakers say having to 
work harder on defense against second shots is affecting their offense. "We 
need to eliminate those second shots," said James Worthy, who led the Lakers 
with 20 points despite playing with an injured right shoulder. "We can't let 
teams do that all the time. Once we eliminate it, it'll help our half-court 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"It always comes back to our own defense when our offense struggles. When we 
have to work harder against the second shots, you don't get out and run as much 
on the fast break, and that hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said the Lakers were sluggish partly because of fatigue from the 
double-overtime loss to Portland and partly because the six-day break for the 
All-Star game put them out of sync. 
</P>
<P>
"We bounced back," Riley said. "We did a lot of good things tonight. We didn't 
give up an inordinate amount of second shots. But we've got a ways to go before 
we're all the way back. We aren't real focused right now. We have these lapses. 
</P>
<P>
"The win is important, but if we don't get sharper Sunday against the Celtics, 
a big physical, rebounding team, we'll struggle again. Tonight, we had two or 
three spells where we lost the feel for the game, where we don't execute." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe because these were the Kings (13-35), the Lakers could afford lapses and 
still persevere. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' first nap came midway through the first half, when they went eight 
possessions and nearly five minutes without making a field goal. Yet, they 
never lost the lead and enjoyed an eight-point advantage at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
After coming out strongly at the start of the third quarter, the Lakers slipped 
into a stagnant state just as quickly. Byron Scott's jump shot with 7:36 to 
play in the quarter gave the Lakers a 63-49 lead, but they did not score 
another field goal for the rest of the quarter and the first 3:58 of the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' nine points in that span came on free throws. Vlade Divac finally 
broke the spell with a fast-break dunk with 8:02 left to return the Laker lead 
to eight points. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento could not take advantage of the Laker offensive droughts because 
they sank only 42% of their shots, partially because of the Lakers' improved 
half-court defense. 
</P>
<P>
Wayman Tisdale led the Kings with 23 points and nine rebounds, and Antoine Carr 
added 17 points in his King debut after arriving from Atlanta in the Kenny 
Smith trade. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that the Lakers had finally put away the Kings for good when Magic 
Johnson sank a three-point shot for an 89-75 lead with 2:29 to play. But 1:17 
later, the Kings had scored eight consecutive points and pulled to within six. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Lakers pulled away because they simply have more talent than 
the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, who said he injured the rotator cuff in his right shoulder about a week 
ago, made 10 of 14 shots. Scott and Johnson each scored 17 points, Divac had 13 
and Orlando Woolridge 11. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Lakers made only 43.6% of their shots and were outrebounded for 
the second consecutive game, they are not willing to toss back a victory 
because it was not overpowering. "In the most important respect," Scott said, 
"our main objective was to come out here and get a (victory). We accomplished 
that. We just got to work on the rest of our game." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, for one, said he predicted a tough game against the Kings after the 
58-minute marathon against the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we'd be in trouble after double overtime," Johnson said. "We just 
wanted to come out and win any way possible." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy said he started feeling pain in his right shoulder about a week 
ago. During most Laker timeouts, he attaches a heating pack to his shoulder to 
keep it from stiffening. "It's just the socket or the rotator cuff -- whatever 
you want to call it," Worthy said. "I hope it doesn't get to be a big deal. Now 
that I know what it is, I can take care of it." . . . Worthy said that the 
Kings did not get the better end of the Antoine Carr-for-Kenny Smith trade. "I 
think they are going to miss Kenny Smith," Worthy said. "He is a quality point 
guard. I think you can already see that."

UNLV IS STILL THE BIG GUN IN BIG WEST 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Anthony, his face covered with tape because of a broken jaw, looked like a 
masked man. Anderson Hunt, who worried the last two days that he might have 
chicken pox, looked the picture of health. 
</P>
<P>
The two guards inspired Nevada Las Vegas to a 109-86 rout of New Mexico State 
Thursday night, staving off the Aggies' bid to take over first place in the Big 
West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, who broke his jaw Monday night in a game against Fresno State, shocked 
Coach Jerry Tarkanian by showing up for practice Wednesday. Anthony intended to 
play wearing a hockey helmet and a football facemask. 
</P>
<P>
He decided before the game, however, not to wear the mask and immediately made 
a three-point shot, exciting the crowd of 18,790 in the Thomas &amp; Mack 
Center, and setting the tone of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels (21-4, 13-1 in the Big West) made 13 three-point shots, nine by 
Hunt, who as it turned out had only sinus congestion. Hunt, who came within one 
of tying Freddie Banks' school record for three-pointers, scored 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony played 32 minutes, scored 10 points and had six assists and two steals. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg was a real inspiration, he played with so much courage," Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time he came out, they were putting oxygen in his nose." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian was worried. Center David Butler's knee was strained, reserve guard 
Stacey Cvijanovich has a shoulder separation and reserve guard Travis Bice has 
chicken pox. 
</P>
<P>
And the seventh-ranked Rebels, who have won the Big West seven consecutive 
years, were not comfortably in first place as they usually are this time of 
year. In addition, they lost to the Aggies, 83-82, on Jan. 8 at Las Cruces, 
N.M. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the game we had to have," Tarkanian said. "I didn't have a good 
feeling before the game, but our team has great pride." 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas dominated the Aggies (20-3, 11-2) in the first half and were never 
threatened. The Rebels lead the Aggies by 1 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels got off to the emotional start they wanted when Anthony, Hunt and 
Butler made contributions right away. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony and Hunt each hit three-point shots and Butler, dominating the boards, 
had two free throws and a tip-in, and the Rebels led, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State tied the game, 10-10, but the Rebels, passing the ball crisply 
over New Mexico State's matchup zone defense, went on an 8-2 run, highlighted 
by two three-pointers from Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt stayed hot, swishing two more of the long shots to give the Rebels a 26-16 
lead with 8:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Aggies couldn't make much headway against Las Vegas' man-to-man 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We played about as good as we can in the first half," Tarkanian said. "We 
moved the ball beautifully and our defense was great." 
</P>
<P>
The three-point shooting was contagious. Barry Young came off the bench to make 
two bombs before Hunt made two more in succession to increase the lead to 
48-31. He made another one at the buzzer, and the Rebels led at the half, 
62-39. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had 21 points and Butler scored 17 for the Rebels.

SANTA BARBARA SHOWS FULLERTON HOW TO KEEP A LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps mindful of what happened in their own arena last month, UC Santa 
Barbara clamped down on its lead against Cal State Fullerton Thursday night and 
didn't let go. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos, leading by seven points with 3:33 to play, hit 12 of 13 free 
throws down the stretch in a 75-70 victory over Fullerton in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
When the teams played in Santa Barbara last month, the Titans had an 11-point 
lead with 2:20 remaining, and then folded, missing six free throws in a row 
down the stretch and in overtime. Santa Barbara outscored them, 21-2, and 
walked away with an eight-point overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara (17-6, 10-4 in Big West Conference) came into Thursday's game 
having won eight of its last 10 games, with the only losses to Nevada Las Vegas 
and New Mexico State, both by two points. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (12-11, 6-8) lost at home for the first time this season, breaking a 
13-game home winning streak that started last season. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Cedric Ceballos' 27-point, 21-rebound performance, Fullerton again gave 
Santa Barbara trouble for a while. The Titans had a 41-38 lead in the second 
half after consecutive fast breaks led by Ceballos, who rebounded and then took 
control of the break himself, finishing one with a three-point play and dishing 
off on the other. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Barbara's Carrick DeHart came back and settled things, hitting three 
three-point baskets in less than three minutes to pull the Gauchos ahead by 
eight points, 51-43, with nine minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
DeHart finished with 20 points, and Eric McArthur, the nation's leading 
rebounder, had 16 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gray's 25-point performance, twice his 12-point average, was the key for 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Mark Hill, who had played the worst game of his career against 
Santa Barbara last month, did worse than that this time, going one for 11 and 
scoring a career-low three points.

KENTUCKY'S FARMER SINKS NO. 9 LSU FROM LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louisiana State's Chris Jackson scored 41 points, but it was the six free 
throws in the waning minutes by Kentucky's Richie Farmer that proved to be the 
telling factor Thursday night as the Wildcats upset the No. 9 Tigers, 100-95, 
in a Southeastern Conference game at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, the fourth in a row for the Wildcats (13-10, 9-5), snapped LSU's 
seven-game winning streak and avenged a Jan. 13 loss to the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers trailed, 87-70, but rallied behind Jackson, whose three-point basket 
capped a 22-7 run that cut the deficit to 94-92 with 1:12 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But Farmer hit both ends of a one-and-one, then made two more free throws 17 
seconds later to give Kentucky a 98-92 edge. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson hit his seventh three-point basket to cut the margin to 98-95 with 41 
seconds left. But Kentucky worked 33 seconds off the clock before Jackson 
fouled Farmer, who made both free throws for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to close my mind and shoot them like I do in practice," Farmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Miller had 29 points and Deron Feldhaus 24 for Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Seven-footer Shaquille O'Neal, who fouled out with 6:52 left, added 14 points 
for LSU. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers made 17 of their 24 turnovers in the first 20 minutes and Kentucky 
used a 32-10 run in the first half to take a 41-18 lead with 6:24 left. Miller 
scored 14 points in the spurt. 
</P>
<P>
LSU battled back to make it 41-32 on Jackson's layup with 2:14 left, but 
Kentucky got seven of the last 11 points for a 48-36 halftime margin. 
</P>
<P>
No. 5 Michigan 77, No. 17 Minnesota 73 -- Rumeal Robinson scored a career-high 
33 points in a Big Ten Conference game at Minneapolis, as the Wolverines ended 
the Gophers' 14-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan (19-4, 9-3), which never trailed, moved into a second-place tie with 
Michigan State in the Big Ten, a half-game behind Purdue. Fifth-place 
Minnesota, which got 25 points from Willie Burton, is 16-6 and 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Georgia Tech 83, Fordham 78 -- Kenny Anderson had 19 points and 13 
assists in his New York homecoming as the Yellow Jackets won their sixth in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who holds the state high school scoring record with 2,621 points, was 
cheered throughout the game at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
The Yellow Jackets (17-4) were led by Brian Oliver's 26 points and have a 
chance to finish 12-0 outside the Atlantic Coast Conference with a victory over 
Notre Dame later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Fordham (14-10) got 23 points from Jean Prioleau. 
</P>
<P>
No. 18 Louisville 97, Virginia Tech 78 -- LaBradford Smith fueled a first-half 
surge that helped the Cardinals continue their domination over the Hokies in a 
Metro Conference game at Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Six players scored in double figures for Louisville (19-5, 9-1), which began a 
stretch in which six of its last seven games are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech's Bimbo Coles had a game-high 20 points for the Hokies (10-15, 
2-7), who lost to Louisville for the 11th consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had six points, one steal and an assist in a first-half surge that 
enabled Louisville to open a 10-point lead. He finished with 11. Jerome Harmon 
led the Cardinals with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 22 Xavier (Ohio) 71, Evansville 52 -- Tyrone Hill scored 16 points, grabbed 
14 rebounds and led a 10-0 run at the start of the second half as the 
Musketeers won at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier (20-2, 9-1 in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference) avenged one of its 
two losses by continuing its home-court dominance over Evansville (14-12, 6-4). 
</P>
<P>
Brian Hill had 18 points for Evansville, which trailed by as many as 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico 60, Brigham Young 51 -- First-half shooting by reserve Willie Banks 
helped the Lobos to beat the Western Athletic Conference-leading Cougars at 
Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
Banks scored 13 of his team-high 15 points in the first half for New Mexico 
(12-11, 4-7). 
</P>
<P>
BYU (19-5, 9-3) got 16 points from Andy Toolson. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State 63, Pacific 50 -- Charles Terrell and Kenne Young scored 17 
points each and Young added a game-high 11 rebounds as the Spartans (3-10, 
6-16) beat the Tigers (6-8, 13-10) in a Big West Conference game at Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific was paced by its lone scorer in double figures, Don Lyttle, who scored 
24.

<P>
MCCARRON SAYS HE THINKS MORE IS EXPECTED OF DESORMEAUX THAN THERE WAS OF HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The comparison between Chris McCarron and Kent Desormeaux is easy to make. 
Before the Maryland-based McCarron came to California in 1978, he had won an 
Eclipse Award as the nation's outstanding apprentice jockey, had led the 
country in victories more than once and held the record for most wins in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux, who began riding at Santa Anita Wednesday, also came from Maryland. 
He has won two Eclipse Awards, as an apprentice in 1987 and as a journeyman 
last year, and has been the national leader in victories three consecutive 
years, including 1989, when his 597 wins broke McCarron's 15-year-old record by 
51. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron, who has added an Eclipse Award and three national money titles since 
coming West, is aware of the Desormeaux parallels. But he also sees a lot of 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure, but it might be that a lot more is being expected of Kent than 
there was of me," McCarron said. "Those big years I had were a few years behind 
me by the time I came to California. I don't think my arrival out here was 
played up as much as Kent's is. I was just another new face on the scene." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron remembers arriving at Santa Anita on March 27, his 23rd birthday. He 
closed out the Santa Anita season and, counting the opening weeks at Hollywood 
Park, says he won about 65 races in his first 70 days on the West Coast. He has 
been a fixture here ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about talent, but statistically I think there are more jockeys 
with credentials out here now than there were when I got here. Back then, there 
was Laffit (Pincay), Shoe (Bill Shoemaker), Darrel McHargue and Sandy Hawley." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay is still around, of course. Hawley, at Santa Anita now, mainly rides in 
his native Canada. Other jockeys whom Desormeaux has met in the last several 
days include Eddie Delahoussaye, Gary Stevens and Pat Valenzuela, all 
nationally known. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides them," McCarron said, "we also have guys like that guy over at the 
water fountain right now. There are a lot of guys out here who know how to win 
races." McCarron pointed across the jockeys' room to Russell Baze, who once won 
15 consecutive seasonal titles at Bay Meadows and Golden Gate Fields. 
</P>
<P>
When McCarron came to California, he hired a local agent, Harry (The Hat) 
Hacek, to book his mounts. Whether an incoming jockey should bring his agent 
with him or hire someone already entrenched in California has long been a topic 
of discussion, but McCarron really had no choice, because his Maryland agent 
wanted to stay in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing when you make a move is that your agent should be totally 
committed," McCarron said. "And I mean 110%. Even 98% isn't good enough. I 
remember going to Keeneland one year, when the Maryland tracks were on strike, 
and my agent wasn't sold on being there, because he was afraid that if we did 
well, I might want to stay in the Midwest. The whole meet, I couldn't buy a 
mount." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux's agent is 34-year-old Gene Short, a native of Hot Springs, Ark., 
who used to sneak into the races when he was a teen-ager, posing as a hot 
walker. 
</P>
<P>
Short cashed the first bet he ever made, a $42 winner. "I got into racing to 
make a million dollars betting the races," Short said. "I found out soon enough 
that nobody knows who's going to win these races. I hardly make a bet now. 
We're out here just to ride a lot of winners." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux is only the fourth rider Short has handled since he started working 
as an agent in 1982. They hooked up the day after Desormeaux won the fifth race 
of his career, in Louisiana, and were together for the last three years in 
Maryland, where Desormeaux was based while winning 1,521 races. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux went 0 for 5 in his Santa Anita debut, then missed with two more 
horses Thursday before riding favored Spirit Bay to victory in the third race. 
Spirit Bay paid $4. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux, who had eight mounts for the day, also won the last race with 
Aloma's Tobin, another favorite, who paid $4.80. In the feature, Desormeaux 
rode Santangelo, who went off at 45-1, to a second-place finish, 2 3/4 lengths 
behind Opening Verse. 
</P>
<P>
Although the California competition is the toughest Desormeaux has faced, he 
believes he will be more comfortable riding here. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a better (jockeys') colony than I've ever been used to," Desormeaux 
said. "And what that means is that everybody knows where they're going out 
there. That should be better for me, because I won't have to do the thinking 
for anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Five horses are likely to run against Bayakoa in Sunday's Santa Margarita 
Handicap, and the list could grow if trainer Ron McAnally decides to save his 
Eclipse Award-winning mare for the Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to run either way are Gorgeous, Nikishka, Luthier's Launch, Kelly and 
Carita Tostada. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the six sprinters entered in Saturday's 5 1/2-furlong El Conejo Handicap 
are trained by John Sadler, who will start Olympic Prospect if the track is 
dry, and Frost Free if it comes up mud. 
</P>
<P>
Others entered are Sunny Blossom, Bet on the Blurr, Prospectors Gamble and Ole 
Hank McGill. Sunny Blossom, who set a track record for six furlongs of 1:07 in 
upsetting Olympic Prospect by 1 1/4 lengths in the Palos Verdes Handicap on 
Dec. 30, will still have a four-pound weight advantage over Sadler's horse 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux's scheduled riding appearance Monday in Saudi Arabia has been 
canceled. Desormeaux said he was told that the mount he was supposed to ride in 
the race is not 100%, and the sponsors didn't want him on a horse which didn't 
have the best chance. . . . A big field is expected Monday for the $250,000 San 
Luis Obispo Handicap at Santa Anita, and one of the candidates for the 1 
1/2-mile grass race is Drum Taps, who is in trainer Neil Drysdale's care after 
winning the McKnight Invitational at Calder. Another starter will be Frankly 
Perfect, making his first appearance since winning the Hollywood Turf Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Felton, former chairman of the California Horse Racing Board, will act as 
referee at a board hearing today regarding Ron Hansen. Golden Gate Fields has 
banned Hansen for undisclosed reasons, and the jockey's attorney is appealing 
the action both in court and through the racing board.

TWIN QUALIFYING RACES AT DAYTONA; 
</P>
<P>
PETTY STEALS THE THUNDER FROM TWO WINNERS AND ONE POLE-LOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The King is back. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Petty came out of the pack -- and a time warp -- Thursday to lead the 
first of the twin 125 qualifying races for 15 laps and bring the crowd of 
95,000 at Daytona International Speedway to its feet, cheering for the blue and 
red No. 43 stock car. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since July 4, 1984, that Petty, who has won the Daytona 
500 seven times, had led a lap here. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Bodine, in Junior Johnson's Ford, and Dale Earnhardt, in a Chevrolet, won 
the twin 125s, which serve as qualifying races for Sunday's Daytona 500, but it 
was Petty who provided the most excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Petty, 52, swept past defending 500 champion Darrell Waltrip on Lap 28 to take 
the lead and remained there until Lap 42, when he pitted for a splash of fuel 
along with the other members of the front-running group -- Waltrip, pole-sitter 
Ken Schrader and Mark Martin. Only eight laps remained in the 50-lap sprint. 
</P>
<P>
This permitted cars driven by Bodine and Harry Gant, neither of whom pitted, to 
finish first and second as Petty and the others could not make up the time lost 
during their stop. Martin finished third, Waltrip fourth and Petty fifth, 
followed by another racing legend, A.J. Foyt. 
</P>
<P>
Schrader, who won the pole with a 196.515-m.p.h. lap during qualifying, spun 
out as Bodine was crossing the finish line and was hit by Hut Stricklin. 
Schrader's Chevrolet was so badly damaged that it was withdrawn from Sunday's 
race, and he will start in a backup car from the rear of the field. 
</P>
<P>
Bodine's victory was almost identical to what happened last year when Terry 
Labonte drove a Johnson Ford to win one of the 125s by conserving fuel and 
racing the 125 miles without a pit stop. 
</P>
<P>
"We used a lower gear and couldn't keep up with the lead cars but we set out to 
finish 125 miles without fueling, and we accomplished it," Bodine said. "That 
was the plan we went into the race with." 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt won the second race by pitting for four new tires during a caution 
period 12 laps from the end and then running up through the field with an 
impressive display of horsepower. Earnhardt, a three-time Winston Cup champion 
still looking for his first Daytona 500 victory, passed cars in gulps, picking 
off four before the pack reached the first turn on the restart. 
</P>
<P>
Driving a black Chevrolet prepared by Richard Childress, Earnhardt got five 
more cars on the next lap, then two more the next time around, before he set 
out after the leaders, Dick Trickle and Jimmy Spencer, who were driving 
Pontiacs. 
</P>
<P>
With Bill Elliott following right behind in a two-car draft, Earnhardt grabbed 
the lead on Lap 47, and the two of them finished going away. Spencer, on his 
33rd birthday, came in third, but Trickle ran out of fuel two laps from the end 
and dropped to 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the talk along pit row after the twin 125s would have been of 
Bodine's strategic victory and Earnhardt's power, but Thursday was King 
Richard's day, and his fellow drivers seemed as enthusiastic as the fans at 
seeing him in front. 
</P>
<P>
"I was glad to see him back up there because maybe it showed people, who said 
he ought to retire, that he can still drive a race car," Earnhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Bodine, who said he has been a Richard Petty fan since he began racing 
micro-midgets in 1955, added: "The way Richard ran today, he'll definitely be a 
factor come Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Petty, who led only once, for nine laps, during the entire 1989 season, was 
obviously pleased, but not with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more fun being up front," he said. "I know more people up there. I like 
being five (rows) from the front a lot better than being five from the back." 
He will start 11th, in the sixth row, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"One on one, we were as strong as anybody out there," Petty said. "But 
together, they were better than me alone. We ran good and we ran in front, but 
if you look at the results it's totally different. Circumstances dictate that 
the fastest car doesn't always win." 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances also dictated that some of the participants weren't sure what 
was going on . 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had won the race," Martin said. He had been the first car out of 
the pits after he, Petty, Waltrip and Schrader had stopped for fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"They came on the radio and told me I had outrun everybody on the track. It 
turned out they meant everybody but the ones who didn't pit. Heck, I thought I 
won, dadgumit. I thought I was racing for the win and I was just trying to hold 
Kenny (Schrader) off at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Gant, who finished second, had about the same idea Martin had. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end, I didn't know who was the leader," Gant said. "I didn't know until 
two laps from the end that I was second behind Bodine. 
</P>
<P>
"Around four laps to go, I looked up at the scoreboard and didn't see my 
number. The reason was I was looking at the bottom of the scoreboard instead of 
the top. I figured I was somewhere near 10th." 
</P>
<P>
Schrader blamed himself for his last-lap accident, which also knocked 
Stricklin's car out of the 500. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was racing Martin for the win," Schrader said. "If I'd have known 
I wasn't, I would have backed off. I just plain old lost it. My car had been 
loose all day, and I didn't see why it should act any different on the last 
lap, but coming out of (Turn) 3, it just started sliding." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Hendrick, who owns Schrader's car, said his team would lend a Chevrolet 
for Stricklin to drive Sunday, since he had no backup. 
</P>
<P>
NASCAR officials said Schrader will line up Sunday at the front of the field, 
alongside Earnhardt, the second-fastest qualifier. But when the field starts 
out behind the pace car, Schrader will wait at the side of pit road and fall in 
at the back, with everyone in the left line -- led by Bodine -- moving up one 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Bodine and Earnhardt each collected $34,000 for his victory.

CABLE-TV LEADERS ADOPT PLAN TO IMPROVE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cable-television industry, beset by complaints about service and prices, 
issued guidelines Thursday that officials said could lead to price increases 
but also to service worth paying the extra price. 
</P>
<P>
The voluntary standards, which cable officials hope can be adopted nationwide 
by July, 1991, call for improved responses to customers, better-trained and 
more accessible service representatives and faster installation and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The standards also urge cable companies to state clearly what services a 
customer is receiving and their cost and to make prompt refunds. Customers also 
should be given at least a month's notice when a company is going to raise 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
"In all candor, we can say that a significant number of our companies haven't 
gotten to the point where customer service is adequate," said James Mooney, 
president of the National Cable Television Assn. "Just as cable customers 
demand the best in television programming, they also expect and demand the 
prompt and reliable service reflected in these standards." 
</P>
<P>
Mooney said that the new guidelines could boost monthly cable rates but that it 
will benefit customers in the long run. "If customers want high-quality 
programming and . . . state-of-the-art plants -- sure it's going to cost them 
something. . . . But I think it will not be a significant upward boost in 
rates." 
</P>
<P>
Cable companies acknowledge a need for better service. But they note a survey 
released last May by Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable operator, 
in which 27% of responding subscribers rated quality of service as "extremely 
good" and 57% as "pretty good." On the down side, 8% said service was "not very 
good" and another 8% rated it "not good at all." 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen bills are pending in Congress that seek to impose varying 
degrees of "re-regulation" on a cable industry that, since it was essentially 
deregulated in 1987, has been criticized by some as having grown smug and 
unresponsive to complaints over prices and service. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Miron, chairman of the National Cable Television Assn., said 
implementing the guidelines will require spending by the companies. But 
investing in customer service, he added, is likely to make money for cable 
companies in the long run because it will help them attract the 40% of the 
public that does not now subscribe. 
</P>
<P>
Among the standards: 
</P>
<P>
* Telephone calls will be answered within 30 seconds, including waiting time 
and transfers, and automated answering systems will limit the number of rings 
to four. This standard should be achieved 90 percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
* Under normal circumstances, a customer will receive a busy signal less than 
3% of the time a cable company office is open. 
</P>
<P>
* Standard installations will be done within seven business days.

PEOPLE: REEBOK OFFICIAL RESIGNS, UNITS COMBINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reebok International Ltd. has combined its domestic and international Reebok 
divisions, and the president of the U.S. operation has announced his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Frank O'Connell, who was president of the U.S. division the past two years, 
said he was departing the athletic-shoe company "with positive feelings." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a situation where I didn't see the opportunity to exercise my 
leadership skills," O'Connell, 46, said in a phone interview. "I don't want to 
stay unless I could really run it." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive of Reebok, said in a statement that 
John Duerden will be president of the combined, global business. 
</P>
<P>
Duerden, 49, was previously president of the international division. 
</P>
<P>
Combining the two divisions "is the most effective way to maximize the global 
opportunities for the Reebok brand," Fireman said, adding that Duerden's 
experience will help the company focus on worldwide sales. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new structure, Duerden will report directly to Fireman, as will the 
presidents of other company divisions, such as Avia and Rockport shoes and 
Boston Whaler boats.

HEAVY-HANDED LESSON ON IMMIGRANTS' PRIDE

The Family by Buchi Emecheta. (George Braziller: $17.95; 240 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Among many other things, Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses" painted a vivid, 
hallucinatory picture of Muslim East Indian communities in Great Britain. Buchi 
Emecheta's "The Family," a smaller and quieter work, provides a glimpse of 
another little-known society: that of the hundreds of thousands of Africans and 
West Indians who settled in London since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Emecheta, of Nigerian origin, has written principally and gracefully of black 
African women in flux between tradition and modernity. In "The Family," her 
focus is upon a family of immigrants from Jamaica, and particularly upon the 
growing up and out of Gwendolen, the eldest daughter. 
</P>
<P>
In the early chapters, Gwendolen is a child being raised by her grandmother in 
a hillside slum outside Kingston. Her parents had moved to London, promising to 
send for her when they could. 
</P>
<P>
She lives in a constricted, tightknit community. The poverty is acute, and if 
there is village warmth, there is also village hopelessness. A middle-aged 
neighbor, Uncle Johnny, is a regular visitor to Gwendolen and her grandmother. 
He helps them out, and at night he abuses the child sexually. She is too 
ashamed to protest, she is ashamed of not protesting, and when she finally does 
protest, she is ashamed of the trouble that follows. 
</P>
<P>
Told in short sentences, flavored with patois, as if spoken in the voice of the 
12-year-old Gwendolen, these first chapters are short on character or feeling. 
They seem designed to set the stage for the contrast of what the child will 
find in London. 
</P>
<P>
The child's bewilderment upon arrival in London is nicely done. She is 
astonished to see a white cabdriver tip his cap to Winston, her father. The 
cold is like an assault. On the other hand, there is her first experience with 
an overcoat: "The feeling of privacy -- it was like walking about carrying your 
own house." 
</P>
<P>
Winston works hard in a construction job and makes good money, but he is 
illiterate and utterly lost in the big city. Sonia, his wife, works just as 
hard, keeping her apartment immaculate and decorating every inch of it, but she 
too hasn't a clue about how to adapt to British ways. 
</P>
<P>
Emecheta contrasts these West Indians, descendants of slaves, with their 
Nigerian friends who come from free, complex and traditional societies. 
Winston's work mate, Ilopinga, is well educated and skillful at negotiating the 
bureaucracy of the new country. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he is hampered by the very traditions that give him 
confidence and pride in himself. His two wives compete for status by producing 
children. There are 11 of them. Ilopinga knows a man should be proud of such a 
thing, but it forces him to put off his plans to study law. Winston, ruthless 
and unlettered, gives him rootless but pragmatic advice: Put the wives to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Dem wan' be baby machines let them carry on," he says. "But dem feed their 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
"The Family" follows Gwendolen through school, where her teachers, though not 
ill-intentioned, humiliate her over her difficulties in reading, writing and 
speaking standard English. She finds some consolations singing in a local black 
church; she is set back, almost into nightmare, when Winston sleeps with her 
during a trip by her mother back to Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Still traumatized by her earlier experience of abuse, and loving her father -- 
Emecheta oddly succeeds in making him sympathetic, not so much evil as doomed 
and eventually punished -- Gwendolen says nothing. And she becomes pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to be a trap. But she refuses to be caught, as her parents have been. 
She becomes a friend and lover of a Greek boy, and she runs away. After the 
police pick her up and place her briefly in a mental hospital, she gives birth 
and -- helped by the still provident British system of social assistance -- 
sets up on her own as a single mother. 
</P>
<P>
She has discovered pride in herself. She gives her baby an African name. She 
makes friends and begins to look outward. And suddenly she is speaking English 
of literary quality instead of patois. 
</P>
<P>
It is too sudden. Through Gwendolen, Emecheta is teaching us a lesson about 
hope and liberation among the London immigrants. Unfortunately, Gwendolen is 
virtually all lesson, and person virtually not at all. 
</P>
<P>
The book's didacticism swallows up its fiction. Only in the portrayal of 
Ilopinga and the other London Nigerians does Emecheta free herself from her 
purposes and liberate herself into her art.

Q: What do you recommend as a wrap for a strapless white sequined prom dress? 
My mom sews.

<P>
-- K.H.

<P>
A: A white organza shawl would be a simple-to-make, safe choice. But if you're 
willing to be a little daring, how about wearing an oversized white organza 
shirt? Londoner Rifat Ozbek designed one with kimono sleeves. You can 
approximate the look with Vogue Pattern 7727 (illustrated here). It has French 
cuffs, but essentially it's the same. MARYLOU LUTHER

Beverly Hills hairdresser Dusty Fleming had one of those weeks last week. He 
was shuttling about town do-ing some major heads -- Barry Manilow, Marvin 
Davis, the Jordan Hubner and John Davis wedding party -- when he got the call 
to Century Plaza to take an even more pressing assignment: Barbara Bush was in 
town and needed a do. Although Fleming wouldn't charge for his services, Mrs. 
Bush did give him a $10 tip, which, instead of pocketing, he framed.

GO GO'S BY FLO-JO: Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner, complete 
with short-for-her, vivid-pink nails, quietly introduced her Flo-Jo by Mizuno 
activewear/leisurewear earlier this week in Los Angeles. The 
functional-but-fashionable sweat suits, T-shirts, tank tops, cropped tops, 
biker shorts, stretch pants and cropped leggings have Flo-Jo's name emblazoned 
across many of the pieces (sometimes it's her name and her portrait). But don't 
go looking for these Japanese-made garments, which she helped design, unless 
you're shopping in Japan. Prestigious department stores there are also privy to 
the Florence Joyner Signature line of dresses and separates, and the Joyner 
Dash line of casual sportswear, both of which are manufactured by Sosukaya.

$1,000 DATE: Some teens will spend as much as $1,000 to go to the prom, 
according to Your Prom magazine, the new publication from Modern Bride. The 
premiere issue of the magazine hit the newsstands last week. Should teens be 
captivated by such articles as "Creative Corsaging," the publishers say Your 
Prom will become an annual "write" of spring.

WHICH CAME FIRST?: "Dick Tracy," starring Warren Beatty and Madonna, is 
scheduled to premiere June 15. But the spin-off merchandise is already in the 
stores or on the truck. Village Mews, a Van Nuys-based T-shirt company, has its 
$14 Dick Tracy T-shirts in Trendy Gifts in Torrance, Cartoon Junction in 
Sherman Oaks and L.A. T-shirt Museum in Westwood. Jacques Moret, a bodywear 
line imprinted with Dick Tracy logos, will be available by April at Bullock's. 
And Timex will offer watches featuring our handsome hero, Breathless Mahoney 
(Madonna's character) and Tracy's adversary, Flattop, available in May for 
$29.95. (The first Dick Tracy watch, manufactured by the New Haven Watch Co. in 
1934, sold for $2.65.) Jewelry designer Wendy Gell is on the bandwagon with a 
variety of jewelry pieces priced from $12 to $35 that will be available in 
March or April at Nordstrom and Disney stores.

FASHION FUTURES: The '90s may mean less constrictive office wear for men. 
According to the 1990s Trend Forecast Report from the Rhinebeck, N.Y.-based, 
Socio-Economic Research Institute of America, necktie sales will decline during 
the decade because of the global warming trend and other environmental changes.

A PILL FOR SLEEPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I was on a cruise with some friends, and one evening a member of our 
group said he was going to take a sleeping pill and turn in. This surprised me, 
because it was as if he was saying that he was going to brush his teeth and 
turn in. 
</P>
<P>
Should sleeping pills be used so casually? I sometimes have trouble falling 
asleep, but I've never used pills to help me do so. Should more of us be using 
pills for this purpose? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I don't know why your friend was relying on pills to fall asleep; 
possibly there was some sound medical reason for him to do so. In general, 
however, people who only occasionally experience difficulty in sleeping should 
not resort to the use of medication. 
</P>
<P>
If lack of sleep is impairing an individual's ability to function normally, 
then the use of pills for a few days may be indicated. Of course, 
sleep-inducing pills may also be prescribed for patients who are experiencing 
difficulty in sleeping because of illness or recent surgery.

ABC's Zahn Bids Adieu: Kathleen Sullivan has been notified that today will be 
her last day as anchor on "CBS This Morning," even though Paula Zahn still has 
not been officially signed as her replacement. Zahn, news anchor on ABC's "Good 
Morning America," said goodby on the air on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a wonderful opportunity to go into," Zahn told viewers. "The details 
are being worked out at this moment so we can't really talk specifically what 
they are about." CBS' official announcement of the signing of Zahn -- at an 
estimated $1-million salary -- has been delayed by the formality of ABC's 
contractual option to make a matching counteroffer. Sources said that ABC was 
unlikely to match CBS' offer, but Zahn's hiring by CBS has been held up because 
ABC News executives have been in South Africa. Faith Daniels will be the 
substitute host on "CBS This Morning" next week. BETH KLEID

Spike Lee Tops Critics' Poll: Spike Lee, who was overlooked for an Oscar 
nomination for his direction of "Do the Right Thing," was the overwhelming

Lee was named the year's best director by 29 of the critics and "Do the Right 
Thing" was picked as the year's best picture by 24. Paul Mazursky, also left 
off the Oscar ballot, was the critics' second choice as best director for 
"Enemies, a Love Story." The second choice of the critics for best picture was 
"Drugstore Cowboy." Neither "Do the Right Thing" nor "Drugstore Cowboy" made

'COURAGE MOUNTAIN' OFFERS FEW PEAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The uneven, curiously titled "Courage Mountain" (citywide) would have been 
better off called what it is: "The Further Adventures of Heidi." 
</P>
<P>
Although the often-filmed Swiss children's novel "Heidi," which was based on 
its writer Johanna Spyri's experiences living with her grandfather in the Alps, 
was published in 1880, "Courage Mountain" writers Weaver Webb and Fred and Mark 
Brogger have moved the time up to the outbreak of World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Heidi (lovely, talented Juliette Caton, who was the tempting angel in "The Last 
Temptation of Christ") is now a beautiful teen-ager eager to be old enough to 
be the beau of her 18-year-old neighbor, Peter (Charlie Sheen). Meanwhile, her 
grandfather (Jan Rubes) sends her off to an exclusive finishing school in 
Northern Italy run by the elegant and emphatic Miss Hillary (Leslie Caron). 
</P>
<P>
Heidi barely has time to adjust to her richer and more sophisticated classmates 
when the army commandeers the school, and Heidi and three of her classmates end 
up in the local orphanage. It's run by a dastardly couple, the Bonellis (Yorgo 
Voyagis, Laura Betti), who turn their charges into slaves, laboring in their 
soap factory. When Heidi becomes determined that she and her friends must 
escape, the film's adventures begin in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
Or rather they should. Unfortunately, director Christopher Leitch has not been 
able to sustain the panache and momentum with which he gets the film under way, 
and its final portion slackens just when it should be its most taut. (Not 
helping matters is Sylvester Levay's trite, sappy and downright intrusive 
score.) The story owes a clear debt to Dickens, "Oliver Twist" especially, yet 
its mild PG rating should be taken very seriously: It is far too harrowing for 
small children, particularly in its orphanage sequences. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side are the film's gorgeous natural locales and period settings, 
all of which have been stunningly photographed by Jacques Steyn (who also shot 
the current "Kill Me Again"). The acting honors go to Leslie Caron and Laura 
Betti. Caron is so strongly associated with several classic MGM musicals that 
many may not realize that in the European cinema she has emerged in more recent 
years as a stylish, witty character actress. 
</P>
<P>
Her Miss Hillary, born in France but raised in Britain, is a crisp, doughty, 
loving charmer, so well-bred that for all her character and courage she is not 
prepared to deal with the crude evil and corruption of the Bonellis. Both 
Voyagis, who is Greek, and Betti, a plump, golden-haired stalwart of the 
Italian cinema, play their villains with a delightful touch of tongue-in-cheek. 
It's admirable of Sheen to accept small roles in small films, but here his 
presence is jarring because he makes no attempt whatsoever at an accent. 
</P>
<P>
Two final nagging questions: Why would Heidi's grandfather send her off to 
Northern Italy when he seems to be aware of the gathering war clouds, and why 
to such a fancy establishment in the first place?

PIANIST LUCCHESINI RETURNS TO AMBASSADOR AUDITORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quick, what are the three most famous piano pieces in the key of D-flat? 
Obviously: the "Minute" Waltz, the Sixth Hungarian Rhapsody and "Clair de 
Lune." 
</P>
<P>
After a very serious program marking his second local recital appearance, young 
Andrea Lucchesini on Wednesday night at Ambassador Auditorium offered two of 
those three chestnuts as his encores. He didn't play the "Minute" Waltz, but he 
gave full value to Liszt's familiar Rhapsody and Debussy's once-ubiquitous 
evocation of moonlight. 
</P>
<P>
In this context -- an agenda beginning with Brahms' F-minor Sonata, ending with 
Schumann's "Carnaval," tied together with three Chopin impromptus -- such a 
descent into musical populism could be justified. The 24-year-old Italian 
pianist had already proved his seriousness -- as well as his inconsistency. At 
the end of the evening, he had some fun. 
</P>
<P>
As did his audience. The Liszt piece, with those wrist-challenging repeated 
notes, bushels of fast octave-passages and knotty, hard-to-articulate chords, 
caused Lucchesini no sweat. With good humor and a genuine sense of style, he 
sailed through. And "Clair de Lune," though no model of layered soft-playing, 
nevertheless exerted its legato charms seductively. 
</P>
<P>
The second half of the printed program also revealed the Italian musician an 
admirable Romantic. He stayed close to the keys, and to the spirit of Chopin, 
in the A-flat, F-sharp and G-flat Impromptus, which touched the listener 
through the pianist's unforced spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
He brought the same sense of on-the-spot invention, combined with myriad 
felicitous and pertinent details, to Schumann's colorful canvas. Indeed, this 
familiar masterwork has seldom received such exhaustive probing. Young 
Lucchesini clearly has a mind as sharp as his technical skills. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he failed to show any finished integration of brain and fingers in his 
mostly uneventful run-through of Brahms' great Opus 5 Sonata, which opened the 
program. Here, the actual piano-playing emerged immaculate and clarified. But 
the huge work's musical content came out half-baked, incomplete and 
unapprehended. Intensity and compulsion, the core of Brahms' emotional profile, 
never made an appearance; consequently, the sonata remained unrevealed. DANIEL

BLOMSTEDT IN PROGRAM OF SECOND SYMPHONIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Herbert Blomstedt is not a star conductor, and the San Francisco Symphony, 
Blomstedt's orchestra for the last five years, is not a virtuoso ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at its third Southland 
appearance in three days, the San Franciscans shone. 
</P>
<P>
What could have been an ordinary symphonic concert became a special occasion, 
through superior music making alone. Beethoven's "Leonore" Overture No. 2, not 
always a thriller, made a terrific impact. And second-level works by Roger 
Sessions and Tchaikovsky showed their more impressive facets. One left the 
Music Center uplifted. 
</P>
<P>
The American-born Swedish conductor accomplished these feats simply and 
modestly. His long association with the orchestra has resulted in solidity and 
single-mindedness in its playing. There seems to be a trust and mutual respect 
between players and podium that bridges any technical or mechanical gaps in the 
ensemble's execution. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the apprehendable musicality of Blomstedt's view of these works 
-- in addition to the overture, the second symphonies of Sessions and 
Tchaikovsky. He projected logic, motivation, emotional balance and continuity 
through both readings, which offered flow and contrast and telling details. 
</P>
<P>
The deepest probing is not this conductor's style; Blomstedt does not grab the 
listener by the ear and force him to feel. His performances do not reek of 
sweat, tears and compulsion. But they are eminently listenable, and usually 
admirable. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's Second "Leonore" opened this program authoritatively, in wondrous 
instrumental transparency. Sessions' enigmatic Second -- even after 43 years 
(this ensemble introduced the work in 1947), the work does not give up its 
mysteries easily -- moved along in its earnestly light-footed and brainy way. 
</P>
<P>
And Tchaikovsky's cherishable "Little Russian" Symphony, less than crisply 
articulated and in moments lacking that choral weight we associate with most 
American orchestras, nevertheless exerted its charms in a jaunty, if not always 
touching, reading. DANIEL CARIAGA

STAGE BEAT: 'CITIES': A DEAD END FOR DREAMS AT FIGTREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The loss of dreams and where that loss can put us is the subject of three short 
plays gathered under the umbrella title "Cities," at the Figtree Theatre. 
They're well worth the less than two hours it takes them to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
The production is spare. L. Lewis Stout's set grows in detail as each play 
grows in size and scope. The writing is also spare, but as rich as it needs to 
be to rip open the wounds of disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce McIntosh's monologue "Jill," smoothly directed by the author, places 
actress Victoria Haas in a straitjacket in a Connecticut asylum, reciting the 
important events of her short life. Nothing worked -- not family, not her 
fascination with art history (she lost her virginity at Sotheby's), not the 
cowboy "around a crimson van with white trim" at Madison Square Garden. But 
Haas makes it work. It's a sensitive piece of writing. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee Williams' "Talk to Me Like the Rain and Let Me Listen" moves north to 
Manhattan's Eighth Avenue. It's the '40s, and the Man and Woman have reached a 
dead end. 
</P>
<P>
McIntosh and Lisa Houle, as the couple, show with delicacy and insight their 
brief moments of false optimism, and their quick slide to despair. Len Donato's 
direction gives the performance force. 
</P>
<P>
McIntosh is less open but just as intricate as the sleazy New York type looking 
for a comet's tale to grab in Willy Holtzman's "San Antonio Sunset." Mr. Stone 
is looking for a black blues singer to record. It's 1936. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Whaley, as the singer from the jukes, is fascinating as he teaches the 
white man about the blues -- and the facts of life. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Klock is very good as the desk clerk, who can look the other way but 
doesn't miss a thing. He and McIntosh make the final scene dangerous and 
intriguing as the clerk lays bare Mr. Stone's own reason for fear. The dark 
period mood is nicely amplified by the straightforward, muscular direction of 
Philip Granger. 
</P>
<P>
At 6539 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood; Wednesdays and Thursdays, 7:30 p.m.; 
indefinitely. Tickets: $10; (213) 960-8870.

Bridging a Cultural, Generation Gap in 'Oasis' 
</P>
<P>
Vic Tayback is a charmer as the patriarch of a Lebanese family in S.K. 
Hershewe's "An Oasis in Manhattan" at the Venture Theatre. He's fighting not 
only a generation gap, but the large gap between the old world and the new. 
However, his fight is no different from that of the parents in "Romeo and 
Juliet" or "Abie's Irish Rose." 
</P>
<P>
The parental consternation is over the marriage of Youssef's daughter Olga (a 
charming Lainey Hashorva) and Freddie Schroeder, a young Jewish student (a 
crisp, ingratiating David Jahn). 
</P>
<P>
The action is spiced with the lively performances of Zee Tobin as Olga's 
all-American teen-age sister, and the warm, controlled mother of Diane Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of a few overplayed small roles, the company is sharp and sincere and, 
under T.J. Castronova's direction, they bring energetic life to Hershewe's 
derivative sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Fulvio's Manhattan apartment set makes a perfect frame for the action, 
but can't obscure the fact that Tayback's performance holds it all together. 
</P>
<P>
At 3435 W. Magnolia Blvd., Burbank; Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; ends April 
14. Tickets: $12.50-$15; (818) 846-5323. 
</P>
<P>
Road to 'Country' Hits a Few Bumps at Burbage 
</P>
<P>
Some plays need help, particularly when the playwright doesn't have an ending 
up his sleeve. The help provided in the case of Gilbert Girion's "Bad Country," 
at the Burbage Theatre, detracts rather than enhances the work. It looks tacked 
on. 
</P>
<P>
"Bad Country" concerns a family facing the loss of its mother. Satirically 
slanted or not, it's drafted in the style of John Steppling, and also owes a 
lot to Sam Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
The performances of John Pappas, as the no-good brother Jimmy, and Kari Lizer, 
as his sister's girlfriend, acknowledge the debt with respect and erudition. 
Jim Haynie is also strong as the errant father, but O-Lan Jones as the sister 
presents a series of attitudes rather than a performance. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the cast is unremarkable, though Andy Griggs' direction provides 
every opportunity. What Griggs hasn't solved is the script's feeble attempt at 
commenting on itself. A couple of goofs look too planned, and the gimmick of 
visiting Japanese theater buffs who examine the theater during the play (and 
provide the trumped-up ending) doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
At 2330 Sawtelle Blvd., West Los Angeles; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8:30 
p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 p.m.; ends April 1. Tickets: $12; (213) 478-0897. 
</P>
<P>
'Gentleman': Victorian Farce at Celebration 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, Giancarlo Stampalia's "Gentleman's Gentleman" at the 
Celebration Theatre is a delight, a Wildean-styled farce, Victorian in shape 
and as wickedly naive as a cucumber sandwich. A second glance reveals some 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the problems stem from the script's wandering away from its original 
intention and turning into almost serious drama. There are also distracting 
details, such as referring to a gentleman's gentleman as a butler. He's a 
valet. A butler is another animal altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Myles is Thomas Trilling, the dandy who poses as his own valet in order 
to win the lady of his choice. He's a little heavy-handed most of the time, 
except in the frothy opening scenes. Christopher Nixon is much surer in an 
on-the-button performance as the valet who finally wins the undying love of his 
master. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Lilly, as Trilling's original fiancee, and Michael Scott Shaw, as the 
obsessively gay brother of Trilling's new idol, are both on a level with 
Nixon's airy delivery. 
</P>
<P>
The cast works well under Michael Benedict's direction. 
</P>
<P>
At 426 N. Hoover St.; Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.; 
indefinitely. Tickets: $12-$15; (213) 876-4257. 
</P>
<P>
'Dragon Slayers': Black Comedy for Adults Only 
</P>
<P>
The publicity for American Puppet Theatre's production of Stanley Keyes' 
"Dragon Slayers" says it's for "mature audiences only." It most certainly is. 
</P>
<P>
The company has a "kids' show" arriving during the spring, but leave the little 
ones home for this one. This black comedy concerns a troupe of puppeteers in 
Berkeley whose communal urge is first to get each other's clothes off as 
quickly as possible, then to get out of puppeteering into the Siamese 
fighting-fish racket. 
</P>
<P>
The puppet show of the title, which the company is in the throes of creating, 
follows the story line of the film of the same name, but not to any great 
length. There is little puppetry in this production. 
</P>
<P>
If the two worlds, real and puppet, were more integrated, it might all come 
together. But the play itself is quite ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford Mays' direction doesn't help. The actors scream at each other, to 
little dramatic effect, and the whole has an unmistakable aura of 
disorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1625 N. La Brea Ave., Hollywood; Wednesdays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 2 p.m.; 
indefinitely. Tickets: $10; (213) 874-6427.

Eve of Destruction: Photographers Patrick Nagatani and Andree Tracey once again 
collaborate on a series of elaborately faked Polaroid still-lifes about nuclear 
destruction. Intrinsic to the proceedings is a weird kind of gallows humor. 
</P>
<P>
The artifice of staged setups puts a patina of frivolity on horror but, 
increasingly, laughter seems to be choked off. There is a tension and 
earnestness in this work that is new to the pair. 
</P>
<P>
Nagatani's New Mexico missile sites haunted by dancing Kachinas still have the 
unreality of a myth materialized in broad daylight. Conflict between symbolic 
forces has the edge of a real battle of the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
Tracey's photo collage, mixed-media paintings are no-holds-barred attacks on 
the exploitation of the environment. Blunt to the point of being overly 
didactic, they still pack a punch. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view are richly colored painted towns by Christopher Warner. Standing 
in the middle of nowhere, they both love and hate the human presence under the 
big Western sky. Loving the purity of the land, they nonetheless dote on the 
trash, wheel ruts and power boxes that mark human habitation, pushing them 
forward like a bulldozer scoops garbage. Through it all, the color is succulent 
and the trash and sky compete in vivid silence, giving the paintings the eerie 
stillness of a battleground. (Koplin Gallery, 8225 1/2 Santa Monica Blvd., to

Search for Meaning: In John Frame's newest batch of miniature carved comedic 
dramas, the soul's search for meaning continues. The small dioramas are 
impeccably crafted and the tiny Punchinello-type figures captivating. 
</P>
<P>
Part puppet, part spectral effigy, each effortlessly mimes its part in the 
silent theater of Frame's constructions. 
</P>
<P>
But this time around the scenarios and the figures venture outside the safety 
of fine craft and Renaissance Italian art into less civilized, more archetypal 
ground. Playing off found objects and unmanipulated natural materials, several 
figures are left raw, like stick dolls, with only hands or faces developed for 
stark contrast. In "My Sebastian/If I Fade," the juxtaposition between the 
delicately carved, hole-riddled saint spiked with a woodsman's wedge in his 
voice box and the two crude wood spirits haunting the tree branch he's tied to 
sets up a fascinating narrative about faith, death and nature's primal forces. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast with Frame's heavy ruminations are Mieke Gelley's delicate, 
abstract color field washes that mix printmaking and watercolor on one image. 
Technically inviting and sensuously colored, they hint at botanical 
associations but don't push the innuendo anywhere. Most interesting are the 
blocks of dense color crushed into thin translucent paper. Here the vague 
watery blots and spare organic forms seem importantly solid against the 
yellowish, rose water atmospheres. (Jan Turner Gallery, 8000 Melrose Ave., to 
March 3.) SUVAN GEER

Layers of Imagery: Painter Judith Simonian's works have incorporated both a 
dreamy sort of realism and a dematerialized, pattern-happy treatment of form. 
The Los Angeles artist, who now lives in New York, peers at landscapes through 
the linear tracery of wrought-iron fences and merges recognizable painted 
images with abstract patterns of ceramic tiles. 
</P>
<P>
The thinness of the painting surface suggests either a fragile contemporary 
world liable to disintegrate or a distant universe perceived with difficulty 
through layers of imagery. 
</P>
<P>
In "Population," black and gray jabs of paint reassemble themselves as birds 
flying above a promontory. Painted with a miniaturist's care on top of the 
fresco-like landscape -- all milky blue and chalky yellow -- a tiny bundle of 
scrolls tied with a red ribbon reinforces the feeling of having uncovered a 
passage of antique art for which we no longer possess a context. 
</P>
<P>
Tiles are clustered together in "The English School" three-dimensional objects 
filling in the severe outlines of what appears to be an International Style 
building lurking behind a cozy, typically English structure in the foreground. 
Scattered in the trees, individual tiles remind the viewer of Mondrian's 
transformation of natural imagery into patterns of squares. Ultimately, the 
tiles reinforce Simonian's stress on the underlying patterns of objects, 
whether seen close-up or glimpsed after details have been eroded by time.

Detritus of Culture: Innumerable paintings lumped together with word-puzzle 
texts and deceased movie-star photos make Andrew Masullo's art as complicated 
and self-contradictory as life, personal experience and the art world itself. 
Along with his own simply lettered "message" paintings, Masullo obsessively 
displays as his art an eclectic collection of scavenged images, framed and hung 
meticulously on the walls a la Allan McCollum. 
</P>
<P>
This detritus of culture is absorbed pretty much wholesale into his process via 
the addition of a narrow vertical line of patterning or a block of solid color. 
Then each piece is dutifully signed and numbered like entries in a crudely 
efficient mental reference book. 
</P>
<P>
This is not work that explains itself. Repeatedly, words and images bounce off 
one another, breeding a sketchy kind of mental construct that questions as much 
as it explains. Alongside tributes to Bette Davis and bright pink enshrined 
photo enlargements of the artist are mirrors obscured by black painted 
splotches, literary quotes that breathe with Angst and fancy framed canvasses 
that dumbly read "Art." If meaning can be ferreted out of fragmentation by 
sheer dogged questioning and repositioning, then Masullo has the modern system 
for information assimilation by the tail. (Asher/Faure, 612 N. Almont Drive, to

BUSH PROCLAIMS 'ANTI-DRUG CARTEL'; 
</P>
<P>
SUMMIT: FOUR LEADERS ANNOUNCE NO SPECIFIC NEW STEPS TO FIGHT TRAFFICKING. THE

CARTAGENA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush flew here for his much-heralded summit with three Latin American 
presidents Thursday and proclaimed after about three hours of meetings that the 
four nations have formed "the first anti-drug cartel." 
</P>
<P>
An 11-page "Declaration of Cartagena" signed by Bush and the presidents of 
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru said that fighting drug traffic requires effective 
efforts to reduce demand for drugs in consuming countries and to stimulate 
economic development in producing countries. 
</P>
<P>
Bush promised in the document to seek congressional approval of new funds to 
"counteract the short and long-term socio-economic impact of an effective fight 
against illicit drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The communique also pledges the four governments to control chemicals used in 
refining cocaine, share money and properties seized from traffickers, exchange 
intelligence information and control weapons, planes and other equipment used 
in drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
However, the presidents -- Bush, Peru's Alan Garcia, Bolivia's Jaime Paz Zamora 
and Colombia's Virgilio Barco Vargas -- did not discuss extradition of drug 
criminals, specific levels of American economic aid or the use of the U.S. 
military to fight the drug traffic, according to Bush's spokesman, Marlin 
Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and South American officials negotiated details of the document until 
Wednesday night before coming to final agreement. A source close to the talks 
said that the American negotiators wanted to put the major emphasis on police 
and military repression of drug trafficking, but they yielded to the South 
Americans' insistence that greater emphasis should be put on the need for 
financial aid and economic development as necessary conditions for controlling 
the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The South American governments reluctantly acceded to a U.S. demand for a 
clause specifying that the armed forces of the three South American countries 
may participate in the fight against trafficking, the source said. The 
Colombian military already is involved, but the military leaders of Peru and 
Bolivia have balked at joining police in anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater described the meeting as "cordial and businesslike . . . very 
complete." 
</P>
<P>
Others took a somewhat more skeptical view. 
</P>
<P>
"As they say in the United States, 'Where is the hamburger?' " asked Peru's 
Garcia during a joint press conference at the end of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the question, the four participants each pronounced themselves 
basically happy with the meeting. While no specific new steps were agreed upon, 
they said, the fact that the four presidents met at all was an important 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
"We have begun a form of perestroika," Paz said at the joint press conference, 
adding that he was "fully satisfied" with the results. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time," said Garcia, "we have come together with the President of 
the United States." That fact, he declared, marks the beginning of "a new 
collaborative approach" and a "new chapter" in relations between Latin America 
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, said Bush, "demonstrates solidarity" between the United States, 
the world's largest consumer of cocaine, and the three nations that are the 
chief sources of the drug. "In signing the document, we've committed ourselves 
to the first common, comprehensive international drug control strategy. We, in 
fact, created the first anti-drug cartel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paz said the communique shows that the United States now accepts the idea that 
coca leaf production cannot be curtailed without major economic support for the 
economies of the coca-growing countries, Bolivia and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
The document states, "The United States is also prepared to cooperate with the 
Andean Parties in a wide range of initiatives for development, trade and 
investment in order to strengthen and sustain long-term economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
But Paz said the South American presidents recognized that U.S. budget problems 
make it difficult for Bush to promise all the aid needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We indicated that we do not expect it to come only from the United States," he 
said, but other developed countries should also help with financial support. 
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the United States also pledged "increased cooperation in 
equipment and training to the law enforcement bodies" of the three Andean 
countries. It agreed to work with them "to stem weapons exports from the United 
States to illegal drug traffickers." 
</P>
<P>
But the presidents' declaration left several major questions unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
Barco, for example, denied news reports that his government had made a deal 
with traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"These rumors are completely and totally false," he said. "Colombian law cannot 
be negotiated." 
</P>
<P>
Barco did not, however, mention the word "extradition." And although he 
insisted that drug traffickers must "give everything up, including themselves," 
he made no commitment that the Colombian government would continue to send at 
least some of those who did surrender to the United States to face trial. 
</P>
<P>
Extradition is the fate that members of the Colombia drug cartels apparently 
fear most. When the assassination of a popular presidential candidate by 
traffickers last August prompted Barco to revive an extradition treaty with the 
United States, the cartels fought back with a campaign of terror. Recently, 
messages from the traffickers have indicated that they would end their war with 
the government and get out of the illicit drug trade. Observers say their aim 
is to persuade Barco to drop extradition. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the United States and Peru agreed to make a separate exchange of 
diplomatic notes reinforcing their commitment to the extradition of accused 
drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, for his part, pledged to continue to seek economic aid to help wean the 
economies of the three Andean nations from cocaine. But he made no commitment 
to a total amount and specifically said that the United States would not try to 
match the loss of cocaine revenue "dollar for dollar" or "job for job." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can do that," he said. The South American nations should try 
to end coca production, despite the economic costs, because "growing drugs for 
the international market" is "immoral." 
</P>
<P>
Bolivia's President Paz, however, painted a picture of how difficult that will 
be for his impoverished country. He said upon his arrival Tuesday night that 
coca accounts for half of its national economy. In a separate, bilateral 
agreement with Colombia, the United States pledged to try to open the U.S. 
market to additional Colombian exports that would replace drugs, but, again, 
Bush made no specific promises. American consumers "do not want to pay higher 
prices," he said when asked about efforts to increase the international price 
of coffee, one of Colombia's largest legal exports. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Peru also signed an agreement permitting the exchange of 
tax records, bank statements and other information to uncover illicit drug 
profits and trace drug money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also repeated his pledge to continue efforts to reduce demand for drugs in 
America, an important symbol for South American leaders, who for years have 
bridled at what they argue is unfair American pressure to destroy coca crops, 
the main source of income for hundreds of thousands of otherwise impoverished 
peasants, while United States does little to reduce the demand that fuels the 
drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
Next to demand reduction, "all other tactics pale into insignificance," 
Colombia's Barco said as he welcomed the three other leaders to the summit 
site, a Colombian navy base on a small peninsula jutting out into the placid 
waters of Cartagena Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"The only law the narco-traffickers do not violate," he said, "is the law of 
supply and demand." 
</P>
<P>
The aspect of the summit that was almost certainly the most carefully watched 
in the United States was a question answered before the meetings even began: 
Bush proved he could travel to Colombia safely. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, the question of the President's security here has dominated 
discussions of the meeting. Despite qualms by his security staff and worries of 
many Americans, Bush insisted on traveling here, saying that to do otherwise 
would send a message of no-confidence in the Barco government. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials Thursday continued their conflicting messages about 
the degree of danger. White House officials warned reporters and staff members 
not to wander from "secure areas" and not to accept any packages or gifts. 
Other Administration officials, however, said they thought the concern over 
security, which had led the White House to keep the bulk of the press corps in 
Barranquilla, about 60 miles from the meeting site, had been overstated. 
</P>
<P>
The worries were "overblown," Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson told 
reporters on Air Force One as Bush flew south before dawn Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Although security was tight, few unusual precautions were apparent. Air Force 
One made a fast, low approach to the airport at Barranquilla. Bush spent a few 
minutes greeting dignitaries at the airport, then boarded a Marine helicopter 
which sped off for Cartagena. Accompanied by three other helicopters carrying 
press, staff and Secret Service agents, the President's helicopter flew at high 
speed and low altitude along the coast, sending flocks of egrets swirling into 
the air from the marshes below. 
</P>
<P>
Peru's President Garcia had threatened to not attend the summit because of the 
U.S. invasion of Panama. He changed his position only after the United States 
announced that all invading troops would be withdrawn by the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving Thursday morning in Cartagena, Garcia indicated that the invasion was 
not be a subject for discussion. Panama "is a separate chapter," he said, but 
added: "We continue to reject the intervention; we continue to reject the 
invasion." 
</P>

"Glad to meet you at last," Bush said to Garcia as the two were introduced. 
"You're a big man, a big guy," he added to the Peruvian president, who, even 
without the elevator shoes he wore is a couple of inches taller and quite a few 
pounds heavier than the six-foot two-inch Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a brief stroll in the humid ocean breeze before their meeting, Bush 
chatted with the three other heads of state in a small courtyard of an old fort 
located on the peninsula as raucous tropical birds crowed nearby and flocks of 
small yellow warblers darted between branches of bright pink bougainvillea. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it, beautiful," said Bush "I just wish we had more time for fishing."

BACKGROUND Cartagena was once a major storage port for the treasure-laden 
galleons of the Spanish Main. An extensive network of fortresses and ramparts, 
with walls 50 feet thick in places, was built by Spain to protect hoards of 
gold and jewels from pirates and privateers, who attacked the city repeatedly. 
Sir Francis Drake captured Cartagena in 1586 but, for a payment of 10 million 
pesos, did not burn it down. The French sacked it in 1697. But in 1741, its 
mightiest fortress, San Felipe -- honeycombed with tunnels and passages -- 
resisted a massive assault by 27,000 men and 3,000 pieces of artillery led by 
the English buccaneer Edward Vernon. Well-restored and well-maintained, 
Cartagena's Old City today is one of the best preserved colonial-era districts 
in South America. It has often been used as a set for films seeking to recreate 
authentic period locales, including that of "The Mission," starring Robert De 
Niro.

THE TALK OF CARTAGENA 
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug war brought the leaders of the United States, the biggest 
consumer of illegal drugs, and the major producing nations, Colombia, Peru and 
Bolivia, together at a summit in Cartagena, Colombia. Some facts and figures 
about the drug trade and the participating nations: 
</P>
<P>
COLOMBIA 
</P>
<P>
Colombian farmers grow about 10% of the coca leaves for U.S.-bound cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The Medellin and Cali drug cartels refine 80% of U.S. cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal cocaine brings in an estimated $500 million to $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
BOLIVIA 
</P>
<P>
Bolivia raises about 30% of the coca for U.S. cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine trafficking brings in an estimated $200 million to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
PERU 
</P>
<P>
60% of U.S.-bound cocaine is derived from coca grown in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 Peruvians earn their living growing coca. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs bring in $1.2 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
UNITED STATES 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's national drug control strategy for 1991, if approved, will 
cost $10.6 billion. Of the total spending, 42% would be for domestic law 
enforcement, 29% for interdiction and 29% for prevention and treatment. The 
plan includes $423 million in drug law enforcement and economic development aid 
to Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.

WOMAN IS HAVING BABY TO SAVE HER AILING DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual case that raises complex ethical issues, a 43-year-old Walnut 
woman is having a baby in hopes that the newborn can become a bone marrow donor 
for her teen-age daughter, who is suffering from leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd be pregnant at my age, but when you're faced with the 
possibility that your child is going to die, you desperately seek, and whatever 
you need to do, you do it," said Mary Ayala, who is due in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
Although family members are the best sources for transplants, none of the 
Ayalas proved compatible when tested. A search by the National Marrow Donor 
Program of unrelated donors -- with only a 1in-20,000 chance of a match -- also 
came up empty. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the bone marrow can be obtained at little risk from an infant who 
is at least 6 months old. And doctors say the Ayalas' 17-year-old daughter, 
Anissa, is likely to still be alive then. The chances that the two siblings' 
tissues will be compatible are about one in four. 
</P>
<P>
Medical ethicists interviewed Thursday said it is extremely rare for a baby to 
be conceived specifically to serve as a bone marrow donor for an ailing family 
member, and that the Ayala case raises a number of ethical issues. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike adults, children are unable to give informed consent for medical 
procedures such as marrow donation. Such legal consent is usually given on 
their behalf by a parent or guardian. But, ethicists said, the Ayala case 
raises the issue of the parents' ability to do what is in the baby's best 
interest because a decision may be clouded by desperation over another family 
member's sickness. 
</P>
<P>
"What they're doing ethically is very troubling," said Alexander M. Capron, 
professor of law and medicine at USC. But he added, "On the other hand, I can 
sympathize with their desire to do everything possible to save their daughter's 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Jake Priester, a research fellow at the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the 
University of Minnesota, said that he, too, can understand why the Ayalas opted 
to have another baby. However, "it seems to raise questions as to whether this 
child is simply being used as a means to provide something for someone else. 
How much potential pain and risk can one parent demand of one sibling for the 
benefit of another sibling?" 
</P>
<P>
The Ayalas acknowledge that their decision is highly unusual. But they defend 
their choice and express dismay that anyone would question their motives. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not a match, we will love our baby just the same," Mary Ayala said 
softly. The new baby, she said, "would give Anissa lots of enthusiasm, it would 
make her fight to stay alive to see her grow up." 
</P>
<P>
And the Ayalas say that their unborn baby girl, if able to communicate, would 
agree to be a marrow donor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our choice, and I think the baby, if she turns out to be the donor 
Anissa needs, would have thought it was a real miracle," Mary Ayala said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ayalas decided to go ahead with the pregnancy even though Anissa's doctor, 
a pediatric oncologist at City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte, advised Mary 
not to become pregnant just for Anissa's sake. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a peculiar reason to have a baby," said Dr. Patricia Konrad. 
"It made me uncomfortable. It didn't sit well, if that was the only reason, to 
have a child to help another child." 
</P>
<P>
But Konrad said she plans to perform the transplant if the infant girl, whose 
sex was revealed through the prenatal diagnostic test known as amniocentesis, 
proves to have compatible tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after Mary and Abe Ayala -- who own and operate a speedometer repair 
business -- had exhausted all alternatives to save their daughter's life, they 
decided to create one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when many of their friends were becoming grandparents, the Ayalas 
opted to become parents again. 
</P>
<P>
The Ayalas say their decision was not a frivolous one. The couple did a lot of 
soul-searching, they said, and discussed the idea at length with Anissa and 
their 19-year-old son, Airon. They also said they asked for -- and received -- 
God's guidance. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a dream and God told me everything was going to be OK," Mary Ayala said. 
"He wants me to have this baby." 
</P>
<P>
Anissa's doctor said the leukemia has stabilized, leaving her in relatively 
good health. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager's burnished brown hair and rosy skin belie her illness. She does 
volunteer work, exercises at the local gym and expects to graduate from Walnut 
High School in May. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the Ayalas decided to have another child, they didn't know if they 
could because Abe Ayala had undergone a vasectomy after Anissa was born. 
</P>
<P>
At first, doctors offered little hope of a reversal. But six months after the 
vasectomy reversal operation, Mary Ayala became pregnant. The baby is due April 
13, nearly two years to the day since Anissa's illness was diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
This week, as Mary Ayala recounted the history of her daughter's leukemia, 
Anissa wrapped her arms tightly around a pillow on the family's living room 
couch. But when the conversation turned to the baby, mother and daughter took 
on the conspiratorial tones of sorority sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Mother and daughter have combined their names to come up with one for the baby 
-- Marissa Eve. 
</P>
<P>
When Marissa is born, Konrad plans to collect blood from the baby's umbilical 
cord, then freeze the blood for use later in the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
If the baby's tissue matches, Anissa's doctor will begin the long and painful 
process of preparing her for the transplant by destroying her existing marrow 
through bombardments of radiation and chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
The harvesting of the marrow, as the medical procedure is known, is done under 
general anesthetic, during which a thick needle is inserted into the marrow 
cavity of the donor's hipbone. Konrad said a healthy donor can regenerate the 
extracted marrow within a week. 
</P>
<P>
The marrow is prepared and then injected into a vein of the recipient, similar 
to a blood transfusion. The marrow cells then travel through the bloodstream to 
the bone marrow, where they grow. 
</P>
<P>
Because the pregnancy has only a one-in-four chance of yielding a match, the 
drive to find a donor for Anissa continues, with the help of such groups as 
Covina-based Life-Savers Foundation of America. The foundation recruits donors 
for the 9,000 Americans who are awaiting bone marrow transplants. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Walnut High students, their families and friends next week will begin to 
recruit volunteer marrow donors for Anissa and to help raise money for testing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ayalas are waiting out the last two months of pregnancy. "We 
face it every day, that maybe today Anissa gets sick," Mary Ayala said. "But 
you just can't dwell on it." 
</P>
<P>
"We're just waiting and hoping that our miracle baby will be the miracle baby 
that Anissa needs." 
</P>

SOVIETS PROPOSE MIXED ECONOMY, PRIVATE PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet government, proposing a major change in the country's socialist 
system, presented legislation Thursday that would end the state's monopoly 
ownership of all means of production and thus lay the basis for a mixed economy 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Leonid I. Abalkin, the deputy prime minister for economic policy, described the 
legislation as the foundation for broad reforms of the Soviet economy, 
introducing much-needed competition through diversified ownership and bringing 
market forces into what has been a centrally managed economy. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation is aimed primarily at enabling enterprises owned by local 
governments, by workers and, in some cases, by individuals to compete with 
those owned by the state, Abalkin told the Supreme Soviet, the country's 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to give the same legal basis to all forms of 
property, including that of the individual," Abalkin said. "This is a great 
step forward. . . . This law has colossal importance." 
</P>
<P>
The bill looks forward to the privatization of many state enterprises through 
sale to their workers or to cooperatives or the leasing of their assets to 
entrepreneurs willing to take over money-losers in the belief that they can be 
made profitable through better management. 
</P>
<P>
It also would give foreign companies setting up factories here the same rights 
as Soviet enterprises in the hope of attracting Western investment. 
</P>
<P>
And it would permit, for the first time in more than 60 years, the private 
ownership of small service firms and capital goods such as farm equipment and 
professional tools, although initially only in limited forms. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, as presented after months of discussion and drafting, would 
"recognize, admit and protect the ownership by citizens of the means of 
production," Abalkin said, and thus abandon the long-held Marxist principle of 
public ownership of all enterprises and other means of production. 
</P>
<P>
So radical is this departure from the socialism developed here in both theory 
and practice since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 that the legislation 
immediately ran into a storm of criticism from members of the Supreme Soviet, 
who saw it as a return to capitalism -- although its principles were endorsed 
by the Communist Party's Central Committee in the platform it adopted last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"This is nothing other than the legalization of private property," one deputy, 
Leonid I. Sukhov, a taxi driver from the Ukrainian city of Kharkov, said, using 
the phrase that is synonymous here with capitalism in its most exploitative 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the present conditions, I will be voting against this bill. . . . I 
believe, in fact, that the bill should be submitted to all the people in a 
national referendum. We have to ask the people. The people know better than 
these academicians what we should do." 
</P>
<P>
Vavil P. Nosov, a machine operator from Komi in northern Russia, said the bill 
would allow the many millionaires in the Soviet Union's illegal "shadow 
economy" to make even larger profits by putting their money into legitimate 
businesses and taking them over. 
</P>
<P>
Collective farmers and rural enterprises would be particularly vulnerable, 
Nosov said, if this bill were followed by other legislation permitting the 
buying and selling of land. The large amount of money that the "dealers of the 
cities' shadow economy" could pay would tempt rural residents who were both 
poorer and less sophisticated, Nosov argued. 
</P>
<P>
Other deputies expressed concern about the ownership of natural resources, 
including the water from the mighty Siberian river system. But they were told 
that these issues will be addressed in companion legislation on the ownership 
and use of land and natural resources and on the new relationship to be worked 
out between the central government and the constituent republics. 
</P>
<P>
The real objection to the legislation, however, is ideological. Decades of 
Marxism have left most people with what one deputy called "an allergy" when 
there is a reference to "private property." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, as the ideological founders of socialism, had 
gone as far in their criticism of capitalism as to sum up their theory of 
communism in a single phrase -- "the abolition of private property." 
</P>
<P>
"The very term private property has a great emotive force here, as many people 
associate it with exploitation, unemployment and social insecurity," the 
official news agency Tass said in a commentary. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-article bill, as a consequence, never uses that phrase, speaking instead 
of "the property of citizens." At its first reading in the autumn, the bill 
caused such controversy that it underwent substantial revisions, according to 
Tass, and at least 10,000 changes were written into the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, more significantly, also avoids defining "means of production," 
except to give farmers the specific right to own equipment, such as tractors, 
that was previously classed as capital goods and thus not available for sale to 
individuals. This question will be settled later, Abalkin told reporters, so 
that some republics, notably Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, could proceed on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation prohibits "exploitation" of workers, but it does not define 
"exploitation" nor specifically bar the employment of workers, whose salaries 
and benefits might be such that no one would argue that they were exploited. 
</P>
<P>
The bill did have its defenders in the often emotional debate. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to have a market economy and participate in the international 
marketplace, then we need such a law," Justice Minister Veniamin F. Yakovlev 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander A. Korshunov, an aircraft factory employee in the Central Asian city 
of Tashkent, said that "private property already exists and will develop 
further -- let's not kid ourselves about that -- but, like all forms of 
property, should be controlled and taxed." 
</P>
<P>
"We may not like private property, and it may go against what we have thought 
and been taught for a long time," he said, "but that is not an argument against 
it, particularly when we are looking for a way out of the country's economic 
crisis."

CRANE FIRM'S SAFETY RECORD NOT CHECKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the construction firm in charge of a building project where a 
240-ton crane fell and killed five people here last November said Thursday that 
he was unaware of the extremely poor safety record of the subcontractor hired 
to operate the crane. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is "we don't deal with safety" records when it comes to hiring 
subcontractors, said David Grubb, president of Swinerton &amp; Walberg, a large 
company with a good reputation for safety on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Grubb, testifying before a House subcommittee studying the lack of federal 
regulation of cranes and those who operate them, said his company now is paying 
more attention to subcontractor histories. 
</P>
<P>
The Erection Co., a Seattle-based firm hired by Swinerton &amp; Walberg to put 
up high-rise steel at a building in downtown San Francisco, was cited for 59 
violations between 1985 and 1988 by Washington state work-safety officials, 
according to testimony by Gerard F. Scannell, chief of the federal Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration. The state officials had proposed penalties of 
$110,000. 
</P>
<P>
Grubb said that before the accident his company regularly checked out 
subcontractors' bondability and industry reputation, but "our diligence . . . 
would not have taken into account safety." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the speed of the construction bidding process is among the 
factors that discourage general contractors from making such checks. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the House subcommittee on employment 
and housing, said Grubb's testimony illustrates why the construction industry 
should fund a national data bank to immediately make available safety records 
of subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos also urged Scannell to create OSHA regulations on huge "tower cranes" 
such as the one that collapsed, and said he plans to introduce legislation next 
week to substantially increase criminal penalties for employer negligence that 
leads to serious on-the-job injury or death. 
</P>
<P>
Grubb, breaking with the general anti-regulatory posture of the construction 
industry, said he supports federal licensing of crane operators and suggested 
that all operators be required to attend approved technical schools. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Swineton &amp; Walberg, both the Erection Co. and a crane-delivery 
company it hired, American Pecco Co., declined invitations to testify Thursday. 
Lantos said the subcommittee will issue subpoenas to require representatives to 
appear at a future hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the Nov. 28 crane accident, which killed four workmen and a bus 
driver on the street below and injured 21 others, still is not known. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Cal/OSHA, the state workplace-safety agency that is authorized by 
the federal government to regulate safety in the state, said Thursday that they 
have ruled out nothing except winds and alcohol or drug use on the part of the 
crane operator in explaining why the crane suddenly spun off balance and fell 
19 stories as it was being elevated for higher-level work. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the San Francisco crane accident and another crane fatality in 
Los Angeles, the state Legislature is considering a bill to require more 
frequent inspections of cranes, licensing of operators and an end to a practice 
of "self-certification" -- also permitted on the federal level -- that allows 
cranes to be inspected by their manufacturers instead of an independent third 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos, regarded as Congress' most persistently severe critic of OSHA, spent 
considerable time Thursday grilling Scannell, who began heading the federal 
agency last fall and is regarded by workplace-safety advocates as potentially 
the strongest leader in OSHA's relatively timid 19-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos was outraged at Scannell's testimony that OSHA has inspection 
requirements for several kinds of cranes, but not for the massive tower cranes. 
</P>
<P>
Scannell said he thought that was "probably an oversight" dating back to OSHA's 
inception. 
</P>
<P>
Responded Lantos, "I find OSHA as an entity to be criminally negligent to allow 
such an oversight year after year." 
</P>
<P>
"I agree with you," Scannell said. "It was horrendous." 
</P>
<P>
Scannell noted in his testimony that OSHA is creating a separate office of 
construction to improve its regulation of the construction industry, which is 
responsible for more workplace deaths than any other segment of the economy. It 
won him no thanks from Lantos. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other criticisms the subcommittee chairman had of OSHA was the tiny 
number of cases referred to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution -- 
only 55 in the history of the workplace agency. 
</P>
<P>
The main problem, according to Lantos and other critics of OSHA, is that the 
law which created the agency permits criminal penalties only in cases where 
employer negligence has led to death. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos said his bill, which would raise the maximum prison sentence to 20 years 
from the current six months, would permit criminal prosecution in any case 
where unsafe conditions lead to "major bodily harm."

Gird your loins. The Selling of Malathion has begun. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few weeks, wave after wave of sweet reason will come rolling in 
from the agricultural heartland. The boys in the John Deere hats have had 
enough of this hysteria over the killing of a few bugs. Some timely 
pacification of the south is in order, and appropriate steps are being taken. 
</P>
<P>
Even as you read this, discreet polling is taking place south of the 
Tehachapis. Big agriculture wants to know how this anti-spray thing got out of 
hand and -- much more important -- how to calm it down. In the words of one of 
the veterans of the chemical wars, the farmers are looking for ways to bring 
the south's relationship with malathion back to the "comfort level." 
</P>
<P>
The outfit retained to find our comfort level is the Dolphin Group, the Los 
Angeles political consulting firm that helped bring you the Recall Rose Bird 
campaign. So stay tuned and stay close to the TV, cause that's where this war 
for the hearts and minds of the sprayees will be fought. 
</P>
<P>
It appears, in fact, that counteroffensives are blooming all over. In 
Thursday's editions of this newspaper you may have read where the governor has 
ordered his Medfly lieutenants to stop the political bleeding, spray-wise. And 
even our own county agriculture commissioner has launched a campaign to correct 
what he calls the "misinformation" being spread by those masters of propaganda, 
the neighborhood activists. 
</P>
<P>
So here we go. California, once again, is about to do what it does best: decide 
public policy on TV. With this in mind, allow me to offer the campaign 
consultants some advice from down here in the spray zone. Who knows, we just 
may find that comfort level yet. 
</P>
<P>
First piece of advice: Stop patronizing those who are being sprayed. These 
people are making a substantial sacrifice, and the issues they have raised 
about the risks of spraying are legitimate. When such issues are referred to as 
"misinformation," and the people raising them called "demagogues," you 
trivialize the process and create more anger. 
</P>
<P>
Second piece of advice: Admit your past mistakes. A little confession is good 
for the soul, it clears the air, and gives you opportunity for a fresh start. 
You might begin by conceding that the spraying program has been conducted 
callously, in a military style, and has provided virtually zero opportunity for 
residents to ventilate their concerns. You might want to promise that this 
approach will be avoided in the future. 
</P>
<P>
You should also admit that your initial assurances about the complete safety of 
malathion were not entirely candid. Too many scientists, some of them the very 
people who conducted the safety studies, have suggested otherwise, especially 
when used under the current circumstances. As long as you cling to your 
position of complete safety, the whole program will suffer an erosion of 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
And you might want to fess up about the state's failure to develop alternative 
control methods. The Medfly infestation is no surprise to anyone, and the state 
has been on notice since the last major attack in 1981 that alternatives are 
needed. Why, given our past experience, has the state been unable to produce 
sufficient quantities of sterile Medflies? Why have no other safe controls been 
developed? 
</P>
<P>
Third piece of advice: prove to those in the spray zone that there is an end to 
the malathion, and that the end is within sight. If you cannot do this, you 
will lose the hearts-and-minds war. Not only must you convince the sprayees 
that this infestation is being defeated, you must demonstrate that future 
problems will be met with different techniques. If a new Medfly emergency is 
announced in 1991 and the spraying starts again, you will have to roll tanks in 
the streets of L.A. to keep the populace under control. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, there is a real opportunity here to come to grips with the ugly 
choices posed by the Medfly war. The stakes are huge for everyone, not just the 
farmers, and there is no easy way out. If we stop the spraying, we do not avoid 
malathion. We may end up with more of it as we try to stop the Medfly in our 
own back yards and as the farmers slap heavy doses on their crops. 
</P>
<P>
But there are also limits to anyone's tolerance. The whole notion of choppers 
flying over rooftops at night, dumping poison on people huddled inside their 
homes, is so abhorrent that the state should have started long ago to find 
other ways out of the Medfly dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Are the farmers and the state willing to look at these problems without 
blinking? That's what we will find out when the selling begins.

BILL ON LONG-GUN WAIT SENT TO GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
GUN CONTROL: THE MEASURE IMPOSES 15-DAY WAITING PERIOD ON PURCHASES OF RIFLES 
AND SHOTGUNS. DEUKMEJIAN SEEMS TO WAVER ON EARLIER SUPPORT.

<P>
The Assembly on Thursday narrowly passed and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian a 
bill abolishing the Old West tradition of cash-and-carry sales of hunting 
rifles and shotguns in California and replacing it with a 15-day waiting 
period. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily lobbied bill would impose the delay on the purchase of so-called 
long guns while law enforcement authorities check the purchaser's background 
for a history of crime or mental instability. The procedure would be unique in 
the nation, though other states employ other forms of background checks. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, a staunch opponent of new controls on firearms until a crazed 
gunman armed with an assault rifle murdered five schoolchildren in Stockton 
last year, indicated last week that, barring any major changes, he would sign 
the bill by Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly (D-Sacramento). 
</P>
<P>
But shortly after the Assembly vote, Republican Deukmejian seemed to be 
hesitating in his support. He said he still "strongly supports" the concept of 
preventing criminals and the mentally ill from buying guns, but he wants to 
"review carefully" whether the bill provides the "best method" for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents argued that the bill's potential for saving lives far outweighs the 
inconvenience to law-abiding rifle and shotgun buyers. The backers contended a 
"cooling-off" period would curb killings of "impulse and passion." 
</P>
<P>
But Republican opponents argued that any wait is unnecessary because technology 
is available to create a computerized system for "instant" background checks, a 
proposal favored by the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Following a tense, one-hour debate, the bill passed on a 42-25 vote, one more 
than required in the 80-member Assembly. The bill was strongly supported by top 
law enforcement officers and Handgun Control Inc., but stiffly opposed by the 
National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the bill represented another election-year defeat for the 
politically active gun owner organization. The Connelly bill generally is 
regarded as much farther reaching than the ban on assault weapons enacted last 
year by the Legislature and Deukmejian over NRA opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-one Democrats and a single Republican -- surprisingly, gun owner 
Assemblyman Stan Statham of Oak Run, who represents a substantial constituency 
of rural hunters and sportsmen in Northern California -- cast the favorable 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three Republicans and two Democrats -- freshmen Sal Cannella of Modesto 
and Willard H. Murray Jr. of Paramount -- voted against it. Ten Republicans and 
Democrat Richard E. Floyd of Carson abstained. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many killings that occur in the heat of passion that there is 
nothing the matter with a two-week cooling-off period," Statham said. "This 
bill will do a lot to stop the crazed, erratic impulse buying of guns." 
</P>
<P>
Statham was heavily lobbied in November by Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun 
Control and wife of former White House Press Secretary James Brady, who was 
crippled in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
A supporter of the bill said Sarah Brady was the guest of Statham and his wife 
at a conference of state legislators in Monterey. "She lobbied him for a whole 
weekend," the source said. On Thursday, Statham was credited with casting the 
breakthrough Assembly vote. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, buyers of pistols and revolvers in California have waited for 15 
days before they can take possession of their firearms. If a background check 
discloses that the purchaser has committed a serious crime or suffered mental 
illness, the sale is canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The Connelly bill would extend basically the same restrictions to purchasers of 
long guns and would put such firearms out of the reach of individuals who had 
been detained by authorities for an involuntary 72-hour psychiatric examination 
and criminals convicted of violent and gun-related misdemeanors. It would go 
into effect Jan. 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the unregulated casual sales of long guns between private 
individuals would be subject to the waiting period and would have to go through 
a licensed dealer. Critics long have complained that guns privately transferred 
often end up in the hands of criminals and the mentally unstable. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Justice estimates that background checks would be run on 
about 1 million long gun purchasers annually, in addition to the 300,000 checks 
performed each year on handgun buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey require that prospective long 
gun purchasers obtain a permit from law enforcement before buying a firearm. 
The criminal background checks can take two weeks or more. 
</P>
<P>
During the Assembly debate, Connelly read aloud the names of Californians who 
were fatally shot during the past few months by long guns purchased shortly 
before the killings. Included were the two little daughters of Betty Morgan of 
Yuba City, who were shot by their father with a newly purchased long gun. He 
then killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
"The gun owners I've talked to, virtually without exception, are willing to 
suffer that (15-day wait) inconvenience so Mrs. Morgan doesn't have the kind of 
inconvenience she had up in Yuba City," Connelly declared.

LIABILITY OF POLICE FOR DAMAGES CUT; 
</P>
<P>
COURT OF APPEALS: LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN PAY ON BEHALF OF LAW ENFORCEMENT 
PERSONNEL IF MALICE IS NOT INVOLVED, THE JUDGES DECIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a precedent-setting decision, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 
Thursday that local governments can pay punitive damages on behalf of law 
enforcement officers who have violated the civil rights of citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, which arose from a 1987 incident in which a pregnant woman was 
punched and photographed under duress by Riverside police, was termed 
"outrageous" by attorney Stephen Yagman of Santa Monica, who sued on the 
woman's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate ruling "puts police officers in a position where they can do 
anything because they know they won't have to pay for it," Yagman said, adding 
that he intends to ask the 9th Circuit to reconsider the case with a larger 
panel of judges. 
</P>
<P>
In May of 1988, a federal court jury in Los Angeles returned a verdict against 
five Riverside police officers stemming from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Cornwell had claimed that she was roughed up by undercover policemen who 
failed to identify themselves when she went to her front lawn to complain to 
neighbors about a noisy party. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors awarded Cornwell $88,000 in compensatory damages and $327,000 in 
punitive damages, but U.S. District Judge Ferdinand Fernandez, who presided 
over the trial, later reduced the punitive damages to $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside city officials decided to pay the judgment but Cornwell refused to 
accept the $45,000 in punitive damages. She then appealed Fernandez's decision. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit decision Thursday was described as a "major breakthrough" by 
John M. Porter, a Riverside attorney who represented the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough enough to be a cop without worrying about whether you're going to 
have some of the damages (in a case like this) come out of your own pocket," 
Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision does not guarantee that officers will always be indemnified but 
it does guarantee that that option is available" to cities that want to use it, 
Porter added. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony at the 1988 trial showed that undercover officers had gone to 
Cornwell's residence to investigate complaints of a noisy party. The woman, 
thinking they might be part of the unruly party-goers, came outside, and sharp 
words were exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, testimony showed, Officer Richard Bradley punched Cornwell, 
who was three months pregnant, in the stomach. Officers Carmen Andrade and 
Jackie Bell took her into custody. She was taken to a local hospital, where she 
was photographed against her will by Officer Gary Crawford. Sgt. Benjamin 
Reiser was the supervisor in charge of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, California law has provided that a city can pay compensatory 
damages for the wrongful acts of its employees, but the Legislature broadened 
that law in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The new statute provides that public agencies, other than the state, are 
authorized to pay punitive damages for their employees if it is found that they 
acted within the course of their employment, in good faith and in the apparent 
best interests of the agency involved. 
</P>
<P>
Yagman argued that Riverside should not pay the punitive damages, despite the 
state statute, because of language in a 1981 U.S. Supreme Court decision that 
held that a city was immune from punitive damages under federal laws that allow 
citizens to file police brutality cases. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Supreme Court noted that taxpayers do not have to foot the bill if 
there is malice involved. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's 9th Circuit decision was written by Judge John T. Noonan Jr., who 
wrote that the Supreme Court's decision does not prohibit cities from paying 
punitive damages when the city finds that its police officers acted without 
malice.

Wildlife officials desperate to save migrating salmon and steelhead began 
firing rubber-tipped arrows at the sea lions responsible for decimating the 
fish runs through the Ballard Locks. 
</P>
<P>
Washington state Wildlife Department spokesman Bob Byrne said the arrows will 
fly at the locks weekday mornings through March. "The goal of the rubber tips 
is to use this negative stimuli -- pain -- coupled with an underwater sound so 
that the sound becomes the negative stimuli," Byrne said. Byrne said the 
department's goal is to save 1,600 fish in an expected run of 2,100. But he 
said workers will be lucky to spare 900.

A study of airline-cabin environment found that, even with the smoking ban that 
takes effect Feb. 25, passengers and crew still face a health risk from 
increased radiation from the sun and stars. The study released by the 
Department of Transportation recommends airlines schedule cabin crews in ways 
that will reduce their risk to cosmic radiation, especially those crews who 
regularly fly near the North Pole and South Pole or at higher altitudes. 
</P>
<P>
The study found the risk of cancer death from cosmic radiation comparable to 
the risk of death from exposure to smoke-filled cabins. In addition to risks 
facing crew members, the study noted a risk to frequent fliers and to the 
fetuses of pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy.

Panamanian pilot Eduardo Pardo pleaded guilty to one racketeering count in the 
drug conspiracy case involving Manuel A. Noriega and is expected to testify for 
the prosecution when the deposed Panamanian dictator goes on trial. 
</P>
<P>
Pardo entered his plea in Miami to a charge that he flew $800,000 in cocaine 
proceeds from Florida to Panama in 1983. He faces a maximum possible punishment 
of five years in prison and a fine of $10,000. The plea by Pardo, 44, who will 
be sentenced in April, could lead to similar pleas from some of the four other 
co-defendants who are accused with Noriega of importing cocaine into the United 
States through Panama, according to sources close to the case.

Mayor Richard M. Daley proposed building a $4.9-billion, 9,400-acre airport in 
the Lake Calumet area on Chicago's Southeast Side, to be operational by 2010. 
The site includes hazardous waste areas and about 5,500 residences. Rep. Henry 
J. Hyde (R-Ill.), who prefers to expand O'Hare International Airport, 
criticized Daley's cost figures as too low. State and federal officials and 
residents of the area around O'Hare have been promoting the idea of a new 
Chicago airport to relieve congestion at O'Hare. U.S. Transportation Secretary 
Samuel K. Skinner endorsed the Daley plan.

SOUTH AFRICA: THE VISITING AMERICAN GOT A ROUSING RECEPTION. BUT SUDDENLY THE 
FOCUS WAS ON MANDELA.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jesse Jackson and his 17-member entourage tore across South Africa on a 
fact-finding mission for five days last week, delightedly mugging for the 
cameras, pressing flesh in the townships, embracing black liberation heroes and 
making all the local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, after spending the days since Sunday in the publicity shadow cast 
by black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela's return from 27 years in prison, 
Jackson cut short his stay in South Africa and flew on to Namibia, leaving some 
angry anti-apartheid activists in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
Things began to go awry for the American civil rights leader and former 
presidential candidate within minutes of Mandela's release Sunday. As the 
71-year-old prisoner walked free, about 50,000 people were gathering on parade 
grounds in downtown Cape Town to welcome their leader. 
</P>
<P>
As the spectators, crushed together and kept waiting several hours in a hot 
sun, grew increasingly angry with the delay, Jackson's chauffeur-driven sedan 
forged into the crowd and attempted to deposit the American in front of the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson emerged from the car, waved to the crowd and looked up at the City Hall 
portico where Mandela was to speak. Seeing no way to climb the platform, 
Jackson got back into the car. But the car was penned in by the surging crowd, 
many of whom thought it had been carrying Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson got out again and this time found himself being lifted above the masses 
and pulled, his double-breasted suit jacket hanging open, up to the platform. 
He escaped into the building and was never asked to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, Jackson failed to show up for a reception sponsored by the 
U.S. Embassy in his honor and the next day he canceled planned rallies in 
Durban and Port Elizabeth, deciding instead to fly to Johannesburg, saying he 
had to meet with Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
Mkhuseli Jack, an anti-apartheid leader in Port Elizabeth, said he and the 
other rally organizers were "a little angry and very disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
"Ordinary people were looking forward to hearing a man who has stood for human 
rights, and the organizations had invested a lot of time in planning for this 
visit," Jack said. 
</P>

South Africa had granted Jackson, a strong critic of Pretoria's white 
minority-led government, a visa in January. But when he delayed his journey, 
government sources said they worried that he was hoping to share the limelight 
with Mandela, whose release was widely expected in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, it might have been better if he had come at a more opportune 
time," Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha said a few days before Mandela's 
release. "I must be honest. I would have liked to have him here in January." 
</P>
<P>
The reason, Botha said then, was that "it's not always easy to handle all the 
fanfare of some of our American friends. But I understand it. If it's got to be 
done, let it then be done. He can come and enjoy the aftermath, but certainly 
not claim credit for having been a player on the field." 
</P>
<P>
During his first few days in South Africa, Jackson was warmly greeted by 
enthusiastic crowds. A gold Mercedes-Benz led his motorcade to the black 
township of Soweto, where he visited an educational complex and met with civic 
leaders. A crowd of several hundred black student nurses from nearby Vista 
University cheered his arrival, and he was swamped by reporters and 
photographers as he waded into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of ululating women thronged around Jackson as he entered the building, 
where he, his wife, Jackie, and son, Jesse Jr., were joined by ANC leader 
Walter Sisulu and his wife, Albertina. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know the 'Rev' would be here," said Anna, one of the students. "I 
think he's just a great man and I'm very grateful to see him. I just got to 
shake his hand!" 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Jackson got an audience with Mandela in the freed leader's brick 
home in Soweto. Jackson and his family emerged from the hourlong meeting to 
face dozens of reporters, most of whom had been waiting for interviews with 
Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he wished the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. could have "been 
there for that special moment." 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear now that Mr. Mandela represents more people in the country than 
the state president and represents more people in the world with more 
credibility than does the national government," Jackson said. "He is now in the 
equation to help define a new South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"The misnomer around the world is that Mandela is free," Jackson added. "He is 
out of jail, but he's not free. He is not free to live where he wants, not free 
to vote and not free to run for office." 
</P>
<P>
As Jackson flew out of the country, the Star newspaper ran a color photograph 
of a smiling Jackson and his wife alongside Nelson and Winnie Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
"He got what he wanted by coming at this time," one diplomat said. "He did bask 
to a certain extent in the Mandela limelight, and the private film crew he 
brought with him surely got what they needed."

Israeli Atty. Gen. Yosef Harish has dropped a criminal investigation of dovish 
Science Minister Ezer Weizman, demoted for alleged contacts with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, Israel Radio said. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
removed Weizman from the policy-making Inner Cabinet last month after accusing 
him of meeting with a PLO official in Geneva. Israel Radio said Harish dropped 
the investigation because of a lack of evidence and after determining that 
Weizman had parliamentary immunity from prosecution.

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, distancing himself from the government he helped 
create, said that a reunified Germany poses no danger to Poland. He also said 
he wants Soviet troops out as soon as possible. The Solidarity-led government 
of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki has adopted a more tolerant attitude 
toward Soviet withdrawal, saying the 40,000 troops in Poland should leave only 
after creation of a new security arrangement for Europe.

DIPLOMACY: THE TONE OF RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW IS SHOWING MARKED IMPROVEMENT.

<P>
"In the past, we often rejected your ideas just because they came from your 
side," Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III in Moscow last week, according to a U.S. official who was 
present. "Now we've realized that a lot of your ideas are good ideas, and we 
can accept them." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's foreign minister put that new principle into startling practice this 
week by agreeing, swiftly and stunningly, to a pair of U.S. proposals on German 
reunification and troop levels in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
American officials were openly surprised by the concessions. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of things that happened more quickly than certainly I would have 
thought," President Bush said Wednesday with the pinch-me-to-see-if-it's-real 
tone of someone who had just won the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important than the Soviets' specific concessions, officials said, the 
overall tone of U.S.-Soviet dealings seems to have taken a marked turn for the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"It is simply different dealing with them now," said one official who 
accompanied Baker to Moscow. "As a Sovietologist, I have to say that it's an 
amazing experience. . . . It's just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as a few years ago, he said, Shevardnadze and other Soviet 
officials typically listened to U.S. proposals in stony silence and responded 
-- if at all -- with tough counterproposals, weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
Now, another official said, "At the highest levels of the Soviet government, 
there's a willingness to reach a solution. . . . They don't see the United 
States as the enemy anymore." 
</P>
<P>
During Baker's visit to Moscow, Soviet negotiators engaged in an unusual, 
impromptu negotiating session with U.S. officials to seek a breakthrough in the 
talks on reducing strategic nuclear weapons. The Soviet legislature accorded 
Baker an unprecedented invitation to testify publicly before its committee on 
international affairs. And the KGB, the once-feared Soviet secret police, 
proudly gave U.S. human rights officials a tour of its headquarters to show off 
its new "rule of law" program. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the most striking moves were the two that Shevardnadze made on Tuesday 
at a military aviation conference in Ottawa -- because they abruptly reversed 
positions that Soviet leaders had only recently proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
First, Shevardnadze accepted a U.S.-designed plan for unity talks between East 
and West Germany along with a conference of the Allies of World War II -- only 
two weeks after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev first acknowledged that 
German reunification was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in an even greater surprise, the Soviet official agreed to a Bush plan 
that the superpowers reduce their troops in Central Europe to 195,000 each -- 
while allowing the United States an additional 30,000 troops in southern and 
Western Europe. Last week, Gorbachev rejected the plan as unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still trying to figure that one out," a U.S. official confessed happily. 
"We never dreamed they would accept it this quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials involved in the U.S.-Soviet talks of the past week 
said there were good reasons for Gorbachev and Shevardnadze to move as they 
did. 
</P>
<P>
On the German question, they said, Gorbachev wanted an orderly process that 
guaranteed Moscow some influence over the pace and shape of reunification -- an 
issue of major public concern inside the Soviet Union, where memories of World 
War II remain vivid. 
</P>
<P>
On troop levels, they said, Gorbachev apparently decided that it was more 
important to secure an East-West agreement on conventional armed forces than to 
haggle over numbers that appear unrealistic as the political pressure mounted 
for troop withdrawals on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"Floors, ceilings -- that stuff doesn't matter so much any more," one Bush 
adviser noted. "What matters is arranging an orderly withdrawal of forces and a 
sense that things are under control." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, several officials noted, the Bush Administration was probably 
willing to compromise on the issue of its demand for 30,000 extra U.S. troops 
in Europe; Baker even said publicly that he wasn't "wedded to it." 
</P>
<P>
But negotiating the issue would have delayed agreement, and Gorbachev, facing 
escalating demands from his former allies in Eastern Europe for a complete 
Soviet withdrawal, apparently decided that an internationally accepted troop 
level of 195,000 was better than no fixed level at all. 
</P>
<P>
The turnabout on troops, one senior U.S. official said, was only the most 
recent and vivid example of a recurring phenomenon: the Soviet leader 
frequently changes his minimum demand -- his "bottom line" -- when 
circumstances shift. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing about Gorbachev is that he has always had a moving bottom 
line," the official said. "If you give him an escape hatch, he moves beyond 
where you think he would go." 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviet leader has still kept U.S. officials guessing, because his 
flexibility isn't consistent, another official noted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disorienting," the official said. "On some things that should seem 
central to their security, they move surprisingly fast. . . . On others, like 
Afghanistan, they don't." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Bush Administration is trying to respond -- and to encourage more 
Soviet flexibility -- by being more aggressive in offering areas for agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Because they're different, it makes us different," one aide said. "There are 
times . . . when we have to move in their direction." 
</P>
<P>
At Baker's meetings in Moscow last week, he noted, the United States 
volunteered several new formulas to solve longstanding arms control issues. 
</P>
<P>
And the Administration deliberately designed its proposal for German 
reunification talks with an eye toward Gorbachev's political needs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was developed because we knew Gorbachev had to have a handle on this 
process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. desire to help Gorbachev has been heightened further in recent weeks, 
since conservatives in the ruling Soviet Communist Party have begun attacking 
their leader's foreign policy. At last week's meeting of the Communist Party 
Central Committee, for example, conservative member Yegor K. Ligachev 
criticized Gorbachev for failing to slow the process of German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
"What Gorbachev needs is things he can point to" in Moscow's domestic debates, 
one official said. "He needs to show that he's not the only one making 
concessions." 
</P>
<P>
Another official said the increased criticism "definitely seemed to affect 
Shevardnadze" in his talks with Baker. "It is increasingly important that they 
be able to explain their policy at home," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some U.S. officials cringed when Bush proclaimed two weeks ago 
that Gorbachev was "the best Soviet leader" from the standpoint of American 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Please tell your President that we don't need that kind of support," a Soviet 
liberal told U.S. diplomats. "That won't help."

lifejackets from the ship washed up on the beaches at Arcachon on Thursday, 
appearing to confirm fears that the vessel had gone down, the coast guard said.

Argentina and Britain announced an agreement Thursday to restore full 
diplomatic ties, nearly eight years after they fought a 74-day war over the 
Falkland Islands, a sparsely populated archipelago off Argentina's coast in the 
South Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement capped two days of talks here between Argentine and British 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced 
around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The pact calls for advance notice by each side of military exercises around the 
islands, which are home to about 1,900 people. 
</P>
<P>
In the war over the islands, called the Malvinas by Argentina, 712 Argentines, 
255 Britons and three islanders died. London and Buenos Aires broke diplomatic 
relations during the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement announced Thursday stipulated that talks will continue between 
the two nations on fishing around the islands -- an important source of revenue 
-- and that the International Red Cross will work out visits by Argentines to 
war cemeteries in the Falklands. 
</P>
<P>
By mutual consent, the latest talks did not touch on claims to sovereignty over 
the Falklands, which Argentina and Britain have disputed since 1833.

Massive unrest in the Tadzhikistan capital of Dushanbe toppled the leadership 
of the entire Central Asian republic Thursday, and the deputy prime minister 
turned against the government to head a "provisional people's committee." 
</P>
<P>
In the first reported outburst of Islamic fundamentalism in the mainly Sunni 
Muslim republic, extremists mobbed a bus and attacked Tadzhik girls because 
their heads were uncovered, Radio Moscow's Interfax news service said. 
</P>
<P>
The official Tass news agency said seven people were killed and 40 wounded in 
the last 24 hours in clashes between Tadzhik militants and self-defense units 
formed by other residents of Dushanbe, a city of 316,000 people with a variety 
of ethnic groups. The city is 95 miles north of the Afghan border in Central 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
There was no clear casualty toll from the four days of violence. Tass quoted 
the Soviet Interior Ministry as saying 18 people were killed and 200 wounded. 
Interfax, citing unofficial sources, reported 25 dead. Soviet television 
earlier had said 37 had died, a total that Thursday appeared to be 
questionable. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, facing the second Muslim insurrection on 
his vast country's southern rim in less than a month, vowed Wednesday to squash 
the instigators of violence in Dushanbe. 
</P>
<P>
The upheaval in Dushanbe erupted Monday with pogroms directed against Armenian 
refugees from last month's ethnic violence in Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said 8,000 people rallied outside the Tadzhik Communist Party headquarters 
and a smaller number gathered at the government building to demand the 
resignation of republic and local leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Tadzhik Communist Party boss Kakhar Makhkamov, Prime Minister Izatullo Khayeyev 
and President Gaibnazar Palleyev submitted their resignations, but there were 
no immediate replacements, the Izvestia government newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The leadership void widened when Deputy Prime Minister Buri Karimov jumped ship 
and took over the helm of "Unity," a "provisional people's committee."

KATHLEEN BROWN SHAKES UP TREASURER'S RACE;

POLITICS: SHE ACCUSES INCUMBENT HAYES OF DRAGGING HIS FEET IN SELLING 
VOTER-APPROVED BONDS.

Waking up the quiet race for state treasurer, Democrat Kathleen Brown is 
accusing incumbent Republican Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes of delaying numerous 
public works projects by moving too slowly to sell $7 billion in bond measures 
approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that voters are being asked to approve another $5.1 billion in bonds in 
the June primary election, Brown told a group of Times reporters during a 
breakfast interview this week that Hayes has not "taken an aggressive enough 
approach" to selling the state's bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"The treasurer ought to be leading some sort of effort to determine why the 
bonds aren't being issued. If they aren't needed anymore, then we should be 
cleaning them off our books," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes conceded that he is waiting to sell $7 billion in bonds approved by 
voters over the last 16 years. But the treasurer, who is running for his first 
full, four-year term after being appointed last year by Republican Gov. George 
Deukmejian, suggested that nothing short of catastrophe would result if the 
state suddenly moved to sell the bonds.

Selling bonds faster than he has been doing, Hayes said, would "cost the state 
billions" in higher interest costs, jeopardizing the tax-free status of 
California's bonds and threatening the state's AAA bond rating. He said it 
would also rush massive school, water and prison construction projects before 
they are ready to leave the government planning incubator. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds, usually paid off over 20 years, are the state's traditional means of 
financing long-term building projects.

<P>
Brown, the daughter of former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown and sister of ex-Gov. 
Edmund G. Brown Jr., will face Compton City Treasurer Wesley Sanders in the 
June Democratic primary. But Brown clearly is looking toward the general 
election in November, taking swipes at both Hayes and his Republican primary 
opponent, Angela (Bay) Buchanan, a former U.S. treasurer under President Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Brown described Buchanan as "an Orange County gal" who is off base in 
criticizing other candidates in the treasurer's race for accepting campaign 
contributions from financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Buchanan raised money for Reagan and Bruce Herschensohn, an 
unsuccessful Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1986, Brown said the 
GOP candidate "had a midnight conversion" on the contributions issue for 
"political purposes." 
</P>
<P>
But Brown, who was an elected member of the Los Angeles school board during the 
1970s and more recently a Los Angeles public works commissioner, spent most of 
her time talking about her differences with Hayes, who served as the 
Legislature's chief auditor before being appointed treasurer by Deukmejian. She 
drew Hayes' background as a career civil servant into her remarks at every 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Sacramento Press Club, Brown said, "When you put on the green 
eye shade and you start saying you cannot issue more than X billion dollars of 
bonds, you begin to ignore two things. One, what is the need? And two, what is 
the public telling you? The treasurer is an elected official and not a civil 
servant. The treasurer is there to solve problems and to respond to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, poking some fun at herself, said she had three key assets as a 
candidate: She is a woman, a Democrat and a Brown. Each, she said, would help 
her win votes. Then she got a laugh from members of the Press Club when she 
outlined her three main liabilities: being a woman, a Democrat and a Brown.

In one of the bleakest official forecasts since the drought of 1977, federal 
officials announced that water deliveries will likely be cut by half to 
agencies serving more than 20,000 farms from Redding to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
The potential cuts, mostly agricultural, include water destined for two densely 
populated counties in the Bay Area -- Santa Clara and Contra Costa -- where 
about 3 million people live. The annual forecast of water availability was made 
by the Bureau of Reclamation, which provides water to farms through more than 
300 local water districts and contractors. Last year, federal officials made 
similar predictions, but heavy rainfall and replenishment of the mountain 
snowpack in March eliminated the need for cuts.

B. REYNOLDS; ACTIVIST FOR WORLD PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barbara Reynolds, whose 1958 protest voyage with her husband and two children 
into America's forbidden Pacific nuclear test zone made international headlines 
and propelled her into a career as a peace activist, has died at the age of 74. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reynolds was a housewife and author of children's books in 1951 when her 
husband, Earle, a physical anthropologist, was sent by the U.S. government to 
Hiroshima to study the effects of atomic-bomb radiation on the growth of 
children. Three years later, the study completed, the family set out in a 
50-foot yacht called the Phoenix for a four-year tour of the world. It was near 
the end of that tour that they encountered a group of Quakers en route to the 
Bikini Island area to protest nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
"We (began) to realize that they were by no means crackpots," Mrs. Reynolds 
told an interviewer in 1984. "Well, we just got involved." 
</P>
<P>
Because they had announced their plans in advance, the Quakers were prevented 
from entering the nuclear test zone. So the Reynoldses, who were unknown, 
entered instead, and their lives were never the same. 
</P>
<P>
Instant celebrities, the family was taken to Honolulu where, after a 
well-publicized two-year trial, Earle Reynolds was acquitted of all charges. 
They made one more protest voyage together -- a much-heralded but otherwise 
uneventful trip into Soviet testing grounds in 1961. But being on the 
international stage had created domestic stress, family members said, and they 
were divorced in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Reynolds went on to organize two more international "peace tours" -- 
both times by air -- and eventually returned to Hiroshima where she spent the 
next several years working with survivors of the bombing. She founded the World 
Friendship Center, a hospitality center in Hiroshima, and created the 
Hiroshima/Nagasaki Memorial Collection of nuclear memorabilia at Wilmington 
College in southern Ohio near where she was born. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Mrs. Reynolds became the first non-Japanese woman ever to be 
designated as an honorary citizen of Hiroshima. Her experiences on and off the 
sea have been chronicled in several books, among them, "All in the Same Boat" 
which she co-authored with her former husband, and "Forbidden Voyage," which 
Earle Reynolds wrote himself. For the last 10 years, Mrs. Reynolds had lived in 
Long Beach where she worked with Cambodian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
According to family members, death -- of heart failure -- came Sunday in 
Wilmington, Ohio, where she had gone to gather historical material for 
presentation at commemorative ceremonies to be held this summer in Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing she did was help Americans face what happened in Hiroshima," 
said her daughter, Jessica Shaver, who also lives in Long Beach. "I feel 
privileged to have been her daughter." 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled at 11 a.m. Saturday at First Friends Church in 
Long Beach. Two sons also survive.

SHIFTING AIR EXPECTED TO TAKE FROST FROM WEEKEND WEATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two days of dangerously cold temperatures that damaged crops and brought 
snow flurries and bitter winds to the county, a shift in the air pattern today 
will bring slightly warmer weather, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur Shigehara, senior meteorologist for the service, said the weekend 
warming trend, although signaling no heat wave, will bring a respite to local 
avocado and strawberry growers who have been battling frost damage since 
Wednesday. A frost advisory issued Wednesday night will be lifted tonight, 
Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help the homeless, downtown shelters expanded their facilities 
Wednesday and Thursday under a city policy that allows them to add beds when 
temperatures are expected to fall to the 35- to 40-degree range. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency shelters for the homeless were also opened by the county both nights 
at the National Guard armories in Vista and El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
The cold Siberian air mass that blasted San Diego will give way this weekend to 
a gradual westerly shift in the wind, causing temperatures to rise 3 to 5 
degrees, Shigehara said. Temperatures will hover in the low-to-mid 60s in most 
of the county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A storm off the Pacific Northwest will bring partly cloudy skies to San Diego 
through Presidents' Day, Shigehara said. There will be a 30% chance of rain 
Sunday that could extend into Monday morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures at the beaches today will rise to between 55 and 60 degrees before 
leveling off for the weekend, Shigehara said. The ocean water is 58 degrees, 
and the surf is at 3 to 5 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal highs today will range from 57 to 63 and from 60 to 66 through the long 
weekend. Overnight lows along the coast will range from 38 to 46 tonight and 42 
to 52 Saturday and Sunday nights, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Inland daytime temperatures will be similar to those along the coast, but 
overnight lows will hover in the low 30s, Shigehara said. A low of 30 to 40 
degrees is forecast tonight, 35 to 45 on the weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain highs are expected to range from 32 to 38 today, 38 to 43 Saturday 
through Monday. Nights will still be below freezing -- in the low-to-mid 20s -- 
and Sunday's rain could bring snow to the 5,500-foot-level, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Desert temperatures will struggle to rise to 60 degrees today and to between 62 
and 68 on the weekend. Overnight lows will be from 30 to 40 tonight and 34 to 
44 Saturday and Sunday, Shigehara said.

SECOND FREEZING NIGHT HAS GROWERS BURNING MIDNIGHT OIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A numbing freeze returned Thursday night, seriously damaging strawberry crops 
and sentencing growers to a second sleepless night fighting the arctic weather. 
</P>
<P>
Damage from the winter's first serious cold spell began Wednesday night and 
struck from just south of the Orange County line to Otay Mesa, on the 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry growers were hit hardest because the freeze destroyed much of the 
first crop, now being picked. This first crop sells for premium prices because 
it hits the market before berries in other areas are ripe. 
</P>
<P>
The damaged fruit and frozen blossoms signal at least a month's delay before 
another strawberry crop will be ready for market, growers said. By then 
competing berries will be ripe. 
</P>
<P>
The freeze brought low temperatures of 21 in Escondido and 22 in Valley Center. 
National Weather Service forecaster Wilbur Shigehara predicted Thursday that 
overnight temperatures would moderate only a degree or two and that a slight 
warming trend would move into the area today, raising overnight lows tonight 
into the high 20s and low 30s. 
</P>
<P>
"By this time of year, we are usually packed up and out of the fields," 
Escondido grower Ben Hillebrecht said Thursday of the all-night battle with the 
elements. Instead, growers were using every method available to raise the grove 
temperatures above danger levels. 
</P>
<P>
Winds that would have helped move the colder air out of low-lying pockets died 
down around midnight Wednesday as temperatures in the inland valleys dropped to 
near-record lows in the low 20s early Thursday morning. The late freeze caused 
avocado growers to strip their trees of all remaining sellable fruit in advance 
of the cold front, and to use grove heaters, wind machines, irrigation and even 
helicopters to prevent serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
Flower growers received a break because the cold spell hit after their peak 
Valentine's Day season, and few fields of blooms remained. 
</P>
<P>
An entire crop of cauliflower plants, newly transplanted outside from a 
greenhouse, was destroyed at San Clemente Ranch near the Orange County line, 
said Bill Snodgrass, assistant county agricultural commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
At Otay Mesa, near the Mexican border, about 50% of the cucumber crop was 
destroyed by the freeze, Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
In Valley Center, Mike Horwath reported his acreage of rhubarb weathered the 
first night of freezing well, but he worried that added bouts might damage even 
the hardiest plants. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Henry, an Escondido grower, used 500 orchard heaters on his 2,500-acre 
property and supplemented the protection with two helicopters that hovered over 
their groves to circulate the warm air through the trees. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado and citrus growers predict moderate to serious damage to their crops 
and possible damage to the trees, but results won't be known until signs of the 
damage appear in four or five days. 
</P>
<P>
Hillebrecht said Thursday that he found ice crystals in oranges in his 
Escondido grove, an indication of crop damage, but he could not judge the 
extent of the damage for a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
Nurseries are reporting high fuel usage, and outdoor ornamental plant growers 
say it is too early to determine whether serious damage has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Growers hoped cloud cover would move into the area late Thursday to prevent 
continued freezing, but Shigehara said the needed blanket probably will not 
appear until late today or Saturday in advance of a storm front.

</P>

SAFETY: TWO SAN DIEGO CASES HELPED PROMPT THE ELIMINATION OF TEMPORARY 
LICENSES, WHICH WERE GIVEN WITHOUT FINGERPRINTS AND A BACKGROUND CHECK. THE 
APPLICATION PROCESS WILL BECOME MORE STRINGENT JUNE 1.

<P>
The California Highway Patrol, prompted in part by two San Diego incidents, 
announced Thursday that state officials will toughen the application process 
for school bus drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rengstorff, chief of enforcement for the California Highway Patrol, told 
the Assembly Transportation Committee that, as of June 1, the 180-day temporary 
licenses -- given to drivers employed by school districts and private 
contractors -- will no longer be issued. 
</P>
<P>
Two San Diego incidents involving drivers employed by Laidlaw Transit played a 
major role in the decision to make the application process more stringent. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who called the hearing, mentioned a Feb. 2 
accident in which a Laidlaw driver was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving 
after the bus he was operating rear-ended a pickup truck on Balboa Avenue near 
Mission Bay Drive. The other incident occurred in 1987, when driver Victor H. 
Gomez was charged with kidnaping a 5-year-old girl and molesting her in the 
bus. 
</P>
<P>
Under the CHP plan, applicants for a permit to drive school buses will receive 
their licenses only after fingerprint and background checks are completed. Now, 
drivers who pass state tests are given temporary six-month permits before 
checks are made. 
</P>
<P>
Rengstorff said authorities are targeting school bus drivers because "there 
just seems to have been numerous instances where contractor-employed applicants 
have been involved in serious bus incidents," Rengstorff said. 
</P>
<P>
Katz called the hearing to examine the procedures of Laidlaw, other bus 
companies, school districts and state agencies. "There's something seriously 
out of whack" in the system, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
He cited the arrests of two Laidlaw employees accused of driving buses while 
drunk -- one in the San Fernando Valley and the other in San Diego. Laidlaw 
receives about $20 million a year from the Los Angeles Unified School District 
as its largest bus contractor. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Laidlaw driver Harold Keith Lone was arrested in Encino as he 
prepared to pick up students at Lanai Elementary. A breath test showed Lone had 
a blood-alcohol level of 0.27%, more than three times the new legal limit of 
0.08%. Authorities have said that Lone obtained his job by using an alias to 
hide a lengthy record, including five drunk-driving convictions. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Diego accident, the driver was transporting Clairemont High School 
students when he collided with the pickup truck, injuring three people, 
according to the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Katz voiced concern about the other San Diego case involving Gomez. 
According to prosecutors, Gomez kidnaped and molested the girl on April 21, 
1987. He was ordered to stand trial but failed to appear on Jan. 20, 1988, and 
San Diego police say he remains a fugitive. A civil lawsuit filed on behalf of 
the child against Laidlaw is pending. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's hearing, Katz expressed shock that Gomez is still listed as 
having a valid license to drive a school bus. Bill Gengler, a spokesman for the 
Department of Motor Vehicles, confirmed that his agency "had not suspended or 
revoked" Gomez's license because "we had no information from law enforcement or 
other sources that would allow us to act." 
</P>
<P>
But Katz complained about DMV's "business-as-usual approach" in cases like 
Gomez's. He also said that Laidlaw and other private bus contractors "are not 
acknowledging their responsibility to develop a better procedure of screening 
the drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Daley, vice president of operations for Van Nuys-based Laidlaw Transit, 
acknowledged that, when he joined the local operation, "substantial 
improvements were needed." 
</P>
<P>
For example, since Katz's committee held a similar hearing in 1988, Daley said 
that Laidlaw has beefed up checks on applicant references and its training. "We 
feel our procedures have been corrected in a responsive manner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Daley described the latest arrests of drivers as "isolated," but said they 
pointed up the need to improve staff training to detect drug and alcohol abuse 
among drivers. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent future problems, Laidlaw officials asked the committee to adopt 
criminal sanctions against drivers who lie about their background on employment 
applications, including a mandatory six-month jail term and $10,000 fine for 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Laidlaw attorney Eric Freedus denied allegations, in the civil 
suit against Laidlaw, that the company failed to do a background check of 
Gomez. Freedus said the company "requested a certificate" from a law 
enforcement agency, which checked Gomez's background and found nothing that 
would prevent him from working as a bus driver. 
</P>
<P>
Freedus could not recall which law enforcement agency was supposed to have 
checked Gomez's background. 
</P>
<P>
"The report came back negative, clean. . . . An employer has a limited ability 
to do a background check on an individual. If (law enforcement agencies) cannot 
come up with anything in a man's background, how can an employer?" Freedus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He also questioned allegations that the girl was molested by Gomez and said 
there is evidence that the "mother suggested things" to the child. 
</P>
<P>
"Laidlaw's position is that, if this incident occurred, it is very unfortunate 
. . . But there is clearly evidence that words were put into the child's 
mouth," Freedus said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Assembly committee, attorney Irwin M. Zalkin, who is 
representing the child in the civil suit, alleged that the National City and 
Coronado school districts had requested that Laidlaw remove Gomez from routes 
in their districts. Zalkin alleged that students from the two districts 
complained that Gomez was rude, made racial comments and "was sexually 
suggestive to the girls on the bus." 
</P>
<P>
Carla Bruno, spokeswoman for the local Laidlaw office, said she did not know if 
the allegations made by Zalkin are true. 
</P>

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: PANDA COUNTRY'S NEW RESTAURANT TAKES A STAB AT 
GOING FOR THE GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Nelson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's something rather engaging about the shrimp tails that stick up from the 
corners of the shrimp toasts at the new Panda Country in the Golden Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
Since these properly are called Phoenix shrimp toasts (in reference to the 
mythical bird, not the city), it may be supposed that the shrimp tails 
represent cascading tail feathers, or something of that sort. Their practical 
effect is to serve as handles to lift the savory, 
sesame-and-shrimp-paste-coated toasts, detouring, perhaps, for a quick dunk in 
mustard or plum sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The less obvious side of this little refinement, since ordinary shrimp toasts, 
like most foods, do not come equipped with handles, is that it is a refinement. 
Panda Country offers several innovations on its menu and, perhaps more 
importantly, has chosen to present this menu in an atmosphere of some style and 
elegance. The place certainly is a far cry from the neighborhood cafes that, 
just a decade ago, dished up most of the Chinese food served in San Diego. 
Servers are polished, polite, informed and somewhat formal, and the airy decor 
has more in common with big-city chic than with ethnic identification. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant is the offspring of the Panda Inns of Santee and Clairemont, 
which recently were renamed Panda Country, and is not related to the Panda Inn 
at Horton Plaza. The name change evidently has resolved a certain friction 
between these competitors. The Golden Triangle location is also a definite 
upgrade on this mini-chain's other locations and seems Panda Country's shot at 
the gold. It probably ranks among the top three Chinese houses in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the dishes that qualify the restaurant for this high status appear on 
the specialties page, which also lists some quite inferior offerings. Choosing 
among them can in some ways resemble roulette, although the servers often prove 
reliable guides through the maze. 
</P>
<P>
The dish that seems most specifically Panda Country's own (memory does not 
recall its presence elsewhere) is the "house special duck." This relatively 
elaborate presentation requires that a duck be roasted, then boned and cut in 
squares; these pieces in turn are stuffed with ground shrimp, then crisped in 
deep fat and coated with a savory and somewhat pungent sauce. This is a very 
successful way to serve duck, not only for the pleasant flavors but also 
because it is essentially greaseless, a rare comment about this bird. 
</P>
<P>
The menu offers shrimp, beef and chicken in similar presentations, with the 
exception that none is stuffed. The sauce used for these dishes also is spicier 
and more sharply defined, and it works especially well with the shrimp, which 
are thoroughly delicious. The trick of batter-frying the foods until crisp, 
then sauteing them in the sauce, gives each a mellow, special character. 
</P>
<P>
Another dish that appears on the specials list, the minced chicken, is in fact 
served everywhere, but this restaurant turns out a notably delicate version of 
what the servers here (and nearly everywhere in San Diego) rather proudly call 
a "Chinese burrito." At the table, the server piles this blend of finely minced 
chicken breast, black mushrooms and vegetables into lettuce leaves spread with 
hoisin sauce, which the diners then roll into bundles and eat rather quickly 
(speed is important, since the lettuce leaves like to split and dump their 
cargo down shirt fronts). The contrast between hot, soft filling and cold, 
crisp lettuce cleverly extends a dish that, served without lettuce, would still 
be excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Among other specialties, there is a choice of shrimp or scallops yum nam, to 
which the key is a saute with green onions and a final garnish of ham. The 
chicken with celery turns out to be a typical Cantonese mix of chicken breast 
and vegetables, among which celery does not seem to predominate; it is mild but 
well done, and a good balance to any spicy dish that may also have been 
ordered. Among the spicy dishes is sha dee beef, an inelegant and disappointing 
stir-fry of shredded beef with onions and peppers. Neither the meat nor the 
vegetables had much to recommend them, and none seemed the least bit happy in 
the others' company. 
</P>
<P>
The menu denotes quite a few dishes as "hot and spicy," but, as has become a 
common problem in Oriental restaurants today, it does not consistently follow 
through. For example, the imperial shrimp, though so noted, were simply shrimp 
in a tomato sauce that had much in common with American chili sauce -- there 
was barely a trace of heat. When this was mentioned to the waiter, he responded 
that, if one wants a dish spicy, one must speak up. "Not everybody likes it 
hot; you have to tell us," he said. Still, it hardly seems that the customer 
need specify that he wishes a dish to be served in the manner promised by the 
menu. 
</P>
<P>
Like most Chinese menus, this one runs on nearly forever and covers much 
familiar ground, usually with competence. Especially likable are the chicken 
dishes, mostly variations on the diced breast meat, mild white sauce, garnish 
theme (garnishes include broccoli, cashews, almonds, mushrooms, pea pods and 
all the other usual suspects). What recommends these dishes is the simple skill 
of their preparation, since the meat seems uniformly succulent and well-allied 
to its sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer list includes the increasingly popular steamed dumplings, which 
have become fairly standard but are quite well done here. An unusual variant 
upon the everlasting egg roll is called, quite amusingly, "Goldfinger," and 
consists of rolls stuffed only with small shrimp and diced bananas. These taste 
much better than they sound, and are, in fact, quite good. 
</P>
<P>
The star of the starter list, however, would have to be the "five spice" pork 
spareribs, which the kitchen just slightly undercooks so that they remain 
wonderfully juicy. The heavy, pungent "five spice" coating gives a crisp finish 
and a fine flavor that, for whatever reason and as unlikely as it may sound, 
makes the ribs taste somewhat like the best fried chicken.

UNSTABLE CLIFFS MAY KEEP HIGHWAY CLOSED; 
</P>
<P>
LANDSLIDE: A COASTAL COMMISSION GEOLOGIST MAY DECIDE THAT EXCAVATING FARTHER 
BACK INTO THE BLUFFS IS NECESSARY FOR A SAFER SLOPE.

<P>
Crumbling bluffs over El Camino Real, where an endangered plant species was 
removed to a safer location last weekend, might cause the highway to be closed 
for months rather than weeks, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although emergency repairs may be finished in two to three weeks, a state 
Coastal Commission geologist will decide Friday whether more permanent work is 
needed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"With the danger of falling rock from the excavation," City Engineer William 
Cameron said, "we would have to keep the whole road closed." 
</P>
<P>
The highway from Avenida Pico to Camino Capistrano was shut down a week ago 
when city workers clearing a small landslide after last week's rains noticed 
deep chasms, some as wide as six feet, cutting into the 50-foot cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials originally predicted that El Camino Real would be 
reopened in a few days, geologists determined over the weekend that simply 
pulling down the precariously balanced sheets of rock and earth would be a 
"Band-Aid" solution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a two-phase project," said Bill Brasher, project manager for the Lusk 
Co., a development firm which owns the 250-acre site beside the highway. 
Repairing the immediate danger would make the cliffs safe for up to three 
years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But geologists hired by the city and the Lusk Co. agree that a second phase of 
repair is needed, Brasher said. That repair would consist of contractors 
excavating farther back into the cliffs to provide a safer, less severe slope. 
</P>
<P>
Although he declined to estimate how long a second phase would take, the Lusk 
spokesman said it would be longer than the two to three weeks predicted for 
emergency repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Any extensive cutting into the cliff face would require the permission of the 
Coastal Commission. A geologist from the state agency will inspect the 
ridgeline on Friday, Brasher said. 
</P>
<P>
"He will be the key to how we can go with this," Brasher added. 
</P>
<P>
The Lusk Co. overcame another potential delay last weekend when it arranged to 
transplant from the cliffs a plant which is on the state's endangered species 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Known as Dudleya blochmanae, the tiny succulent grows only on cliff tops, where 
it remains buried and dormant until a steady rain, said Mike Evans, co-owner of 
the Tree of Life nursery in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
About 18 flats containing thousands of the small green plants were transported 
to the nursery on Saturday, Brasher said. 
</P>
<P>
Resembling a miniature ice plant, the succulent was a subject of controversy 
during discussions over failed plans to build a Richard M. Nixon library on the 
250-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente has suffered from a series of landslides over the past 16 years, 
including a rock fall in 1979 which closed a section of Coast Highway for 
several months. FRANK MESSINA

BASEBALL: VINCENT PESSIMISTIC ABOUT QUICK SETTLEMENT. ARBITRATION REMAINS A 
PRIMARY STUMBLING BLOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With revenue sharing no longer the pivotal factor, baseball's collective 
bargaining talks focused Thursday on arbitration, long a thorn in the owners' 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about a number of important issues, but arbitration is, as it has 
been in all the previous negotiations, a major stumbling block," said Don Fehr, 
executive director of the Major League Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A five-hour meeting in Commissioner Fay Vincent's New York office touched on 
several other traditional areas but boiled down to a discussion of arbitration 
and pensions, according to Fehr. 
</P>
<P>
Was there progress? 
</P>
<P>
Not according to Vincent, who said he was "extremely pessimistic" regarding a 
quick settlement. "We're talking, but we're not making much progress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles O'Connor, general counsel of the owners' Player Relations Committee, 
said he would measure Thursday's results in inches rather than miles. 
</P>
<P>
And Fehr agreed, saying: "I wouldn't categorize it as immeasurable, affirmative 
progress, but I wouldn't say there wasn't any. I think we'll know more 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday marked Day 1 of the owners' spring training lockout, and O'Connor 
reiterated that the camps will not open without a bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The union and the PRC had met separately Wednesday to review Vincent's 
nine-point proposal, which the union later called regressive because of a 75% 
restriction on arbitration raises, a series of minimum salaries for younger 
players that the union believes would become the standard wage for all players 
in those categories, and the lack of an increase in the owners' pension 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
The nine points formed the basis of Thursday's negotiations. Was there an 
agreement on any of the points? "We consider it a package," O'Connor said. 
"When we resolve them, we'll resolve them all." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but it is unlikely that any agreement will include arbitration or 
salary restrictions that the union has fought in previous negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how we feel about caps," said Mark Belanger, a Fehr assistant. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of the cost certainty that the PRC believed was inherent in revenue 
sharing, a 75% limit on arbitration raises would provide considerable club 
savings at a time when many arbitration filings are producing salary increases 
of 300%. 
</P>
<P>
The union, in fact, is asking that the eligibility requirement for arbitration 
be rolled back from three years of major league service to two, as it was 
before the 1985 negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, as a concession to the owners' claim of financial distress, the 
union agreed to raise the eligibility requirement by a year. Now, insisting 
that baseball has never been healthier, Fehr believes he should get that year 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fair to say that most of our discussion today focused on the eligibility 
issue and the question of players who were eligible before but aren't under the 
current plan," he said. "We accepted their claims of poverty in '85, but they 
can't sell it to us now." 
</P>
<P>
Arbitration would have been eliminated by revenue sharing and replaced by a 
pay-for-performance system, which also included a payroll cap that put 
restrictions on free-agent mobility. Now all of that is off the board. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue sharing, O'Connor said, is an issue only in the context that the PRC 
seeks a joint study leading to the possibility of eventual implementation. 
</P>
<P>
Of its removal after seven weeks of impasse, O'Connor said, "We have an 
immediate need to reach an agreement, and that need overrides adherence to any 
particular method of getting there." 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that within 10 years all sports will employ some variant of 
revenue sharing and said the problem the PRC faced in attempting to implement 
it now was one of education -- attempting to convince the union and "some of 
the clubs" that the timing was right. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, the union and the PRC are left to discuss more traditional issues 
"laden with a negotiating history" that may make modifications difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser, one of seven players who attended Thursday's 
meeting, said by phone: "There are still times when I think the owners want an 
agreement that will help protect them from themselves, but at least we're 
talking cordially, and I'm glad to have Fay involved because he strikes me as 
an honest man. And as Don (Fehr) says, without revenue sharing we're back in 
the same ocean."

BOEHEIM SHUFFLING, BUT HE HAS THE CARDS 
</P>

<P>
They've been up -- ranked No. 1 -- and they've been down -- four Big East 
Conference losses -- but at Syracuse, there continues to be a lot of hope that 
the best is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen are 18-4, ranked No. 5 and have the appearance of a potential 
Final Four team, which is about as good as anybody can look right now, 
according to Coach Jim Boeheim. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had to pick four teams to go to the Final Four, I don't think anybody 
could pick even one," he said. "It's almost impossible. Everybody is just 
capable of getting beaten, is what it boils down to. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just a lot of good teams. There are no great teams. Missouri and 
Kansas are real good, but you're not afraid to play them. You just don't see 
anybody out there who scares you, but you also don't see anybody out there you 
don't think can't beat you." 
</P>
<P>
Next up for Syracuse is a Saturday game in the Carrier Dome against Notre Dame, 
a 13-8 team that provides the Orangemen with a break between killer Big East 
games. So far, Connecticut and Georgetown are 8-3 and a half-game ahead of 
Syracuse (8-4) in the conference standings. 
</P>
<P>
Said Boeheim: "Looks like a normal season to me." 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen have been anything but normal. A preseason choice along with 
Georgetown to dominate the Big East, Syracuse has not done that. Instead, 
Boeheim has shuffled his lineup to find something that works. 
</P>
<P>
Former Kentucky player LeRon Ellis began the season at center, then went to the 
bench, then moved back into the starting lineup at small forward. Derrick 
Coleman moved from power forward to center. Billy Owens moved from shooting 
guard to power forward. Stevie Thompson moved from point guard to shooting 
guard. Freshman Michael Edwards left the bench and became the starting point 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
Boeheim said Ellis must improve for Syracuse to go very far in the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"He just hasn't really gotten comfortable," Boeheim said. "He's been in a lot 
of foul trouble. I see signs of him getting going, though. He would make a big 
difference in our team if he would be able to step up his production." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is a 5-foot-11 freshman from Eastern Regional High in Voorhees, N.J., 
and has a lot to learn, according to Boeheim. 
</P>
<P>
"He has really helped the team, though," the coach said. "We had to play 
Edwards just to get someone to push it up the court. Stevie has done a good job 
at (shooting guard). He's more effective scoring there. And his defense has 
been great. He's been having a great year. 
</P>
<P>
"But the key to our team is the front court, really. Owens and Coleman are 
playing extremely well, and if we can get Ellis going a little better, then I 
think we can be a better team. Right now, we're not there, but we could be." 
</P>
<P>
Pauley want a cracker?: Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps said he thought Pauley 
Pavilion could have helped UCLA if it had placed bleachers close to the 
baseline to give the place the ambience of a small, so-called crackerbox gym. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps has many memories of Pauley Pavilion, which is celebrating its 25th year 
in season-long ceremonies. It was the Irish who ended UCLA's 115-game 
nonconference winning streak at Pauley in 1976, but Phelps cannot forget his 
impressions of Pauley the first time he walked inside. 
</P>
<P>
"My first memory was not a good memory," Phelps said. "We lost by 58. That was 
in 1971. We were horrible, we were 6-20 before the year was over. We lost to 
Indiana by 65. That was my first time to see (Pauley), and we got blitzed." 
</P>
<P>
Two years later in South Bend, Ind., the Irish ended UCLA's 88-game winning 
streak. However, Phelps said it is in Pauley that he feels something special. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one of the great arenas in the country," Phelps said. "And of course 
with (John) Wooden winning 10 out of 12 national championships, it would be 
like Yankee Stadium. I mean, Pauley at UCLA is like Yankee Stadium to the 
Yankees in New York. Before the big domed stadiums, the big arenas, Pauley is 
really one of the last great arenas for basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Opposites attract: At the University of Washington, home crowds for the 
nationally ranked Husky women's team average 3,331. Average home attendence for 
the sub-.500 Husky men's basketball team is 3,028. 
</P>
<P>
He's got the point: Kenny Anderson of Georgia Tech may not be the best freshman 
in the country -- Shaquille O'Neal of Louisiana State? -- but he's probably the 
top freshman guard. More than that, Anderson is a point guard, playing perhaps 
the most demanding position in college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-2 Yellow Jacket from Archbishop Malloy High in Rego Park, N.Y., runs the 
show for Coach Bobby Cremins. Anderson is averaging 20.4 points, 8.7 assists, 
5.3 rebounds and his 46 steals lead the team. He has played so well, he is 
already picking up huge compliments without even having finished his first year 
of college ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Kenny Anderson is the best I ever saw at his position coming into college, and 
I've been following basketball since 1940," NBA scouting guru Marty Blake told 
Mark Bradley of the Atlanta Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Coach Hugh Durham: "He's the most complete backcourt freshman I've ever 
had the misfortune of going against." 
</P>
<P>
Temple Coach John Chaney: "He's a throwback to the old lead guards . . . 
reminds me of Lenny Wilkens." 
</P>
<P>
The scoring load does not fall on Anderson's shoulders, although it is his 
responsibility to get the ball to shooters Dennis Scott and Brian Oliver. But 
whether the Yellow Jackets go or not depends on Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"A point guard has to be a catalyst," Anderson told Bradley. "He can turn a 
game on and off. He can pick up the pace or turn it way down. In Bob Cousy's 
book -- he sent me an autographed copy -- he wrote: 'A point guard should never 
make a bad decision.' 
</P>
<P>
"But I just want to keep excelling. I want to excel at every level, at high 
school and college and the pros. Guys like Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan 
have done that. I want to, too."

DODGERS GO ABOUT BUSINESS AS USUAL, WITH A FEW NEW TWISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

VERO BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As is the custom for players just before spring training, pitcher Mike Morgan 
stopped by Dodger Stadium last Friday to gather his gloves. 
</P>
<P>
"My snowmobile gloves," Morgan said. "The owners don't want us to play. I'm 
going back to my winter cabin in the mountains." 
</P>
<P>
As usual before spring training, pitcher Ray Searage began studying baseball 
videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
"Tapes of my kids," he said. "The only good thing about the lockout is, it will 
let me see them play Little League baseball for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
And also as usual before spring training, catcher Rick Dempsey is looking 
forward to leaving Dodger Stadium and working out on a new field. 
</P>
<P>
"A high school field," Dempsey said. "All the local guys are invited. A lockout 
won't stop us. We'll just play when the kids are in class." 
</P>
<P>
A lock and chain apparently are nothing to those who feel armed with 
principles. And so the Dodgers, many of whom should be at Dodgertown today for 
the start of 1990 spring training, aren't too worried that they're not. Being 
locked out of training camp by their owners is bothering them a lot less than, 
say, being locked out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, at about the time Dodger pitchers, catchers and previously 
injured players should be stretching and throwing, they will be busy with other 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Tim Belcher will be running down to the corner YMCA at Mt. Vernon, 
Ohio, to renew his six-week membership. 
</P>
<P>
"It expired just when camp was supposed to start," Belcher said. "No big deal. 
Just get another one." 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson will be working in his Detroit-area real estate development office. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got plenty to do," Gibson said. "I'm not going to sit and cry about it." 
</P>
<P>
John Wetteland will be working out at his old high school in Santa Rosa, then 
speaking to one of the classes about something on which he is becoming an 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
"Real life," Wetteland said. "I put on a coat and talk about real life." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's not the end of the world," said Gibson, who can use the extra time 
in recovering from leg surgery. "We'll just wait for the owners to come to 
their senses." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger players' cavalier attitude is based on a question they've spent the 
last few days asking each other on the telephone: Hey, what's a couple of 
weeks? 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows spring training is too long anyway -- just about two weeks too 
long," said Belcher, the team's interim player representative. "We really think 
by that time, they'll have things worked out." 
</P>
<P>
At least one Dodger even said he wouldn't worry if the lockout went longer. 
</P>
<P>
"After a winter of pitching, I need two weeks and I can be ready for the 
regular season," said Wetteland, who pitched in the Dominican Republic. "A lot 
of guys in my situation feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
Between shrugs, the players admitted their concern over a couple of darker 
realities. This spring training, once it begins, will be different from others, 
from the way the players live to the way they practice. 
</P>
<P>
Because most players canceled Vero Beach living arrangements, when the lockout 
ends they might be unable to find condominiums or even hotel rooms within 15 
miles of training camp. For most, this means spending a month or more in the 
Dodgertown hotel-type rooms, where families are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"In a small town like Vero, housing becomes a major problem," said Bill DeLury, 
the team's traveling secretary. "No landlord is going to hold his place for a 
player when, if that player doesn't show up, it could cost that guy $5,000. All 
the places the players usually had could be gone. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of (players) will have to stay on the base, which will be hard for those 
guys who are used to being with their families. But they just won't have a 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lucy Marine, Dodgertown baseball secretary: "We could put them in hotel 
rooms, but they will be filled with fans. You see, the fans don't cancel." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher said that problem could be solved with a simple attitude adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in Dodgertown every year, and it's the most relaxing six weeks of 
my season," he said. "You are 30 steps from the clubhouse, 30 steps from where 
you eat, and nobody can get in at night and bother you. I miss my wife, but 
guys will find out that staying there can be great." 
</P>
<P>
A bigger problem is what happens on the field when training camp finally opens 
and the players must prove they can really prepare for a 180-day season in what 
could be less than a month. Rookies are predicting missed opportunities, while 
veterans talk of needless injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hartley, 28, has spent eight years preparing for this spring. He has 
played for 10 teams in two organizations, and finally, the right-handed pitcher 
believes he is on the verge of winning the last spot in the bullpen. "This is 
not going to be good for me," said Hartley, who allowed one earned run in six 
major league innings last year. He is one of the few locked-out Dodgers whose 
chances could be hurt by inactivity. Others are pitcher Pat Perry and 
outfielder Chris Gwynn, both of whom need to prove that they are physically 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
Lamented Hartley, who had a good winter season in Puerto Rico: "This was going 
to be my most important spring. I was planning on coming in and winning a job. 
If they don't see me, they are going to have to go on hearsay. And my chances 
aren't as good." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Hartley noted, his most important activity during the lockout does not 
involve a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I watch ESPN for news," he said. "And I hope." 
</P>
<P>
Searage, who might be helped by a lockout because he is the leading candidate 
to be the team's left-handed reliever, remembers when his situation wasn't so 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, if spring training was just one week shorter, I wouldn't have made 
the team," Searage said. "People like me, I can see where they would be 
worried." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because of players such as Hartley, most are predicting that the 
delayed workouts will be impassioned. Many translate that to mean somebody 
could get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute everyone gets back, it will be very, very intense," predicted Billy 
Bean, an outfielder who begins Dodgertown workouts today with 63 other 
nonroster players and minor leaguers. "It will be strange. People will have to 
be careful. Nobody will know what is going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey can guess. 
</P>
<P>
"The injury factor will be very big," he said. "This is why players should come 
in very prepared. They should not delay getting their work in during this 
lockout." 
</P>
<P>
But enough about work. Although the players realize they should treat the 
lockout as the unfortunate product of a labor dispute, most are simply looking 
at it as a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm even going to my kids' Little League practices," said Searage, referring 
to his sons, Ray Jr., 9, and Ryan, 7. "And you bet I'm filming everything. Now 
that I've finally got a chance to be a tacky parent, I'm doing it all the way."

EXOTICS START HITTING THOSE HOOKS IN BUNCHES AT SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND 
</P>

<P>
San Clemente Island is providing anglers with the wildest exotics bite of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Substantial numbers of yellowtail were found this past weekend by two L.A. 
Harbor Sportfishing boats, the Outerlimits and the Shogun. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gary Norby, captain of the Outerlimits, "these yellows have been 
here all winter on every trip. We have observed them while fishing for bass and 
rock cod. Now the fish are feeding and with perfect water conditions and a good 
supply of squid we can catch them on a day-to-day basis." 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one were caught over the weekend and another 14 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Freckles Upan of Carson was the top fisherman, catching six. Connie Conklin of 
Long Beach hooked several and lost them. But not giving in to the fighting 
fish, she hooked two more and landed the jackpot with a 21-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
A drastic change was noted inside L.A. Harbor at the Annie B barge. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing at night last Friday and Saturday, 48 anglers were witness to tons of 
anchovies coming up to the barge's lights, followed by schools of Spanish jack. 
</P>
<P>
Barge master Paul Berube called the jacks' appearance unusual. "This is the 
first time we have had these fish invade the barge, either day or night." 
</P>
<P>
Anglers were hooking up with these fighters and bouncing three-to-six-pounders 
onto the deck. 
</P>
<P>
Berube said it's possible these fish moved into the harbor after the oil spill 
off Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Stassi Vellonakis of Redondo Beach returned from an 18-day, long-range trip 
fishing Alijos Rocks in Mexico and caught a 213-pound yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hori of Manhattan Beach returned from a recent trip to Cabo San Lucas, 
where the King Harbor Marlin Club member, using six-pound test line, landed a 
25-pound dorado after a 30-minute fight. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Felipe Burton of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Happyman 
at Venice Beach, caught the whopper of the week, a 32-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Herrera of Hawthorne, fishing aboard the Amigo, won the jackpot with a 
23-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Moe Cohen of Westchester, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at Rocky Point, used 
live squid and caught a 22 1/2-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Fuginami of Gardena, fishing aboard the Shogun at San Clemente Island, 
won the jackpot with a 20-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Tex Lucas of Wilmington, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Southern Cal, 
won the jackpot with a 17-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Local fishing has improved for rockfish and halibut. Catalina 
Island has been good for calico bass and blue perch. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire's anglers sacked 200 sculpin and 
89 sand bass fishing at Venice reef. 
</P>
<P>
The Happyman on a half-day trip to the bay returned with 40 sculpin and 10 
halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O rock cod special fished shallow rock piles and anglers sacked 450 
rock cod and one cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray fished Redondo Canyon and anglers sacked 
612 rock cod and one lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Special on two half-day rock cod trips chalked up 380 rock cod and 
one lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackjack worked Cherry Bank for a catch of 525 rock cod and six lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
At 22nd Street Landing: The Monte Carlo's Catalina rock cod trip resulted in a 
catch of 259 and two lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom fished San Clemente Island and anglers got a variety -- 137 calico 
bass, 69 sheephead, 55 blue perch and one yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
At L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Outerlimits' San Clemente Island trip resulted 
in a catch of 38 yellowtail, 101 calico bass, 35 sheephead and 29 whitefish. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun fished San Clemente Island and anglers sacked 140 calico bass, 90 
sheephead, 22 yellowtail and 18 whitefish. 
</P>
<P>
The Annie B barge had a weekend count of 956 jacksmelt and 135 Spanish jack. 
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach Sportfishing: The Southern Cal worked the horseshoe kelp for 60 
whitefish and 45 rockfish.

IF THE DUNKS WON'T GO PLUNK, HE'LL TRY COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
Terry Nelson's aspirations are probably greater than those of most junior 
college basketball players. Rather than focusing on doing his best at Harbor 
College, a stepping stone in his career, the freshman is preoccupied with 
stardom and slam dunking. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was little," Nelson said, "I thought, 'One day, if I could dunk, most 
of my shots will be dunks.' Now I think dunking is my major asset. I can dunk 
in a half-court game." 
</P>
<P>
He realizes, however, that fancy moves and occasional jams don't guarantee 
success. That's why Nelson, the Seahawks' top scorer and team captain, has a 
backup plan in case his athletic career doesn't take off. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-6, 205-pounder, known as "Smoothe" for his court finesse, is also a 
stand-up comedian. He writes his own jokes; his style, he says, is somewhere 
between Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've watched all of Eddie's movies," Nelson said. "I rewind them and watch 
them over and over again till I know every line." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson works hard at being funny, although succeeding in basketball is his 
immediate priority. The 19-year-old spends four hours a day in the gym and uses 
every spare moment to rehearse witty lines in front of the bathroom mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Nelson performed his comedy routine at a Hollywood restaurant. He 
plans to do it again at the end of the season, although he says it's difficult 
to find a club that books comedians under 21. 
</P>
<P>
"I just write the stuff and I act it out," Nelson said modestly. 
</P>
<P>
Last season he was a sensation among Seahawk players, coaches and the team bus 
driver. Although Nelson wasn't eligible to compete, he joined the Seahawks on a 
January road trip to Barstow College. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor's bus broke down on the way home, stranding coaches and players for 
eight hours in a cold and isolated desert. Nelson used the opportunity to test 
his stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"He really had everybody cracking up," said Harbor Coach Ken Curry. "It was 
hilarious. It helped keep us warm." 
</P>
<P>
One season later, Nelson's serious stuff, his performance on the court, has 
kept the Seahawks hot, with a 21-12 mark (7-4 in league) going into tonight's 
final Southern California Athletic Conference game against Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor, in third place in the seven-member conference, has been assured of a 
playoff berth for the third consecutive season under Curry. The third-year 
coach says this is his best Harbor team and that Nelson, who averages 19 points 
and nine rebounds a game, is the biggest reason. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got incredible athletic ability," Curry said. "He can run the floor; he 
can play the three (small forward), the four (power forward). He can do so many 
things. He's a superstar and a team leader." 
</P>
<P>
The best part, Curry says, is that fame hasn't gone to Nelson's head. Most 
talented young players, he points out, tend to be cocky and hot-headed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's flamboyant without being arrogant," Curry said. "He does awesome things 
and he says, 'OK, let's go on to the next play.' He gets it done and goes on." 
</P>
<P>
Marymount Coach Jim Masterson says Nelson is undoubtedly one of the league's 
best players. Harbor beat Marymount, 80-78, on Jan. 24 in the first round of 
conference play, and Masterson isn't looking forward to facing Nelson again. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tremendous player," Masterson said. "He jumps well, and he plays good 
inside and outside. His first game back, after his toe injury, was against us, 
and he got 14 points even though he hobbled and played very little." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson sprained his right toe in a game against Barstow on Jan. 10. He leaped 
for a rebound and jammed the toe against the floor when he landed. The injury 
forced him to miss two games and two weeks of practice, but he used the time 
wisely. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a blessing in disguise," Nelson said. "While the team worked out, all I 
could do was shoot free throws. I'd spend two hours a day shooting free throws. 
Before, my (free-throw) percentage was in a slump. It was under 50%. My first 
game back (against Marymount), I went nine for 12 from the line." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson has improved other parts of his game as well. He's had to, in order to 
stay at the top after a one-year absence from competitive basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson sat out last season because he transferred to Harbor from Cal State 
Fullerton. He also would have skipped a year had he stayed at the Big West 
college because, under Proposition 48, he was academically ineligible to play 
out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
Despite poor grades, Fullerton signed Nelson on Nov. 11, 1987, the first 
official sign-up day for high school basketball players. Cal State Long Beach, 
the University of Hawaii and the University of Nevada, Reno, also tried 
recruiting him after a successful career at Long Beach Poly High. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson was also a high jumper and football player at Poly, but basketball was 
his specialty. He played three years on the varsity and averaged 17 points and 
10 rebounds as a senior, despite a broken ankle that kept him out for almost 
half the season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was the first school he visited. He committed early because he liked 
former Coach George McQuarn. But McQuarn resigned in November, 1988, and a 
dissatisfied Nelson left after his first semester. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like the change," he said. "I didn't like the new coach and his 
plans." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson enrolled at Harbor last spring because he knew Curry from a summer 
basketball league. Curry also recruited Nelson out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried really hard," Curry said, "and I thought I was going to get him 
because he didn't have the grades to play anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson says that's changed. If all goes well, he'll play at a Division I school 
next year. He says his grades have improved and he's on schedule to receive a 
two-year degree by the end of this summer. 
</P>
<P>
On the court, "it's taken me 30 games to finally do my stuff and to really get 
in shape," Nelson said. "It's finally coming together, and it hasn't been 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
Many coaches say Nelson is ready to play in the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. -- no surprise since his athletic ability has never been questioned. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely a Division I player," said Trade Tech Coach Oliver Jones, "and 
I think he can make the move after only one year at a junior college. I'm very 
impressed with him. I think we (league coaches) all are." 
</P>
<P>
So far, New Mexico State, Cal State Long Beach and St. Mary's have shown 
interest in Nelson. So far, he doesn't have a preference. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to win the state title and be the MVP of the tournament so I can 
get some recognition," he said in a serious tone. 
</P>
<P>
Not a far-fetched goal for a guy who considers himself a mini-Magic Johnson, 
even though he's not conceited.

LOYOLA'S GATHERS CRIES FOUL OVER FOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ

<TEXT>
<P>
An amusing sidelight to Loyola Marymount's basketball game at the University of 
San Francisco last weekend came when Lions star Hank Gathers accused USF and 
Coach Jim Brovelli of intentionally trying to injure him. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the game, Gathers took an elbow to the face. Even though a foul was 
called, Gathers was so incensed he had trouble calming down, barking at the 
referees that the foul was intentional and accusing one referee of allowing the 
USF players to use dirty tactics. Coach Paul Westhead had to remove Gathers 
from the game to let him regain his composure. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Gathers said it was the most physical game he had ever played 
in, and accused Brovelli of sending waves of less-talented players at him to 
try to injure him. "I'm a player with NBA possibilities, and they're messing 
with my future," Gathers, who plays center, said after the game. Gathers had a 
sub-par performance, with no rebounds in the first half and only three in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The three players who primarily covered Gathers -- James Bell, John Glavan and 
Jeff Green -- combined for 10 fouls in 34 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The curious thing was that the game didn't look more physical than normal to 
observers, and the muscular Gathers is the West Coast Conference's most 
dominant physical player, the self-proclaimed "strongest man in America." 
Neither Westhead nor Brovelli thought play was unduly physical, and Brovelli 
laughingly noted that Gathers is the most physical player in the conference and 
should be able to take some of what he dishes out. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, players such as Louisiana State's Shaquille O'Neal and Stanley 
Roberts and Xavier's Tyrone Hill and Derek Strong presented more physical front 
lines than USF -- but in Gathers' view, they didn't cross the line into dirty 
play or go out of their way to hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
The kicker: These teams could meet again in early March in the WCC Tournament. 
Don King may want to be on hand for that one. 
</P>
<P>
Milestones: Hank Gathers was presented the game ball early in Wednesday's 
contest against Pepperdine when he broke the West Coast Conference record for 
scoring in conference games. He had entered the night tied with USF's Bill 
Cartwright at 1,065 points. Gathers now has 1,094 points in WCC games -- in 
three seasons, whereas Cartwright played four -- and has 2,599 points in his 
career, good for 17th place on the all-time NCAA list. He needs seven points to 
move past Joe Dumars and 30 to pass Michael Brooks into 15th place. 
</P>
<P>
With his season-high 40 points Wednesday (he scored 42 last season against 
DePaul), Jeff Fryer moved past Jim Haderlein into fourth place on the Loyola 
career scoring list with 1,735 points. Next on the list is Keith Smith at 
1,980. Fryer is averaging 30.7 points in the last three games and shooting 63% 
from three-point range, hitting 17 of 27 triples in that stretch. He also had 
seven rebounds Wednesday, five of them on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Kimble, who continues to lead the country in scoring, averaging 35.7 points, 
now has 2,076 points in his career and 857 points this season. If he maintains 
a scoring pace of about 30 points per game, he would join Gathers as the 13th 
collegian in NCAA history to score 1,000 points in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Lions Coach Paul Westhead's next victory will be his 100th at Loyola. In his 
fifth season, Westhead is 99-46 and has recorded three straight 20-win seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Dee-fense: As of Jan 2, the Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball team was 
allowing more than 70 points per game, something a Dave Yanai-coached team has 
never done. Since then, the Toros have given up only 60.7 points per game. And 
in 10 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. games, the Toros are No. 1 in 
defense, allowing 61 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: Loyola Marymount has raised its season scoring average to 
125.1 points, a pace that would break its own year-old NCAA record (112.5) by 
more than 12 points. Loyola could average 50 points the rest of the way and 
still break the record by more than a point. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: 
</P>
<P>
Loyola sophomore forward Nicole Taylor scored a career-high 22 points Tuesday 
in a 75-64 victory over Pepperdine. She hit nine of 16 shots, all four free 
throws and added seven rebounds. . . . In a victory over Cal State Northridge, 
Dominguez Hills center Khyra Anderson got 15 rebounds and two blocked shots. 
The next night the Lady Toros defeated Cal State Los Angeles, hitting a 
season-high seven three-pointers. . . . The Dominguez Hills golf team, ranked 
20th in Division II, ran its dual record to 3-1 with a victory over Loyola 
Marymount on Monday. The Toros defeated UC San Diego, 380-381, last weekend 
with Jeff Manare carding a 73. . . . The 15th-ranked Loyola men's volleyball 
team, which has been off since Feb. 7, returns to action Sunday at Stanford. 
The Lions are 1-5. . . . Dan Melendez, South Bay high school baseball player of 
the year at St. Bernard last spring, is off to a fast start at Pepperdine. 
Going into this weekend's series at Loyola, the freshman ranks among the West 
Coast Conference's leading hitters, batting .444 with two doubles, two homers 
and eight runs batted in after eight games. . . . Former Aviation and Redondo 
High and El Camino College basketball star Roland H'Orvath is serving as 
graduate assistant coach at Santa Clara, where he played for two seasons.

<P>
GRANADA HILLS' JOHNSON KEEN TO WEAR GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Johnson, the Granada Hills High boys' basketball coach and a counselor at 
the school, sports a distinguished head of gray hair. He rarely loses his cool 
with players. His sideline deportment would earn an A grade. 
</P>
<P>
What, then, would prompt this normally conservative, levelheaded 55-year-old to 
deck himself in school colors before each game? Consider the garb: Bright green 
socks. Lime green belt. Green pinstripes on his button-down shirt. Any more 
green and the guy would look like a 6-foot leprechaun or Kermit the Frog. 
</P>
<P>
"School spirit, I guess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hmmm. But it might run deeper than that. Some observers suspect that Johnson 
has worn the same outfit to every game recently. After all, before their loss 
to Cleveland last week, the Highlanders had won eight games in a row. And it's 
awfully tough to hide the coffee stain on the shirt . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It probably seems like I wear it every game, but it's not a superstition 
thing," Johnson said, grinning. "I only wear it for the tough ones." 
</P>
<P>
That does not eliminate many, Bob. Last Friday, Granada Hills lost to 
Cleveland. On Wednesday, the Highlanders rallied from a 10-point deficit to 
beat Taft. The week before, Granada Hills trailed by as many as 14 points in a 
win over Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the streak is over, it will be clear whether it's superstition tonight 
when Granada Hills opens the City Section 4-A Division playoffs at home against 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Raider of the last arc: Brandon Martin is Cleveland's stealth bomber. While 
fans are more familiar with players such as Eddie Hill or Bobby McRae, Martin, 
only a sophomore, has more than held his own as a starting forward. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, averaging 12.8 points a game, is second on the team in scoring only to 
Washington State-bound Hill (15.2). Yet if Martin continues to play as he has 
recently -- he made a critical three-point basket in the closing moments of a 
60-59 win over Taft on Feb. 1 and scored a team-high 20 points against Granada 
Hills last Friday -- he will be a secret no longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Who was that guy on the Raiders -- it was Lester Hayes or somebody -- that 
they called the 'Quiet Assassin?' " Cleveland Coach Marc Paez said, confusing 
Hayes with former Oakland defensive back Jack Tatum. "Anyway, Martin's our 
Quiet Assassin, an efficient player. There's not much flash. He doesn't waste 
any moves." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, of course, was nicknamed The Judge. The verdict on Martin? 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very hard worker," Hill said. "He's been asked to be a consistent 
player in our starting lineup, to play well each night. That's a lot to ask 
from a sophomore, and he's come through." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Kennedy guard Garret Anderson (23.3 points a game), Granada Hills 
guard Jermoine Brantley (20.1) and San Fernando forward Russell Baldwin (17.4) 
lead their respective teams in scoring. Each is the best player on his 
playoff-bound team and each is a senior. What else do these North Valley League 
standouts have in common? (Answer below). 
</P>
<P>
Teed off: Last month Taft Coach Jim Woodard had to endure a 77-45 whipping 
administered to his team by Cleveland. That was bad enough. But at halftime, 
with his team in arrears to the tune of 48-11, his dignity really took a 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
"At halftime, the guy who does the announcing and keeps their book came up to 
me and asked if I wanted to play in their golf tournament," Woodard said, 
referring to the recent Bret Saberhagen fund-raiser at Knollwood Golf Course. 
"I asked him what it was for. He said it was a benefit for Cleveland athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"We're down, 48-11, and they ask me to play in a Cleveland fund-raiser? I said, 
'Uh, I think I'll pass.' " 
</P>
<P>
As good as new: Greg Tan of San Fernando High suffered a fractured leg at the 
beginning of the wrestling season in December in the Rosemead Invitational, but 
the senior has returned and has won four consecutive matches in Valley League 
competition in the 154-pound division. 
</P>
<P>
Tan will compete in the league finals Saturday at El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Each is left-handed. 
</P>

TOROS HIT THE ROAD LOOKING FOR BERTH IN CCAA TOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball team faces a road trip this 
weekend that could determine whether it will win a berth in the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. post-season tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros (5-5 in conference play and 9-14 overall) play at first-place 
Bakersfield (8-2, 20-3) tonight at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Then they visit Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (5-5, 15-8) on Saturday night at 8:05. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield is ranked No. 14 in the country. Cal Poly and Dominguez Hills are 
among four teams tied for third place in the CCAA, behind Bakersfield and UC 
Riverside (7-3, 17-6). 
</P>
<P>
Only four teams will advance to the conference tournament. A victory at San 
Luis Obispo would give the Toros a tie-breaker advantage because they defeated 
the Mustangs, 58-56, earlier in the season. Also tied for third are Cal State 
Los Angeles (5-5, 12-11), defeated twice this year by the Toros, and Cal State 
Northridge (5-5, 10-13), which beat Dominguez Hills twice. 
</P>
<P>
In women's play, the Lady Toros (3-6, 11-12) can keep their slim post-season 
hopes alive with a victory Saturday night at San Luis Obispo (4-4, 10-12). Game 
time is 5:45.

BOYS' SOCCER ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
HART-BUENA MATCH CALLED AFTER 2-2 TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After playing through four overtime periods and two sets of five-shot, 
penalty-kick shoot-outs, Hart and Buena highs were forced to call their 
Southern Section 3-A Division first-round boys' soccer playoff match at Hart on 
Thursday because of darkness with the score tied, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 1-1, after regulation. Buena scored in the first 10-minute 
extra period, and Hart scored in the second 10-minute overtime. 
</P>
<P>
They followed with two scoreless 10-minute sudden-death periods, then two sets 
of five penalty kicks. After 3 hours 15 minutes, the match was postponed. 
</P>
<P>
In another match: 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos 1, Burbank 0 -- San Marcos scored early in the second half to knock 
visiting Burbank (12-5-6) out of the Southern Section 3-A playoffs.

BRAZILIAN TRACK COACH MAINTAINS LOW PROFILE AND FAST RUNNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luiz de Oliveira, a Brazilian middle-distance coach, has a reputation for 
keeping his runners' times low. Seems he works on his profile in much the same 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
De Oliveira heads a somewhat nomadic group of runners now living in San Diego. 
When he left Brazil in search of greener training grounds in 1981, he 
originally settled in Provo, Utah. That lasted three months. 
</P>
<P>
His next stop was Eugene, Ore. That lasted until last summer, at which time he 
packed up again and moved to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just been doing things quietly since moving here at the beginning of 
June," he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Quietly? Try secretively. De Oliveira, whose success once lured Mary Slaney to 
his stable in Eugene, now works out of a small cubicle in a nondescript, 
two-story office building on the 7300 block of El Cajon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
There are no running ovals next door, no jogging trails nearby, no weight rooms 
in the vicinity; just doughnut shops, video stores and dilapidated motels. 
</P>
<P>
It's no place to train athletes, but for now it will do as a place to set up a 
desk, plug in the computer and track the development of his runners, two of 
whom -- Jose Luiz Barbosa and Ocky Clark -- will run the 1,000 meters in 
tonight's Times/Eagle Games at the Forum in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The humble headquarters belie de Oliveira's reputation as a top-flight coach. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he worked with Mary Slaney for two years through the 1988 Seoul Olympics, 
at which she finished eighth in the 1,500 meters at 4:02.49. But de Oliveira is 
known more for developing Joaquim Cruz into one of the best 800-meter runners 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz speaks of de Oliveira's devotion to his runners. And perhaps it is that 
devotion that keeps de Oliveira from managing a full-fledged club, with it's 
own track and training facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Seems de Oliveira is more concerned with running a club for athletes, whom he 
considers friends, rather than operating it as a business. 
</P>
<P>
He took no money from his runners until 1986, and then did so only at their 
insistence. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1986, I talked to him," Cruz said. "I said, 'Luiz, this is not fair to you. 
We have to give you something. You have a family to support.' We decided to 
give him a percentage of what we get from contracts and from races. But still, 
that is a very small amount." 
</P>
<P>
The money de Oliveira gets from his runners is only a supplement. His main 
income comes from consulting work he does for Adidas. 
</P>
<P>
But he is a coach first. 
</P>
<P>
"He totally enjoys what he is doing," Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
In the world of track and field, de Oliveira is something of a guru. He is to 
middle-distance running what Jenny Craig is to the heavy-set. Those who adopt 
his program shed unwanted seconds from their personal bests. 
</P>
<P>
His athletes swear by his methods. 
</P>
<P>
The results? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Barbosa ran personal bests at 800 meters in three consecutive European 
meets in 1988: a 1:43.59 in Holland, a 1:43.49 in Italy and a 1:43.20 in 
Zurich, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cruz has turned in six of the 12 sub-1:43 800 meters ever run, and his 
1:41.77, the South American record, is just four-hundredths of a second off 
Sebastian Coe's world record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- During last year's indoor season, Clark, who had been training under de 
Oliveira for a little more than a year, set two American indoor records, the 
first in the 1,000 meters (2:18.19, bettering Don Paige's 2:18.88) and the 
second in the 800 meters (1:46.07, bettering Johnny Gray's 1:46.1). Clark's 800 
record stood only a week before Ray Brown showed up in Athens and became the 
first American to run under 1:46 indoors (1:45.85). 
</P>
<P>
Of the records, Clark said: "It had to have been the training with Luiz that 
helped out." 
</P>
<P>
De Oliveira points to his schooling when asked about his success. 
</P>
<P>
"In (Brazil), you don't just become a coach by reading a book," said de 
Oliveira, who earned a teacher's degree in physical education from the 
University of San Carlos in 1973. To earn his degree, de Oliveira took 30 
months of specialized courses in track-and-field training. 
</P>
<P>
While de Oliveira talks of his knowledge of biology and biomechanics, his 
athletes see a strength of a different sort. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing about Luiz," Barbosa said, "is our relationship with 
him. He is friendly, like a dad and son. He's concerned about our health, about 
how we're eating. He's concerned whether we're sleeping good." 
</P>
<P>
Cruz traces that concern to a time when he was a 12-year-old basketball player 
and de Oliveira was the team's coach. 
</P>
<P>
De Oliveira then encouraged all children to focus on more than one sport. For 
Cruz, basketball, not track, was his love. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knew that I hated (running)," Cruz said. "At the time I was just a 
kid, and I was having a lot of fun playing basketball. I saw the kids who were 
in track practicing, and I thought, 'These kids are not having fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Cruz was not having fun, too. De Oliveira, following his multiple-sport 
philosophy, more or less forced Cruz to compete in a San Paulo track meet. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz won the 1,500 meters with a time of 4:19.1 and, much to his chagrin, 
earned a berth in the national meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember I stayed away from basketball practice for a week because I wanted 
Luiz to forget about the idea of me ever running again," Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't work. When Cruz showed up to practice on the following Monday, de 
Oliveira told him, "If you were my kid, you would have been spanked by now." 
</P>
<P>
And de Oliveira got his way. Cruz said he ran in the national meet and finished 
third at 4:02.9. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Cruz ran against his will. But in 1981, he embraced the 
sport and set a junior world record in the 800 meters at 1:44.3. 
</P>
<P>
De Oliveira still takes an active interest in his athletes' lives. He forces 
them to consider where their lives are heading after their track careers end. 
</P>
<P>
He has encouraged Cruz to finish work on his teaching degree in physical 
education at Point Loma Nazarene College. Barbosa is studying journalism at San 
Diego City College, and Clark is taking classes at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"He's concerned with us getting a good education and tells us this, running, is 
a fantasy we only have for a little while. 
</P>
<P>
"And he's concerned with our personality as well. He says first you are a human 
being and second you are an athlete." 
</P>
<P>
And now De Oliveira is thinking about raising his profile in San Diego. He 
figures a good way to deal with drug addiction among youths is to get to them 
before they get to drugs. And maybe, he says, he and his world-class runners 
can encourage some to try track and field instead. 
</P>
<P>
His plan is take his troupe on a tour of local high schools to give clinics. 
But he lacks the funding to set up such a program and is currently looking for 
a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, de Oliveira says, is that many kids find running a bore. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think we can make it fun, you know?"

A HIGH PRICE JUST TO BE DISAPPOINTED

<P>
Il Gazebo in Glendale is the ambitious new offspring of Gennaro's, that popular 
power eatery up the street. 
</P>
<P>
While Gennaro's is like a fancy dining room on a landlocked cruise ship, 
complete with padded walls and a professional crew of former Princess Line 
waiters, Il Gazebo, with its visible kitchen, wood-burning oven and designer 
pizza, tries for a younger, more casual atmosphere complete with a bit of 
time-proven trendiness (if such a thing exists). At Gennaro's, the food is 
old-fashioned Italo-Continental fare, and the clientele is well-heeled. At Il 
Gazebo? Well, as the saying goes, in spite of a California pizza or two, apples 
don't fall far from the tree. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, it's hard to know what to make of this big, well-appointed new lad on 
the block. 
</P>
<P>
Gazebos, or design elements thereof, form a series of semiprivate dining areas 
against the back wall. In the center of the room, a large fountain trickles 
under a skylight. 
</P>
<P>
Flowers are on the walls, the chair seats and on plasticized chintz cloths that 
box each table -- the resemblance of these stiff cloths to oilcloths on a 
picnic table is, I hope, unintentional. Despite its fussy decor, there's 
something spacious and inviting and urban about Il Gazebo. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, Il Gazebo feels more like an old-fashioned fancy dinner house 
catering mostly to an older clientele. Some nights, at the dinner hour, there's 
an accordion player. He performs the most sentimental of old standbys; during 
"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling" there's not a dry eye in the house. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, there aren't many eyes in the house. Part of the reason for the 
low turnout is that Il Gazebo has been open only since October and many who 
might go there have not yet found it. On the other hand, Il Gazebo's food, 
which is on the pricey side, is not yet very good. Except for the designer 
pizza, it's standard old-line Italian fare: mozzarella marinara, red or white 
sauced pasta and veal, veal, veal. 
</P>
<P>
The very best thing we tried is a chicken soup with vermicelli and spinach; 
it's rich and nourishing. Otherwise, there are a lot of expensive 
disappointments. The special salads appear to be made, for the most part, in a 
document shredder. 
</P>
<P>
The Fettucine alla Burina is, according to our waiter, probably a Roman dish, 
since Burinas are female Romans. To us here in Glendale, it appears a gooshy 
dish: overcooked pasta sauced with a near-tasteless mush of tomatoes and 
eggplant and topped with a scoop of cold ricotta straight from the carton. 
</P>
<P>
A Gorgonzola and prosciutto pizza is tasty, but the crust -- too thin, too 
ordinary -- needs some work. 
</P>
<P>
A halibut special is fine, but the portion seems meager. The osso buco is good, 
not great, and comes with a very cheesy risotto and limp vegetables. And so 
forth. A great deal more imagination and plain old-fashioned good cooking could 
do wonders for Il Gazebo. 
</P>
<P>
As with many new restaurants, the large staff is enthusiastic, full of hope 
that this ambitious establishment might take wing and prosper. We're greeted 
cordially, attended to promptly, we even get a wine bucket for our bottle of 
Pellegrino. Despite all the service people and their good intentions, our 
plates, when they came from the kitchen, were never delivered to the person who 
ordered them. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner one night my friend and I wandered around the vast, empty room, 
checked out the semiprivate gazebos -- they looked cozy, pretty, as if one 
could have a good, small party in there. The restaurant's best-kept secret is 
its lovely bar. Step past the counter and you're in a small, enchanting room 
with a real fire, attractive lithographs, comfortable tapestry chairs -- a 
great place for nursing a cognac on a rainy night. 
</P>
<P>
On our way out, we stopped for a moment at the white, scalloped fountain.

CAMPUS CELEBRATES BLACK ARTS;

HISTORY: A MONTHLONG CELEBRATION WILL FEATURE DANCE, DRAMA, SONG ON THE CAL

<P>
Black arts and culture will be celebrated in a number of events planned by the 
Pan African Studies Department at Cal State Northridge and several student 
organizations to commemorate Black Studies Month. 
</P>
<P>
The events include a program called "The Black Star Search," a program 
sponsored from 7 to 9:30 tonight by Delta Sigma Theta, a CSUN black sorority. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinator Lashawn Kindle said the event, fashioned after the popular 
television show "Star Search," will include eight areas of competition: 
spokesman and spokeswoman, male and female vocalist, male and female dancer, 
dramatic reading and rap music performers. 
</P>
<P>
Since this is the second such annual competition, last year's champions will 
compete against this year's challengers. Trophies will be awarded to the 
winners, who will be determined by a panel of judges including actor Bentley 
Evans of "Family Matters." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the talent competition, the show will feature a tribute to black 
celebrities Lena Horne and Leontyne Price. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $4. Part of the proceeds from the event will be donated to the 
Medeba Foundation, which provides scholarships, clothing and food for South 
African children, Kindle said. 
</P>
<P>
In another program at 6 p.m. Sunday, the Pan African Dance Ensemble will 
present "Black Dance Odyssey -- A State of Rhythm," which will feature guest 
performers Yao Marshall, Sarah Abukutsa and Keith Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
The program will show how the elements of African dance have been passed down 
through the ages and been incorporated into a variety of dance forms, said the 
dance ensemble's president, Tish Crawford, who choreographed several numbers in 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
Dances will include the lamba, the najanie, the samba, a modern ballet, a 
contemporary tap dance, a '40s dance hall number and a hip-hop selection danced 
to rap music. 
</P>
<P>
In the lamba, an ancient African healing dance, "The priest and people of the 
village would dance to create energy to help heal the sick person," Crawford 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
The najanie is a traditional African social dance of celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The samba, Crawford said, shows evidence of strong African roots, dating back 
to the time when black slaves were brought to South America. They brought with 
them their rich tradition of dance that became assimilated over time into the 
Afro-Cuban culture, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The modern ballet will be performed to the popular gospel tune "Let Us Break 
Bread Together." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said dance has always been an integral part of black culture and an 
outlet for the expression of blacks' feelings. Within the dances, there is 
evidence of feelings of oppression and death, happiness and hope. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone can understand these feelings," she said. "They come through the 
music, the rhythm and a basic beat. The dances can offer people an education, 
and show how black dances transcend through the decades." 
</P>
<P>
To add to the authenticity of the various dances, Crawford said, Afro-American 
drummers Derf Reklaw and Tony Martin will play the junjun and the djembe, drums 
from West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
All of these dances, she said, exhibit traditional characteristics of African 
dance: strong arm and head movements, lots of hip action and isolated movements 
of the back, stomach, shoulders and rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
The program will include the performance of two songs by popular Kenyan singer 
Abukutsa, who is also responsible for designing most of the costumes in the 
show, many of which are evocative of African culture. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the dance program are $10 for non-students, $5 for students. 
</P>
<P>
Another program of Black History Month will be held from 7 to 11 p.m. Feb. 24, 
when CSUN's chapter of the black fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha presents "Ebony 
Entertainment Night." 
</P>
<P>
Trey Whitaker, chapter president, said the event will be "a showcase for the 
celebration of black culture and talent." 
</P>
<P>
The presentation will open with a fashion show of designs for men and women, 
followed by a performance by student comedian T.W. Williams, who was selected 
by audition. 
</P>
<P>
"Ebony Entertainment Night" will also include monologues and readings of 
dramatic and poetic material with a decidedly black orientation. Also part of 
the evening will be performances by fraternity members Brian Miles, Ryan 
Williams, Phillip Cox and John Dokes, who will sing a cappella contemporary 
gospel music; The Crew, a group specializing in street dancing; Movement X, a 
rap group; and comedian-actor Lewis Dix as master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $13. Proceeds from the show will be donated to a variety of causes, 
Whitaker said, including the United Negro College Fund and Project Alpha, a 
teen-age contraception program aimed at young black males and sponsored by 
Alpha Phi Alpha. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Ebony Entertainment Night' is a positively charged show," Whitaker said. "It 
fits right in with Black History Month -- a time to come together to enjoy each 
other's company, a time to promote consciousness, awareness and unity." 
</P>
<P>
A primary goal of Black History Month is the elevation of self-esteem among 
blacks, James Dennis, associate professor of Pan African Studies, said. 
</P>
<P>
"We remind all our people we do have a lot going for us in all areas of our 
endeavors. This is a time to build on it, perpetuate it and be proud of it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dennis, who advises the university's Pan African Council, said the programs 
can ultimately serve another purpose: "So we can create a better world." 
</P>
<P>
All the Black History Month events will be held at the Northridge Center on 
campus. Tickets are available at the door or by calling the Pan African Studies 
department at (818) 885-3311 or 885-3312.

A TRULY HAUNTING PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Who says Valley theater is dead? 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Art Theater, a relatively new Equity-waiver house in North 
Hollywood, is finding that it can fill enough seats to stay alive -- in a 
building that used to be a funeral parlor. 
</P>
<P>
Plays are staged in what was the family chapel and viewing room. The audience 
sits where grieving relatives once did, which could lead to all sorts of 
comments about the drama being offered on stage. And, until recently, the 
theater company's library smelled faintly of embalming fluid. 
</P>
<P>
"You would think this place would feel very negative," said Ted Haler, the 
theater's artistic director. "But there is a very positive energy to it." 
</P>
<P>
There is also, if you believe Haler and his resident actors, a ghost residing 
on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
Not just any ghost. The ghost of comedian Lou Costello. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard noises. He has turned lights on that were off," Haler said. "When 
he's in the room, the temperature drops 15 degrees. The hair on your arms 
stands up." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a joke," said Darryl Shelly, the company's dramaturge. "It's 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
Dead serious. 
</P>
<P>
Costello was living in Van Nuys before his death in 1959. He was prepared at 
Steen's Mortuary, which several years ago became the Mise en Scene Theater, 
which last year gave way to the Los Angeles Art Theater. It is one of a number 
of small theaters along Magnolia Boulevard, which amounts to North Hollywood's 
version of Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Costello made his ghostly presence known -- in the minds of the company -- 
during a recent play. One of the actresses looked into the audience and saw 
Costello sitting in a previously empty seat. By play's end, he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Just three months ago he reportedly appeared in different form at an acting 
workshop. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting in the audience watching some other actors work," said Shannon 
Hile, a member of the company. "I turned to my left and in the doorway . . . 
God, how do I explain this? . . . it was an oval-shaped apparition and it had a 
green tint to it. You could feel it, an energy type of feel. Then it faded 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Company members, who have just opened a new play, "The Feminists," say they 
have grown accustomed to their poltergeist and his bumps and bangs in the 
night. They list Costello in the play's credits under the title "Special 
Effects." There are no plans for an exorcism. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of scares you when he's around," Hile said, "but it's kind of neat."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OPERATION RESCUE LOSES ROUND IN APPEALS 
COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal appeals court in San Francisco Thursday reinstated an injunction 
prohibiting Operation Rescue, the anti-abortion group, from blockading family 
planning clinics in seven Southern California counties. 
</P>
<P>
An order from U.S. 9th Circuit Court Judges Mary Schroeder and Ferdinand 
Fernandez granted an emergency temporary stay of a Jan. 31 decision by a 
district court judge in Los Angeles which had voided the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
In the Jan. 31 decision, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima dismissed a 
lawsuit by the National Abortion Federation and other pro-choice groups that 
alleged that Operation Rescue's actions violated a woman's right to travel and 
her right to obtain an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Carol Sobel, who represents the 
pro-choice groups, said Thursday's decision meant that the injunction would be 
in effect until the 9th Circuit holds a full hearing on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue lawyer Victor Smith said he felt Thursday's order was "just 
the court of appeals holding things in place in order for Operation Rescue to 
have an opportunity to respond to this crisis motion by the ACLU."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 32 YEARS TO LIFE IN KILLING OF 
YOUTH AT MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gang member who accidentally killed a teen-ager when he opened fire on a 
rival at a mall crowded with Christmas shoppers was sentenced Thursday to 32 
years to life in prison plus a consecutive term of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Darlene E. Schempp gave Roger Leon White, 23, of 
Van Nuys the maximum sentence possible. 
</P>
<P>
He will not be eligible for parole for 27 years, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Shellie Samuels. Authorities described White and his intended victim as gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
A jury on Jan. 4 convicted White of first-degree murder in the Dec. 16, 1988, 
death of Sergio Alpuche, 16, also of Van Nuys, at the Panorama City Mall. 
Alpuche, an "A" student at Birmingham High School with no gang affiliation, was 
shopping for Christmas presents when he was shot.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 PLEAD GUILTY IN SALES OF USED ITEMS TO 
A-PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two brothers who operate businesses in Burbank and North Hollywood pleaded 
guilty Wednesday to felony charges of selling used circuit breakers labeled as 
if they were new to nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos and Isidro Trevino, owners of California Breakers Inc. of North 
Hollywood and ATS Circuit Breakers Inc. of Burbank, admitted to two counts of 
using counterfeit labels to falsely identify the circuit breakers. 
</P>

Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona in February, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Trevinos face terms of up to 10 years in prison each and fines of up to

REQUEST FOR CIGARETTE RESULTS IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One teen-ager was killed and another was wounded in downtown Los Angeles 
Thursday morning when one asked for a cigarette from a passing stranger, who 
police said then pulled a handgun and shot them. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, whose identities were withheld pending notification of relatives, 
were standing on the northeast corner of 5th and San Pedro streets about 9:15 
a.m. when a man walked by, and one of them asked him for a cigarette, Detective 
Tom Brascia said. 
</P>
<P>
The man pulled out a handgun and fired two shots, fatally wounding one youth, 
who was said to be about 18, in the stomach and hitting his 15-year-old 
companion in the leg, police said. The younger victim was taken to County-USC 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The suspected gunman was arrested and booked on suspicion of murder, according 
to police. His identity was not immediately disclosed. The motive for the 
shooting was unknown.

VICTIM OF BURGLARY ACCUSED OF SEX CRIMES; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATIONS: A DOWNEY MAN IS CHARGED WITH CHILD MOLESTATION AFTER A 
VIDEOTAPE STOLEN FROM HIS APARTMENT IS GIVEN TO THE ALLEGED VICTIM'S MOTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Downey man was charged with molesting his 9-year-old neighbor after a burglar 
stole some video equipment from his apartment -- and a homemade, pornographic 
videotape taken in the theft ended up in the hands of the girl's mother. 
</P>
<P>
Ward Allen Rafay, 28, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to nine felony counts of 
committing lewd acts with a child and one felony count of possession of 
marijuana for sale, according to Downey Municipal Court documents. Rafay is 
being held in lieu of $50,000 bail pending a preliminary hearing on March 1, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Dean Shotwell said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rafay was arrested last Saturday after the girl's mother viewed a portion of 
the videotape and called police, said Downey Police Capt. Bob Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The tape allegedly showed Rafay fondling and performing oral sex acts on the 
girl. Rafay and the woman were friends and neighbors at the modest apartment 
complex on Neo Street, police and an apartment manager said. 
</P>
<P>
Rafay told police that his apartment had been broken into about two weeks ago 
and some video equipment had been stolen, Williams said. The tape apparently 
was in the equipment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said detectives are investigating the burglary of Rafay's apartment 
and how the mother obtained the tape. The mother's boyfriend told police that a 
friend of a friend bought a video camera from an unknown man and the tape was 
in it, according to court documents. They recognized the girl and turned it 
over to her mother. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been arrested in the burglary. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who is involved in this we'll talk to," Williams said. "Everyone is 
under investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Police also are investigating whether other neighborhood girls may have been 
molested. Williams said there is no evidence that Rafay was producing child 
pornography for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Apartment manager Sheri Romero said the arrest has monopolized conversation in 
the complex of yellow stucco apartments on Downey's West Side. 
</P>
<P>
Tall and slender at 6-foot-1 and 160 pounds, Rafay had lived in the apartment 
for about five years and did not attract much attention, Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged victim also had been living at the complex with her mother and four 
brothers and sisters for several years. They often visited Rafay. 
</P>
<P>
"The mother and (Rafay) were good friends," Romero said. "They used to go in 
(to Rafay's apartment) all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The alleged victim told police that Rafay paid her to engage in sexual acts and 
to keep quiet, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Police found nine other videotapes when they searched Rafay's apartment, 
according to court documents. Five of them were adult pornography and the rest 
general entertainment. Police also seized about a pound of marijuana, according 
to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
If found guilty on all counts, Rafay would face 25 years in prison, Shotwell 
said.

MCMARTIN TRIAL JUDGE DENIES BIAS, REBUTS DEFENSE ACCUSATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a detailed response to a defense motion to disqualify him from hearing the 
March 9 retrial of McMartin Pre-School molestation defendant Ray Buckey, the 
judge who presided at the record-setting first trial defended his actions on 
the bench and with the media. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William R. Pounders denied any bias and said 
he made public statements only to explain legal issues and to praise the 
jurors' dedication. 
</P>
<P>
In a six-page statement filed last week and made public Thursday, Pounders 
stated: "I am not prejudiced or biased against or in favor of any party to this 
proceeding or their counsel" and proceeded, point by point, to respond to 
defense accusations that he improperly handled the case and inappropriately 
made public statements after the bulk of the verdicts were released last month. 
</P>
<P>
He had been appointed to hear the controversial case after lawyers rejected 
three other judges. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted on 52 counts 
of molestation and conspiracy after a trial that lasted nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner announced he will retry Ray 
Buckey on at least five of the undecided counts with two different prosecutors, 
Deputy Dist. Attys. Joe Martinez and Pamela Ferrero. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Buckey's attorney, Daniel Davis, immediately filed papers seeking to 
prevent Pounders from presiding at the retrial. 
</P>
<P>
In a 64-page declaration, Davis claimed that Pounders is "so lacking in 
appropriate judicial temperament and restraint that he should be removed as 
trial judge in this case." 
</P>
<P>
He said Pounders called him "an ass" during a bench conference, failed to 
compensate him for critical services (including $47,000 for an unauthorized 
"secret" office in which to store documents), and vowed to conclude the trial 
"even if it's over your dead body" -- a comment that Davis says he took as a 
personal threat. 
</P>
<P>
Davis also claimed that Pounders excluded crucial evidence and witnesses, 
denied appointment of a memory expert and repeatedly referred in open court to 
"the crime," the "child victims," and "further offenses," phrases that Davis 
says showed where Pounders stood. 
</P>
<P>
He further criticized Pounders as being "nothing less than a publicity seeker, 
participating in virtually any and all national and local television and radio 
broadcasts relating to this case" while charges were still pending. 
</P>
<P>
On one show, Pounders allegedly explained: "The standard is, it is better that 
10 people go free than one innocent person is convicted. And if you accept 
that, you have to understand that guilty people will be found not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
However, Pounders strongly defended his public appearances after the trial as 
an effort to answer criticism leveled at the judicial system. He said that he 
wanted to provide information that was unknown or had been forgotten over the 
course of the six years the case took and that he felt compelled to support 
"the outstanding service of a jury under siege. 
</P>
<P>
"Few had seen the suffering of the jurors as I had when a trial forecast at one 
to two years took two years and nine months. The public had to be reminded of 
the sacrifices of three special jurors who overcame the death of a spouse, 
major spinal surgery and the bankruptcy of an employer, to serve this 
community. Without these unusual heroics, a mistrial would have been declared. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Pounders said he was so "shocked" by the defense's first monthly expense claim 
of $250,000 (expenses that eventually reached nearly $6 million) that he 
ordered an audit which found that Davis had "grossly exceeded" spending limits 
set by the supervising judge. He said that salaries paid for security guards 
provided Ray Buckey after his release on bail amounted to as much as $37,000 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said further that Davis' claims of being cut off are spurious, 
because the defense used up 70% of the prosecution's 14-month presentation with 
cross-examination of witnesses, and then took twice as long as it had estimated 
to put on its defense, despite limitations imposed by Pounders "because of the 
apparent reluctance of counsel to present a reasonable case." 
</P>
<P>
In an accompanying memorandum filed on Pounders' behalf, County Counsel DeWitt 
W. Clinton and Assistant County Counsel Frederick R. Bennett argued that Davis' 
statement of disqualification is legally insufficient, untimely, ignores a 
judge's duty to take charge and control the pace and cost of lengthy and 
difficult litigation, and should be denied without a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Judge Pounders has served long and well in this difficult case which has 
subjected all who have been connected with it to considerable controversy. The 
case has taken considerable courage as well as skill, and has thrust the judge 
unavoidably into the public eye. . . . He has a duty to complete the task," 
Clinton and Bennett wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting from a 1985 appellate decision, they added that "judicial 
responsibility does not require shirking every time an advocate asserts the 
objective and fair judge appears to be biased." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both sides have agreed on Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff to 
hear the disqualification issue. No date for a hearing, if any, has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Hoff, 49, who was appointed to the bench only last July, is a former Los 
Angeles police captain, civil attorney and Municipal Court judge popular with 
both prosecutors and defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Although the retrial is set to begin next month, it is likely to be delayed by 
this and other pretrial proceedings, such as an expected change of venue 
motion.

UNIVERSITY REFUSES TO ENDORSE GAY GROUP; 
</P>
<P>
CATHOLICISM: LOYOLA MARYMOUNT PRESIDENT SAYS GROUP CAN USE FACILITIES, BUT 
JESUITS CAN'T CONDONE HOMOSEXUAL LIFE STYLE. 
</P>

<P>
The president of Loyola Marymount University declined Thursday to endorse a gay 
student group that sought recognition as an official campus organization, but 
he said the students will be granted access to the campus facilities and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The Jesuit school issued a statement saying that the university "cannot endorse 
or condone . . . a sexually active homosexual life style." However, the 
statement noted that the university community should "support those among us 
who happen to be homosexual." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member group, the Alliance of Gays and Lesbians, sought official 
recognition from President James N. Loughran. As an official campus club, the 
group would have the right to meet on the Westchester campus, to advertise in 
the campus newsletter, and to receive university funding. 
</P>
<P>
Since the group was formed in an off-campus apartment last spring, the issue of 
whether it should be officially recognized has been the subject of a campuswide 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
James Munselle, alliance president, called Loughran's decision "an offer of 
separate but equal." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not asking the university to endorse homosexual activity," Munselle 
said. "The university is unable to make a distinction between sexual 
orientation and sexual activity." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Gloria Allred, who is representing the alliance, called the statement 
"insulting . . . It does not spell out why they should be treated differently. 
It's relegating gays and lesbians on campus to second-class citizenship." 
Allred said she is sending Loughran a letter today asking him to grant the 
group full recognition. 
</P>
<P>
To be recognized as an official campus club, a group must receive the approval 
of the Student Affairs Committee after submitting a list of officers and a 
draft of its constitution. Final approval comes from the president. 
</P>
<P>
Lane Bove, vice president for student affairs, said the alliance would be able 
to meet on campus, but whether they have access to funding and other privileges 
had not yet been decided. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be meeting with James and other members of the alliance and nailing 
those things down as they come up," Bove said. She said the university's 
Student Affairs Committee has formed an ad hoc group of two faculty members, 
two staff members and a student to meet with alliance members. 
</P>
<P>
"The university's point is not to get hung up on the recognition issue but to 
move forward on the issue of recognizing the needs" of homosexual students, 
Bove said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only do we need to be responding to our gay and lesbian students, we need 
to also be addressing the ignorance and fear and prejudice and the homophobic 
attitude among the students," Bove said. "We need to speak to the education 
side of the issue as well."

DEBRIS KICKED UP BY TRUCK BLAMED FOR DEATH ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An object that killed a Harbor Freeway motorist earlier this week and raised 
suspicions that the man had been murdered by a missile tossed from an overpass 
in fact was a piece of debris kicked up by a truck's tires, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a freak accident," Los Angeles Police Detective Erin Browne said 
of the incident that killed 34-year-old John A. Raff as he traveled past the 
Harbor Freeway's 23rd Street overpass early Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Raff, a Los Angeles resident and self-employed glass architect, was southbound 
in his van when a truck traveling in front of him apparently kicked up the 
metal base of a street sign lying in the roadway, propelling the object through 
Raff's windshield, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide investigators initially were assigned to the case because it was 
unclear whether the object that killed Raff had been thrown from the overpass 
or hurled up from the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
However, Browne said, "we found pieces of what resembled a metal disk that is 
the base of (a) stop sign . . . along the freeway" and determined that it was 
responsible for the accident. Officials said that calls from witnesses also 
helped in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Raff, whose van came to rest against a freeway center divider just south of 
Adams Boulevard, died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy, completed Thursday afternoon, concluded that he had died of cranial 
cerebral trauma, according to Bob Dambacher, spokesman for the Los Angeles 
County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli would not comment on the incident, but 
said that the state agency in charge of California's highway system makes a 
concerted effort to keep roadways clear of debris. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of our maintenance program," said Tiritilli, explaining that agency 
employees regularly patrol the freeways, as well as respond to calls from 
motorists and California Highway Patrol officers who have spotted potentially 
hazardous objects on the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an ongoing, constant thing," she said.

IBM STARTS LATE BUT 'VENGEFUL' PUSH INTO WORKSTATION SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Years after faster-charging rivals paved the way, International Business 
Machines Corp. moved with a self-proclaimed "vengeance" Thursday to stake its 
share of the fast-growing technical workstation computer market. 
</P>
<P>
IBM introduced nine new systems claiming to offer the most desktop power for 
the lowest price. The new systems -- arguably IBM's most important product 
rollout since the 1981 launch of its personal computer -- represent the latest 
attempt from the world's largest computer maker to win a large piece of one of 
the most promising segments of the lackluster electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
Now growing at an estimated 30% annually, the $6-billion-a-year workstation 
market had eluded IBM since 1986, when engineers and scientists, the primary 
customers for workstations, shunned its first offering as under-powered and 
over-priced. 
</P>
<P>
IBM said its follow-up system, a family of computers called RISC System 6000, 
is designed to reverse its workstation fortunes -- and quickly. "We're entering 
this market with a vengeance," proclaimed Terry Lautenbach, president of IBM's 
domestic operations. "We are very, very serious about this market." 
</P>
<P>
Workstations, relatively new and highly sophisticated desktop machines, have 
been glaringly absent from IBM's product lineup, prompting criticism from Wall 
Street analysts who questioned how serious the company was about tapping 
emerging technology markets before its competition. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Thursday that while the new systems would have little immediate 
impact on IBM profits, which sagged 35% in 1989, the aggressive introduction 
did signal the company's strong intent to improve its fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new systems won several rave reviews for their price, speed and 
power, analysts and competitors still questioned whether IBM would achieve its 
objectives of stealing market share from such established workstation 
manufacturers as Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment. Those 
rivals all have promised to introduce yet more powerful and competitively 
priced systems over the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Early skepticism centered on how quickly software programs could be introduced 
to operate on the new systems, how qualified IBM's sales force is at working 
with scientists and engineers, and whether IBM would soon have a system costing 
less than the current base price of about $13,000. 
</P>
<P>
Still, International Data Corp., a Boston-area market research firm, estimated 
that the company would ship about 15,000 RISC systems this year, and three 
times that number in 1991. "With such success, IBM could rank in the top four 
among workstation vendors in the 1992-93 time frame," the research firm 
predicted. RISC systems (RISC stands for reduced instruction set computing) can 
process information more quickly than conventional computer systems because 
they have fewer commands to handle. 
</P>
<P>
Shipments of the workstations, which will range in price from about $13,000 to 
$74,000, are scheduled to begin within 90 days. And IBM executives promised 
that at least 175 software programs would be ready for use by that time. The 
number of available programs is expected to increase by hundreds by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
According to industry insiders, IBM spent millions of dollars to entice 
software programmers to write packages that would operate on the new RISC 
systems. In one case, said an executive who requested anonymity, IBM paid $5 
million to the creators of a noted program. IBM executives acknowledged that 
independent software companies had been working for as long as the last year to 
have programs immediately available when the machines hit the market in a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts and competitors said they are still puzzled about how IBM intends 
to position and sell the new systems. Noting that IBM traditionally has enjoyed 
its success among general business customers, one competitor wondered how the 
company would train its sales force to make the sale to more technically 
oriented engineers and scientists. 
</P>
<P>
"These boxes do not sell themselves," said John Hime, vice president of systems 
products at MIPS Computer Systems, a Silicon Valley workstation maker. 
</P>
<P>
Others wondered whether IBM's traditional commercial customers needed the high 
level of power the RISC machines offered, or would they rather have 
lower-priced systems. Some further questioned if the new workstations would 
cannibalize sales of IBM's more expensive IBM AS/400 mid-range computers. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to the intra-IBM product wars!" Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex 
Research, said in a commentary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Workstations are desktop or side-of-desk machines that are much more powerful 
than personal computers. Some even match the power of mainframes. They are used 
widely by scientists and engineers for such processing-intensive tasks as 
three-dimensional computer modeling of new products. The workstation market is 
small but is among the fastest-growing segments of the computer industry. And 
uses for the machines are expanding.

OXY PETE NAMES IRANI EVENTUAL SUCCESSOR TO ARMAND HAMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s board on Thursday unanimously approved the choice 
of President Ray R. Irani to succeed 91-year-old Chairman and Chief Executive 
Armand Hammer, believed to be the first time the board has placed its 
imprimatur on a Hammer successor. 
</P>
<P>
But the vote of confidence in Irani, 55, doesn't signal Hammer's intentions to 
step down soon. The controversial oilman "continues to be in very good health 
and plans to continue to serve as chairman and chief executive officer for the 
indefinite future," the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
With the vote, Irani gains a virtual lock on the top job of the Los 
Angeles-based chemical and oil company, and analysts saw that as a way to 
ensure an orderly transition and to calm a nervous stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Nervous investors typically send Oxy's stock jumping any time Hammer has a 
physical problem, fearing a management gap in the event of his death that would 
leave the company vulnerable to takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Just last November, Oxy's stock jumped $3 per share after Hammer was 
hospitalized for implantation of a pacemaker. It slumped back $2 after Hammer 
appeared to recover. After Thursday's announcement, Occidental's stock closed 
up 87 1/2 cents at $28.25 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The stock's skittishness hasn't been helped by the stream of presumed heirs who 
have passed through Occidental's executive suites. They include former 
presidents A. Robert Abboud and Joseph Baird, who eventually fell out of favor 
and left the company after disagreements with Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
"One always had the question in the back of the mind that the position (of 
president) was a revolving door," said Craig Schwerdt, an analyst with Seidler 
Amdec Securities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Irani's selection did not surprise most observers. As Oxy's chief operating 
officer, he has been running many of Occidental's day-to-day operations anyway 
and has filled in for Hammer at public functions in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Hammer, Irani is characterized as "a motivator" and "politically savvy."

OFFICES RAIDED IN JAPANESE BID-RIG CASE; 
</P>
<P>
ANTITRUST: THE FTC INVESTIGATION CENTERS ON BIDS BY JAPANESE CONTRACTORS AT THE 
U.S. AIR FORCE BASE NEAR TOKYO.

<P>
Japanese antitrust authorities have searched the offices of a group of 
companies -- including a subsidiary of the electronics giant NEC Corp. -- in 
connection with U.S. allegations of bid-rigging on telecommunications contracts 
at an American military base in Japan, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The raid by investigators from the Japan Fair Trade Commission (FTC) at some 20 
locations Wednesday came as criticism mounted, both domestically and from 
abroad, that the agency has been relatively lax in its enforcement activities. 
</P>
<P>
Antitrust regulation is expected to be a prominent issue when U.S. and Japanese 
negotiators meet later this month for the third round of the Structural 
Impediments Initiative talks, which aim to identify structural barriers to free 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC investigation centers on bidding by Japanese contractors at Yokota Air 
Base, the U.S. Air Force installation west of Tokyo that also serves as the 
headquarters for the U.S. Forces in Japan. Eichiro Kokubo, a spokesman for the 
FTC, said investigators seized a number of documents as evidence and will look 
into allegations that NEC Information Technology Ltd. led a dango -- or 
bid-rigging -- cartel at the base. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1988, the FTC levied sanctions against a dango group of 140 Japanese 
companies found to have rigged bids at the U.S. Naval base at Yokosuka, Japan. 
The U.S. Justice Department last year collected about $32 million in damages 
from 99 of those companies, after threatening legal action in U.S. courts. 
</P>
<P>
The new dango case apparently stems from a whistle-blower lawsuit filed in 
federal court in Jacksonville, Fla., by the former chief of the contracts law 
division at Yokota, Arthur Williams. Court records have been sealed at the 
request of the Air Force, according to Electronic Engineering Times, a trade 
publication covering the electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
NEC Information Technology, a wholly owned subsidiary of NEC, is suspected of 
inflating the price of telecommunications maintenance contracts at Yokota by 
restraining competition. Spokesmen for both the parent and subsidiary denied 
any wrongdoing and said the investigation would clear them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no truth to it," said NEC spokesman Kazuya Yoshida. 
</P>
<P>
NEC Information Technology did significantly lower the price of its contract 
bid last spring, however, when the Air Force requested it to submit proposals 
for service using fewer employees, said spokesman Nobuyuki Murakami. 
</P>
<P>
The price cutting -- by about half -- took place at the same time base 
authorities received a competitive bid from an American firm, Honolulu-based 
Hawaiian Telephone Co., but it was "coincidental" and not necessarily in 
response to the competition, Murakami said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill French, the overseas project manager for Hawaiian Telephone, said his 
company had maintained a limited presence in the U.S. military market in Japan 
for the past two decades but launched an aggressive marketing initiative at the 
end of 1987, initially winning two major contracts for optic fiber, microwave 
and digital switching services, mostly on Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. firm quickly found inroads blocked by uncanny competition from 
NEC, he said.

Mild temperatures in January helped push new-home construction up a record 
29.6%, the Commerce Department said Thursday, but analysts warned that talk of 
a boom is premature. 
</P>
<P>
Builders hampered by exceptionally bitter cold in December were able to take 
advantage of unusually warm weather last month to increase starts on both 
single-family homes and apartments after a 6.9% drop in December.

Total starts climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.63 million units 
from 1.25 million in December. 
</P>
<P>
It was the best showing since 1.66 million starts in January, 1989, and far 
exceeded some forecasts. But analysts warned that mild weather, rather than a 
market change, accounted for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
For example, while housing starts rose in all regions, the sharpest increase 
came in the usually frigid Midwest (42.6%).

PACIFIC ENTERPRISES CHANGES VOTING; CANDIDATE BLOCKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Shareholders of Pacific Enterprises voted Thursday to change the way they elect 
directors, virtually dooming any chance a maverick shareholder and union 
representative might have of succeeding in his second run at the board of the 
Los Angeles company, which owns Southern California Gas and Thrifty Corp. 
</P>
<P>
At a special shareholders meeting marked by sharp exchanges, nearly 70% of the 
company's outstanding common and preferred shares were voted to abolish 
cumulative voting, a system under which a small group of stockholders can 
gang-vote their shares for one candidate and greatly improve the chances of 
electing him or her to the board of directors. Nearly 49.2 million shares, or 
89% of the shares that were voted, supported the change. 
</P>
<P>
Union representative Sam Weinstein, who nearly made it to Pacific Enterprises' 
board last year with the help of cumulative voting, said he hasn't given up. 
</P>
<P>
As allowed by a new state law, Pacific Enterprises proposed switching to the 
more conventional system of majority voting, under which the holder of each 
share may vote for one candidate for each of the 15 seats on the board. Under 
cumulative voting, a shareholder could cast all 15 votes for one candidate, 
which Pacific Enterprises argued could result in the election of a director 
representing a special interest group or could make the company more vulnerable 
to a hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you afraid of?" one union member asked Pacific Enterprises Chairman 
James R. Ukropina during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to stop shaking in my boots before I make this comment," Ukropina 
replied. "This is not a matter involving one person," he continued. "Our 
concern is not about a particular party but a particular principle. 
</P>
<P>
"We are afraid that if you have a person in the board room that represents a 
certain group of shareholders," then that person won't represent all 
shareholders as required by law, Ukropina said. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein, who based his 1989 campaign on the contention that Pacific 
Enterprises' diversification had caused the company's stock price to drop, 
accused the board of "insulating itself from shareholder pressures." 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein, Western regional director of the Utility Workers of America union, 
said after Thursday's meeting that he and his supporters are studying ways to 
reinstate cumulative voting so that they can elect a union representative to 
the board. However, Weinstein said he is not sure whether he will run for the 
board again at the company's annual meeting in May.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: SEEKING AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE TAXES MANY A 
FIRM'S INGENUITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Brad Roller, president and founder of Swiger Coil Systems, a Cleveland 
electric motor parts maker, spoke up about the high cost of health insurance 
for his employees, he quickly found himself in charge of a plan to help small 
businesses get affordable coverage. 
</P>
<P>
That was nine years ago. Today, as insurance chairman for the Cleveland Chamber 
of Commerce's Council of Smaller Enterprises, Roller is still fighting that 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
And Cleveland is serving as a model for other communities where small-business 
owners are grappling with the exorbitant costs of providing health insurance to 
their workers. Serious talk of state and federal health-insurance mandates have 
sent a chill through small businesses generally. Many business owners attending 
a small-business retreat in Palm Springs this month said they would be forced 
to lay off workers if they had to provide health insurance for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
The current crisis was precipitated by skyrocketing health-care costs, which 
have been increasing at about 15% a year. As premiums rose and insurance 
companies became more selective in offering coverage, more and more 
small-business owners found themselves squeezed out of the affordable insurance 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Some politicians, especially Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), point to the 
shocking fact that between 31 million and 37 million Americans have no health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The desperate need for affordable health insurance was the major issue tackled 
at the Palm Springs conference, sponsored by National Small Business United, a 
Washington-based grass-roots group of small-business owners. One afternoon, 
representatives from the medical profession, hospitals, small-business 
organizations, government agencies and insurance industry associations grappled 
with the complex challenge of providing affordable coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"The insurance industry knows it can't be business-as-usual anymore," James 
Dorsch, Washington counsel for the Health Insurance Assn. of America, told the 
group. In response to the crisis, he predicted, the 1990s will be the decade 
when insurance companies become "health-care managers instead of just paying 
the bills." 
</P>
<P>
Roller said Cleveland's quest for affordable insurance for small businesses 
began in 1974, when small-business owners organized themselves into a single 
group for coverage purposes and asked Blue Cross, the giant insurance provider, 
to offer them a discount on premiums. Blue Cross agreed to a 10% discount, but 
by 1981 rising premiums were eating away at the discount and Roller was back in 
the fray. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to do something," Roller said. "Cleveland was the fourth most expensive 
city in the U.S. for health care." 
</P>
<P>
Today, 7,000 small and medium-sized companies participate in 14 different 
plans, primarily with Blue Cross but with other insurance providers as well. 
The plans cover 125,000 small-business employees and their dependents, who paid 
$115 million in premiums last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We save our members an incredible amount of money," said Roller, who 
frequently is called upon to explain the program to other small-business 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing in Cleveland could be done by a significant number of small 
companies across the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In California, Gov. George Deukmejian recently jolted business owners by 
outlining a plan that would require all employers to provide some kind of 
health-care coverage to workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone will have to pitch in and give a little to make health care 
affordable and available," the state's insurance commissioner, Roxani 
Gillespie, told the gathering. "Employers will have to provide insurance or 
pick up the costs." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Diamond, director of the American Medical Assn.'s private sector 
outreach, said the AMA is seeking to reduce rates for malpractice insurance 
because the premiums can increase a patient's bill by about 15%. She said 
doctors now tend to order more tests before making a diagnosis because they are 
forced to practice "defensive medicine." 
</P>
<P>
After the session, several business owners said they plan to take the 
initiative in solving the insurance problem before the government steps in. 
</P>
<P>
Business owners are being pressed to seek creative alternatives, including 
self-insurance programs designed to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
One Los Angeles firm founded by a former executive at a major insurance company 
sets up custom-tailored insurance programs for companies with 50 to 500 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We design partially limited, self-funded insurance plans which allow small 
companies to do what the Fortune 500 companies have been doing for years," said 
Robert Turell, founder and chairman of Insurance Design Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Turell said a self-funded plan can save a company between 15% and 20% on its 
insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
It works like this: The company agrees to pay the everyday costs of providing 
health-care services for its employees -- within certain limits. Then it buys 
reinsurance to cover more expensive and catastrophic claims. 
</P>
<P>
"The employee gets the same benefits he had before, but in this way a firm can 
have tailor-made coverage and control the costs," Turell said. He has set up 
about 100 custom insurance plans in the last 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
He said companies also can save on administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike an insurance company, which charges fees based on a percentage of total 
claims paid, a benefits administrator usually charges about $10 a month per 
employee to manage an insurance program. Turell, who has several major law 
firms as clients, said one company with 250 employees saved about $150,000 a 
year by partially self-insuring.

CASTLE &amp; COOKE TO SPIN OFF DOLE FOOD TO SHAREHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. said Thursday that it will spin off to shareholders its 
Dole Food Co., one of the nation's largest food concerns, and become solely a 
real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, due to close in May or June, Dole will become a separate 
publicly traded company. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders will receive one share of Dole for each share of Castle &amp; 
Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
The move was not unexpected since David H. Murdoch, Castle &amp; Cooke's 
chairman and chief executive, announced at the company's annual meeting last 
May that management was considering splitting the company in two. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch said at the time that growth in earnings and assets led to 
consideration of the action. 
</P>
<P>
Castle &amp; Cooke said Thursday that the spinoff will provide a tax-efficient 
method of implementing such a separation. 
</P>
<P>
"By separating into two companies, the management of each will be able to adopt 
strategies and pursue objectives appropriate to its specific business," Murdoch 
said in the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Castle &amp; Cooke will retain its real estate holdings in 
Hawaii, including 98% ownership of the island of Lanai, and developments in 
California and Arizona. It will be headquartered in Honolulu and lease its 
Hawaiian agricultural properties to Dole. 
</P>
<P>
Dole will have headquarters in Los Angeles and Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
The company also reported fourth-quarter earnings of $23.8 million, up from 
$19.4 million for the 1988 fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $700.1 million, up from $588.8 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The improved earnings stemmed primarily from gains in the company's real estate 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
For 1989, earnings were $94.9 million, off from earnings of $112.3 million for 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 earnings included a $17.9-million pretax gain from the sale of the 
company's investment in Amfac Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for all of 1989 was $2.7 billion, up from $2.5 billion for 1988.

NIKE ALLEGES INFRINGEMENT BY L.A. GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nike Inc., the nation's leading producer of athletic shoes, on Thursday filed 
suit against rival shoemaker L.A. Gear, alleging patent and design 
infringements. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, claims that L.A. Gear 
incorporated a patented performance-related feature of Nike's Air Jordan 
basketball shoes into a Gear product called MVP-1. The suit also alleges that 
six other L.A. Gear products infringe on that patent, a design in the sole of 
the Air Jordan shoe. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Nike claims that L.A. Gear has violated other commercial trade 
laws by producing MVP-1, alleging that the shoe too closely resembles the look 
of the the red, white and black Air Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., is seeking unspecified damages and a ban on the 
sale of the Gear products. Air Jordan, promoted by basketball superstar Michael 
Jordan, has accounted for more than $45 million in sales since its introduction 
in September, 1988, said Lindsay Stewart, general counsel at Nike. Air Jordan, 
offered at a suggested retail price of $110, is the top-selling Nike shoe, 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that it (Air Jordan) would be even more successful if it were 
not competing against a product that infringes . . . on our property rights," 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
However, L.A. Gear is unaware of any commercial infringements, said Gil N. 
Schwartzberg, the Los Angeles shoemaker's executive vice president and chief 
administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very careful about this kind of thing," Schwartzberg said. "We have our 
shoes examined by outside designers. We have our shoes reviewed routinely and 
we have been advised that the shoes do not infringe on any rights." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartzberg said the MVP-1, which retails for about $80, was introduced in 
June and accounts for less than 1% of L.A. Gear's sales.

GM, FORD PROFITS PLUMMET IN PERIOD; INCENTIVES CITED 
</P>

<P>
Fourth-quarter profits plunged 50% at General Motors Corp. and 72.9% at Ford 
Motor Co. as the nation's biggest auto makers on Thursday showed the impact of 
slow sales and costly buyer incentives. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterly results completed a sharp drop in annual earnings for the 
nation's Big Three auto makers, which have been struggling with an industrywide 
slump that has prompted plant closings and thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The results at GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp. -- on Tuesday, Chrysler posted a 
$664-million loss for the quarter -- will mean little or no annual 
profit-sharing payments this year. 
</P>
<P>
GM posted a $700.2-million profit in the three months ended Dec. 31, down from 
$1.4 billion in the 1988 quarter. GM's revenue during the October-December 
quarter, including non-automotive subsidiaries, fell to $31.36 billion from 
$32.43 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Ford reported fourth-quarter profit of $314 million, compared to $1.16 billion 
in the year-earlier quarter. Ford's quarterly revenue in its automotive and 
financial services businesses amounted to $24.15 billion, compared to $23.91 
billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford earnings decline reflected a $424-million loss linked to the sale of 
its Rouge Steel Co. subsidiary. But even without that factor, fourth-quarter 
earnings were down 36.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Industrywide, car and truck sales fell sharply when the 1990 model year began 
in October, mainly because of reduced buyer incentives and higher prices for 
the new vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout November and December, auto companies funneled money into incentive 
programs -- which comes directly out of profits -- in an attempt to halt the 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problems, the Big Three faced swelling inventories and prepared 
to lay off thousands of auto workers during the first quarter of this year. 
Those layoffs largely have been accomplished. Inventories of unsold vehicles 
have shrunk from a 91-selling-day level at year's end to 70 days at the end of 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Treasurer David McCammon said the company spent an average of $800 in 
incentives for every car and truck it sold in the fourth quarter, slightly more 
than double the figure for the year-earlier quarter. 
</P>
<P>
He said that on Dec. 31, Ford was spending about $1,000 on incentives for each 
of its vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
As production and inventories get more in line with demand, McCammon said, auto 
makers should be able to rely less on incentives to control new-car inventory 
and sales. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since 1985, GM's annual earnings outpaced those of No. 2 
Ford. 
</P>
<P>
GM's annual profit fell 13.1% to $4.22 billion, on total corporate revenue of 
$126.93 billion, compared to a profit of $4.86 billion on revenue of $123.64 
billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
GM's major subsidiaries reported earnings Wednesday. General Motors Acceptance 
Corp. and GM Hughes Electronics Corp. reported declines, but Electronic Data 
Systems Corp. said its profit grew with added data services customers. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's annual earnings fell 27.6% to $3.84 billion from $5.3 billion in 1988. 
Annual revenue rose to $96.15 billion from $92.45 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's $664-million fourth-quarter loss was mainly due to a one-time 
$577-million charge for plant closings and costs of cutting jobs from its 
white-collar work force. Chrysler posted a profit of $433 million in fourth 
quarter 1988. Its annual profit plummeted 65.8% to $359 million. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the auto makers said their performances in the United States suffered 
last year, meaning no profit sharing for Chrysler hourly workers, no bonuses 
for the company's salaried employees and sharply lower profit-sharing payments 
to hourly workers at GM and Ford.

STATIC QUO: AM 530, Caltrans' Highway Advisory Radio, has been a bust for much 
of the past two weeks. . . . Although a big yellow sign urges motorists on the 
Costa Mesa Freeway to tune in for traffic reports, those who do hear a lot of 
static. . . . Agency officials blame it on a transmission line to the 
transmitter, the low frequency used and the proximity of high-voltage power

COINCIDENCE? With settlement thought imminent in two related suits against 
Sheriff Brad Gates, insiders say the deal -- which could cost the county more 
than $1 million -- may not be finalized until mid-March. . . . Coincidental or 
not, the filing deadline to run for sheriff is March 9. . . . Gates, seeking 
his fifth term, so far has no opposition. . . . Eileen Padberg, a longtime 
Gates political consultant, said she knows of no effort to delay settlement 
past the deadline but added: "It would be a stroke of luck that I'd be 
appreciative of." Dana Parsons and Kristina Lindgren

<TEXT>
<P>
Although state and local officials have told residents repeatedly that the 
current levels of malathion spraying pose no health hazards, they also have 
cautioned Southland physicians that direct exposure can cause eye and throat 
irritation, chest tightness, headaches and nausea, it was disclosed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent discrepancy bolstered claims by malathion critics that the state 
has adopted a reckless and cavalier attitude toward public health concerns in 
its assault on the Mediterranean fruit fly. Among those critics were about 400 
people who demonstrated Thursday night in Garden Grove in one of the biggest 
malathion protests in Southern California since aerial spraying started last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the helicopters hit Orange County as scheduled around 9 p.m. 
Thursday to begin spraying parts of nine cities covering 36 square miles for 
the second time. State officials got the go-ahead for the job hours earlier 
when a Sacramento Superior Court judge rejected a second request by the cities 
of Huntington Beach, Garden Grove and Westminster to halt the malathion 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
In refusing to halt Thursday night's spraying around Garden Grove, Judge 
Anthony DeCristoforo Jr. said from the bench that he uses malathion liberally 
to rid his back yard of pests and said he would not second-guess state 
agriculture officials. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the "enormous economic damage" that the Medfly could do to parts of 
the state's $16-billion agriculture industry, the judge asked: "Don't we face a 
greater disaster if we do nothing than if we do something?" 
</P>
<P>
In urging the judge to allow the spraying to continue, a deputy attorney 
general reaffirmed the state's position that use of the spray mixture of one 
part malathion to three parts bait over about 300 square miles of Southern 
California is safe. 
</P>
<P>
"No Health Hazard," declares one headline on a bright yellow notice that the 
state has distributed door-to-door to hundreds of thousands of Southern 
California residents who live in the spray zones. 
</P>
<P>
In an accompanying "malathion fact sheet" to residents, state officials said: 
"If convenient, stay indoors at the moment of application in your area to avoid 
spotting of personal apparel." There is no mention of health effects in the 
handout. 
</P>
<P>
But a somewhat different story is told in newly disclosed letters that were 
prepared by health department officials in Los Angeles and Orange counties, 
reviewed by state officials and mailed recently to thousands of local 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
The "Dear Doctor" letters in the two counties, virtually identical, assert that 
officials expect "no serious or long-term health effects" from malathion 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, each letter acknowledges that moderate, airborne exposure can 
cause "direct irritant effects. . . . Persons directly sprayed with the 
pesticides, or breathing fairly concentrated vapors from sprayed surfaces, 
might experience eye and throat irritation or chest tightness. If exposure is 
prolonged, headache or nausea might develop." 
</P>
<P>
The physicians' letter was disclosed as part of a deposition from Orange County 
Health Officer L. Rex Ehling. The document was received Thursday by the Legal 
Aid Society of Orange County as part of a lawsuit seeking to force the 
government to provide shelters for the homeless during spraying. Local armories 
were opened for the homeless Thursday night because of the cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion protesters, pointing to medical evidence of their own, have grown 
increasingly vocal in their attacks on the safety of the pesticide. But the 
physicians' letter marks the first official indication that state and local 
officials recognize potential health hazards associated with malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Gera Curry, spokeswoman for the state Department of Food and Agriculture, stood 
by the state's repeated assertions about malathion's safety and said of the 
cautionary notes in the letters: "Doctors among themselves tend to be a great 
deal more conservative and think of worst-case scenarios." 
</P>
<P>
Added Orange County Health Officer Ehling: "You have to consider your audience. 
We're not concealing anything from the public, but on the other hand we don't 
want to suggest symptoms to anyone. With the physicians, we were being a bit 
more technical in the event symptoms do occur. We wanted to be frank with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Cohen, executive director of the Legal Aid Society, said: "This is 
outrageous. They're telling the public one thing and physicians another." 
</P>
<P>
Telling physicians that nausea or other symptoms may develop, Cohen said, "is 
qualitatively different than telling people you don't want to get your clothes 
spotted. If you're a homeless person, getting your clothes spotted may not be a 
top priority but getting sick would be." 
</P>
<P>
Sickness was foremost on the minds of those with homes as well Thursday, as 
about 400 residents braved cold winds and temperatures in the 40s to stage a 
sunset anti-malathion rally at the intersection of Harbor and Garden Grove 
boulevards in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The group, buoyed by honking and waving from supporters in passing cars, 
included scores of young children. One little girl carried a sign that read: 
"Don't Gamble With My Health." 
</P>
<P>
Several mothers said they came to the rally because they fear malathion may 
harm their children. "I think what they're spraying is actual poison, and it's 
going everywhere, and my kids have to breathe it," said Vikki Wheeler of 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisors Roger R. Stanton and Harriett M. Wieder, joined by elected 
officials from many of the nine cities affected by Thursday's spraying, urged 
people to let their state legislators know about their unhappiness with the 
malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder said she could not understand how the state would declare a state of 
emergency because of two Medflies found in Orange County while declining to 
declare an emergency in the recent oil spill off Huntington Beach. She said she 
was also disappointed that the courts had refused to stop the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that the courts don't work," Wieder said. "But you can get your 
message heard by going to the legislators. . . . You can get them to change the 
laws, and that's what has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
While city attorneys have not yet decided whether to pursue further legal 
action to try and halt the sprayings, the word from the bench was not 
encouraging at the morning hearing in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, DeCristoforo told reporters that he hoses down his 
flea-infested dogs with the pesticide and even sprays malathion around a 
breezeway entering his home. "I'm not careful at all. I get it in my eyes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach and Garden Grove attorneys portrayed the state's malathion 
campaign in the county as a massive overreaction to the discovery of two flies, 
only one of which was a pregnant female, and said it is unfair that the Crystal 
Cathedral was exempted from the Jan. 25 spraying because an outdoor dinner for 
2,500 ministers was under way. 
</P>
<P>
Dep. Atty. Gen. Charles Getz said the Crystal Cathedral exception was made last 
month because there was no way to warn the participants before the spraying. 
Thursday night, he promised that the cathedral would be included in the second 
application of gooey malathion. 
</P>
<P>
"They will be sprayed tonight," said Getz. "I hate to tell Dr. (Robert) 
Schuller but he will have to get out there with the Windex and clean the 
windows."

SPILL CLEANUP RUSHED AS OIL SHEEN SPREADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Cleanup crews patrolled 25 miles of Orange County coastline looking for further 
oil damage Thursday, and officials closed a stretch of shoreline between Corona 
del Mar and north Laguna Beach as a thin petroleum sheen drifted offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Patches of the sheen also were reported lingering off Newport Beach and the 
Huntington Beach Municipal Pier as receding tides pulled back into the surf 
some of the crude that had reached the sand in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
"If (cleanup crews) didn't get to it quick enough, (the oil) goes right back 
out," said Coast Guard Petty Officer Dennis Hall. "It's like playing tag." 
</P>
<P>
As crews worked to capture the beached oil, the investigation of last week's 
394,000-gallon spill from the tanker American Trader focused on the depth of 
the offshore mooring area where the accident occurred, 1.3 miles off Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
At least three new soundings were under way or planned to measure the depth of 
the mooring station to determine whether the American Trader was in too shallow 
waters when it struck its own anchor, gashing the hull and spilling Alaskan 
crude into the Pacific. Results of the soundings were not made available. 
</P>
<P>
Along the shoreline, the cleanup was concentrated on Newport Beach but concern 
also focused on the newly restored Huntington Beach wetlands, where heavy 
amounts of oily seawater collected at the base of temporary earthen dikes in 
the mouth of the Santa Ana River. Rock jetties leading to the 25-acre estuary 
were coated with oil, but apparently none of the tainted seawater breached a 
series of protective booms and dikes. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife officials said fewer oil-soaked birds were being found. By late 
Thursday, 368 birds had been rescued alive since the Feb. 7 spill and 15 of 
those were released back into the wild near Point Mugu in Ventura County. Thus 
far, 216 birds have died, including 13 California brown pelicans, an endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
With most of the slick now ashore, Coast Guard officials reopened Los Alamitos 
Bay and the San Gabriel River to boat traffic, but Anaheim Bay, Huntington 
Harbour and Newport Harbor remain closed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Several sizable patches of glistening sheen -- a coating of oil often only 
thousandths of an inch thick -- remained just offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Fingers of the oily sheen washed ashore Thursday as far south as El Moro beach 
near Laguna Beach and in the Crystal Cove area, a rocky stretch of coast dotted 
with tide pools teeming with marine life. Although the oil left only a brown 
film on the rocks, environmentalists fear that any amount of petroleum residue 
is a threat to sea life. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they can do little about the sheen because equipment such as 
skimmers are useful only when oil is thickly concentrated offshore. British 
Petroleum, owners of the spilled oil, said the sheen, should it come ashore, 
does not present a serious threat. 
</P>
<P>
After an aerial inspection of the coast Thursday, Coast Guard officials said 
none of the thicker, dark crude that spilled from the 80,000-ton tanker 
remained in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
About 36% of the spilled oil, or 144,600 gallons, was recovered by a flotilla 
of skimming vessels, while 46%, or 184,800 gallons, was estimated to have 
evaporated or dispersed in the ocean, Coast Guard spokesman Rick Medit said. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest is on the beach," Medit said. 
</P>
<P>
As the investigation into the mooring mishap continued, Golden West Refining, 
owners of the mooring, began taking new soundings of the area under orders from 
the Coast Guard. Also planning to examine the bottom were the tanker's owners, 
New York-based American Trading Transportation Co. and the federal National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials had reported Wednesday that preliminary readings at the 
mooring indicated that the water may have been as much as five feet shallower 
than indicated on current navigational charts. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the tanker may have been operating in 46 or 47 feet of water 
instead of the 51 to 53 feet listed on the charts. At the time of the accident, 
the ship had a draft of 43 feet. Its anchor is four feet wide and about 10 feet 
long. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West and American Trading have hired private companies to survey the 
bottom. Responding to a Coast Guard request to complete a similar study, the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will bring one of its small 
research vessels from Northern California to do the soundings and check depth 
readings on existing navigational documents, agency spokesman Brian Gorman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman said depth readings off Huntington Beach were last taken by the agency 
in 1975, but navigational charts produced by the National Ocean Service are 
updated on a more frequent basis from new information supplied by merchant 
mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, federal authorities said the ship's reported coordinates at 
the time of the spill would have placed the tanker near an underwater 
obstruction marked on navigational charts. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials stressed, however, that the vessel may have merely 
reported an erroneous position and might have been closer to the offshore 
docking station where it planned to moor and unload its shipment of oil. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure there's any relevance in this obstruction thing," said Cmdr. 
Scott Porter, Coast Guard assistant chief for marine safety in California. "We 
don't know when they took that position." 
</P>
<P>
If the accident actually did occur near the obstacle, about half a mile south 
of the tanker mooring, it would contradict previous reports of the ship's 
position, which placed it near the offshore berth, a U-shaped series of buoys 
700 feet wide, forming a collar of sorts around the pipeline. Several crew 
members said the American Trader was near the mooring and in the process of 
maneuvering into the sea berth when they felt two sharp bumps a couple of 
minutes apart, then discovered oil spilling into the sea from the tanker's 
damaged hull. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with both the Coast Guard and the National Ocean Service, the federal 
agency that maps waters off the United States, said they do not know the nature 
of the underwater obstacle. But one veteran pilot familiar with the Huntington 
Beach mooring said he believes the obstruction is a pile of boulders dumped 
into the sea to form a fish habitat. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the 1,400 workers committed to the cleanup effort Thursday worked 
along a mile-long stretch of beach between Newport Pier and 47th Street that is 
still caked with black crude. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the oil has been mopped up with special absorbent materials 
manufactured by the 3-M Corp. that are designed to soak up to 10 times their 
weight in oil. The oiled cloths and two-man hand booms -- looking much like 
giant rolled-up bath towels -- are gathered into plastic bags and stored in 
large bins on a seven-acre parcel in the 5600 block of Coast Highway in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The bins are then emptied into a hydraulic truck. It squeezes out a potentially 
toxic liquid that is collected by a vacuum truck and taken to refineries that 
recycle the residue. 
</P>
<P>
The solid waste will be packaged and trucked to a toxic waste disposal site at 
Buttonwillow, near Bakersfield, and a landfill in the Imperial Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Don McKinnon, a supervisor with GSX, one of the cleanup firms, said the 
makeshift transfer station should not present a significant health risk to the 
Newport Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, 23 bins containing about 500 tons of waste were lined up ready to 
be compacted and shipped. McKinnon said the facility will handle up to 700 tons 
per day during the two weeks that officials anticipate the transfer station 
will be in operation. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from Cal-OSHA and the federal office of the Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration have inspected the site and have assured local 
officials that it meets safety standards.

Several months before world-class skier Patricia Kastle's ex-husband gunned her 
down, she drafted a will to ensure that, if he did, he would get only one thing 
from her estate: her wedding rings. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee Kastle/Strumer receives my wedding rings as a reminder (of) his marriage 
to me!" the 26-year-old Austrian native said in a will dated Oct. 20, 1989, and 
filed in Orange County Superior Court. Lee Strumer took the last name Kastle 
when he married Patricia Kastle four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In a later will, dated Dec. 2, she left her Newport Beach dress shop to her 
best friend, Ursula Neuhaus of Irvine, and expresses fear of Lee J. Kastle. 
</P>
<P>
"You know that with Lee J. there is not really a normal way out," Kastle said. 
"I am sure Lee J. will try to contest my will, but I would like to see that he 
is behind bars! If I die naturally, then it is a different story, but if he 
kills me and (sic) to show that I am the one that pushed him into it, then he 
needs to be put away behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a bad choice in partner, know (sic) it is time to pay," Kastle wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Kastle asked Neuhaus to "have a party at the store and invite all our friends 
and loyal customers! But please, not a sad party. Have a memorable day in joy. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Kastle was the granddaughter of the founder of Kastle Skis, a 
well-known manufacturer, and skied for the Swiss Olympic team in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 5, Lee Kastle, 44, chased his ex-wife around his Lido Peninsula 
mobile-home park with a gun, shot her to death and then killed himself. 
Patricia Kastle had come to the park to retrieve personal items. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 2 will, addressed to Neuhaus and marked: "Please open only when. . . 
.," said she wanted Neuhaus to be her "principal (inheritor)" by taking over 
ownership of La Patou Boutique in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Kastle said that she was writing "in full conscience," and hinted that Lee 
Kastle might have recently threatened her: "I feel fine just threatened to die 
(sic), but other than that I feel very calm and I know what I am doing," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Kastle obtained a court order Dec. 11 to keep him away, but she 
complained in court papers that despite the order, he slashed her tires and 
once tried to drive her off the road. 
</P>
<P>
Kastle also said in the Dec. 2 will that she and her ex-husband "have a 
contract where he signed that La Patou Boutique is not his," and she said the 
store and all its bank accounts would go to Neuhaus. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Kastle's divorce lawyer, Harvey E. Berman, said the couple's divorce 
settlement, which became final in January, gave Patricia Kastle the shop and 
assigned Lee Kastle a percentage of the proceeds from its sale. Berman said he 
does not know if a special administrator, appointed at Neuhaus' request, 
intends to sell the shop now. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Kastle bequeathed her jewelry to her mother in Switzerland and her 
clothes to the Salvation Army. She instructed that $20,000 in cash she kept in 
a safety deposit box be given to the Red Cross "for people in need." 
</P>
<P>
Berman said Wednesday that he believed Patricia Kastle's mother might challenge 
the will, but now knows that will not happen. He said he knows of no other 
threatened challenges. Lee Kastle's estate is being handled by the public 
administrator.

BUT THE BITTER COLD COULD RETURN BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.

<P>
A winter frost described as one of the worst in recent years destroyed a 
significant portion of the county's strawberry crop Thursday, and area growers 
were scrambling to protect their remaining plants from a second night of 
freezing temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Most spots in the county reported lows in the 30s Thursday morning, but 
temperatures in some places fell into the 20s. The county's coldest spot was 
southeast Irvine, where the temperature dipped to a record-breaking 22 degrees. 
The previous record was 23, recorded in Orange on Feb. 15, 1942, county 
historian Jim Sleeper said. 
</P>
<P>
The cold snap is the aftermath of an Alaskan cold front that was blasting 
through Southern California this week, said Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. The front has settled 
in the Rocky Mountains, Dittmann said. Temperatures were expected to fall below 
freezing in much of the county Thursday night and early this morning, Dittmann 
said. Although higher temperatures are predicted beginning tonight, freezing 
conditions could return by the middle of next week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For today, forecasts called for increasing afternoon clouds with high 
temperatures in the 50s and 60s and lows in the 30s and 40s. Weekend weather 
could include showers beginning late Saturday and continuing through Monday; 
highs ranging from the 40s to the 60s are expected. 
</P>
<P>
The chill has also affected the county's homeless population, which is 
estimated at about 10,000. Scott Mather, chairman of the Orange County Homeless 
Task Force, said that already overtaxed private shelters were strained beyond 
capacity Wednesday night and early Thursday. In addition, about 250 people went 
to the two National Guard armories that were opened because of the cold. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the shelters are full every night, no matter how cold it is," Mather 
said. The armories have been opened about 10 times so this year, he said, when 
nighttime temperatures have dipped below 40 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
At dawn Thursday, icicles were hanging off fences around farm fields, and 
Laguna Canyon Road was covered with a hazardous coat of ice. Laguna Beach 
police said the road was treated with a combination of sand and cat-box litter 
to keep drivers from skidding around the dangerous curve known as Big Bend. 
</P>
<P>
"Ice formed about a quarter-inch thick on our fields, and there were icicles 
around the strawberry leaves and the sprinklers," said Paul Murai of Murai 
Farms on Laguna Canyon Road in Irvine. Murai shook his head in dismay Thursday 
as he was surveying the damage to 150 acres of strawberry fields. 
</P>
<P>
Murai estimated that he lost 25% of ripe strawberries and blossoms that would 
have produced fruit in another month. He added that about 120 workers were 
expected to arrive at the farm this 
</P>
<P>
morning to pick the damaged berries, which will be used for juice. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the worst frost we've had in three years," Murai said. "And 
when it comes this late in the year, we have the potential of losing a lot more 
money because the crops are all ready" to pick. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, farm owner John Magarro estimated that he sustained a 25% loss to 
the more than 4,000 tons of berries produced on his 150 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Growers protected their fruits, vegetables, trees and nursery plants with 
techniques that included wind machines, sprinklers, smudge pots, thermal 
coverings called "hot caps" and special frost-resistant chemical coatings. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us have been up since 10 p.m." Wednesday, Magarro said Thursday 
morning of the efforts to protect his fields. "We'll be out again" Thursday 
night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Volkert at SeaTree Nurseries in Irvine said Thursday that workers there 
were preparing for the cold by refueling smudge pots, readying wind machines 
and sprinklers. They also were trying to get some sleep during the day so that 
they could make it through another all-night vigil, Volkert said. The nursery 
has managed to save most of its trees so far, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the 400-acre Magarro Farms in east Irvine, employee Dominic Etcheberria said 
the strawberry harvest season, which normally reaches its peak in April and 
May, would be delayed four to six weeks this year because of the cold. 
Strawberries are typically planted in October, and the first berries harvested 
in January, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Citrus crops, avocado groves, vegetables and nursery plants appeared to have 
suffered the least frost damage, according to early estimates by John Ellis, 
the county's deputy agricultural commissioner. Some winter tomato crops may 
have been destroyed by the frost, however, Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Citrus trees are better able to hold their own against the cold," Ellis said. 
Because the sugar content of the fruit is higher at this time of year, he said, 
the citrus trees probably suffered less damage than they would have a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia oranges are the county's biggest citrus crop, he said, and these are 
harvested in late March and in April. 
</P>
<P>
El Modeno Gardens, a wholesale nursery in Irvine, had covered its plants with 
heavy plastic but still lost some less hardy ones, said JoAnne Groot Beall, 
vice president of operations for the firm. Those lost included flowering 
specimens such as marguerites, hibiscus and bougainvillea, Beall said.

DIANNE KLEIN: 'IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE TO HAVE CAREER TO VALIDATE YOURSELF' 
</P>

<P>
Donna Saltarelli is 35 years old, a wife, mother, energetic volunteer and, she 
says, a dinosaur. That's how those around her sometimes make her feel. Like a 
relic, a curious throwback to another time. 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't have a paying job, by choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think why I get angry is because of this cultural imperative that says you 
are not valid if you don't have a job," she says. "It's that paycheck. When you 
live in a materialistic society like we do, producing money is what it's all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
And there is more to this dilemma. It's about prestige and self-esteem, the 
division of labor between the sexes and even among those of the same sex. It 
cuts to the core of who we are and what we value. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine, a judge's wife, went to a dinner the other night," says 
Eileen Ford, a temporarily employed wife and mother who is 35 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"The table was full of female attorneys and one of them turned to her and said, 
'What do you do?' and she said, 'I stay at home.' No one talked to her after 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Denice Jones, 42, was a regional sales manager for a yacht manufacturer when 
she gave up her career 10 years ago to raise her son. She would do so again, 
she says, but still there are clues that her feelings about that choice remain 
in flux. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago -- I can picture the exact moment -- this man came up to me at 
a cocktail party," she says. "Then he says, 'What do you do?' and I didn't have 
a response. I just stood there, and then he was embarrassed and started 
apologizing. Then I was embarrassed. . . . It's like you almost have to have a 
career to validate yourself as a human being." 
</P>
<P>
I don't believe that I would be having this particular conversation with these 
women, all of them college-educated and quick with their thoughts, if the time 
machine were turned back to, say, the year 1950. 
</P>
<P>
The rules back then were more rigid, more unfair, but simpler. Women were 
primarily in the home. That was where they derived their worth. 
</P>
<P>
Today, of course, most women are in the workplace, some of them more willingly 
than others. And standards, for mothers in particular, are more exacting, 
certainly more exhausting. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Barbara Hodgson, 39, quit her job as a benefits manager in 
Minnesota, with a salary of $50,000 a year, to follow her husband to a sales 
position out here. Now she works part time, by choice, in the library of her 
son's elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
"At first," she says, "I really felt that I had let down the movement, that I 
was doing just what all those men had said. . . . But I had actually achieved 
what I wanted to achieve. I got there and said, 'This is it?' 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, you have to live for yourself. It wasn't so much my son I quit 
for; he was doing great. It was me. I was the one who was missing out." 
</P>
<P>
Women with careers are guilty about not spending more time in the home, 
nurturing their kids. Women in the home are guilty about "wasting" their minds. 
</P>
<P>
These are rough stereotypes -- and I know many exceptions -- but I believe they 
are founded on truths. Often women, and a growing number of men, are not 
completely satisfied with choosing between the extremes. 
</P>
<P>
Choose, however, most of us must. Then we often find ourselves on the 
defensive. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Saltarelli mentions the three boards that she sits on, the charities she 
helps, the books she reads, her ability to stump her husband, an attorney, at 
Trivial Pursuit. The oft-repeated phrase, "You don't work," sets her on edge. 
</P>
<P>
"I find that in some settings, I'll say, 'I work, but I don't get paid,' " adds 
Eileen Ford. "I feel that need." 
</P>
<P>
Denice Jones, who has a degree in economics, talks about the budget that she 
managed for the PTA -- it was comparable to that of a small business -- and the 
volunteer activities that take up so much of her time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like that bumper sticker for the Girl Scouts, 'Proud to be a Volunteer!' 
" she says. "My husband always encouraged me to work. He still does. . . . I 
think even for him, it's difficult to believe that I like what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
Then one of the women says that sometimes, when she gets together with her 
friends, they talk about career women who never seem to have enough time for 
their kids. Maids take them here, friends pick them up there. These are the 
children who always seem to be the last to leave the playground yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about the fiber of our kids," says Denice. "So many of them are in day 
care." 
</P>
<P>
Then I hear myself putting up my own defense. I wanted to stay for the 
Valentine Day's party at my daughter's preschool, but I didn't have the time. I 
had to be here. 
</P>
<P>
I worry that my neighbor, who has just started a part-time job, will move away. 
Then who will pick up my daughter from school? I wish it could be me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real sensitive about making people who are working feel guilty," adds 
Barbara Hodgson. "I don't know that we can just sit back and feel superior. . . 
. I think what is so important to stress is that we have a choice. So many 
people don't." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it does any good to have one side pointing fingers at the 
other," Eileen Ford agrees. "We all make choices. We have to respect ones that 
are different from our own."

EL TORO AIR BASE ADDED TO EPA'S TOXIC-DUMP LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<DATELINE>
<P>
EL TORO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that it has placed the 
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station on its Superfund list of toxic waste sites 
because of contamination in abandoned storage drums, landfills and ground water 
caused by four decades of dumping by the military. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said the base contains several landfills and firefighter 
training pits where hazardous wastes such as jet fuel and paint thinners may 
have been dumped in the past. They said there are also abandoned storage drums 
with low-level radioactive waste, explosives and other scattered deposits of 
battery acid and fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have also reported a large plume of contaminated ground water that 
will be addressed under the Superfund program, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials say that the waste sites pose no immediate health risk but that 
"there's potential for a long-term problem," said Virginia Donohue, a 
spokeswoman from the agency's regional office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Master Sgt. Steve Merrill, a public affairs spokesman at the El Toro base, said 
the Marine Corps station is grateful to be on the Superfund list. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a lot of experience in environmental investigation," he said. 
"They're going to provide a logical and scientific approach to the cleanup 
efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Because the military base is a federal facility, the Superfund designation will 
not release additional funds for the cleanups. EPA guidelines prohibit the use 
of the fund to pay for the cleanup of federally owned sites. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the cleanup will be paid for by the U.S. Department of Defense. The 
Superfund designation, however, will increase the priority of the effort for 
the Defense Department, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The El Toro base will benefit from the inclusion because "it elevates you above 
other priorities," Donohue said. "These problems get cleaned up first." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they did not know how much the cleanup was going to cost. First, 
they said, an investigation will be conducted to determine the extent of the 
work that is needed. Donohue said that she did not know how long the 
investigation will take but that it could be several years. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA identified 14 separate hazardous waste sites on the Marine base that 
will be included in the Superfund designation for inspection, cleanup and 
monitoring by federal environmental officials. 
</P>
<P>
The El Toro base already has started some studies on the sites through the 
Defense Environmental Restoration Account -- the Defense Department's special 
environmental cleanup fund, Merrill said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems to be investigated is the contaminated ground water that 
has been found below the base and in portions of Irvine. Officials said they 
have found that the ground water contains trichloroethylene, or TCE, a 
cancer-causing degreasing agent. TCE was used by the military until the late 
1970s to clean jet fighter and helicopter engines. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the contamination has not reached public wells and poses no immediate 
threat, said James Van Hahn, a spokesman for the Orange County Water District. 
</P>
<P>
The Water District has reported the existence of a large plume of contaminated 
ground water nearly three miles long and a half-mile wide, stretching from the 
El Toro base to a point halfway between Jeffrey Road and Culver Drive, in the 
Woodbridge area of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps, in its own study, contends that the area is smaller and 
scattered, Van Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
The military also has not accepted full responsibility for all of the ground 
water contamination that has been found. Local officials said Thursday they are 
hopeful that the investigation conducted as a result of the Superfund 
designation will assign responsibility for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine base has already installed a treatment system to remove TCE from the 
ground water. The water district and the city of Irvine started removing some 
of the contaminated water last year. Van Hahn said that the process could take 
over five years and that it has already cost over $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
In its announcement Thursday, the EPA added 71 other sites to its Superfund 
list, including seven others in California.

<TEXT>
<P>
The state has reimbursed Anaheim for $4.5 million the city spent to build an 
overpass across busy Lincoln Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Funds from the Public Utilities Commission repaid costs of the overpass that 
allows pedestrian access to Lincoln Elementary School and provides motorists 
with a more convenient route into downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The state makes such refunds to encourage local governments to redevelop areas 
as needed. 
</P>
<P>
The funds will be returned to the city Redevelopment Department and will be 
used for other projects.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GATES HAILS OPENING OF GENETIC LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's new genetic testing laboratory, with its computers, radioactive 
incubators, freezers and cameras, was officially opened Thursday with 
authorities saying it will be ready for its first case in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the blood and semen left during rapes and other crimes will be used to 
identify the suspect and provide the district attorney with powerful evidence 
in court," said a proud Sheriff Brad Gates, who fought to finance the lab and 
who has been training people for more than two years in anticipation of its 
opening in the coroner's Forensic Science Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory will allow investigators to study the unique genetic codes in 
DNA -- deoxyribonucleic acid -- that are found in everything from hair and skin 
samples to blood and other body fluids. 
</P>
<P>
It is the only DNA laboratory west of the Mississippi River and one of only six 
in the United States. Four people will work in the testing laboratory program 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Most law enforcement officials say DNA testing is one of the biggest advances 
in forensics during this century. 
</P>
<P>
"What can we expect from this DNA laboratory?" Gates asked Thursday as he 
addressed the small crowd of police chiefs, county staff, FBI agents and two 
county Supervisors, Chairman Don R. Roth and Harriett M. Wieder, who came for 
the DNA laboratory dedication. 
</P>
<P>
"We can expect fewer trials, as defendants plead guilty in the face of this 
evidence. Within the last month or two we've had two suspects who have 
pleadedguilty because of DNA and according to the district attorney's office, 
this saved taxpayers $60,000 in court costs. 
</P>
<P>
"A wise, cost-effective investment in the criminal justice system, that's the 
bottom line here today," Gates told the audience. "Most important, victims of 
sexual assaults and child molests will be saved the additional trauma of 
testimony during trial . . . that would affect them the rests of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gates and his forensic staff praised the new technology as a way to 
positively identify rapists, murders and even hit-and-run drivers, some 
scientists claim that the DNA fingerprints could not with certainty decide if a 
person is guilty or not. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to some scientists, is that the DNA images can stretch 
and shift like a design printed on rubber, making them difficult to read and 
match. 
</P>
<P>
"We see that happening," said Frank Fitzpatrick, director of the Sheriff's 
Department forensic science services. "I think the ultimate question is when 
you are setting up your guidelines, at what point do you say something is 
inconclusive and at what point do you say it's an . . . identification." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick said the controversy of stretching images goes straight to the 
issue of quality control and training. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though the Board (of Supervisors) authorized this laboratory in October," 
Fitzpatrick said, "we have had people in training for two years. We have sent 
them back to school; they've been to the university; they've been to the FBI 
and they've been to conferences on DNA." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana defense attorney John D. Barnett said: "Law enforcement scientists 
appear to be willing to abandon former methods of identification that they used 
to depend on in order to save this new baby called DNA." 
</P>
<P>
A DNA laboratory did not come easily. Gates raised $80,000 privately for the 
facility through his Sheriff's Advisory Council. At one emotional supervisors 
meeting in October, Supervisor Wieder questioned her male colleagues' concern 
for rape victims because of their refusal to pay for the genetic laboratory 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Her request for the $120,000 followed the rape of a 12-year-old Huntington 
Beach girl. The suspect in the case was a man who five months earlier had been 
acquitted of a rape charge after prosecutors were late in obtaining evidence 
from an outside DNA lab. The two commercial laboratories that do the DNA 
testing have three- to four-month backlogs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The board approved the funds about two weeks later. GEORGE FRANK

DEVELOPERS LEAD RECALL CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developers again dominated the list of contributors to unseat Councilman Robert 
A. Curtis as the campaign heads into its final two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Financial statements filed Thursday show that development interests, topped by 
the Mission Viejo Co., gave all but $500 of the $113,416 donated between Jan. 
15 and Feb. 10 to the Alliance for Mission Viejo, the citizens group attempting 
to recall Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo Co. paid $75,000 to the recall effort, bringing its total 
contributions during the campaign to $132,000. Overall, developers and 
pro-growth political groups have donated $282,102 of the $307,457 raised by the 
alliance since the group initiated a petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis reported receiving $7,122 during the latest filing period. His largest 
contribution is listed as $3,600 in printing costs donated by Edwards 
Photography of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same story," Curtis said. "But it just keeps getting larger and 
larger. This (financial statement) makes it obvious that the Mission Viejo Co. 
and their cronies are trying to buy the election." 
</P>
<P>
The councilman said the development firm wants to get rid of him for his 
slow-growth stance. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo Co., which did not return calls Thursday, has said that 
Curtis threatened the city's planned community concept by trying to annex 
Aegean Hills. The community of 7,000 residents is in unincorporated territory 
neighboring Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Monroe, leader of the recall group, said the money contributed by 
developers doesn't reflect the anger of Mission Viejo citizens over Aegean 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of many, many people who are giving their time," she said. "Many can't 
afford to give money, but they are working to recall him all the same." 
</P>
<P>
Developers "are obviously angry at (Curtis) too. We have no problems with 
accepting their contributions," she said. "It costs a lot of money to run a 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Mission Viejo Co., the alliance lists contributions from 
development interests of $10,000 each from Beach Cities Development Corp. of 
Long Beach; the Alliance for Representative Government of Covina and Bramalea 
California Inc. of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The recall group's statement shows $28,670 paid to Janison Publication Inc. of 
Los Angeles for campaign literature. Kimco Services Inc., which organized the 
alliance's campaign walkers, billed the group for $9,298 and received $18,000 
for past services. 
</P>
<P>
No individual contributed more than $250 to Curtis. Of the $3,522 in cash 
donations listed by the councilman, $2,272 were gifts of under $100. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 50,000 Mission Viejo residents are receiving a 
newspaper-style political mailer that has unleashed a wave of new allegations 
about the councilman's political and business conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The slick, professionally done tabloid put out by the Alliance for Mission 
Viejo says that it uncovered court cases filed against Curtis alleging that he 
had not paid personal and business debts. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, a private lawyer before joining the Riverside County district 
attorney's office, has called the mailer "a smear campaign. . . . I think this 
tabloid would make the editor of the National Enquirer blush." 
</P>
<P>
The mailer put out by Curtis last week was criticized at a City Council meeting 
Monday by a city planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Ben Meharg said the mailer was filled with inaccuracies and called 
for the council to approve a resolution that would set the record straight on 
17 issues raised during the recall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The council discussed backing the resolution for two hours before directing 
city staff to research the document and prepare a report. FRANK MESSINA

TEACHER-DISTRICT TALKS BREAK DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days of intense contract talks between teachers and officials of the 
Capistrano Unified School District broke down unexpectedly this week, despite 
hopes that a state mediator would help end an eight-month impasse. 
</P>
<P>
No new talks have been scheduled between district officials and negotiators for 
the 100-member Capistrano Unified Educators Assn., officials for the two sides 
said on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"As of last night, we are back to square one," union president Ric Stephenson, 
a history teacher at Newhart Junior High School, said of the meetings that 
ended Wednesday night. "If we cannot resolve this at the mediation level, then 
we will have to take action that will have an effect on the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to elaborate, although teachers have picketed a district health 
fair and Dana Hills High School in recent months to express their frustration 
over the contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
The state mediator was asked in January to assist in ongoing negotiations, and 
this week's meetings were the first of both sides with the mediator. 
</P>
<P>
The union wants increased health and retirement benefits and an 8% 
across-the-board salary raise for this school year. The district has offered a 
7.5% wage increase and wants a disciplinary clause included in the new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
The clause would establish a panel to handle disciplinary action against 
teachers. School principals now deal with disciplinary actions on a 
case-by-case basis. Stephenson said the two sides reached agreement on the 
clause, and were within a half percentage point on salary. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Cerra, spokeswoman for the 23,000-student district, said officials 
were "very pleased with the progress of the last few days," but were 
disappointed that they were unable to agree on a contract. JAMES M. GOMEZ

2 CALLS TO 911 END WITH VERY SPECIAL DELIVERIES

<P>
Twice within a 24-hour period, emergency telephone operators in Orange County 
helped talk expectant mothers through their deliveries before paramedics 
arrived, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Two impatient infants gave little notice of their arrivals, entering the world 
only minutes after their worried fathers called 911 for assistance, Orange 
County Fire Battalion Chief Kevin S. Brame said. 
</P>
<P>
For the pair of dispatchers involved in the deliveries, the births were special 
occasions that won't soon be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Dispatcher John Gray handled the first call on Wednesday morning from Richard 
Stamps of Orange, who called to say his girlfriend Jacqueline Holly was about 
deliver their child. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that she was on the toilet about to give birth, and I immediately 
told him to get her off the toilet and lay her down on the ground with her legs 
spread and knees bent," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said he has instruction cards that help him tell callers what to do, but 
as he started reading the initial steps, the baby had already advanced to the 
final card. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rare that we get beyond the first couple of steps before the paramedics 
arrive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stamps' mother took the information from Gray and relayed it to her son. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me that the baby was out, and I couldn't believe it. I said, 'All the 
way out?' and she said, 'Yes,' " Gray said. "There was a pause for a moment 
after that." 
</P>
<P>
Gray continued with post-birthing instructions until the paramedics arrived to 
care for the healthy baby girl, named Jasmine Holly, who weighed 7 pounds, 4 
ounces. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really rewarding to bring in a life like this," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:34 a.m. Thursday, dispatcher Heather O'Darrow received the second delivery 
call. 
</P>
<P>
Only an hour before, O'Darrow had a traumatic Sudden Infant Death Syndrome 
call. 
</P>
<P>
"The SIDS call was really upsetting, but delivering the baby was very exciting 
and upbeat. It was a very happy moment." 
</P>
<P>
O'Darrow said she also had a quick delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I was on Step A the baby was already on Step F," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Within three minutes of the call a healthy baby boy was born. His proud 
parents, Charles and Terry Gero of Mission Viejo, thanked O'Darrow for her 
assistance as the baby cried in the background. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really great," O'Darrow said. "That's the type of thing that makes this 
job so worthwhile."

MIKE PENNER: HE HAS A NAME AND GAME YOU WON'T FORGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The best thing Larry and Debe Parks ever did for their son was the first thing 
they ever did for their son. 
</P>
<P>
They named him. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee was their choice. Cherokee Parks. 
</P>
<P>
Good thing Larry Parks' heritage was part Cherokee and not some other tribe. 
Cherokee was fortunate. With a little less luck, he could've been a boy named 
Sioux. 
</P>
<P>
It was a brave move, no doubt, but also a wise one. For the rest of his life, 
regardless of which path he wandered, Cherokee had a built-in guarantee that 
he'd never be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Then he grew to 6 feet, 11 inches by his 17th year. 
</P>
<P>
Such a combination, the name and the frame, tends to leave an indelible 
impression. As Cherokee puts it, "You can't forget the name Cherokee. 
Especially a 6-11 guy named Cherokee. It sticks in your head." 
</P>
<P>
So do the dunks and the drives and the three-point rainbows and everything else 
Cherokee does while patroling the hardwood for Marina High School's basketball 
team. He's become a legend before his own time, a high school junior who's 
already being compared to Bill Walton and a player whose physical gifts may be 
unprecedented in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Think about this area and think about some of the big men who have posted up 
down here. From the prehistoric era, there were Swen Nater and Mark Eaton, late 
bloomers whose coordination didn't catch up with their long limbs until after 
high school. "Sticks on the block," Marina Coach Steve Popovich calls them. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Rogers? "He was more of an outside player," Popovich says. "Cherokee 
plays both inside and outside." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton Olivier? "He probably didn't have the mobility Cherokee has," Popovich 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Schneiderjohn? "He was pretty fluid, he played a lot like Cherokee," 
Popovich admits. But the coach will stick with his guy. 
</P>
<P>
LeRon Ellis? Tougher inside than Cherokee, but not as versatile. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Keefe? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Popovich is stumped. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the only one who stands out," Popovich says. "Keefe plays so hard. He's 
so physical and so fundamentally sound. 
</P>
<P>
"But once Cherokee puts some weight on himself. . . . He already is a real 
refined player. He's mobile, he's got a good shooting touch, he learns very 
easily. If he got up to 225, 230, a good weight, he'd be a complete player." 
</P>
<P>
At 217 pounds, Cherokee is averaging 22 points and 13 rebounds a game, shooting 
59% from the field and 80% from the foul line. But if there's room to get 
bigger, Cherokee agrees, there's room to get better. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to follow my shots more," says Cherokee, running down his want list. "I 
need to get some good weight on me. My defense -- I play good defense against 
the good player, but not against the lesser ones. I sink to their level. And, I 
have to work on my shot selection. I need to develop my pump fake." 
</P>
<P>
One more thing, Popovich suggests. 
</P>
<P>
"A jump hook," the coach says. "He's going to be playing against strong inside 
players all the time in colleges -- 6-10, 7-foot guys. To get shots off with 
those guys guarding him, he's going to need a jump hook." 
</P>
<P>
When this is mentioned to Cherokee, it elicits a wry grin. 
</P>
<P>
"I use a jump hook a lot more than he realizes," Cherokee says. "In the 
all-star camps last summer, I used it all the time. I was making them, too. But 
that's against 6-10, 6-11 guys. Local guys are usually 6-6 and I can post up on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
College coaches can hardly wait for the finished package. Already, there have 
been visits from Nevada Las Vegas' Jerry Tarkanian, Syracuse's Jim Boeheim, 
UCLA's Jim Harrick and Arizona's Lute Olson. Duke has sent a few talent scouts. 
Kentucky, Maryland and Ohio State have stayed in contact by phone. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the mail. "He has his own zip code," Popovich jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Popovich, who went through the recruiting circus 15 years ago with Rich 
Branning, already has mapped out the months ahead with Cherokee and Debe Parks. 
"We're in the process of working it out, getting it down to a realistic number 
of schools," Popovich says. "We're going to try to prevent it from getting out 
of hand." 
</P>
<P>
But college coaches aren't the only ones. Next season, Marina will play a 
preseason tournament in South Carolina with all expenses -- air fare, hotel 
rooms, per diem -- paid. Call them Cherokee perks. The invitation hinged on the 
presence of a certain center and Popovich had to sign a dotted line to ensure 
that Cherokee was indeed coming east. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee Parks. Don't leave home without him. 
</P>
<P>
The early grapevine has UCLA holding the inside track on Cherokee, a rumor 
fanned by Cherokee's frequent presence at Bruin home games. And if UCLA was 
good enough for the first Bill Walton, it ought to be right for the next one, 
right? 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee plays this one behind a screen. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that all started because I've been up to UCLA a lot and I played with 
some of their players last month," he says. "But I've seen ASU and loved it. 
I've been to USC and that's another school I really liked. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," he adds, "I'd keep it quiet if I thought UCLA was going to be the 
school." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, there are other things to consider at the moment, such as the Southern 
Section playoffs. Marina won its first-round game Tuesday and tonight, the 
Cherokee people venture to San Bernardino to play a 22-3 Cajon High team. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings are underdogs, but they arrive with a great equalizer, a 6-11 
middle man capable of carrying a team a good ways. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, this is no ordinary Cherokee.

CEBALLOS DOES IT ALL, BUT IT ISN'T ENOUGH AS TITANS LOSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cedric Ceballos drove the baseline and made silky-sweet lay-ins. 
</P>
<P>
He hit the boards, and outdid the nation's leading rebounder, Eric McArthur. 
</P>
<P>
He made good on three-point plays, and he even led the Cal State Fullerton fast 
break, end to end. 
</P>
<P>
But he couldn't lead the Titans to victory Thursday. They lost to UC Santa 
Barbara, 75-70, in Titan Gym despite his 27-point, 21-rebound performance. 
</P>
<P>
The loss, the Titans' first at home in 10 games this season, broke a 13-game 
home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara, mindful of what can happen when a team misses its free throws, 
clamped down on a seven-point lead with 3 minutes 33 seconds to play and didn't 
let go, making 12 of 13 free throws down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Gauchos came back from 11 points down with 2:20 remaining 
against Fullerton to win in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton folded in that game, missing six free throws in a row down the 
stretch and in overtime. Santa Barbara outscored them, 21-2, and walked away 
with an eight-point overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos didn't give Fullerton a chance to return the favor. 
</P>
<P>
"We had good execution down to the wire tonight," UC Santa Barbara Coach Jerry 
Pimm said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara (17-6, 10-4) came into Thursday's game having won eight of its 
past 10 games, with the only losses to Nevada Las Vegas and New Mexico State, 
both by two points. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Ceballos, Fullerton looked as if it might give Santa Barbara trouble 
again. The Titans had a 41-38 lead in the second half after consecutive fast 
breaks led by Ceballos, who rebounded and then took control of the break 
himself, finishing one with a three-point play and dishing to Wayne Williams, 
who hit Dareck Crane for an open jumper on the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Amazing," Pimm said. "Ceballos is one of the best if not the best in the 
conference. He plays so well on the backboards. We had two guys blocking him 
out on some plays and he still got the rebound." 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Barbara's Carrick DeHart came back and settled things, hitting three 
three-point baskets in less than three minutes to pull the Gauchos ahead by 
51-43 with nine minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton tried to come back, and narrowed the lead to three-points twice in 
the final minute, but couldn't get closer. 
</P>
<P>
DeHart finished with 20 points, and McArthur had 16 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gray's 25-point performance, a career high, was the key for Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who was averaging 12 points, took advantage of lax interior defense and 
Fullerton foul trouble inside. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Mark Hill, who had played the worst game of his career against 
Santa Barbara last month, did worse than that this time, going one for 11 and 
scoring a career-low three points. 
</P>
<P>
He scored six on one of 15 shooting in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark Hill had two bad games against UCSB this year," Fullerton Coach John 
Sneed said. "They were in his face the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
Agee Ward added 14 for Fullerton (12-11, 6-8), and Wayne Williams scored 11. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Keith Starr, who resigned his position as a Cal State Fullerton assistant coach 
last week, was at Thursday's game. He called the decision to resign "mutual," 
saying he planned to leave at the end of the season anyway. "I think they 
wanted to bring someone else in on the recruiting," Starr said. Fullerton 
sources said Starr did not enjoy recruiting and Coach John Sneed was not 
pleased with his efforts. . . . Fullerton point guard Wayne Williams did not 
start because he was arrived late for pregame meetings, but entered the game 
after four minutes, replacing senior Marlon Vaughn.

John Sykes, Cal State Fullerton's starting center at the beginning of the 
season, has been dropped from the team, Fullerton Coach John Sneed said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"John Sykes is through for the year," Sneed said. "He missed the team meeting 
yesterday and hasn't been attending study hall." 
</P>
<P>
Sykes had missed six games this season because of disciplinary suspensions or 
illness, and had not been expected to play any more this season even if he was 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him the benefit of the doubt but he hasn't turned his ways around," 
Sneed said. ROBYN NORWOOD

EX-MARINA PLAYER GEORGESON INJURED IN AUTO ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Georgeson, a sophomore center on the Pepperdine basketball team and a 
former Marina High School player, was seriously injured early Thursday in a 
head-on collision while driving in Malibu Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Georgeson suffered a broken pelvis and three broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
He was listed in serious but stable condition Thursday afternoon at Westlake 
Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred as Georgeson was driving from Pepperdine to his residence 
in Calabasas after Wednesday night's game against Loyola Marymount. A 
spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol said Georgeson, 20, was driving 
north on Malibu Canyon Road when he went into the southbound lane and collided 
with a car driven by Parkie Singh, 52, of Malibu. Singh was listed in critical 
but stable condition at Westlake Community Hospital Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
A CHP spokeswoman said a ticket probably would not be issued. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-10 Georgeson, a 1987 graduate of Marina High in Huntington Beach, 
has started 17 games this season and is averaging four points and 2.5 rebounds. 
He spent the 1987-88 season as a redshirt at Arizona and transferred to 
Pepperdine in December of 1988. KOLLEN LONG

A FEW COMPANIES CLEAN UP SUPPLYING OIL CLEANUP GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THUAN LE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phillip Mamatas was awakened at 2:30 a.m. Saturday by an unusual business phone 
call. Someone wanted to place an order for 100 rain suits, 100 hard hats, 24 
pairs of rubber boots and 20 eyewash bottles -- and they wanted them delivered 
to Long Beach on the double. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the odd hour, Mamatas, president of Century Safety Instruments &amp; 
Supply Corp. in Orange, was not surprised by the call when he heard who the 
customer was. It was Southwest VECO Inc., the Long Beach company hired by 
British Petroleum Co. to clean up the huge oil spill off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Since last Friday, when BP asked VECO to help clean up the spill, VECO has 
bought $850,000 in supplies and equipment from about two dozen Southern 
California companies for use in the beach mop-up operation, said Sharon 
Hagelstrom, a VECO spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Century Safety has received a nice chunk of that business -- $71,000 to be 
exact -- for a variety of equipment including megaphones and life rings. 
</P>
<P>
While the spill has been a tragedy for the Orange County coastline, a small 
bright spot is that it has generated a good deal of business for some Southern 
California firms. 
</P>
<P>
The spill "has almost doubled my business for this month," Mamatas said. "But I 
didn't want this to happen here or anywhere. I live within a mile of the 
beach." 
</P>
<P>
Out of the 23 suppliers hired by VECO, only four were Orange County firms. The 
remainder are located in Long Beach or elsewhere in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Cates, VECO's purchasing director, said his firm relied primarily on Los 
Angeles County companies that it has done business with in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"We're based in Long Beach, so we do a lot of our business in Long Beach," 
Cates said. "When you call up vendors in the middle of the night, they're going 
to expect cash. It's nice if you have established credit with these vendors 
already." 
</P>
<P>
Besides hard hats and boots, VECO has purchased a host of other supplies to 
clean up the oily mess: 125,000 plastic trash bags, 58,500 absorbent pads, 
45,000 rain suits, 13,500 rubber gloves, 240 flashlights, 20 portable light 
poles and 16 cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the cost of all that equipment, VECO is spending about $200,000 
per day to pay the cleanup crews, Hagelstrom said. VECO was also the prime 
contractor for last year's disastrous Exxon-Valdez oil spill clean-up in 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Since Monday morning, suppliers have been flooding VECO with phone calls to 
offer their services -- and leaving phone numbers where they can be reached at 
night, Cates said. 
</P>
<P>
Mamatas and Century Safety's general manager, Mike Luzzi, said they took turns 
delivering the supplies to the shoreline clean-up site from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Luzzi said VECO uses inexpensive vinyl and rubber rain gear to protect the 
cleanup crews from toxic oil. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an intelligent and cost-effective way of doing things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While VECO has been ordering more equipment each day, VECO says the bulk of 
supplies have already been purchased. 
</P>
<P>
For Century Safety, the spill clearly has been a windfall. The company has 
already supplied more than 8,700 rain suits, 4,000 goggles, 1,000 hard hats and 
2,000 pairs of gloves.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: DISTRIBUTED LOGIC POSTS A PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Distributed Logic Corp., the Anaheim computer products company, posted a net 
income of $18,641 for fiscal 1989, contrasted with a loss of $2.2 million for 
the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the year ended Oct. 31 rose slightly, to $51.5 million from $51.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter of 1989, however, the company reported a net loss of 
$15,675, contrasted with a loss of $1.9 million for the period in 1988. Revenue 
increased 19%, to $13.5 million from $11.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn C. Salley, Distributed chairman and chief executive, said net income was 
adversely affected by interest expense, foreign currency translation losses and 
unfavorable international tax charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Although this resulted in a net loss for the fourth quarter, we were 
profitable for the full year, which is a significant improvement over the prior 
two fiscal years," he said.

Ropak Corp.: The Fullerton maker of plastic packaging and handling products 
said that 1989 net income dropped to $807,000 from $2.9 million a year ago, 
despite a 6% gain in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed the decrease on intense competition, a rise in costs and 
unused production capacity that resulted from the company's expansion. Revenue 
for the year rose to $94.4 million from $88.8 million. For the fourth quarter, 
Ropak lost $97,000; it reported a net income of $493,000 for the period in 
1988. Revenue declined 5%, to $20.5 million from $21.6 million.

<P>
Showley-Wrightson is an unlikely name for a restaurant, but then again 
Showley-Wrightson is an unlikely restaurant. The proprietors, Grant Showley and 
Shirley Wrightson, are a married couple, and the food they serve reflects their 
background as cooking teachers. Because they can cook in almost any style, they 
do. Lyon, Jakarta and Santa Fe could be envisioned as tri-cities in the 
restaurant's tiny kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tiny restaurant, too, tucked away in a hard-to-find shopping mall called 
Eastbluff, in a ritzy part of Newport Beach. The owners have tried to give the 
place some atmosphere -- a collection of posters depicting life in provincial 
France, white tablecloths and candles at night -- but the look is still that of 
an upscale grocery store with tables. Racks of comestibles like good imported 
olive oil and fancy pastas line the room, which is papered bath shop-style in 
dotted white. A real estate agent might key on the word cozy in his description 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
But as a neighborhood restaurant, Showley-Wrightson works perfectly. I know 
some local people who wouldn't dream of eating anywhere else, and they are not 
alone. The wide variety of entrees caters to every taste. The menu changes 
daily. Owner Wrightson is a friendly woman, and she greets every one of her 
customers like house guests. "I can procure just about anything for a customer 
with a few days' notice," she says, "and if I can't, neither can anybody else." 
When I ask her about Bresse chicken, she says, "Give me until Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
The candles were flickering one Friday evening as we took our seats, and the 
music of Vivaldi reverberated throughout the crowded room. Little canapes of 
shrimp mousse and spinach-laced ricotta were served to us on a silver tray, 
making the greetings from our two servers seem even more genteel. Service is 
warm and relaxed in this restaurant, with noble attempts to render the 
experience more European. (Silverware is replaced between courses. Butter is 
served in little crocks.) 
</P>
<P>
We began with wonderful breads, a dense, chewy walnut bread and fougasse, a 
Provencal flat bread topped with onions. I could have gone on eating bread all 
night -- if I had, I would have left in total contentment. 
</P>
<P>
But I didn't. Subsequent courses exposed the major problem at 
Showley-Wrightson: many dishes here are more adapted than reproduced. And while 
all are well-crafted, their flavors seem muted, minimally spiced, ephemerally 
smoked, lightly salted, quickly simmered. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point: the pate plate. When it arrived everyone's eyes got a little 
bigger. But when we tasted the components our initial hopes were dashed. The 
duck rillettes actually could have used more fat (that's where the real flavors 
come from). The chicken-liver mousse needed more texture (Gerber couldn't have 
made it much smoother). Thanks to a fine, grainy country pate served with an 
excellent pear chutney and a superb mustard, we finished off somewhat 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
A tomato bisque was food-processor silky, but though the basil in it was 
clearly visible, it was not easy to taste. The lentil soup was better, a light 
broth with carrots, onions and delicately stewed lentils. That soup had real 
flavor, though I would have liked it better with a little more garlic. 
</P>
<P>
About the best of the main courses that night was Tante Paulette's garlic 
chicken, boned chicken sauteed with unpeeled garlic cloves and brandy. The 
caramelized garlic was especially delicious. But I couldn't help noticing that 
the chicken tasted as if it had been partially boiled before hitting the saute 
pan. Tante Paulette would never take a shortcut like that. 
</P>
<P>
Some entrees listed on the menu that night seemed so interesting we couldn't 
resist ordering them. Indonesian lamb loin, served with chutney and, according 
to the menu, rice sticks, was one of them. But the rice sticks turned out to be 
ordinary fried rice, and the lamb, while fresh and tender, had none of the 
perfumed coriander or turmeric that I associate with Indonesian cooking. 
Tortelli with spinach, ricotta and Parmesan -- advertised as pasta rounds -- 
was in reality one giant sombrero of baked pasta with a rather innocuous 
filling. I thought it looked and tasted like a German pancake. 
</P>
<P>
On a second visit I found more of the bright spots. Risotto with asparagus, 
shrimp and fresh spinach was perfectly cooked, and nicely balanced. I could 
taste several divergent flavors in every forkful. Grilled tenderloin of beef, 
lightly smoked over grapevines and sauced with red wine and porcini mushroom, 
would have been at home in any of the great restaurants of Tuscany. 
</P>
<P>
If you have room after your culinary world tour there is a dessert tray filled 
with homemade goodies. Two stand out: One is the flour-less chocolate cake, a 
dense wedge so popular with the table that the person who ordered it surrounded 
it with empty wine glasses to keep the rest of us at bay; the other is the 
ginger-snap ice cream with ginger-snap cookies on the side, a 
raised-consciousness version of ice cream and cookies. This is an adult 
dessert, but it arouses childish emotions. With a little more nerve, most of 
the other dishes in this restaurant could do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Showley-Wrightson is moderately priced. At lunch time, attractive salads like 
chicken lemon, Tex-Mex potato, and mushroom feta, are offered in combinations 
for $8.75. Picnic baskets, filled with goodies that Lynn Redgrave wouldn't 
touch, are $20. At dinner, appetizers are $5.50 to $8. Main dishes are $12.50 
to $18.

AUDIENCE GETS TOO INVOLVED IN 'CUCKOO'S NEST' STAGING

HUNTINGTON BEACH

<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Beach Playhouse tries, almost literally, to pull us into "One 
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." The small theater has been turned into a mental 
hospital ward; audience seats mingle with those of patients, who wander about 
and are apt to take a breather by sitting down beside you. 
</P>
<P>
The program comes disguised as an "admittance folder" for Oregon State 
Hospital; the cast box shares billing with a list of rules telling everybody 
how to behave. Please avoid "teasing or exciting to violence any of the 
patients" and don't stray far from the burly staff escorts. 
</P>
<P>
Director Gregory Cohen's approach (based on David C. Roster's concept) is 
interesting, and the crowd at a recent performance seemed intrigued, at least 
initially. But the idea is a mistake -- not a fatal one, but still a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Wasserman's adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel is not so much about 
environment or atmosphere as it is about personalities and ideas, as embodied 
in the psychological battle between repressive Nurse Ratched and the 
anti-establishment loser, Randle P. McMurphy. 
</P>
<P>
By nearly making us an accessory to the action, Cohen dilutes that struggle 
instead of steeping it. The confrontation should be seen from a distance, with 
the audience as outside observers able to develop judgments without feeling too 
involved. That's why "Cuckoo" worked as a play and, especially, as a movie. 
Cohen lets the atmosphere of the ward press too close; it's overwhelming at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
On a more practical level, the seating's organization presents a gamble for any 
ticket holder. It's a challenge to see all that's going on, particularly if you 
end up with a bad vantage point. Many people were craning (a few in the back 
even stood a couple of times) to take it all in. 
</P>
<P>
The characterizations of Mitchell J. Mills as McMurphy and Patti Patronite as 
Nurse Ratched also weren't as revealing as they could have been. Mills did have 
the requisite earthiness and an I-can-wrestle-the-devil! kind of street 
bravado, but there wasn't enough leaderly charisma glaring through. He wins the 
other inmates over very quickly, and with this McMurphy, it seems too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Patronite resorted to mean stares and a few short, cutting declarations to 
communicate Nurse Ratched's egomania, but what we needed was more information 
on why she's so nasty and controlling at heart. To be sure, it's the play's 
most difficult role -- how do you illuminate a character intent on remaining a 
cipher to everybody she comes in contact with? -- but the actor must find ways 
to connect us to it. 
</P>
<P>
The production's best performances came from the cadre of inmates that Ratched 
systematically ruins and McMurphy influences. Ken Meyers gave an intelligent 
reading of the complicated, preening Harding, and Michael Gaffney's Billy 
Bibbit was the lost sufferer he's supposed to be. 
</P>

MIXED BAG OF OFFERINGS AT UCI FACULTY CONCERT

<P>
Things were looking pretty grim at the Wednesday night opening of UC Irvine's 
faculty dance concert when the curtain rose, midway through the program, on 
Donald McKayle's "Ringalevio." 
</P>
<P>
A wooden attempt at Fokine's "Les Sylphides," staged by Kathy Auten under 
Donald Bradburn's supervision, was weighed down by mechanical phrasing and 
myriad problems with myriad arms and feet. Israel Gabriel's premiere, "Mirage," 
to the music box-gone-awry score of Grant Rohr, was a laughably awful pastiche 
of modern dance cliches and gimmicks, including gratuitous semi-nudity and 
entrances made via a stage-floor pneumatic lift. 
</P>
<P>
James Penrod's "Septenarius: Suite for Seven Women," to (unspecified) music by 
Vivaldi, looked like a Cliff Notes version of Paul Taylor's signature style. A 
constant stream of runs, turns, walks and jetes kept seven women moving from 
one side of the stage to the other, but without the freshness and muscular 
purpose that imbue the original. 
</P>
<P>
And then, zap! Along came McKayle's premiere, crackling with sexual energy and 
powerhouse dancing by the "Raptors" and "Marauders," particularly Achmed Valk, 
Tom Smith and Kathy Auten. Named after the children's game in which members of 
one group capture members of the other, "Ringalevio" features hot-to-trot 
teen-agers wearing leopard print tights, vests, big hair and micro-minis. 
</P>
<P>
Smokey music by Astor Piazzolla set up the grinding hips, the backbends, the 
stretches, the conjurers' gestures and the legs that step and retreat as if on 
a spring. The thrill of the piece comes from the dancers' cat-like shifts of 
weight and almost palpable quality of tensile strength. 
</P>
<P>
The program concluded with another premiere, Pat Carney's deftly workmanlike

Most years, the bomb squad at the Orange County Sheriff's Department is as busy 
as the Los Angeles Police and Sheriff's departments combined. The squad's seven 
staff members and two dogs handle close to three calls a day. 
</P>
<P>
The team provides Orange County's 29 cities with complete combustible care. But 
does Orange County fit the profile of a place in need of an elite force of 
fuse-snuffers? 
</P>
<P>
According to Lt. George Johnson, bomb squad manager, the average bomb-builder 
fits right in with Orange County demographics. "Playing with bombs is not a 
ghetto crime," he notes. "Generally, bomb-builders are white males in their 
early 20s with an above-average education. Building a bomb requires a little 
foresight, a little planning, a little knowledge and a little more 
sophistication than, say, committing a crime with a gun." 
</P>
<P>
If January is indicative of the 1990 trend, the team will have to expand its 
staff. In the first seven days of the new year, nine bombings were 
investigated. And since 1987, calls have increased each year. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from investigating bomb explosions, the squad disposes of dangerous, 
unstable chemicals that often turn up in high school chemistry labs. And while 
not every call uncovers a bomb in a briefcase, ultimate care is used to handle 
each situation. "Right now, my people still have all their fingers and toes," 
Johnson says. "We'd like to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at bomb-squad activity during the last five years:

The first month of the new decade brought with it $19.4 million for county 
cities -- the State Board of Equalization's latest allocation of sales and use 
tax revenues. The $2.45 million sent to Anaheim was the largest amount for any 
one city and 13% of the total sent to municipal coffers. Costa Mesa, however, 
scored the largest per-capita allocation. Villa Park had both the smallest 
total and per-capita amounts. 
</P>
<P>
The county's total allocation this month, $20.66 million ranked it above all of 
the contiguous counties except Los Angeles. Our per-capita amount, however, was 
highest of the five. 
</P>
<P>
Each month city and county governments and other governmental organizations 
receive payments from the state in anticipation of actual sales tax revenues. 
In the fourth month, they receive a cleanup payment -- the difference between 
actual revenues and the amounts previously received -- plus the first advance 
payment for the next quarter. The amounts listed here are for the second 
advance payment for the fourth quarter of 1989.

SINGLE LIFE: LOW SELF-IMAGE BRINGS HIGH RISK OF JEALOUSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN CUMMINGS, Evan Cummings is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An acquaintance recently broke an engagement with her fiance because he could 
not control his bouts of jealousy. For three years she was steadfastly loyal, 
yet he continued to look for evidence to support his fears. Such non-events as 
her arriving home a half-hour late or speaking with another man were contorted 
into clandestine affairs in his fertile imagination. 
</P>
<P>
How could people feel jealous about someone who has chosen to spend time with 
them? And if jealous people really believe that their partner is scouting 
around for someone better, why not just cut them loose? 
</P>
<P>
The answer: Jealous people are not emotionally healthy, Dr. David Viscott says. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes on in a lot more relationships than people care to admit," says the 
Los Angeles-based psychiatrist and KABC Talkradio host, who for two hours each 
weekday dispenses advice to 82,000 Orange County listeners -- one-third of his 
total audience -- according to KABC listener demographics. 
</P>
<P>
"Jealousy is nothing more than the lack of belief in your own worth to the 
point where you no longer feel that the feelings generated by you in another 
person are special," he says. Viscott believes that some people measure their 
own self-worth by the affections of another. "They experience anxiety any time 
that they cannot feel the other person actively in love with them." 
</P>
<P>
He says that since love itself is a peculiar emotion -- and fickle by 
definition -- a partner's feelings are sometimes inconstant "because there are 
times when that person does not feel good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
What if a partner seems intent on making you feel jealous? Viscott says that a 
person with a strong belief in himself will not feel threatened, even if his 
partner is obviously flirting with another. 
</P>
<P>
People are attracted to other people throughout life, and this does not 
necessarily portend infidelity, he says. 
</P>
<P>
A person who is overtly flirtatious may be trying to see how bound he or she is 
to the relationship, he explains. 
</P>
<P>
"They are testing out what it feels like to have an affair or to be unfaithful 
right in front of their partner's eyes; therefore it can't be that serious a 
thing. The person will rationalize that they are permitted this testing 
excursion. If the partner doesn't react, they may think that the partner 
doesn't care and that they should continue the behavior until the other person 
does care." 
</P>
<P>
But these kind of individuals, he warns, never put responsibility on themselves 
or ask themselves "What do I want?" or "Does what I'm doing feel right?" 
</P>
<P>
If a partner is being unkind or obnoxious about flirting, chances are that the 
relationship is punctuated by jealousy and the behavior is probably ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
Viscott cautions that "the person who lives with a jealous person is in a 
jealous relationship" and contends that the weakest trait of the weakest 
partner defines a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"Living in a jealous relationship is basically living in a place where the 
person you love doesn't love himself and is accusing you of not loving him, so 
that whether or not this is true, you are constantly living with false 
accusations." 
</P>
<P>
Since such accusations hurt, the result is a buildup of anger toward the 
accuser, Viscott says. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are pushed into a defensive position you are irritated all the time. 
Sometimes you may act in an openly flirtatious manner with the sole purpose of 
hurting your partner's feelings just because they are so vulnerable to 
jealousy." 
</P>
<P>
People who are overtly jealous, he says, often see their partner as just an 
object. "They believe that someone else -- an acquisition -- is the answer, 
instead of believing they are enough all by themselves." That, he says, can 
lead to believing that the other person is worthy of someone greater than you. 
</P>
<P>
Viscott offers the following suggestions if you find yourself caught in the 
clutches of the green-eyed monster, or when someone falsely accuses you of a 
transgression: "Say to them, 'You are feeling insecure, aren't you? Why?' " 
</P>
<P>
Viscott's advice to those immobilized by jealousy: "Ask yourself why you don't 
believe in yourself. Then find something to do that makes you feel good about 
yourself independent of the other person."

STYLE: NEARLY ALL CLOTHING IS FIT TO BE DYED 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Something has happened to tie-dye since the days of peace marches and love-ins. 
It's become respectable. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise your local mall and you'll see tie-dyed rainbows and spirals brightening 
the clothing racks. 
</P>
<P>
It seems as if every imaginable garment has been dipped into dyes. 
</P>
<P>
There are tie-dyed bikinis in electric Kool-Aid colors at Robinson's, an 
elegant tie-dyed jacket and skirt ensemble in green and aqua hues at Nordstrom, 
ethnic-style pants and matching tops tie-dyed in black with wide 
rainbow-colored stripes at Charlotte Russe in South Coast Plaza, and even 
low-priced neon tie-dyed children's tops and leggings at Target. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the '60s has so much tie-dyed clothing been seen in the boutiques of 
Laguna Beach, which carry casual clothing favored by the area's artists and 
beach-goers. "We're incorporating tie-dye into modern styles, says Lynne 
Atkinson, the buyer for Ivory Moon, a Laguna clothing boutique. The boutique 
has tie-dye harem pants and crop tops, oversized T-shirts and leggings and even 
Polo-style shirts for its more conservative customers. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing tie-dyed clothing hanging from the racks of department stores and 
boutiques, it's easy to forget that tie-dye was once outlaw attire -- the 
defiant threads of the '60s counterculture. What could be further from 
corporate pinstripes than those psychedelic colors, swirling and bleeding all 
over a T-shirt? 
</P>
<P>
This new generation of tie-dye has turned mainstream. Although the most 
spectacular shirts can still be had in the parking lots of Grateful Dead 
concerts, it's no longer just aging hippies who are wearing tie-dye or stirring 
up batches of T-shirts in their garages. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Merklinger, an instructor with Piecemakers Country Store in Costa Mesa, 
remembers tie-dyeing a single T-shirt in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Although she graduated from high school in 1966 -- just in time for an 
18-year-old to fall headlong into the anti-Establishment movement -- she came 
from an isolated small town and "wasn't into that hippie business." 
</P>
<P>
Not until two decades had passed did she again decide to experiment with 
tie-dye. Now she's into that hippie business in a big way, tie-dyeing clothing 
to sell at the Fig Leaf, a clothing shop at Piecemakers, and teaching a tie-dye 
class to those who want to rediscover this once rebellious folk art, regardless 
of their age or political persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
"We get people here who look like they never left the '60s and we get 
70-year-old ladies," Merklinger says. 
</P>
<P>
"Today tie-dye has a whole different feeling," she says. "In the '60s people 
thought of tie-dye as the hippies and the youth movement. Now we cater to older 
ladies. It's not just for kids any more." 
</P>
<P>
What brings tie-dye back to Orange County in these conservative times? 
</P>
<P>
Merklinger says brighter colors and crisper lines have again turned people on 
to tie-dye, thanks to today's fiber-reactive dyes that produce richer tones 
than those used in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then, you tie-dyed with Rit (a household dye) or berries, depending on 
where you were at," she says. The dyes bled more, so shirts often had a 
muddier, washed-out look. 
</P>
<P>
Reactive dyes become part of the fiber instead of coating or hibernating 
between fiber pores, so they produce clear, vibrant colors. 
</P>
<P>
"The dyes can go from a soft pastel pink to this deep fuchsia," says 
Merklinger, showing off a T-shirt she's wearing that has what looks like white 
clouds against an almost purple sky. "It's not all bright and wild." 
</P>
<P>
Conservative dressers can tie-dye clothes in a single color, with simple 
stripes running through the fabric. It's as close to pinstripes as tie-dye ever 
gets. 
</P>
<P>
People enjoy the sometimes messy craft of tie-dyeing because it allows them to 
work with their hands, Merklinger says, and they can create something that is 
unique and entirely their own. 
</P>
<P>
"Each tie-dye is different. You can use the same pattern and the same dyes, but 
no two will be alike," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons tie-dyed patterns are as individual as snowflakes is because there 
is no way to predict exactly how the dyes will penetrate into the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
Individuality is another reason tie-dye is appealing in this homogenous, 
quality-controlled age. 
</P>
<P>
Merklinger has tie-dyeing down to an inexact science. 
</P>
<P>
In the warehouse where she conducts her classes, she has charts with tiny 
swatches of fabric to illustrate what different recipes of dyes will look like 
when treated on cloth. 
</P>
<P>
She teaches four principal methods of tie-dyeing. Students can squeeze colored 
dyes directly onto the cloth from a squirt bottle, dip the entire garment into 
a tray of dye, splatter the shirt with a paintbrush or spray the dye on with a 
spray bottle for a softer, watercolor effect. 
</P>
<P>
Different patterns can be made by folding, pleating or twisting the fabric or 
tying it with rubber bands, cords, string or tape. The dye won't bleed through 
areas where the fabric has been tightly tied or fixed with rubber bands. 
</P>
<P>
Binding the garment tightly with rubber bands will yield stripes. Wrapping it 
around a piece of twine then scrunching it into gathers will make a cathedral 
pattern resembling a leaded glass window. 
</P>
<P>
Merklinger can tie-dye anything made from at least 50% cotton: socks, sweat 
shirts, blouses, skirts, scarfs, hats and tops. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't anything you can't do with tie-dye," she says.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) on Thursday became the first California 
legislator to endorse a proposed "clean government initiative" that would limit 
lawmakers to serving 12 years in each house of the Legislature, as well as use 
public financing for political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Killea said she will help support backers of the measure -- written by 
California Common Cause, Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, and San Jose Mayor Tom 
McEnery -- who hope to gather 700,000 signatures to put the measure on the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this initiative has been unfairly portrayed as an attack on the 
state Legislature," Killea said about a measure that has drawn opposition from 
many current legislators. "It is not." 
</P>
<P>
Killea also said she would support another ballot measure aimed at cleaning up 
the Legislature's ethics image by banning the payment of speaking fees to 
lawmakers while establishing a new commission to set legislative salaries. It 
would also set a limit on gifts and tightens conflict-of-interest regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The second ballot measure is being drafted by the Legislature in response to 
recent scandals, including the conviction of former Sen. Joseph Montoya 
(D-Whittier) on political corruption charges, as well as public opinion polls 
that show the public holds its legislators in low regard.

Twin brothers who operated a travel agency in 1988 that stranded 185 junior 
high school students on the East Coast after running out of money pleaded not 
guilty Thursday to conspiracy to commit mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony and Leo Casias, both 50 and from San Diego, appeared before U.S. 
Magistrate Roger McKee and were told to return to court Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers, who operated East/West Travel and Tours in Mission Valley, became 
the focus of publicity in May, 1988, when the students' passes for hotels and 
airlines were not honored. The passes were part of a travel package sold by the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Other schools that had planned trips through the same firm had those trips 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The felony charge against the brothers alleges that they conspired to use the 
mail to defraud students and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
The Casias brothers were ordered released on $75,000 bail each, secured by a 
property bond.

Herb Cawthorne, the controversial black leader threatened with a lawsuit over 
alleged mismanagement of San Diego Urban League funds, has taken over the helm 
of the Black Federation of San Diego, the organization announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne assumed his duties as chairman and chief executive officer of the 
federation Monday, said Vernon Sukumu, the organization's former executive 
director who now holds the title of president. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 3, Cawthorne resigned from his half-time post as an executive for the 
Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce, little more than four months after he 
had taken the job. On June 7, Cawthorne abruptly quit the Urban League amid 
still unexplained allegations that he had mismanaged the organization's funds. 
</P>
<P>
The Urban League decided last month to sue Cawthorne to recover almost $30,000 
in funds and costs, according to sources familiar with the decision, but no 
legal papers have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne, who takes over an organization with a $50,000 debt, will be involved 
in fund raising, both for the organization and black social service groups, and 
programs to develop low-cost housing, Sukumu said. 
</P>
<P>
Cawthorne could not be reached for comment.

<P>
CYCLING: KENNY ADAMS AND JAMIE PAOLINETTI TEAM UP TO TAKE ON TOUR OF THE 
AMERICAS, THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL EVENT OF THE 1990 BIKE RACING SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago, Kenny Adams of San Clemente started trying to support himself 
by riding his bicycle. Even for professional cycling, a sport with more than 
its share of inclines, it was an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Paolinetti, on the other hand, was more of a natural when it came to 
sports. But after a professional baseball career failed to materialize, 
Paolinetti of Newport Beach picked up a bike after a surfing session one day 
and less than a year later, was one of the top amateur riders in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Though the two took different paths, Adams and Paolinetti have ended up 
together on the American Commerce National Bank cycling team in the Tour of the 
Americas, which starts today in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The Tour of the Americas, the first international event of the 1990 bike racing 
season, will feature such teams as Banesto of Spain, with Pedro Delgado, the 
1988 Tour de France winner, and the 7-Eleven team of the United States. The 
race will take place over eight days in Florida, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday at 2 p.m., ESPN will televise highlights of the stages in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Riding on the three-year-old tour is a breakthrough for the American Commerce 
Bank team, in its second year in existence. Getting invited means that the 
team, based in Corona and sponsored by the one-branch Anaheim bank, has been 
recognized as one of the half-dozen strictly professional teams in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, when he signed on with the American Commerce team, Adams, 28, 
received no such corporate support or attention. In a sport in which teamwork 
is crucial, Adams lacked a team. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, who ran cross-country at San Clemente High, was one of the top riders on 
the junior national team when he was younger and after a layoff of three years, 
he picked up the sport again. As Adams grew more serious about his sport, he 
realized he would have to seek out the best competition possible if he was to 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, who worked for a surfboard accessories manufacturer, decided to 
participate in as many cycling events as his resources would allow. "You can't 
really make it if you are not going to go to the national caliber races," he 
said. "And they are all around the country." 
</P>
<P>
For two years, he depended only on prize money to pay his expenses. He went by 
air to race in places such as Ireland, Seattle and Kansas City. In 1987, he 
took a five-week trip through Utah, Wyoming, Colorado and California, racing 
every week. It was all a part of his plan to win enough to attract attention 
and latch on with a professional team. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the obvious financial liabilities, riders without a team rarely have 
the means to be consistently competitive. They must make do without a crew to 
repair bikes after mishaps and to provide food along the course. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any one can do that for too long," Adams said. "There is just 
too much stress." 
</P>
<P>
Paolinetti never had such worries. 
</P>
<P>
After playing football and baseball at La Habra High School, Paolinetti, now 
26, accepted a partial scholarship to play baseball at UC Riverside. He 
expected significant playing time after batting over .400 for his undefeated 
American Legion the summer before. 
</P>
<P>
But Riverside won the NCAA Division II championship his freshman year with 
Paolinetti on the bench. His playing time didn't increase during his sophomore 
season, and when it didn't appear his junior year would be any better, he 
transferred to UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Paolinetti, expected to play outfield or third base for the Anteaters, but 
during the year he was required to sit out, he became interested in surfing and 
competitive karate. 
</P>
<P>
Upon a friend's suggestion, he tried cycling and was immediately successful. 
Within two months of racing, Paolinetti qualified for the national amateur 
championships in 1986. Though he couldn't make it to the championships because 
the local team he was racing for lacked funds and he lacked a reputation, he 
was convinced his talent was genuine. 
</P>
<P>
"The (qualifying) race was 110 miles long and I never had ridden my bike that 
far in my life," Paolinetti said. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from UC Irvine with a degree in social ecology, but gave up a job 
as an L.A. County Sheriff to concentrate on cycling, and was hired last season 
by the American Commerce team. 
</P>
<P>
American Commerce members are paid subsistence-level salaries, allowing them to 
do nothing but ride during the racing season, February through October. 
</P>
<P>
That gives riders such as Paolinetti and Adams the freedom to ride five to 
seven hours a day, 400 to 500 miles a week. The riders said total commitment is 
necessary to be successful at such events as the Tour of the Americas with its 
$150,000 purse and international competition. 
</P>
<P>
"The sport demands every bit of energy you have," Paolinetti said. "So any 
extra energy that you exert other than in training or racing is energy you 
could have better used in a race."

RETURN OF THE CELLULOID RHINESTONE AND OLD PASTE 
</P>

Vintage jewelry is having its moment -- again. Ask Joan Collins, Diana Ross, 
Cher, Farrah Fawcett. All of them are clients of Connie Parente, a jewelry 
collector who lately has supplied the stars, and anybody else who likes the 
aging baubles, from her Ali Baba-like studio in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna, who was covered with Parente's trinkets for her "Material Girl" music 
video, picked up another stash for a new video in the works. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Parente has made a living out of a childhood passion. Growing up 
in St. Louis she played with costume jewelry from the '20s and '30s that her 
mother's friends passed on to her. At the local department store she made a 
beeline to the estate jewelry counter. 
</P>
<P>
"I always loved old stuff," she says, "the voluptuous, romantic pieces. Finally 
I couldn't stand it; it drove me crazy. I just wanted jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
In 1969 when she moved to Los Angeles, a career was born. To make a living and 
do what she loved, she began going to flea markets and swap meets where she 
would buy, and later resell. 
</P>
<P>
She collected rhinestone bracelets from the '20s made from the same celluloid 
as movie film. Later the material was declared illegal because of its 
flammability. Now, celluloid rhinestones are very rare. She bought Bakelite 
plastic jewelry from the '30s and '40s, now prized by collectors. 
</P>
<P>
The serious collector buys with an eye toward design, color and craftsmanship, 
Parente says. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest name these days is Miriam Haskell, whose '40s pearls and 
baroque-style jewelry has skyrocketed in price in the last year and a half, 
Parente explains. 
</P>
<P>
Parente's first rule of flea market shopping for jewelry is this: be sure 
stones are securely set and clasps work. Repair jobs can cost more than the 
original purchase.

It was another scene entirely at the Laurie Anderson concert, across town at 
the Wiltern Theatre. The general fashion effect was minimalist. 
</P>
<P>
Many outfits looked as if they had been layered together after random visits to 
thrift shops. There was little glamour and no glitz, but one definite surprise 
-- a man in an ankle-grazing velvet skirt worn with a dinner jacket. Plenty of 
men, as well as women, wore black leather jackets (Anderson, a performance 
artist-turned-professional musician, often wears one, too) or flowing duster 
coats. But some accessorized with splashes of color. A saffron vest, a ginger 
scarf, cappuccino lipstick or cinnamon-tinted hosiery were reminders that such 
tones do exist, even at rock concerts. Lots of hats, especially bowlers, topped 
off this solemnly chic crowd. MARISSA ROTH

TWO WHO BEGAN FROM SQWEAR ONE 
</P>

<P>
Striking out on their own can be risky, but some young designers still take the 
chance. Henry Duarte and William Berenck of Sqwear are gamblers in that sense. 
</P>
<P>
"We never worked for anyone," says Duarte, 26, who designs the collection, 
while Berenck, 27, manages the business end of the Los Angeles men's wear 
company. "We started fresh, so we have a lot to learn." 
</P>
<P>
That process has resulted in a range of test styles for the 3-year-old company, 
from one-of-a-kind rock clothing to a classics-inspired retail line. 
</P>
<P>
Some proof of that variety is in the list of their music industry clients, from 
the Rolling Stones to pop group New Kids on the Block, and from nouveau beatnik 
Michelle Shocked to hip-hopper Bobby Brown. In fact, Berenck says, 20% to 30% 
of Sqwear's business during the past year has been for the entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it was classic shapes, but we did different fabrications," Berenck 
says of the rock clothing. Jackets, from motorcycle-inspired to traditional 
notched lapels, were the main thrust of the rock wear, although Sqwear also 
sold pants and vests. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's not our main goal," Duarte says about working in show business. 
"It's really two ends. The more extreme and clothes for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The Sqwear label is available at the Traffic and Roppongi boutiques in Los 
Angeles. Pants start at about $250, while jackets are in the $650-range. 
</P>
<P>
"They're young, they're fresh out of school and they're innovative," says Carl 
Dias, the general manager of Traffic, who has been buying Sqwear since the 
company started. "All their stuff was just a little different." 
</P>
<P>
"We started the business while I was in school," says Duarte, who attended the 
Los Angeles Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. "We rented a loft 
space on Spring Street and started making patterns. We didn't even know where 
the California Mart was." 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, they found the downtown trade center for their first show in 1987, 
which consisted, Berenck says, of 12 pieces in one fabric. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Sqwear had something like 35 accounts. The company had revenue of about 
$250,000 in 1989. They readied a store on Main Street in Santa Monica, but "we 
never opened it. We felt it wasn't going to work," Duarte says. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of investing in a store now, the plan is to emphasize retail 
collections. But it isn't the end for Duarte's flashy, one-of-a-kind pieces. 
</P>
<P>
At the recent MARTY awards fashion show at the California Mart, leopard print 
was a recurring theme.

many stylish models with price tags that won't empty your wallet.

The new Minnie Mouse watch by Lorus with a red-and-black polka dot rubber 
wristband is a bit of whimsy for a reasonable $34.95 at Feldmar Watch and Clock 
Center in Los Angeles.

More famous faces in timely places are found in the Memories Collection at the 
Soap Plant in Los Angeles. Autographed photos of Marilyn Monroe and Jimmy Dean

KNBC TO AIR NEWS MAGAZINE IN SEPTEMBER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"The West," a syndicated half-hour news magazine similar to "60 Minutes" but 
devoted exclusively to coverage of the Western United States, Canada and 
Mexico, will air on KNBC Channel 4 beginning in September. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a 'P.M. Magazine' or a tabloid program," senior producer Val 
Nicholas said. "We are an investigative show." 
</P>
<P>
"The West" is produced in Sacramento by Kelly News and Entertainment, a 
subsidiary of Kelly Broadcasting, owner of KCRA-TV in Sacramento. The show 
employs a 35-member staff in Sacramento and a field producer and camera person 
in Seattle. Nicholas said that it intends to add bureaus in Los Angeles, 
Dallas, Phoenix, Denver and Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas said that "The West," which debuted last April, was created because of 
a perception that the region was being neglected by network news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"We found in the initial research that news had an East Coast bias," Nicholas 
said. "If it happened out here, unless it was an earthquake or terrible 
destruction, it wasn't news. We felt there was an appetite for solid 
information and set out to put together a show for that." 
</P>
<P>
The lineup on "The West" last Sunday included stories on the decimation of 
Alaska's walrus population by ivory hunters, the plight of people living under 
the flight training paths of the Air Force's "Top Guns" and the inability of 
researchers to obtain bark from the Yew tree for study of its possible 
cancer-curing properties. 
</P>
<P>
"We think "The West" is fresh and unique," said Pat Wallace, KNBC director of 
broadcasting and promotion. "We think they're doing a terrific job and thought 
it would be an excellent fit with our news and information programming." 
</P>
<P>
KNBC plans to air "The West" as a lead-in to its Sunday newscast at 3:30 p.m, 
Wallace said. In that slot, however, it will be subject to preemption by 
network coverage of the National Football League. In the event of preemption, 
Wallace said, the show will be moved to either Sunday morning or Saturday.

ABC SIGNS JAMES L. BROOKS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABC made its long-simmering deal with Emmy- and Oscar-winning 
writer-producer-director James L. Brooks official Thursday, announcing that it 
had signed him to an exclusive contract under which his company, Gracie Films, 
will develop at least three comedy series for the network. 
</P>
<P>
Gracie Films will continue to produce "The Tracey Ullman Show" and "The 
Simpsons" for Fox Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike ABC's exclusive deal with writer-producer Steven Bochco ("Doogie Howser, 
M.D."), Brooks' does not specify any time constraints on when the projects must 
be developed. 
</P>
<P>
"We want their best work," Robert Iger, president of ABC Entertainment, said of 
Brooks and his associates, "and (we) feel that this agreement, free of the 
usual time strictures, should prove fruitful for both organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks was co-creator of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and wrote and produced the 
films "Terms of Endearment" and "Broadcast News."

PACIFIC-THEMED L.A. FEST HAS 72 PROGRAMS, 300 PERFORMERS; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: DIRECTOR PETER SELLARS PROMISES MORE PARTICIPANTS BEFORE SEPTEMBER, 
DESPITE ONLY $2.9 MILLION IN PLEDGES FOR A $4.9-MILLION BUDGET.

"Los Angeles is going to be the largest showcase of international performing 
and creative artistry . . . ever," proclaimed Mayor Tom Bradley on Thursday at 
a downtown press conference unveiling the first list of programs to be included 
in the Los Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Announced were 72 programs of dance, music, visual art, theater, poetry, film, 
video and performance art, including 14 international groups comprised of 
nearly 300 performers. 
</P>
<P>
Festival director Peter Sellars noted, however, that Thursday's announcement of 
programs was only a partial one for the Pacific-themed festival, which is 
scheduled for Sept. 1-17. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have a couple more announcements of major programs on the way as 
negotiations are completed and the money is raised," Sellars said. He refused 
to say, however, when he would make the next announcement of programming for 
the festival, which has yet to come up with a final version of its logo. 
</P>
<P>
More than $2.9 million in pledges has now been received toward a $4.9-million 
total budget, $1 million less than the 1987 L.A. Festival, which had 352 
artists representing 31 companies and 21 nations. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the announcement were about two dozen film and video programs by 
local, national and international artists, including a weeklong Latin American 
Film Festival and more than 20 hours of KCET (Channel 28) broadcasts including 
documentaries, feature films and performance works. 
</P>
<P>
Also announced were nearly 40 local projects, which festival executive director 
Judith Luther said represented $700,000 worth of programming. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the local works are marimba, gospel and jazz groups, music and 
dance programs by members of Los Angeles' Pacific Island communities, the 
restoration of murals by artists Barbara Carrasco and Willie Herron, an 
anthology of poetry and fiction by Los Angeles writers and a "micro opera" led 
by artist Daniel Martinez in collaboration with playwright Harry Gamboa, 
composer Vinsula, lighting designer Aubrey Wilson and visual artist Diane 
Gamboa. 
</P>
<P>
Represented in the heavily dance oriented international component are groups 
from Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, the islands of Wallis and Futuna, 
Australia and Chile, in addition to a group of harp players from several Latin 
and South American nations. Also considered part of the international 
programming are two groups of Native American musicians and dancers from 
California, Inupiat Eskimo dancers and musicians from Alaska, and traditional 
hula kahiko dancers from Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
While Thursday's announcement in most cases did not include venues for 
individual programs, Sellars did list 38 confirmed sites for festival programs, 
including such outdoor locales as Griffith Park, Angels Gate/Point Fermin Park 
and the African Marketplace at Kenneth Hahn Park; and such usual indoor venues 
as Highways performance space in Santa Monica, the Woman's Building, Hollywood 
Bowl and Japan America Theater. 
</P>
<P>
No announcements were made of programming for the connected Open Festival, 
which will be open to local artists not selected for the L.A. Festival. Those 
performers, while receiving promotional help from the festival, will be 
required to produce their own shows.The Highlights 
</P>
<P>
Program highlights, according to Calendar writers, of the festival as announced 
Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
VISUAL ARTS -- This component of the festival is not huge but includes some 
promising exhibitions of fine arts, artist's video and design. 
</P>
<P>
Among enticing solo exhibitions are Cal State Long Beach's presentation of Gu 
Wen Da, a Chinese artist who lives in New York. He attacks traditional Asian 
ideas of harmonic art by distorting calligraphic characters to create 
large-scale room installations. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Bay Area painter Raymond Saunders will show affectionate jazz-beat 
painting that incorporates aspects of Abstract Expressionism with funky collage 
and popular imagery at Santa Monica City College's gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Museum of Art will bring Seattle artist Norman Lundin to town 
with soft-focus poetic interiors and landscapes that catch the dissolving light 
of the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla artist Robbie Conal, known for his outlaw street-poster political 
satires, will come indoors for a paradoxical "major retrospective" at the 
Pasadena Armory for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Respected video artist Bill Viola will make a festival-commissioned piece on a 
theme of personal isolation and collective revelation at the Santa Monica 
Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Interesting group exhibitions include UCLA's survey of Latino visual art in the 
Wight Gallery's "CARA: Chicano Art and Resistance 1965-1985." The show will 
echo in Loyola Marymount's "Chicana Art in Los Angeles." The legendary 
refinement and visual clout of Japanese graphic design will materialize at the 
Japan American Cultural and Community Center in a 50-year retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 THEATER -- As promised, very little theater will be featured in the L.A. 
Festival, and the highlight may well be the appearance of the Bread and Puppet 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely seen in the Southland, this collective combines pageantry, community 
involvement and giant puppets to make unabashedly political statements. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond this event, what we'll get is mostly new and untested. Mixed disciplines 
and multimedia performance appear to be the order of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Announced offerings include "The Undead," an interdisciplinary, collaborative 
work by Peter C. Brosius (of the Mark Taper Forum's Improvisational Theater 
Project), Dennis Cooper and Ishmael Houston Jones, dwelling on issues of 
identity and interaction among gay teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Chess Piece" is a multimedia performance work by Los Angeles 
artist May Sun to be staged in an outdoor park by her husband Guy Giarrizzo and 
based on chess strategies intertwined with the lives of Chinese and 
Chinese-American women. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at Highways, the Los Angeles Poverty Department, a theater that grew 
out of a workshop for the homeless, will recycle an older piece from its trunk. 
"Jupiter 35" deals with what happens spiritually to a man crippled by a fall 
out of a window during a crack deal. 
</P>
<P>
PERFORMANCE ART -- Performance artist Guillermo Gomez-Pena won a 1989 Bessie 
(N.Y. Dance and Performance) Award for his multicultural perspective as a 
"border artist" exploring the intersection of languages and traditions. For the 
L.A. Festival, he is creating a new piece in which he'll dismantle ethnic 
stereotypes and suggest a new cultural mythology for North America. 
</P>
<P>
Also seen during the 1987 L.A. Festival, Rachel Rosenthal will create a 
multimedia work about the time, 250 million years ago, when the Earth was a 
single continental mass surrounded by water. Dealing with the separation and 
migration of cultures, Rosenthal's "Pangean Dreams" will be presented at the 
Santa Monica Museum. 
</P>
<P>
DANCE -- Under the auspices of Festival Indonesia, three programs of Central 
Javanese court music, dance and puppetry will provide local audiences with an 
extended look at performance traditions known the world over for their 
elegance. The late Sultan Hamangkubawana IX agreed to send his sacred gamelan 
(orchestra) and a complete retinue of dancers and puppeteers (65 performers in 
all) on their first visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
One evening of dance-drama is devoted to the final episodes of "Mahabharata," 
the great Hindu epic that was presented in a three-part English version during 
the 1987 L.A. Festival. Another evening will be shared by two Javanese dance 
forms, and the final program belongs to shadow puppetry. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by didjeridus, sticks, boomerangs and the human voice, 14 
Australian aboriginal dancers from Mornington Island will offer rare glimpses 
of an ancient culture famed for great boldness of design and purity of 
expression. Mornington Island is in an area between Queensland and the Northern 
Territory -- and the dance style there is known for its nervous, quivering 
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Because Pacific Island dancers rarely tour, the visit by a 32-member company 
from the Polynesian islands of Wallis and Futuna (a territory of France) is one 
of the major novelties of the L.A. Festival. The style of the dancing has been 
noted for its lush, almost lyrical energy flow. 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC -- John Adams dominates -- no, is -- the major music component of the 
festival. The efforts of that privileged composer aside, there will be little 
if any contemporary, non-traditional music at the festival. 
</P>
<P>
With the original cast, directed by Sellars, Music Center Opera opens the West 
Coast premiere of Adams' "Nixon in China" -- thoroughly rooted in European 
grand opera -- Sept. 11, with additional performances Sept. 14, 16, 29 and Oct. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
Only one performance of the feature-length silent film, "The Cabinet of Dr. 
Ramirez," at the Hollywood Bowl, is planned, competing with the "Nixon in 
China" opening Sept. 11. "Dr. Ramirez" stars members of the New York-based 
Wooster Group and is directed by Sellars. The accompaniment will be a 
performance of Adams' "Harmonielehre" -- with its conscious evocation of 
Schoenberg and Viennese Expressionism -- by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Local and Latin American harpists and marimba groups will be presented at 
parks. Two local groups of taiko drummers will also be presented outdoors, 
along with international percussion groups including kulintang ensembles from 
the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
FILM/VIDEO -- Besides a tribute to Akira Kurosawa, on the tentative schedule 
are mini-retrospectives for the Japanese master's colleague, Kon Ichikawa 
("Fires on the Plain" and "The Makioka Sisters"), and his two legendary 
contemporaries, Yasujiro Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese section is probably the most impressive of the lineup, but there 
are also strong retrospectives for Mexico's Arturo Ripstein and Jaime Humberto 
Hermosillo -- two of Latin America's most offbeat and accomplished film makers 
-- and for the Philippines' iconoclastic Lino Brocka. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the filmmakers even less known here: Bolivia's Jorge ("Blood of 
the Condor") Sanjines, China's Dai Sijie, Korea's Im Kwon Thek, Colombia's 
Sergio Cabrera and Thailand's Prince Chatri Chalerm Yukol -- whose film, "The 
Elephant Keeper" is an expose on illegal teak logging. 
</P>
<P>
Any or all might prove major discoveries. But certainly the director whose work 
seems to hold the greatest promise is Taiwan's Hou Hsiao-Hsien, whose 1989 
"City of Sadness," about the pro-democracy turbulence in 1947 Taiwan -- won 
great acclaim and the Golden Lion at the 1989 Venice Film Festival -- and who 
will reportedly be represented by eight films, including "Sadness."

FESTIVAL REACHES FOR THE UNKNOWN AND THE EXPENSIVE 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles arts goers are in for a big surprise when the 17-day Pacific-themed 
festival opens in September, according to Judy Mitoma, co-curator of the Los 
Angeles Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"We've picked work that is very seldom brought by other people. Our programming 
is not competitive with any existing presenter in this city," said Mitoma, 
referring to the festival's first group of programs announced Thursday. "Nobody 
else can afford to do it this way. The people that we're bringing are not 
famous celebrities. A lot of this is really unknown, and a lot of people 
couldn't take a chance on that. They want established people with good reviews. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Mitoma, who spent the past couple of years in negotiations with various 
international groups selected for the festival, said that the biggest part of 
her job -- determining the best way to present the work -- is still to come. 
</P>
<P>
"What is risky, however, is if we don't present it properly and people don't 
enter it and therefore they feel alienated. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to find new ways to present the art so people see it in a new way -- 
and we hope that we'll break new ground in an area that has been ignored," said 
Mitoma, noting that the usual Western tendency is to plop everything -- whether 
originally intended for it or not -- under hot lights on a proscenium stage. 
</P>
<P>
One new means of presentation, Mitoma said, will be through an "Earth stage" 
that the festival plans to construct at Angels Gate in San Pedro, where several 
Pacific Island groups will perform. 
</P>
<P>
"When you feel dance pressing on the Earth, you think about what's going on in 
a different way than when it's on a wooden stage. You feel the Earth move. And 
when you're performing, you feel it differently too. (When groups like those 
chosen for the festival perform in the West) often, they will be presented in a 
theater and they don't know quite who they're dancing to. But we want a feeling 
of interaction and response -- we want the give-and-take, the humanity of it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Mitoma said that she and Festival Director Peter Sellars used "pure aesthetic 
choice" to select acts for the international portion of the festival: whether 
the work was representative of its geographic area, and what was relevant and 
interesting to the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the work curated by Mitoma is religious in nature, from the Aboriginal 
music, dance and visual arts of the Australian Mornington Islanders to the 
ritualism of the Korean shamans. While Mitoma admits that such spiritually 
based art may be foreign to some Angelenos, she hopes that such work will cause 
festival goers to consider new concepts. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to say, 'If you look at this work, there is something here 
that speaks to our life in our city,' " she said. "Artists and spiritual 
leaders do not have to be different people. And it's funny, because often our 
artists are spiritual leaders, but they might not be recognized as such. Maybe 
(the festival can make us re-examine) the role of artists in society and our 
definition of artists." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, she said she hopes the festival will make Angelinos re-examine the 
role of art in their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
"A program like the Children of Bali (a group of 28 youngsters selected from a 
single village to illustrate the high level of artistry common to Balinese 
villages) is saying, 'Look, this is from a village -- like a neighborhood or 
your school -- and these children play music. . . . They give back to their 
community.' That's something I wish we had more of here." Mitoma, who is also 
chairwoman of the World Arts and Cultures program at UCLA, said that 
negotiations included spending a week on the islands of Wallis and Futuna, a 
French territory northeast of Fiji. There, Mitoma had to meet and ask 
permission to bring the 32-member music and dance company from French 
governmental representatives, a bishop, three separate kings and several 
cultural chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to understand how their social networks work, you need to get 
permission from everyone understandable, and you have to make sure the people 
you see are seen in the right order," said the 43-year-old Mitoma, who is a 
third-generation Japanese-American, and speaks some Japanese and Indonesian. 
</P>
<P>
Mitoma said that personally, the most satisfying work she curated is the 
65-member Indonesian Javanese court dancers, who have never visited the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if this will ever, ever be possible again, because of the 
economics of doing this," she said. (Festival General Manager Michael Vargas 
estimated a total cost of about $350,000 to transport the court dancers and 
their huge instruments and house and produce their performances here. Sharing 
the costs with the festival is the 18-month-long Festival Indonesia -- which 
will begin during the L.A. Festival (Mitoma is an advisory board member). 
</P>
<P>
But for Mitoma, who herself studied Javanese court dancing and spent almost two 
years in discussions to confirm the appearance of the Javanese troupe, the way 
in which the group's appearance was brought about brings back "intensely 
emotional" memories. 
</P>
<P>
"I was given audience to the Sultan Hamangkubawana of Jakarta -- who was the 
vice president of Indonesia, a revolutionary hero and also a spiritual hero -- 
one month before his (unexpected) death, and that was a very important moment 
in my life," she said. "It was one of those moments when all the paths 
intersected. To have his enthusiastic support was just a tremendous moment for 
me."

Troubled Huntington Beach-based Mercury Savings and Loan Assn., hit last month 
with severe operating restrictions, said today it has cut its staff by 10%, 
producing layoffs of about 70 people. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury, which lost $13.8 million in 1988 and $5.4 million in the first nine 
months of last year, said most of the staff cuts were in lending operations. 
Federal regulators on Jan. 19 ordered the firm to halt all lending and 
investment activities. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift said the cuts also included staff members from other areas and 
several executives, including Ronald Hansen, its chief financial officer since 
1983.

The thrift does not meet any of the capital requirements that went into effect 
for thrifts in December. It became technically insolvent last month with a net 
negative equity of slightly less than $100,000 when it devalued $60.7 million 
in loans outstanding to the owners of the Irvine Marriott and Tulsa Marriott 
hotels.

A burly fighting-dog trainer convicted of involuntary manslaughter because his 
pit bull dog killed a 2-year-old neighbor boy was sentenced today to nearly 
four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a tragic accident. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a living nightmare for me for 2 1/2 years," a sorrowful Michael 
Berry said before being sentenced by Superior Court Judge John A. Flaherty. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had sought to make Berry, 40, the first pet owner in the nation to 
be convicted of murder because of the actions of his dog. But a jury convicted 
him Dec. 22 on the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter and found him 
guilty of two other felonies -- owning a mischievous animal resulting in death 
and cultivating marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Berry's 53-pound dog, Willy, chained in front of a marijuana patch the 
defendant was growing in suburban Morgan Hill, killed 2-year-old James Soto on 
June 13, 1987.

Rhythm-and-blues musician Ike Turner, ex-husband of Grammy Award winning rock 
star Tina Turner, was sentenced in Santa Monica today to four years in state 
prison on his latest conviction in a string of cocaine arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Robert Altman gave Turner, 58, a year's credit off his 
sentence because of time already served in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Turner will have to serve about 18 months before he is eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a drug abuser for 15, 20 years, but has never done any hard time 
until now," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ralph Mayer. "He's going straight to state 
prison." 
</P>
<P>
Turner was convicted Jan. 16 of driving under the influence of cocaine and 
being under the influence of the drug. Jurors, however, deadlocked on charges 
of possessing cocaine and transporting the narcotic. The four charges stemmed 
from Turner's arrest in West Hollywood in May, 1989.

West German officials today unveiled plans for a military defense strategy for 
a united Germany that would include NATO membership, a move opposed by the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The government also announced plans for a 16-state government that would 
encompass West and East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg met with reporters today to 
discuss a common security concept that he said is being drafted by his 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense obligations are indivisible and cannot be weakened for a whole 
Germany," Stoltenberg said, noting that military integration would be an 
important initial step in a single German state. 
</P>
<P>
He said that a cornerstone of the joint force would be its membership in the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Soviet Union has insisted that a united 
Germany be neutral. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Stoltenberg's proposal, the military alignment of a united Germany is 
to be the subject of reunification talks this year among the German states, 
Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
Washington wants at least the West German portion to remain in NATO. East 
Germany is a key component of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg said there likely would be a transition phase during which the East 
and West German armies would be merged. "But we are not going to have two 
different armed forces in a united Germany for long," Stoltenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from the Soviets or opposition leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The governors of West Germany's 11 states met today to discuss how a united 
Germany would be administered. They voted unanimously to pursue a 16-state 
federal structure once the Germanys are united. 
</P>
<P>
They proposed that the East German territory be divided into five states along 
the borders of the traditional regions, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Sachsen, 
Sachsen-Anhalt and Thueringen.

<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, staring across the Korean frontier at North 
Korean soldiers staring back, said today that communism remains a "very hostile 
and threatening" foe in Asia even as it seems to be dissolving in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney slogged through mud and fog to make his way to this mountain-high 
outpost along the frontier that bisects Communist North Korea and the 
capitalist south, which are technically still at war under the longest truce in 
modern military history. 
</P>
<P>
As the defense secretary used bright yellow binoculars to peer north across the 
scrub-covered hills and gullies, a feminine voice wafted across the chill air 
-- a North Korean propaganda broadcast demanding the pullout of U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
In the distance at a small, bunkered North Korean post, two soldiers could be 
seen staring back at the American visitors staring at them from the South 
Korean barbed-wire observation post. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always useful to come back to the demilitarized zone," Cheney told 
reporters accompanying him. "At a time when we are welcoming changes in Eastern 
Europe and the erosion of the Soviet position in the Warsaw Pact, it's 
important to be reminded that the United States and the Republic of Korea still 
face a very hostile and threatening power in the North. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's just as important for us to maintain our determination to protect 
freedom and democracy here in Korea and elsewhere in the world," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney was joined by several Korean generals in symbolically ringing a huge 
bell hung high in a red bell tower perched upon one of the hilltops. The bell 
was rung five times to honor the South Korean 5th Division that guards the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney travels Saturday to Hong Kong before traveling on to the Philippines and 
Japan as part of a two-week Asian tour of the allied nations that host U.S. 
forces.

Changing water temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean may be signaling the 
start of a new El Nino, a climate event that could be felt worldwide, 
government scientists said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The current situation deserves very close attention," the federal Climate 
Analysis Center said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The latest El Nino in 1986 was relatively mild, but one in 1982-83 led to 
weather changes that were blamed for 1,500 deaths and billions of dollars in 
damage across the globe. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to say something is developing that could be like that, because 
that was exceptional," Vernon Kousky of the climate center said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982-83 El Nino was blamed for worsening the devastating drought in Africa 
and causing a series of severe winter storms to come ashore in California. 
</P>
<P>
Kousky's office constantly monitors sea surface conditions, and has learned the 
warning signs that an El Nino may be developing.

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN JANUARY TAKES A 1.2% DROP

<P>
Industrial production slipped 1.2% in January, the government said today, as 
abnormally warm weather reduced utility use and auto makers temporarily laid 
off workers to reduce bloated inventories. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve said January's decline followed a revised 0.2% gain in 
output a month earlier as a major strike ended at the Boeing Co. and utilities 
fired up their operations to meet the demand prompted by the fourth-coldest 
December on record. December's increase originally was reported to be 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
January's decline was the first dip in production since a 0.3% drop in October. 
</P>
<P>
"In January, the output of motor vehicles was curtailed drastically, and the 
extremely warm weather caused a sharp drop in utilities' output," the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
Output at utilities fell 10.7% last month, the warmest January in 96 years of 
government weather record-keeping, reversing a huge 6.3% advance in December. 
</P>
<P>
And the layoffs at auto factories drove overall manufacturing production down 
0.9%. Manufacturing output represents 84% of the index. 
</P>
<P>
"Automobile assemblies plunged to a 4.1-million-unit annual rate from a 
6.2-million-unit rate in December," the department said. 
</P>
<P>
The interest-sensitive manufacturing sector has been among the hardest hit by 
Federal Reserve efforts to restrain inflation by keeping a tight grip on 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
Production of durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last more than 
three years -- fell 1.7% after rising 0.3% in December and 0.4% in November. 
</P>
<P>
Non-durable goods production increased 0.2%, reversing a 0.2% decline in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Fed said the operating rate of the nation's factories, 
mines and utilities dipped 1.2 percentage points to 81.9% in January. 
</P>
<P>
Factory use had remained steady at a revised 83.1% in December, largely because 
of the weather-related 5 percentage point hike to 86.4% in the utility rate. 
</P>
<P>
The factory-use rate was 83.1% in both October and November. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85% or above as an indication 
of inflationary pressures.

CANADA'S TRADE SURPLUS SHRINKS

A robust currency and weakening U.S. economic growth shrank Canada's 
merchandise trade surplus last year to its lowest level in a decade, a federal 
agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's exports grew 1.2% in 1989 while imports climbed a more brisk 5.3% for 
a net trade surplus of $4.7 billion ($3.9 billion U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
That was less than half the $9.8 billion ($8.1 billion U.S.) surplus reported 
in 1988 when the Conservative government signed the free trade agreement with 
the United States, promising it would be a boon to business. The pact removed 
remaining tariffs on goods between the nations over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
International Trade Minister John Crosbie has been under attack from opposition 
parties, which opposed free trade, for Canada's deteriorating trade position. 
</P>
<P>
A higher Canadian dollar made exports less attractive abroad last year while 
slashing the cost of such basic imports as clothing.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the agency that insures deposits at 
commercial banks, said today that it brought a $516-million lawsuit against 
Drexel Burnham Lambert, E. F. Hutton and others related to the failure of a 
Texas bank. 
</P>
<P>
The suit stems from an alleged fraud scheme that the FDIC claims led to the 
demise of the Guaranty Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Dallas, the 
sixth-largest thrift in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel, the once-powerful brokerage and investment bank whose parent company 
filed for bankruptcy Tuesday, was a major underwriter of junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Financially troubled E. F. Hutton was acquired in early 1988 by Shearson 
Lehman. Shearson also is named in the suit, the FDIC said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Dallas, seeks $129.2 million in 
actual damages and $387.6 million in punitive damages from Drexel, Hutton, 
Shearson and others.

The Oldsmobile Division of General Motors Corp. today made rare price cuts of 
as much as $500 on the price of two of its models in an unusual attempt to spur 
sales in a sluggish auto market. 
</P>
<P>
While the nation's Big Three auto makers all have incentives in effect to boost 
sales that have slumped since the model year began in October, Oldsmobile 
spokesman Gus Buenz said he did not believe the others had cut base prices this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, this is the first time that I can recall that GM has, and 
certainly Oldsmobile, reduced prices in the model year," he said. "Normally, 
when it occurs, it is at the introduction of a new model year." 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly not the trend. It is unusual," PaineWebber Inc. of New York 
analyst Ann Knight said. "It's not unprecedented. It's done when the models are 
slow. The sales on those models have been weak." 
</P>
<P>
Effective today, the price of Oldsmobile's Ciera S coupe drops $200 to $12,195, 
while the Ciera S sedan's price drops $500 to $12,495. The Cutlass Ciera S 
accounts for 12% of total Oldsmobile sales, which totaled 163,208 between Oct. 
1 and Feb. 10, the current model year.

It was no mystery when "Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation: 1814" went platinum. But 
that number in the title is a mystery to many fans. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that 'R' is the 18th letter in the alphabet and 'N' is the 14th, but 
that's just coincidence, Jackson said in the March 5 issue of US magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"What actually happened," Jackson said, "was that while writing 'Rhythm Nation' 
I was kidding around, saying, 'God, you guys, I feel like this could be the 
national anthem for the '90s.' 
</P>
<P>
"Just by a crazy chance we decided to look up when Francis Scott Key wrote the 
national anthem, and it was September 14, 1814." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said that when she told A&amp;M Records executives what it meant, "They 
didn't want me to say. So I didn't. They still don't want me to say, but 
everyone keeps asking me."

"As I become more successful, I am aware that it affects other Latinos," he 
told Parade magazine in Sunday's issue. "It's imperative that I don't forget 
the homeboys and the old neighborhood. But I'm also an artist and an actor. The 
one thing I want to do with my career is be versatile -- not limit myself."

"I don't recall overt acts of prejudice, but I must have felt them," said 
Smits, who grew up in New York City. "I always felt that I had to prove

"When I started studying acting, it wasn't good enough for someone to say, 'For

Convicted hotel queen Leona Helmsley believes that Donald J. Trump modeled his 
estranged wife, Ivana, after her and says she wouldn't believe the billionaire 
real estate tycoon even "if his tongue were notarized." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview scheduled to be published in the Daily News on Sunday, the 
president of Helmsley Hotels said Trump is "obsessed with me." 
</P>
<P>
"He modeled his wife after me. Really," she was quoted as saying, noting that 
Trump had made his wife president of New York's Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"When Ivana first came into my bedroom years ago, she called Scalamandre Silks 
the next day and told them she wanted everything exactly the way I had it." 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, who is appealing her federal tax fraud conviction, observed that 
Trump's hate for her is reflected in an interview in the March Playboy magazine 
in which he described Helmsley as "a vicious, horrible woman who systematically 
destroyed the Helmsley name." 
</P>
<P>
"Then why does he model his wife after me?" Helmsley asked. "I wouldn't believe 
Trump if his tongue was notarized."

LIZ SMITH: TRUMP CARD: WILLING TO PAY FOR A QUICK END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ SMITH

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can it be that the Ivana and Donald Trump "Split by Media" is winding down? I 
hope so. Newsday reported Thursday that Donald has now decided to give Ivana a 
$100-million settlement, obviating the controversial pre-and-mid-marriage 
agreement for $25 million and the Connecticut house. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know if this decision just sprang from Donald's good heart, or because 
Ivana's attorney, Michael Kennedy, now has the 400-man, Old Guard and 
distinguished New York law firm of White &amp; Case assisting him. 
</P>
<P>
But one wag, speaking of the Mike Kennedy-John Scanlon media blitz in Ivana's 
favor, joked, "If these guys had been handling the Vietnam war, it would have 
ended in three days!" 
</P>
<P>
HERE'S WHAT I hear -- Donald is talking money now for a fast and quick end to 
all of this and he is talking much more money than even the aforesaid $100 
million. The sum is said to be "considerably larger." 
</P>
<P>
Well, think about it before you faint. Trump's empire is said to be worth 
nearly 2 billion bucks. And he can't have relished, the past few days, looking 
like a piker trying to chisel the mother of his three children and his wife of 
a dozen years down to a mere $25 million plus. 
</P>
<P>
SINCE TRUMP is about to have the largest gambling casino in the world, already 
owns the Palm Beach showplace Mar-a-Lago, and is building the biggest yacht, 
etc., maybe Donald has decided he'd also like to have the ex-wife with the 
biggest divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
And when a man's own mother and his two wonderful sisters turn out to support 
his estranged spouse (as Donald's family did on Wednesday), it might make a man 
think twice. 
</P>
<P>
One big influence could be the person Donald respects most in all the world. 
His father, Fred Trump, is beside himself over this entire affair. Trump the 
elder is devoted to Ivana and his three grandchildren. He supposedly has told 
Donald: "If you don't stop what you are doing, it's going to give me a stroke!" 
Fred Trump is a formidable figure, even to the son who has outstripped his 
father's own empire-building. 
</P>
<P>
ONE THING you should know is that the Trumps are still talking to one another. 
Although Ivana was absolutely devastated Thursday by stories that had Donald 
attending the Marble Collegiate Church with Marla Maples, reconciliation IS 
possible. And it seems to be what Ivana really wants. If these two could come 
back together and forgive the hurts and embark on a new course of fidelity to 
one another, then this is what their friends (maybe even their enemies) wish 
for them. Donald did dine several times this past week in the Trump Tower 
apartment with his wife and three children. 
</P>
<P>
And, hey, let's be careful out there, as they say on "Hill Street Blues." So 
far neither Trump has filed ANY divorce papers. Why, Ivana and Donald are not 
even "legally separated."

The state athletic commissioner says Mike Tyson may have to wait until May if 
he wants to return to the Catskill Mountains to train. 
</P>
<P>
Because Tyson was knocked out by James (Buster) Douglas in their fight in Tokyo 
on Saturday, he could be barred from fighting or sparring anywhere in New York 
for up to 90 days, Athletic Commissioner Randy Gordon said in an interview 
published in today's Albany Times Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the rules, Mike Tyson could still come back to the state to run, climb 
the mountains up north, jump rope, shadow box . . . whatever. But he couldn't 
take and receive punches," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said he would watch the fight again today with the commission's medical 
expert, Dr. Barry Jordan, and that no ruling has yet been made. 
</P>
<P>
Even if a fighter is knocked out outside the ring, he can't fight for 90 days, 
Gordon said. That, Gordon said, is the "Mike Tyson Rule" -- an expansion of the 
regulations created after Tyson was knocked out in an automobile accident in 
the Catskills in September, 1988.

DAYTONA ABCS: PERSEVERANCE, PATIENCE, POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<P>
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patience, perseverance and power are among the key ingredients for a Daytona 
500 winner. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Schrader will need all of them and a little more if he hopes to drive into 
Victory Lane on Sunday and claim a big chunk of the $2-million purse. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all been in that situation at one time or another," race favorite Dale 
Earnhardt said today. "Kenny will have to be careful, but starting in the back 
row at Daytona is not that big a deal." 
</P>
<P>
Schrader is back there, despite winning the pole a week ago, because he wrecked 
his car in a preliminary event and had to go to a backup. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Petty, a seven-time winner of the prestigious stock car race, said 
Schrader will face no dilemma if he remembers it's a long race. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have to be in any hurry," Petty said. "They pay off for 500 miles, 
not 490." 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Darrell Waltrip, a Schrader teammate, said the decision to 
go to the backup car was smart. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't run 500 miles here with a beat-up car," Waltrip said. "If he's as 
fast as he was, he'll be right up there after a pit stop or two." 
</P>
<P>
But Waltrip preaches patience. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to have that, and he's got to have luck," he said of Schrader. "He 
needs a lot of things to fall in place for him." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Martin, one of the fastest of the Ford drivers, sees the need for Schrader 
to move quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to drive as fast as he can and hope he doesn't wreck," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Defending Winston Cup champion Rusty Wallace doesn't think Schrader's task will 
be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will be a problem for Kenny," Wallace said. "He's got such a 
fast car that he doesn't even have to do much drafting to get back to the 
front." 
</P>
<P>
Schrader is not bemoaning his fate. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been saying for the last week and a half that sitting on the pole was no 
big deal," he said. "I can't change my story now." 
</P>
<P>
Schrader insists he won't consider it a great feat if he is able to take the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier to be a speed demon when you're sitting in that car," he 
said of his Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
Schrader has put Hendrick cars on the pole a record-tying three straight years. 
Waltrip won the race with one last year, and former teammate Geoff Bodine, the 
de facto pole-sitter, was the winner in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
If he doesn't win, Schrader will not be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"Daytona does not owe me a thing," he said. "It has been very good to me." 
</P>
<P>
The relaxed Schrader munching on a sandwich in the garage area at the Daytona 
International Speedway today gave the impression that a victory Sunday wouldn't 
alter his life appreciably. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want the attention," he said. "I just want to get in my car and race."

Dave Waymer, a veteran defensive back for the New Orleans Saints who was left 
unprotected under the NFL's Plan B free agent system, will sign with San 
Francisco unless the Saints want to match the 49ers' offer, he said today. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the Saints I wouldn't sign anything until I talked with them. 
</P>
<P>
They can't negotiate with me, but I'm going to see them today and if they want 
to match it, I'm staying," Waymer said. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Greg Campbell, contacted Thursday night in Beverly Hills by the 
Times-Picayune, said Waymer agreed to a three-year, $2-million contract with 
the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Waymer, 31, earned a base salary of $200,000 in 1989 with the Saints. He was 
the team's leader in interceptions with 37 during his career. 
</P>
<P>
Waymer is scheduled to sign a contract Monday in San Francisco if the Saints do 
not match the offer.

Two unbeaten fillies and Breezy Macbree, front-running winner of the Dixie 
Belle, head a field of 11 in Monday's $50,000-added Martha Washington Stakes at 
Oaklawn Park. 
</P>
<P>
The six-furlong Martha Washington for 3-year-old fillies is a major prep for 
the one-mile Magnolia Stakes on March 11. 
</P>
<P>
The unbeaten fillies are Classy Irene and Fernie Belle. 
</P>
<P>
Classy Irene, owned by W. C. Partee and trained by Lynn Whiting, won the first 
race of her career by 10 lengths at Chicago in August. 
</P>
<P>
She did not race again until she captured an allowance race at Churchill Downs 
on Nov. 9. Fewer than three weeks later, she won a stakes race in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of El Baba returned to the races Jan. 28 and was an easy winner of 
the Thelma Stakes at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Classy Irene, who will carry 116 pounds under the allowance conditions of the 
race, will be ridden by Pat Day. 
</P>
<P>
The Gerald Romero-trained Fernie Belle won the first race of her career by 
three lengths last August at Louisiana Downs and then did not race again until 
she captured an allowance race by more than four lengths Jan. 20 in New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Gryder is to ride Fernie Belle, who will carry 112. 
</P>
<P>
Breezy Macbree will carry 119, and Jon Court is to ride. 
</P>
<P>
Breezy Macbree, an Arkansas-bred purchased for $7,000, never spends a night at 
the track. Trainer Don Smith has a training track near North Little Rock and 
vans the daughter of Breezing On to the track on the day of her race. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the field is the John Franks-owned entry of Blissful Union and 
Inposition, each to carry 122. 
</P>
<P>
Blissful Union has been in the money in nine of her 10 starts. In her last 
start, she was second to Classy Irene in the Thelma. 
</P>
<P>
Inposition has won six of nine starts, racing mostly in Canada.

A Berkeley writer who will be the Laguna Poets Winter Festival reader Saturday, 
Griffin has never hesitated to take on life-and-death matters in her work. 
Until recently, however, she hadn't had to address them quite so directly in 
her life. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin's nonfiction books, poetry and plays examine the world from a feminist 
perspective. She's written about pornography, rape and human relationships with 
nature. Her new nonfiction book, "A Chorus of Stones: The Private Life of War," 
will be published by Doubleday next year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975 she won an Emmy award for her televised play "Voices," and she's now 
revising a new one-person play, "One Two Three . . . Loss," which actress Ruth 
Zaporah will perform in Berkeley this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin has had a fair amount of writering success. Yet she must still struggle 
to make ends meet. "The assumption is I'm financially well off because I'm 
recognized," she said, but the reality is that publishers' advances for serious 
writing are small, and more grants are available for younger writers than for 
"established" ones. 
</P>
<P>
In past years Griffin has supported herself as a waitress, Teletype operator, 
house painter, assistant magazine editor, artists' model, actor, director and 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Such jobs are no longer possible, for she's one of a growing number of people 
with chronic fatigue immune dysfunctional syndrome (a recently discovered 
illness in which the body's immune system is suppressed). The disease can 
sometimes make it difficult for her to cross a room, much less teach, although 
she still occasionally takes on private students. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite a recent worsening of her illness, Griffin will perform in Laguna 
because "I like to read. I consider my poetry meant to be read aloud," she 
said. She plans to read from her most recent book of poems ("Unremembered 
Country," 1987) as well as some newer poems, excerpts from the new play and 
bits of "A Chorus of Stones." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin feels that the recent proliferation of immune system-suppressing 
ailments (such as AIDS) results from the deterioration of the earth's 
environment, a deterioration that has not been examined enough. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my work has dealt with denial, the psychology of denial and the kind 
of schizoid division of the self into a physical and a spiritual part," she 
said. "We say, 'I'm not a body, I'm a soul,' as if the body could be thrown 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin says that she, too, denied her illness for several years, despite her 
often-expressed idea that "sensuality and bodily knowledge carry the most 
profound significance." 
</P>
<P>
It helps, she said, to live in the Berkeley hills, a community where she has 
deep roots and where she can maintain her connection to nature because "I live 
in a place with a lot of trees around. And of course nature isn't just outside, 
nature is also in my own body." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin was born in Los Angeles. Her childhood, which she wrote about in a 
still-unfinished, autobiographical play called "Thanksgiving," was hard. Her 
parents divorced when she was 6, and after that "I was moved around from one 
member of the family to another." 
</P>
<P>
At 16 she was living with her father, a fireman, when he was killed in an 
accident. Subsequently she was adopted by a friend's parents. Her adoptive 
father, a painter and sculptor, demonstrated by example that an artist could 
have "a viable way of life," Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1960 Griffin moved to the Bay Area. She earned bachelor's and master's 
degrees from San Francisco State University, studying writing with Kay Boyle, 
Robert Creeley and Josephine Miles. "I think it's critically important for 
young writers to study with established writers," she said, "to have the 
example of someone who has that sensibility and way of life, and see they're 
normal people who brush their teeth and get up and work, like a bricklayer 
does." 
</P>
<P>
Her own work began to be published around 1970. 
</P>
<P>
A self-described "radical feminist," she's written for Ms., Ramparts and many 
other publications, and she's published three books of nonfiction, five of 
poetry, a play and a collection of selected work. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin's writing has won praise over the years. Critic Valerie Miner wrote: 
"Griffin moves us from pain to anger to communion with and celebration of the 
survival of woman and nature." In "American Women Writers" critic Kathleen 
Klein stated that "the power of Griffin's work comes from the clarity of her 
perceptions of the role, conditions, existence and aspirations of women." And 
poet Adrienne Rich has called her "one of the wisest and most lucid writers in 
America today." 
</P>
<P>
Her writing has been influenced by African-American poetry, jazz, haiku, Asian 
philosophy and French poetry and prose poems, Griffin said, by the women's 
movement and by the fact she was born on the West Coast. "People make fun of 
California, and I do too, but the truth is a lot of really important thought 
has been initiated here. It's a place where the whole mind-body dichotomy has 
been challenged," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Married in 1966, she was divorced in 1970. She raised her daughter Rebecca on 
her own. Rebecca, who renamed herself Chloe a few years ago, now lives with her 
fiance while attending Mills College. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of women being silenced by cultural forces recurs throughout 
Griffin's writing. She resisted writing about her sexuality shortly after her 
divorce, when she was "newly lesbian." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to protect my daughter, and I had some questions about child custody. 
. . . It did have a very dampening effect on my work. If you're being so very 
careful not to speak about who you love and what you're feeling, it radiates 
out into the rest of your life. You end up censoring things without even 
thinking about it, before they even reach the stage of consciousness," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Once she allowed herself to begin describing her sexuality, "I remember it as 
this incredible burst of energy, and joy, and anger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She feels that societal changes of the last two decades have made it possible 
for some, but by no means all, women to be less silent about their lives. "I 
think we're just beginning to open up and understand what (sexist) oppression 
is. That situation has not changed for many women, in many ways it's worse than 
it was before," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin's new nonfiction book, "A Chorus of Stones," draws from a long look at 
nuclear policy, at "the effects of gender issues, family structure and intimacy 
on war," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To write it, she studied existing literature and interviewed many individuals 
around the world, in the United States, Britain, Germany, France and Japan. 
Like her earlier nonfiction books, "Stones" draws undisguisedly on her own 
reactions to the material. 
</P>
<P>
The book is "very hard to describe, it doesn't fit in a category," she said. 
"I'm talking about states of mind, states of body. The only way to approach it 
is in more artistic language." 
</P>
<P>
Her new play, "One Two Three . . . Loss" is "a play about encounters with 
death," Griffin said. "I had a very close friend with whom I was living. She 
was killed very suddenly in 1985. The experience was very profound for me. 
She's hardly in it except that she dies. (The play) goes to a place more 
primal" than the one specific death. "I'm looking at the direct experience of 
death from the point of view of the one who doesn't die." The play also draws 
on Griffin's own heightened fears of mortality since the onset of her illness. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the poems of "Unremembered Country" deal with loss, but they also echo 
with the need "to love this world." The poems she's written since publishing 
the book, Griffin said, address "the ecological situation." 
</P>
<P>
Her writing draws on her life, but it isn't straight autobiography. "I think 
unless you are really writing an autobiography, it's important to look at 
things from your life as material, but not as things you have to be faithful 
to," she said. "I don't make up things in poetry. Everything there is literally 
true, (but) it's sort of the case that you may choose to tell this moment, and 
then leap 500 years and tell this (other) moment. I don't bother to explain, I 
let the music, the association, the juxtaposition do that." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her reduced energies, the writer tries to work regularly. Soon, she 
wants to begin writing some nonfiction "about the experience of illness," as 
well as continuing to write poetry and plays. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go to your study every day, even if you just put in an hour, then your 
mind is working when you're not there," Griffin said. "You can't depend just on 
flashes of inspiration, there's an awful lot of spadework with writing. Writing 
is like having a relationship. If there's a particular regularity it allows 
things to open up and unfold. 
</P>
<P>
"It may feel that not much is happening, it goes on that way for six or seven 
days, or even two weeks, and then I'll have a click, and it's illuminating," 
she said. "All those days I worked fed into it, worked up to it. (Writing) 
requires a lot of stick-to-itiveness, faith, and daily work." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Griffin will read from her work at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at the Forum 
Theatre, 650 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. Tickets are $10 and can be 
purchased at the door. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I went very far away from life 
</P>
<P>
 with its torpor. I was out there 
</P>
<P>
 in the ethereal air 
</P>
<P>
 the cold rush against my face 
</P>
<P>
 was exciting 
</P>
<P>
 and even more 
</P>
<P>
 there was a kind of star that broke 
</P>
<P>
 my heart and made it wide 
</P>
<P>
 as space itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I have fallen again 
</P>
<P>
 and I rush arms open like a lover 
</P>
<P>
 or prodigal daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Streets, gleam of pavement after rain, 
</P>
<P>
 my very human thoughts, my very human wants, 
</P>
<P>
 those old songs just now I am writing again 
</P>
<P>
 I love you, I love you again.

ITALIAN FILM MAKER MAKES NAME FOR HIMSELF; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: GIUSEPPE TORNATORE'S 'CINEMA PARADISO' GARNERED AN OSCAR NOMINATION FOR 
BEST FOREIGN-LANGUAGE FILM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Cinema Paradiso," which won a special jury prize at Cannes last year and is an 
Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film, introduces to American audiences 
its writer-director Giuseppe Tornatore. 
</P>
<P>
His film takes its title from an ancient Sicilian village's movie theater, 
where the film's young hero (Salvatore Cascio) falls in love with the movies 
while growing up in the postwar era under the influence of the theater's 
kindly, paternal projectionist (Philippe Noiret). Jacques Perrin plays the boy 
as a middle-aged adult in the film's framing sections. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of film that appeals to movie lovers everywhere, and Tornatore 
acknowledges that it is in part autobiographical. "As a child, I had the same 
curiosity as that little kid," said Tornatore, who was born in Bagheria, a 
village near Palermo. "I invented any kind of reason to get into the projection 
booth." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added that Noiret's character is a composite of many men, some of 
them projectionists. It is Noiret who forcibly insists that the boy must leave 
his hometown if he is to have a hope of fulfilling his destiny, but with 
Tornatore, the man who said the same thing to him was someone he barely knew. 
</P>
<P>
"He was Renato Guttuso, a very famous painter, who had returned to Bagheria, 
which was his hometown, for some big celebration in his honor. Perhaps it was a 
birthday, I don't remember. I told him I'd made some movies -- I made my first 
documentary when I was 15 years old -- and I asked him for his advice. He said 
emphatically that I had to go away! -- that was all." But Tornatore listened to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Tornatore, speaking through an interpreter, is some 20 years 
younger than his screen alter ego. A dark, compact man of gently humorous but 
essentially serious nature, he is a self-taught film maker -- "I tried to see 
as many films as possible and to read as many books about them as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, one of his documentaries was bought by television, which led in 
1979 to his being hired to make documentaries for TV. From 1978-85, he was 
president of a film cooperative that produced a picture in Sicily in 1983 with 
the late actor Lino Ventura, which gave him his first opportunity to shoot some 
scenes for a movie. In 1986 he made his first feature, "Il Camorrista" -- the 
Sicilian equivalent of the Mafia is the Camorra -- starring Ben Gazzara and 
Laura del Sol. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I developed several projects, but I couldn't find a producer to back any 
of them. While I was going through these problems, I decided to visit my 
hometown and discovered they had closed the cinema -- the Supercine. For many 
years I had thought about making a movie about movies; now something clicked, 
and I started to write the script for 'Cinema Paradiso.' " 
</P>
<P>
Starting at the end of 1986, Tornatore spent two months on the first draft, 
drawing upon notes he had kept over the previous seven years. Once again, he 
faced the struggle to find a producer. This time, one of Italy's most 
distinguished veterans, Franco Cristaldi, came to the rescue and put together a 
co-production deal with France, which brought in Noiret and Perrin. The French 
actors spoke in their own language and were dubbed into Italian. 
</P>
<P>
For Tornatore, Noiret became the patient mainstay of what proved to be a 
complicated 13-week shoot. Not only was it necessary to re-create the '40s and 
'50s, but also to find a town with a piazza large enough to allow the 
construction of a sizable theater -- which was promptly destroyed in a 
windstorm and had to be rebuilt. The search for this key locale took four 
months, and the film's village is actually a composite of six different towns. 
</P>
<P>
One of "Cinema Paradiso's" charms is that it tantalizes audiences with glimpses 
of about 50 films -- among them John Ford's "Stagecoach" and Luchino Visconti's 
"La Terra Trema." You may also spot in a vintage swashbuckler the late Amedeo 
Nazzari, a popular star for 40 years, who played himself in Fellini's "Nights 
of Cabiria." 
</P>
<P>
"A provincial theater would play all kinds of movies," said Tornatore. "For one 
day, it might play a film by one of the grand masters, then a typical adventure 
picture the next two or three days." 
</P>
<P>
Tornatore feels indebted to Ben Gazzara for launching his career as a feature 
director. " 'Il Camorrista,' which I adapted from a novel, is the story of a 
minor Neapolitan criminal who is jailed very young and decides to become a very 
big criminal," said Tornatore. "I gave Ben the book, showed him my 
documentaries, and he got very enthusiastic. We did not have a producer, but he 
said not to worry, that he would call a press conference to announce that we 
were going to make the picture and that this was the way to attract a producer. 
He was right." 
</P>
<P>
Tornatore is in post-production on his third feature, "Everybody's Fine," 
starring Marcello Mastroianni. "It's the first time he's played a really old 
man," he said. "He's just retired and decides to journey all over Italy to look 
up old friends. Some don't even remember him. It will be released in October." 
</P>
<P>
One of the surprising things about "Cinema Paradiso" is that while we discover 
its hero, now in his 50s, has gone on to a successful career as a director, he 
hasn't worked out his personal life. Asked if he is married or has children, 
Tornatore said no, adding with a wry smile, "maybe this part of the movie 
really is my autobiography.

FROM SHIELD CARRIER TO LEADING OPERATIC ROLES; 
</P>
<P>
OPERA: RODNEY GILFRY THOUGHT HE'D BE A MUSIC TEACHER. INSTEAD, HE'S SINGING 
VISIBLE ROLES, INCLUDING THAT OF FORD IN 'FALSTAFF' AT THE MUSIC CENTER. 
</P>

<P>
Aswirl in a black cape, Rodney Gilfry trounces onto the rehearsal scene, slams 
a money-filled satchel on the table before his seated adversary, Falstaff 
(Benjamin Luxon), then proceeds to vent his knuckle-biting fury. 
</P>
<P>
Gilfry is portraying Ford, the imaginary cuckold in Verdi's "Falstaff," which 
opens tonight at the Pavilion, courtesy of Music Center Opera. And he ends his 
rich-voiced monologue on a bench, quivering with impotent rage, reduced to a 
fit of paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
But just last month the strapping, blond baritone was a savvy good-guy from the 
servant class, singing the title role in "Le Nozze di Figaro." And before that, 
he impersonated the four villains in "Les Contes d'Hoffmann." 
</P>
<P>
Who would guess that a mere 3 1/2 years ago Gilfry practically stood among the 
ranks of unknown shield-carriers? (He sang a minor role in Music Center Opera's 
1986 inaugural "Otello.") Or that Los Angeles had quietly spawned this 
versatile and uncommon talent in its back yard? 
</P>
<P>
"Least of all me," says the singer on the eve of his 31st birthday. But after 
rehearsal the easy-and-outgoing native of Covina registers neither false 
modesty nor self-importance as he sips mineral water poured from his own 
portable supply. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing is," he explains bemusedly, "I thought small and never wanted 
to travel the world. Every plan I made from high school on revolved around 
having a secure job and living a stable family life -- the kind I grew up with 
in Covina, where orange groves and tract houses and young couples with kids are 
the norm." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Gilfry saw to those goals. He pursued a course of music education in 
college "with the idea of being a music teacher." He married a longtime family 
friend from Claremont High with whom he has children ages 4, 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
But along the way, and almost against his will, a stage personality was 
budding. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school all my friends belonged to a church group that put on musicals. 
I was very social, very community-oriented and joined the productions -- 
despite feeling that it was a sissy thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
He was "an awful klutz," to hear him tell it, and "felt foolish and 
uncomfortable" in the role of exhibitionist-at-large. But peer pressure gave 
way to mastery, and, after taking the lead role opposite his bride-to-be in an 
amateur "No, No, Nannette," among others, he followed her to Cal State 
Fullerton's Music Department, where "people kept saying I could have a career." 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, with substitute teaching in the city schools proving less 
than satisfactory to him, Gilfry was open to alternatives. He began to take 
concert dates, while working part time in a music store and following a 
graduate degree in voice at USC. Further studies brought him to Santa Barbara 
with the noted voice teacher Martial Singher. 
</P>
<P>
His present status is no fluke, however. Peter Hemmings, director of Music 
Center Opera, remembers auditioning local singers in 1984, "about 200 of them," 
he says, "and there's no doubt Rodney Gilfry was the most exciting of the lot . 
. . an extraordinary talent." 
</P>
<P>
The Times' Martin Bernheimer recalls, as well, that the baritone "instantly 
attracted attention," noting in a 1987 review of Britten's "War Requiem" with 
the William Hall Chorale that Gilfry "need fear nothing from the specter of 
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, for whom this music was written." 
</P>
<P>
But stepping out into the world did not occur until 1985, when the singer went 
to audition in Europe. The Frankfurt Opera offered him a two-year contract, to 
start the following season; it guaranteed 11 roles. 
</P>
<P>
"Hamburg also wanted me," he mentions, "but made a far less compelling bid. And 
when Rolf Liebermann, the Intendant there, realized I was turning him down he 
became furious. With his reputation -- as a person not to cross -- I figured I 
was dead meat after that." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing of the kind. A month later, Liebermann called Gilfry and asked him to 
sing Figaro. 
</P>
<P>
"What a twist," he says, explaining how, if he had taken the original Hamburg 
contract, he would have been assigned a smaller role in the opera, "with no 
chance for advancement." 
</P>
<P>
Even with this early stroke of luck, there was cause for trepidation: Gilfry 
had never sung Figaro and "knew nothing but two of the arias." His debut would 
take place in just six weeks and, to make matters worse, he had never ventured 
a major role on a professional opera stage. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't all. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me only 3 1/2-days' rehearsal," he says, "with no guarantee of other 
cast members being available (since he was the only newcomer to the 
production). Also my first meeting with the stage and the orchestra was to be 
at the performance." 
</P>
<P>
Gilfry apparently survived his trial by operatic fire. But he admits that 
"feeling settled" in the role only came about last month. In the last three 
years, he says that the responsibility of a major career has unwittingly made 
an impact on his personal life. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a regular guy, as opposed to a glamorous celebrity, is natural to me," 
he says. "I am very married and a full-time father -- someone who changes a 
diaper before going on stage for a premiere. It's a conscious, deliberate way 
of life. Most stars, on the other hand, are self-centered people who wrap 
scarves around their throats and shake hands at a distance instead of kissing 
and think only of their voices, their careers." 
</P>
<P>
Breaking into a joke, he asks, "How many opera singers does it take to change a 
light bulb? Only one. He (she) holds it and the world revolves around him 
(her). 
</P>
<P>
"Seriously, though, it's interesting to see myself change. Sure, the kids still 
sniffle in my face, but the night before 'Figaro' opened here I slept in the 
living room. They were very sick and my wife had strep throat." 
</P>
<P>
There's a difference, however, between taking professional responsibility and 
indulging petty self-interest. Back in the "Falstaff" rehearsal, Gilfry's first 
venture into Verdi, he picks apart his monologue scene with director Jeannette 
Aster, searching for the fine points that reveal Ford's character -- "the 
vulnerability inside that shrewdly controlled exterior, the deeply loyal man so 
devastated at the thought of his wife cheating." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes art and life converge.

TRACK AND FIELD: HE'S THE HEIR APPARENT TO THE BRITISH MIDDLE-DISTANCE

<P>
A new decade is the signal for a changing of the guard in the esteemed ranks of 
British middle-distance runners. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s belonged to Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram, whose 
accomplishments are part of track and field lore. 
</P>
<P>
In the '90s, Cram, the world record-holder in the mile, will most likely still 
be a factor, along with a 27-year-old steel mill carpenter who is emerging as 
perhaps the next great British runner. 
</P>

Peter Elliott, who will run the mile tonight in the Times/Eagle Indoor Games at 
the Forum, has served his apprenticeship and is apparently ready to be 
acclaimed internationally. 
</P>
<P>
The track and field season has just begun, but Elliott has already won the 
1,500 meters in the Commonwealth Games at Auckland, New Zealand, and made a 
bold bid last Friday to break Eamonn Coghlan's world indoor mile record of 3 
minutes 49.78 seconds in the Meadowlands Invitational at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott didn't do it, but considering that his competition failed to challenge 
him, his time of 3:52.02 was commendable. 
</P>
<P>
He has had his share of disappointments, beginning with the 1984 Olympics in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
While warming up for the semifinals of the 800 meters, he had to pull out of 
the race with a painful stress fracture in his foot. 
</P>
<P>
Four years elapsed before Elliott could get a shot at another Olympic medal, 
this time in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"I was running well all season and made the final of the 800," Elliott said. 
"As I was warming up for the final, the muscles around my abdomen seized." 
</P>
<P>
An injection enabled Elliott to compete, and he finished fourth, missing the 
bronze medal by six-hundredths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
The trials in the 1,500 were still ahead, and Elliott took a pain-killing shot 
20 minutes before every heat. He was determined to get to the final of the 
1,500, which he did. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be more painful to watch an Olympic final that I thought I 
could win, especially after pulling out in L.A.," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott ran second by a stride to Kenya's Peter Rono, who had a time of 3:35.95 
to Elliott's 3:36.15. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott didn't have to prove anything to himself in the 1988 Olympics, but his 
performance quieted the clamor at home that he shouldn't have represented 
Britain in two races. 
</P>
<P>
The background: 
</P>
<P>
Elliott won the 1,500 in his country's Olympic trials, after previously being 
selected for the 800 because he had run the fastest time in Britain that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"The trials were held over only two days, and it was very difficult to run both 
the 800 and 1,500," Elliott said. "Coe just ran the 1,500 and got knocked out 
in a heat." 
</P>
<P>
Then, a British tabloid ran a cartoon depicting Coe as a thoroughbred, Elliott 
as a cart horse. 
</P>
<P>
"They were trying to get the public on Seb's side, saying he should have the 
right to defend his Olympic title at 1,500 meters," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
"They really shouldn't have had a go at me because I won the trials at 1,500 
meters. What they should have been doing is having a go at the guy who finished 
second (Steve Crabb), or Steve Cram, who was pre-selected for the 1,500." 
</P>
<P>
There was also a tabloid phone-in poll that asked, "Who should go, Elliott or 
Coe?" 
</P>
<P>
"It just stirred up the public," Elliott said, "and I got a lot of hate mail. 
It got totally out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
The furor died after Elliott's performance in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a full-page apology from the Daily Mirror," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott said the British selection system for major competitions has been 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of sending the first two finishers in the trials, along with a third to 
be pre-selected, two athletes will be selected on the basis of performances, 
along with the winner of the race in the trials. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott said he is using the indoor season as a buildup for the outdoor season 
and is pointing to the European Championships in Yugoslavia later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
"With four or five races indoors, you find out what kind of shape you are in 
and it gives you confidence for the summer," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, a resident of Rotherham in South Yorkshire County, works four hours a 
day as a carpenter, his trade since he was 16. 
</P>
<P>
"Some athletes train in the morning and sit around all afternoon in a hotel 
room," Elliott said. "I couldn't do that every day. When you're injured, you're 
still guaranteed a little money." 
</P>
<P>
Track and Field Notes
