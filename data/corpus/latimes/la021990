It appears Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) thought defaming gays 
might be a good way to help him get elected to the state Senate. Fortunately, 
he was wrong (Part A, Feb. 7). 
</P>
<P>
Although the group considered safe to pick on changes from time to time, this 
was really just the same old bigotry all minorities experience. What does this 
say about Ferguson? 
</P>
<P>
Let his words speak for him, "I don't care about them, I'm a retired Marine. A 
couple of ------ out there aren't going to scare me" (Part A, Feb. 4). Now, 
fill in that blank with one of the epithets that hate-mongers apply to Jews, or 
African Americans, or Americans of Hispanic, Irish, Italian or Asian descent 
instead of his original homophobic slur, and read Ferguson's words again. Now 
you know what kind of person Gil Ferguson is. He is a bigot.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the past few days your paper has displayed dramatically the tide of history 
that is engulfing the world today. On the same day that Mikhail Gorbachev 
finally triumphed over Article 6 of the Soviet constitution, effectively 
abolishing the most wicked system of tyranny in this century, George Bush 
donned the front page defending our grossly bloated defense budget (Part A, 
Feb. 7). There could hardly be a more vivid example of how one superpower 
leader has risen to the challenge and is riding the crest of history, while the 
other is intent on being swept away with the past.

THE SLAUGHTER GOES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does this sound like a country yearning for peace? 
</P>
<P>
Najibullah, the man Moscow left in charge of Afghanistan when Soviet troops 
pulled out after 10 years of bloody occupation, proposed a cease-fire last week 
to celebrate the first anniversary of the Soviet withdrawal. By way of a reply, 
anti-government guerrillas lobbed five rockets at the capital city of Kabul. 
Western relief agencies estimate that such rocket attacks killed at least 1,000 
civilians in and near Kabul last year. 
</P>
<P>
So the very malevolence of the mood in Afghanistan, the absence among leaders 
of a yearning for peace, makes it all the more urgent that Washington try to 
get a cease-fire accepted there as the first step toward ending the war and 
organizing a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for urgency in Washington is that the United States shares 
responsibility with the Soviet Union for the fact that the war drags on in the 
parched and rugged land. Both ship arms to their surrogates, the United States 
to the guerrillas and the Soviet Union to government forces. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time while Soviet troops were packing their trucks and preparing to 
leave that the superpowers might have struck a deal to stop arms shipments to 
both sides. But back then it looked to Washington as if the guerrillas, the 
moujahedeen, might be strong enough to clear Najibullah and his forces out of 
Kabul. So the United States said "nothing doing." Washington guessed wrong. 
Government troops shrugged off one guerrilla attack after another, lost not a 
single city, and, in fact, expanded their area of influence. 
</P>
<P>
That may account for a partial change of mind in Washington. The White House, 
which had been insisting that Najibullah must step down before peace talks 
could begin, now says he could stay on until the talks are concluded. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Moscow proposed a conference aimed at ending the fighting and 
demilitarizing Afghanistan. It made no mention of Washington's change in 
position on Najibullah, but the Soviets seem to be in an agreeable mood these 
days, often accepting propositions that Washington is sure they will reject. 
That may happen this time. If not, Washington must do whatever else it takes to 
help stop the slaughter.

HELPING THE CIVILIANS TO GUARD THE GUARDS; 
</P>
<P>
LATIN AMERICA: PANAMA PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE OUR EMPHASIS IN THE 
REGION, BOLSTERING DEMOCRATIC RULE INSTEAD OF TRAINING ARMIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER F. MONDALE, Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale is chairman of 
the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crisis in Panama has served to remind us yet again of the cursed influence 
of the military on civilian politics in Latin America. The political future of 
Latin American nations lies in a systematic redressing of the balance between 
military power and civilian authority -- a process in which the United States 
can and must play a pivotal role. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has made welcome proposals to provide Panama with nearly $1 
billion to support democracy by restoring the tattered economy. As we allocate 
these enormous resources, however, we must pay attention to the critical 
element of building civilian political control over the security forces. 
</P>
<P>
In far too many Latin countries -- in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Brazil 
and Uruguay -- elected democrats remain hemmed in by the power of unelected 
military overseers who usurp civilian functions. The recent killings of six 
priests in El Salvador make it clear that the crisis there involves not only 
the ideological struggle between the forces of right and left but also the 
struggle of the civilian leadership to assert authority over a dangerously 
independent army. 
</P>
<P>
Latin American armies have consistently played pernicious political roles. The 
United States has often played a contributing role in creating, training and 
arming soldiers. Our policy-makers have argued that through American efforts 
these armies might become more professional, more democratic, more influenced 
by us. None of this has come about. The governing style of military regimes 
includes human-rights crimes, all-encompassing and easily abused definitions of 
national security, and dislike of democracy. In Panama, the U.S.-trained 
Defense Forces turned out to be unprofessional enough to be easily corrupted by 
a corrupt leader. 
</P>
<P>
Once and for all, we must dedicate our considerable resources to helping Latin 
America's democrats wipe out the deadly myth spun by their militaries: that it 
is the soldiers who, in the words of the Argentine military, safeguard their 
nation's "essence." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the United States supported dictators, invoking geopolitical need 
and the fear of communist-inspired political instability. Today, given the 
changes in Soviet foreign policy, our policies can no longer be based solely on 
the traditional concern for hemispheric military security. Only if we commit 
ourselves to empowering Latin civilians in the oversight of military affairs 
can we sustain the hope for enduring, pluralist rule. 
</P>
<P>
Many practical ways exist to reapportion political and military functions. As 
the Panamanians begin their unique experiment in turning soldiers into "good 
cops," we can provide technical support for splitting off the non-police 
functions of the former defense forces, such as immigration and customs, over 
which the military had assumed authority. Police academies can teach respect 
for human rights, democratic political ethics and legal process, while showing 
that police officers have honor in democratic societies. Political parties can 
increase their awareness of law-and-order issues, even as the civilian 
government assumes financial control over the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
In Panama, politicians, from the grass roots to the legislative level, must 
also be helped to devise an effective democracy in a political arena scarred by 
decades of military rule. Their parties may value training in the nuts and 
bolts of liberal institution-building and governance. In such efforts lies 
their security. By now we know that weak civilian institutions, squabbling 
politicians and polarized politics only invite soldiers to take power, with two 
tanks or 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
If the Panamanians are successful in demilitarizing their forces, they will 
provide an invaluable model for the region. Such a restructuring of 
civil-military relations in Latin America will obviously not be easy. Still, if 
we truly believe, along with so many millions of Latin Americans, that 
democracy can make a stand, then we must rapidly complement our financial 
investments with sturdy programs of practical assistance in the sphere of 
civil-military relations. Upholding democratic values in civilians is surely 
more plausible and profitable than trying to instill them in soldiers. We must 
help Latin civilians guard the guards.

LAKERS NO SMALL TASK FOR CELTICS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: SHORTER L.A. LINEUP TIGHTENS DEFENSE, UNLEASHES OFFENSE IN 
SECOND HALF OF 116-110 VICTORY OVER BOSTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Laker tormentors from way back, the Boston Celtics were not about to give in 
Sunday afternoon at the Forum simply because people say they no longer are 
among the NBA's elite. Resembling the Celtics of old, Boston took a 12-point 
lead in the first half and still led by four early in the third quarter. Far 
from surprised, the Lakers simply reverted to a strategy nearly as old as the 
Laker-Celtic rivalry and, in the end, pulled out a 116-110 victory. 
</P>
<P>
To jump-start their running game and neutralize the Celtics' physical 
advantage, the Lakers went to a small lineup featuring Michael Cooper at small 
forward and James Worthy covering Robert Parish in the third quarter. It 
changed the game's flow, neutralized the Celtics' inside game and opened up the 
Laker offense. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a succession of Laker fast breaks and a spate of three-point 
shots by Magic Johnson and Byron Scott, enough to give the Lakers' their fourth 
consecutive victory over the Celtics at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense was the reason we won today," Cooper said. "When Coach Riley put 
myself in the game and we concentrated on defense, it turned the game around. 
Our defense has always triggered our offense. We get our running game going 
from defense." 
</P>
<P>
Through three quarters, the Celtics made 68.3% of their shots and led, 94-92, 
after the Lakers led by as many as five points earlier in the quarter. But the 
Celtics made only 38% of their shots and commited five turnovers in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But even after the Lakers expanded the lead to nine points with 2:42 left, the 
Celtics made a run and pulled to three points with 12.6 seconds left before the 
Lakers reasserted themselves. Alternating between big (Mychal Thompson and 
Vlade Divac) and small (Cooper and Worthy), the Lakers were able to hold Boston 
to 16 points in the fourth quarter and improve their record to an NBA-best 
37-12. The Celtics (30-20) suffered their second consecutive loss midway 
through an eight-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored 30 points and had 13 assists. He made 10 of 21 shots, including 
consecutive three-point shots in a 24-second span of the third quarter that 
gave the Lakers a one-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who waged a game-long battle with Celtic guard Reggie Lewis, scored 24 
points and made all three three-point shots he attempted. Scott's three-point 
shot with 6:01 left in the game gave the Lakers a 104-100 lead. After the 
Lakers' half-court trap resulted in a missed jump shot by Dennis Johnson, Scott 
finished off a fast break with a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
After that flurry, the Lakers led by six points with 5:34 to play and did not 
let the lead dwindle below three points from there. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to play more physical, get the ball and do what we do best, which is 
run," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just kept pushing the ball up court and got it going in the third quarter. 
Our small lineup is one of our best weapons. It gives us a lot of quickness and 
helps our press. We've always liked that lineup." 
</P>
<P>
The small lineup meant that A.C. Green sat for most of the second half and 
Worthy was forced to guard Parish for most of the third quarter and part of the 
fourth before Divac made a late contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, playing with a severe bruise on top of his right (shooting) shoulder, 
held his own against Parish and, offensively, added 25 points and seven 
rebounds in 42 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Parish had 20 points, but only eight in the second half. With Cooper guarding 
him, Larry Bird also scored only eight of his 20 points in the second half as 
well. McHale (21 points) and shooting guard Lewis (24) were the most consistent 
Celtics, but nobody stepped forward in the fourth quarter to make a run at the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"We just played for 40 minutes instead of 48," Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
"They had some breaks going their way, and when you give up six or eight points 
to a good running team, it's going to kill you. But we didn't get the ball to 
who we wanted. They started double-teaming, and we took poor shots. We had a 
breakdown at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
Even when the Celtics got the shot they wanted in the fourth quarter, the 
Lakers' defense intervened. 
</P>
<P>
After cutting the margin to six points with a minute left, the Celtics had 
possession. McHale received a pass in the low post and shot, but Divac crossed 
the lane and swatted the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
Divac, who logged almost as many minutes as Thompson, had 13 points and six 
rebounds. Thompson scored only six points but had eight rebounds and spent most 
of the afternoon trading bumps and bruises with Parish and McHale. 
</P>
<P>
But the difference was that the Lakers gradually transformed the game from a 
bruising, half-court style to a running game. They did it, as they have so many 
other times, with defense. 
</P>
<P>
"With this team," Woolridge said, "when our defense is playing well, our 
offense is playing well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pat Riley, rumored as a possible color analyst when NBC takes over the NBA 
television coverage next season, said neither he nor agent Ed Hookstratten have 
been contacted yet by the network. "I've read that in about 10 columns around 
the country," Riley said. "Right now, it's all hypothetical talk." But would 
Riley consider leaving coaching to return to the broadcast booth? "You can 
never say never to anything," Riley said. "But (coaching) is what I feel like I 
want to be doing for the next couple of years. I've got a couple of years left 
on my contract." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers made six of 10 three-point shots Sunday. In their last three games, 
the Lakers have made 18 of 42 three-point shots. Magic Johnson has made eight 
of his last 17 from long distance. Riley said he approves of the three-pointer 
as a weapon. "I think with the flow going and when you're not shooting the 
three as a desperation shot, I'll take that," he said. "Earvin has been hitting 
them regularly lately." Said Johnson of his three-point shooting: "It just 
happens. You never know when or how. I was just in the rhythm. Once you hit 
one, you're in the rhythm and want to shoot more." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, to a man, said they still consider the Celtics a serious 
championship contender. "Boston is always capable of getting there," Mychal 
Thompson said. "As long as Boston is on top of its game, they could beat 
Detroit and come back to play against the Western Conference." . . . The Lakers 
held a 34-33 rebounding advantage, the first time in three games they 
out-rebounded the opposition. . . . The Lakers are off today and will play at 
San Antonio Tuesday night.

Former San Francisco Giant pitcher Dave Dravecky, who awed the sports world by 
coming back from cancer surgery on his pitching arm last season, says he has no 
regrets about baseball. 
</P>

"When I'm signing pictures of me pitching, I don't say, 'Oh, gosh. I wish I 
could still do that,' " Dravecky told the San Francisco Examiner from his home 
in suburban Cleveland, Ohio, where he is recovering from surgery three weeks

Dravecky, 34, pitched for the San Diego Padres from 1982 to 1987, compiling a 
career-best 14-10 record with a 3.58 earned-run average in his first full 
season in 1983. He pitched two scoreless innings in the All-Star game that 
summer, and was 13-11 for the Padres in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
He was traded to the Giants in July of 1987, and won seven games down the 
stretch as San Francisco took the National League West title. He gave up one 
run in 25 2/3 innings of postseason action as the Giants lost to the St. Louis 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
On Opening Day of the 1988 season, Dravecky pitched a three-hit victory against 
the eventual World Series champion Dodgers. But a partially detached biceps 
tendon limited him to seven appearances for the season and a malignant tumor 
was found in the deltoid muscle near his left shoulder in September. He 
underwent surgery to remove the tumor in October. 
</P>
<P>
Few expected him to pitch again. But he returned to Candlestick Park with the 
Giants Aug. 10, receiving eight standing ovations while pitching a 4-3 victory 
over the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
He started five days later against the Expos in Montreal, pitching well until 
the sixth inning -- when he collapsed on the mound after his upper arm snapped 
where the bone had been weakened by cancer treatments. Doctors soon found a 
second tumor, and Dravecky announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"The arm is moving well, taking into consideration there is no deltoid," 
Dravecky said. "I can get the arm over my head, rotate it in a circle and do 
pretty much what I want. The only thing I can't do is get my wallet out of my 
pocket." 
</P>
<P>
The Pete Rose watch: Rose told Ron Higgins of the Memphis Commercial Appeal 
that solving his personal problems are his first priority. "I'm not anxious to 
get back on the field as a baseball person," Rose said. "It's not the utmost 
thing in my mind. I can't say that I'm going to apply for reinstatement Aug. 24 
because the timing might not be right. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, my priority is taking care of some of the problems I've had. That's 
more important than worrying whether I'll manage again. That might change. A 
year and a half from now, if a guy offers me $1.5 million to manage a team, 
what am I going to say to him, 'Go to hell?' " 
</P>
<P>
Add baseball: Hall of Fame pitcher Don Drysdale, in his new book "Once a Bum, 
Always a Dodger:" "The war of 1990 might be the bloodiest yet. If the players 
stay away, or they get locked out, I wouldn't be surprised to see owners bring 
up all their minor leaguers and stage the games anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Feb. 19, 1947, who scored five goals for the Montreal Canadiens 
in a 10-2 rout of the New York Rangers? 
</P>
<P>
No fuss, no muss: Sixteen of Fairleigh Dickinson's 22 basketball games have 
been decided in the final minute. Said Coach Tom Green: "We have five games 
left. I think we're going to call all of our opponents and all the officials 
and have them show up at 9 o'clock. We'll give them a one-point lead, put one 
minute on the clock and go from there. Think of how much easier things will 
be." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't make perfect: The Boston Celtics' Larry Bird is making only about 
45% of his shots, a career low. Bird, who often arrives three hours early for a 
game to practice, said: "The only difference is that I make them when there's 
nobody guarding me. Then I come out here and someone's guarding me, and I can't 
make them." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Bernie Geoffrion.

JACK SMITH: BIBLICAL PALINDROMES AND OTHER CONUNDRUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not being a biblical scholar, I tend to go crashing into blasphemy and error 
when I write of biblical matters. I assure my Christian readers that this is 
not irreverence but simply ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, for example, I took the Bible to task for the phrase "tinkling 
cymbals" (1 Corinthians 13:1). I suggested that "clanging" cymbals would have 
been more appropriate (a complaint that is echoed in the "International Bible 
Dictionary"). 
</P>
<P>
But many readers have written to point out that cymbals are not only the large 
brass plates I had in mind, but also a tiny ancient Middle Eastern instrument 
worn on the fingers (especially by belly dancers); they tinkle. 
</P>
<P>
In his tireless missionary journeys over the world of AD 1, Paul, the Apostle, 
must surely have encountered belly dancers, and I have no doubt that it was 
their tinkling cymbals he had in mind when he wrote to the Corinthians. 
(However, in later translations of the Bible, the word appears as "clanging.") 
</P>
<P>
More difficult to resolve are questions that arise from my observation that "we 
do know that Adam's and Eve's first words (and thus history's) were perfect 
palindromes: When Adam said, 'Madam, I'm Adam,' Eve replied, 'Eve.' " 
</P>
<P>
James N. Angelo wants to know how I know that these were the first words 
exchanged by Adam and Eve, since they are not quoted in Genesis. That's easy. I 
simply take it on faith. 
</P>
<P>
A thornier problem is pointed out by Christopher Purcell, who argues that 
palindromes cannot be qualified as "perfect." A palindrome is either a 
palindrome or it is not. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he observes, if one can qualify a palindrome, then "Madam, I'm 
Adam" is not perfect, since the apostrophe takes the place of the elliptical a 
in "Madam, I am Adam." 
</P>
<P>
I agree with Purcell that a palindrome is either a palindrome or it is not, 
although some palindromes are certainly better than others. (The best ever was 
"A man, a plan, a canal -- Panama"; Napoleon's "Able was I ere I saw Elba" is a 
close second.) 
</P>
<P>
However, I do not think the presence of an apostrophe and the absence of the a 
keep "Madam, I'm Adam" from being a palindrome. They do mar it a teensy bit, 
though, which, one might argue, makes it less than perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Harry Cimring questions my statement that it was Eve who named the 
animals, and my curiosity about how she came up with "hippopotamus" and 
"platypus." 
</P>
<P>
"With all due respect to Mark Twain," he writes, "I contend that Eve . . . 
named neither the hippopotamus nor the platypus, unless she spoke Greco-Roman 
(which I doubt very much). 
</P>
<P>
"Hippo derives from Greek-Latin for horse, potamus for river; ergo: river 
horse. Likewise, platypus from flat and foot. It could have been a duck or an 
Army reject just as well." 
</P>
<P>
In paying his respects to Mark Twain, Cimring, of course, refers to Twain's 
translation of Adam's diary, which was my source for the fact that Eve named 
the animals, not Adam, as we are told in Genesis. 
</P>
<P>
Let me point out that Twain is a revered American journalist and author, widely 
admired for his novels and iconoclastic essays. From his translation we know 
that he had access to Adam's diary, which can not be said, for sure, of the 
author of Genesis. Although Genesis may have been divinely inspired, as 
Christians maintain, we may assume that God, not being a journalist, would have 
respected the privacy of Adam's diary. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Gorden notes: "You say, 'Eve herself, who spoke God-knows-what 
language' in one sentence and then, forgetful, you say in the next that Adam 
spoke English, namely, 'Madam, I'm Adam.' " 
</P>
<P>
He adds: "I do not know what language Eve spoke; many, perhaps. Eve is Eve. Her 
one-word reply to Adam may have been in Latin or Greek. Who is to say?" 
</P>
<P>
Exactly. And if Eve spoke Latin and Greek, that accounts for her naming the 
hippopotamus and the platypus. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo argues that Adam more likely would have said, "Eve, I'm Adam," but if he 
had said, "Madam, I'm Adam," Eve's reply would have been "Even am I, man, Eve." 
</P>
<P>
No way. If Adam had introduced himself with a palindrome -- even an imperfect 
one -- Eve certainly would not have responded with a longer one, knowing what 
egotists men are.

SORROW CAN WEAVE A MAGICAL SPELL

<P>
 Hell-Bent Men and Their Cities by Susan Dodd (Viking: $17.95). 
</P>
<P>
There's apt to be a moment in time, when you're reading, when the material by 
density of sorrow overwhelms elegance of style. It's the moment, if you happen 
to be teaching a literature class, when the students in the room begin to 
writhe like pythons, and collectively sigh and groan, "Why did you make us read 
this?" This in no way reflects on the quality of work that's being studied at 
the time, but is, rather, an index of the readers' pain threshold. The material 
is so sad that all the elegance and literary style in the world cannot contain 
it. To read work such as this is to undergo an operation by a great surgeon 
who's using the best instruments -- but somebody forgot the anesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
Cancer, lying, anorexia, career failure, old age and death are the topics in 
this collection of short stories, and the most painful by far is old age -- 
perfectly observed by the author, almost unbearable to read about. In 
"Sinatra," a woman from the East Coast goes to New Mexico to move her 
88-year-old father out of his sterile, lonely condo into the inevitable nursing 
home. It's not the nursing home that's so terrible -- the father, in fact, 
realizes he must go there -- but rather, it's that his brain is functional 
enough to know the full extent of the loneliness of his position, the 
ridiculousness of what he has come to. The subtext here is: His daughter is 
divorced, hasn't seen her father for a year and is as lonely as he is. 
</P>
<P>
In "Third World," a father, full of anguish, watches his daughter slip away 
from him, a victim of anorexia. His divorced wife has colluded with the child 
in her attempt at slow suicide: "Denise had catered for months to Melissa's 
sudden craving for crisp green leaves and sprouted seeds. She had even, she 
later confessed to me, boasted, telling her friends of this teen-age daughter 
who wouldn't dream of sugar and spice, butter and cream. They ate romaine 
together, my wife and child. The woman grew as slim as a girl, the girl as 
slight as a boy. Their eyes were set in hollows, their rage carried like 
concealed weapons." And the child is dying, while her self-centered mother 
grows more beautiful, more stupidly evil. 
</P>
<P>
The theme in these tales can be summed up by an old Johnny Ray tune from the 
'50s: "What's the Use?" What's the use, in "Higher Mathematics," when a 
heroine's mother, a woman who absolutely refuses to give in to the ravages of 
old age and lives in a bedroom like Barbara Cartland's, marries a nice man who 
dies before the first night of their marriage has even fairly begun? What's the 
use in "Subversive Coffee," in which a fanatical Israeli physician in running 
shoes decides to use the narrator's dying old dad as a kind of metaphorical 
football field to run up and down on? The doctor's a hero, the daughter can't 
help but fall in love with him, but the dad is dying, come hell or high water. 
</P>
<P>
In "Nightlife," yet another lonely, middle-aged daughter must put yet another 
infirm father in yet another nursing home. Again, the themes are loneliness, 
futility. The father, and an acquaintance of the father, are exquisitely, 
horribly conscious of their own infirmity, their own mortality. And yet, there 
is, in one man, one last dance. The story is profoundly true, profoundly sad. 
</P>
<P>
"Night Life" is the 11th tale in a collection of 15 stories. After "Night 
Life," there's that one about the hours-long marriage, then the cancer one, 
then an end on an "affirmative uplift" about a Talmudic scholar who gets to 
visit his teacher once a year. (I'm leaving out the stories that came earlier 
about unfaithful husbands, lying husbands, sordid affairs.) 
</P>
<P>
These are all beautifully, beautifully written! But they leave the reader with 
a craving for a triple martini and/or a Star Trek rerun. Anything, anything to 
take the mind off the decay and anguish that seems to be the lot of 
(intellectual) mankind in this century. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, rebelliously, I wonder whatever happened to joy? Is it only the 
dummies who get to have a good time anymore, get together and make love or 
square dance? Is it only the smart ones who have to ignore their dying parents 
or watch their children die of anorexia? If so, these stories are a powerful 
endorsement for the unexamined life.

DRESHER'S MODERN OPERA DRAWS ON AGE-OLD THEMES

<P>
Funny how the next wave seems to resurrect age-old themes and archetypes. In 
spite of its high-tech scenario in a biomedical laboratory, Paul Dresher's 
contemporary opera "Power Failure" is yet another morality play on the 
"Paradise Lost" theme. And, for all its electronic hardware and omnipresent 
speakers, its musical idiom and structure paid unceasing homage to the basic 
conventions of Baroque opera. 
</P>
<P>
For Friday night's Southern California debut of "Power Failure," Dresher and 
his Berkeley-based ensemble set up shop in the Spreckels Theatre, a suitably 
intimate setting for his four-character opera about a research scientist, Ruth 
Lehmann, who synthesizes a genetic cure-all for the diseases that plague 
humanity. Predictably, the amoral drug company CEO, Charles Smithson, attempts 
to suppress the discovery and sell it on a black market for the wealthy 
afflicted. In this traditional view of fallen humanity, the possibility for 
science to create "a heaven on Earth," as Rinde Eckert's terse but didactic 
libretto reiterates, is perverted by greed, and the scientist must destroy her 
miracle cure. 
</P>
<P>
Because Dresher is a gifted melodist, his lyrical, graceful arias for each 
character were the work's sturdy pillars. His few ensembles, however, were less 
compelling, and the composer's inability to develop larger forms and more 
complex textures muted the opera's dramatic effect. A pulsing, essentially 
electronic instrumental basso continuo dominated Dresher's musical foreground, 
and, although he claims to eschew the minimalist label, this aspect of his 
score clearly had such a cast to it. 
</P>
<P>
John Duykers' hefty, impressive tenor dominated the stage, as did his canny 
executive impersonation, a knowing fusion of Lee Iaccoca and Robert Schuller 
into a cunning, terminally smiling huckster of vapid moral uplift. 
Mezzo-soprano Stephanie Friedman projected an earnest scientist, although the 
musical impact of her role diminished as the opera progressed. 
</P>
<P>
Eckert's proletarian night watchman -- actually a gumshoe manque -- benefited 
from his stentorian projection, equally affecting in both his baritone and 
falsetto ranges. However, his character seemed a bit too omniscient for his 
role in the plot. Perhaps the audience was overly conscious that his character 
was also the author's voice interpreting the piece as the opera unfolded -- 
hardly a compliment to the listeners' perception. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Thomasa Eckert used her flexible, clear voice to etch the unfortunately 
modest emotional range of Judith Niles, Smithson's biographer and fantasized 
love interest. Michael Olich's geometric, metallic set, with its fluorescent 
lights and electronic graphics conjured the mood brilliantly, and the computer 
as high altar proved a telling symbol. Larry Neff's lighting underscored the 
opera's atomized, individualistic character depiction. 
</P>
<P>
In authentic Baroque fashion, the composer directed his three other 
instrumentalists (they played from each side of the stage from boxes neatly 
annexed to the set) from the keyboard, although for the most part he was 
playing synthesizers instead of a harpsichord. Dresher also contributed several 
deft electric guitar solos, which helped quicken his overly static score. 
</P>
<P>
Baroque opera seria flourished on a structural formula based on a string of 
brilliant solo arias, but Mozart came along and proved the undeniable dramatic 
strength of ensemble singing. Perhaps in writing "Pioneers," Dresher's sequel 
to "Power Failure," the young composer will take a tip from Mozart.

'TURANDOT': AFTER A DECADE'S TRAVEL, ALLEN CHARLES KLEIN'S CONTROVERSIAL 
VERSION OF PUCCINI'S CHINESE TALE ARRIVES IN ORANGE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reviled and controversial when it first appeared in the early 1980s (San 
Francisco Opera first saw it in the summer of 1982, after it had already 
visited Dallas, Houston and Miami), Allen Charles Klein's Disneyesque 
production of Puccini's "Turandot" has traveled much, to a mixed reception, 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, it arrived in Costa Mesa, just a few miles from the real 
Fantasyland in Anaheim, where it would surely fit right in. The decade-old 
production, more cartoony than legendary, still evokes more the ambience of 
mid-20th-Century Hollywood than ancient Peking, more Terry and the Pirates than 
Old China. 
</P>
<P>
In the welcoming atmosphere of Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, however, it looks like an unimaginative opera-lover's dream 
version of Puccini's final opera. And, as such, it was cheered enthusiastically 
by the dressed-to-kill, opening-night crowd on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Around this sometimes overwrought production, softened in some of its details 
-- at one time, the Emperor's beard was reportedly 12 feet long, for instance 
-- Opera Pacific has gathered respectable musical forces to essay Puccini's 
demanding score. Those forces have been given effective and canny stage 
direction by Matthew Lata. At the first performance, the large cast gave a more 
than adequate representation -- using the abridged Act III finale written by 
Franco Alfano. 
</P>
<P>
Looking genial and relaxed, Louis Salemno also conducted Act I without 
particular urgency; he was seconded rather half-heartedly by everyone on the 
packed Segerstrom stage. 
</P>
<P>
Salemno &amp; Co. seemed to come to life as the action of the opera progressed; 
by the time the controversial Alfano music arrived, genuine energy had gripped 
all hands. Even earlier, after it had warmed up, the orchestra, whose roster 
lists a number of familiar names, gave Salemno full value for his urgings. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Michael Carson, the large chorus -- twice as large as the "Traviata" 
chorus heard last month -- sang lustily and with healthy sounds, but seemed 
underpowered, not only in the first act, where everyone was tentative, but 
later as well. 
</P>
<P>
The principals also bloomed late. Johanna Meier's supremely vulnerable Princess 
-- she seemed to melt before our eyes in Act III -- began badly, with an "In 
questa reggia" so effortful and wobbly it put the remainder of the opera in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after, Meier appeared to recover, and from then on she integrated 
text and tone beautifully, giving all the while an object lesson in operatic 
acting. Meier is a valuable Turandot. 
</P>
<P>
Lando Bartolini, remembered from some mediocre New York City Opera performances 
at our Music Center a decade ago, proved this time around a worthy and 
admirable Calaf, one of reliable and ringing high notes, a manly, reassuring 
presence and utter stage-confidence. Rank pretty, vocally ordinary Maria 
Spacagna among the standard wimpy and unfaceted Lius of the world; she moves 
nicely, sings well and is eminently forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
For all his vocal roundness, Herbert Perry impersonated a stock and 
undistinctive Timur. But Ping, Pang and Pong, in the bright and resourceful 
trio of Ron Baker, Darren Keith Woods and Jonathan Green, made Act II, for 
once, a treat instead of a snore. Among the others, there were no standouts.

<P>
As if to underline her growth from 13-year-old child star into 31-year-old 
adult, Tanya Tucker announced from the stage Friday night that her musical 
taste nowadays ranges "from Mozart to Kitty Wells." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, much of what Tucker sang at the Celebrity Theatre was a slick, 
country-pop hybrid delivered with too much regard for the show-biz conventions 
she grew up with and not enough simplicity and heart. That's too bad: With her 
distinctive, burry twang of a voice, Tucker has the potential to be a 
countrified Bonnie Raitt, someone with real depth and authority. Raitt's genius 
is to sing every song as if she has lived it. Too often, Tucker just went for 
the gloss and came off as a singer with no ambition or motivation beyond being 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
On too many songs, Tucker's six-man band played anonymous arrangements that 
relied upon the synthesized layering and hollow, tinkling electronic keyboard 
sounds that are the trademark and bane of the country-pop form. It's a formula 
for instant, off-putting schmaltz that reeks of button-pushing artifice. To 
make things worse, Tucker's voice was under-amplified for much of the the 
show's first half. 
</P>
<P>
When the singer's older sister, LaCosta Tucker, came on for a brassy, 
three-song stretch at mid-set, the energy level actually improved. (Before 
leaving to change outfits while LaCosta sang, Tanya Tucker announced that she 
is helping to engineer a musical comeback for her sister, who had two Top 10 
country hits in the mid-'70s.) 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's show made it clear that she is trying to engineer a change of persona 
for herself. "I grew up in the business of country music. I'm still trying . . 
. to grow up," she said after announcing that her maturing musical tastes 
extend to Mozart. Part of that growing up evidently involves ditching her old, 
sexually racy stage image. The new Tucker was almost demure, dressed first in a 
white cowgirl outfit, then in a lacy white belle-of-the-ball gown. Aside from a 
couple of hip shakes, there was no sexual emphasis to Tucker's performance, and 
she omitted such sassy, lust-driven numbers as "Highway Robbery." 
</P>
<P>
But there is more to maturity than exchanging tight leathers for white lace. 
Tucker, though folksy and pleasant enough, came off as an unusually 
self-involved performer who kept talking about her history of hits and her 
recent career doings, instead of addressing the crowd on a more down-to-earth 
level that might have illuminated who she is and what she makes of life beyond 
the footlights. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Tucker brought out her adorable 7-month-old daughter, Presley Tanita, 
during her final bows but it was strictly another show-biz maneuver. Instead of 
easily charming the crowd with a glimpse of baby, why not sing a song about 
motherhood and set it up with some observations about her own experience? 
</P>
<P>
Also, as long as Tucker was going to fill us in with chat about the new album 
she is about to release and the new video she just shot for her new single, she 
might at least have given us some preview performances of her new songs. Not to 
do so was sheer stinginess, and in a set that lasted just 65 minutes, a little 
more generosity certainly would have been in order. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the show contained some good moments that make one hope Tucker really 
can enter a process of musical maturation that will lead her from slickness and 
convention to the possibilities of deeper, more personal expression. With the 
tritely contemporary keyboards toned down and the band providing simple 
accompaniment and some strong gospel-tinged backing vocals, Tucker had 
effectively plaintive moments on "Strong Enough to Bend" and "Love Me Like You 
Used to." Countrified oldies such as "What's Your Mama's Name" and "Delta Dawn" 
also held up well. A show-closing rendition of Tucker's recent hit, "My Arms 
Stay Open All Night," offered more of that suspicious country-pop hybrid 
strain, but a brightly affirmative, solidly rocking delivery made it work. 
</P>
<P>
The Desert Rose Band runs afoul of the country-music industry's wariness of 
intrusion from rockers in cowpoke's clothing, which is probably why leader 
Chris Hillman told the Celebrity Theatre audience that he is "still trying to 
dodge that old country-rock label. . . . Good old hillbilly rock 'n' roll is 
what we do." 
</P>
<P>
In a better world, a band as strong as Desert Rose wouldn't have to worry about 
jumping through properly named hoops in order to improve its commercial 
prospects. It would just go out and play the way it did Friday night, and let 
the terminology fall where it may. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Desert Rose Band is a country-rock band. There were Eagles 
resonances in its more pop-ish moments ("I Still Believe in You"), and, with a 
little extra bluegrass accent thrown in, the band's basic approach isn't that 
different from the Southern California country-rockers of the early '70s. Heck, 
as a Byrd and a Flying Burrito Brother, Hillman was in on the ground floor of 
that movement himself. 
</P>
<P>
While pedigree may matter to country-radio programmers and Nashville moguls, 
all that counted on stage was the splendid singing and playing of this 
cornucopia of a band. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman's lead singing is straightforward and effective, but it was the rich, 
accurate harmony blend of three, sometimes four voices that really captured the 
ear. Desert Rose's two instrumental soloists, John Jorgenson on guitars and 
mandolin, and Jay Dee Maness on pedal steel guitar, both played with a 
jeweler's precision and an epicure's taste. Together, they set up an 
instrumental weave that was the equal counterpart of the vocal blend. Maness, 
formerly one of Buck Owens' Buckaroos, is a definitive player who made his 
notes hop, skitter or soar as the situation commanded. That old standby, the 
anthem rocker, took on special verve and grandeur in Desert Rose's hands, 
thanks to Maness' soaring, wind-swept colorations. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't a dud song in the hourlong set. Especially effective was a 
mid-show pairing of socially conscious numbers: first the aching, 
Mexican-flavored lament, "For the Rich Man" (about the plight of illegal Latino 
immigrants), then "Darkness on the Playground," a charging rock anthem that 
gets at some of the complexities (kids adrift through lack of adult 
responsibility in teaching values) of the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
There was just one delicacy missing from Desert Rose's tightly arranged 
bouquet. The band barely departed from its structured, close-to-the-record 
craftsmen's approach, when it would have been fun to hear it let go with the 
free-flying, back and forth soloing of a traditional bluegrass band. (There was 
a bit of that at the end, when a concluding train-rhythm number allowed 
Jorgenson room to take off on a high-powered express run.) When a band is this 
good, it's a special pleasure to watch it throw out the plan and take a song 
into uncharted reaches.

BARBIERI QUINTET AT COACH HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's no mistaking the tenor sax sound of Gato Barbieri. His lusty tone and 
the naked, climactic nature of his improvisations gave his music its trademark 
eroticism long before he recorded the soundtrack to "Last Tango in Paris." 
</P>
<P>
Barbieri's first set Saturday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano was 
full of the emotion for which the Argentinian-native is known. Leading a 
quintet through a heavily Latin-influenced program of originals and the 
occasional standard, the saxophonist showed a considered, narrative style of 
soloing, full of simple, expressive statements peppered with loud outbursts and 
elephantine cries that sounded as though they were pulled right out of a Tarzan 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
Barbieri's tone and his thematic approach to a solo still owe much to Sonny 
Rollins, one of his early infuences. But his attack is pure John Coltrane, ripe 
with confession and filled with anguished shouts that begin and end on a single 
note. Barbieri doesn't display the technical skills of Coltrane or Rollins; 
rather than constructing long, intricate statements, he prefers to string 
together simple melody variations while building to a climax. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the numbers heard Saturday followed the same format: Barbieri 
floated sustained, gritty tones over waves of percussion from drummer Rich 
Gonzales and percussionist Guilherme Franco while pianist Eddy Martinez swirled 
up and down the keyboard. The rhythm onslaught subsided and a groove, led by 
bassist Nilson Matta, was established before Barbieri stated the theme. 
Percussive support increased as the saxophonist's statements became more 
frantic, finally culminating with Barbieri's gravelly declarations and piercing 
screams. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, and the Latin rhythms imposed over every selection, tunes as 
disparate as "What a Difference a Day Makes" and Barbieri's own "Yamarito" all 
ended up sounding pretty much the same. Surely the saxophonist knows that, just 
as with love, variety keeps the program interesting.BILL KOHLHAASE

TIJUANA'S XEWT-TV TARGETS BOOMING LATINO AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tijuana-based Spanish-language station XEWT-TV (Channel 12) has launched its 
first major marketing campaign in San Diego, signaling a new round in the 
competition for the county's rapidly growing Latino television audience. 
</P>
<P>
New advertisements touting the station as "Orgullosamente Mexicano," or 
"Proudly Mexican," began appearing on buses last week. A billboard campaign is 
scheduled to begin this week. 
</P>
<P>
XEWT opened an office in Coronado two years ago and last year increased the 
number of local news crews from three to seven, including two specifically 
assigned to North County. The station also has four crews covering Baja 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The Televisa-owned station is negotiating to be included in the local Arbitron 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is the nation's 13th largest Latino 
audience, according to Miami-based Strategy Research Corp. Latinos accounted 
for 17% of San Diego County's population in 1988, San Diego Assn. of 
Governments statistics show. And the Latino population is growing almost three 
times as fast as the non-Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
"We made the determination that, for 29 years, we'd been broadcasting in 
Tijuana, but there was this enormous border market staring us right in the 
face," said James Gross, XEWT sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
The new kid on the Spanish-language block is KBNT-TV (Channel 19), which went 
on the air Jan. 1. It is a "low-power" station, with an extremely limited 
signal range, but is affiliated with the popular Univision network. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until (January), XEWT was the only station available to the San Diego 
Hispanic audience," said Philip Wilkinson, president and general manager of 
KBNT. "Now viewers have a choice." 
</P>
<P>
In March, KBNT will begin broadcasting local news briefs on weekday evenings. 
</P>
<P>
"We are promoting ourselves as the only San Diego Hispanic broadcaster," 
Wilkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
KBNT is negotiating to have the Daniels and Dimension cable systems carry the 
station. It would make sense because both now take the Univision satellite 
feed. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Southwestern will drop XEWT to pick up the Univision programming of 
KBNT, which includes World Cup soccer games. (XEWT can be picked up more easily 
than KBNT with a conventional antenna, a Southwestern spokesman said.) XEWT now 
shares a channel on Southwestern with KSCI, a multi-language channel. But, in 
March, KBNT will get its own channel on the Southwestern dial. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to provide programming for Hispanics," said Southwestern spokesman 
Jeff Van Deerlin. "We thought it was a natural." 
</P>
<P>
KFMB-TV (Channel 8) promotions producer Elyse Westing thought she was simply 
going to comment on the weather Wednesday night when a station photographer 
appeared in a restaurant while she was having dinner with her boyfriend, Doug 
Sensabaugh. She had been set up. With tape rolling, Sensabaugh took out a ring 
and proposed marriage. Stunned but undeterred, she accepted. In the spirit of 
Valentine's Day, the station ran the tape during the 11 p.m. news. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's more than a little entertaining to read San Diego Union Sports Editor 
Barry Lorge taking potshots at the sports department of the Union's sister 
paper, the Tribune. Referring to the "breathless nonsense that passes for 
journalism in a certain afternoon paper," Lorge blasted the Trib's coverage of 
attempts by Sports Arena operators Harry Cooper and Richard Esquinas to build a 
new arena and attract an NBA team. "With the shameless shilling of the San 
Diego Tribune, Cooper and Esquinas haven't had to pay any publicists," Lorge 
wrote. He's right, of course. But who expected to read about it in the Union. .

The fifth annual International Style Film Festival at the University of 
California, San Diego, begins Tuesday night with "A Taxing Woman's Return." 
Fifteen films are scheduled, screening once a week, including the Australian 
"Prisoner of St. Petersburg" and Finnish "Talvisolta," neither of which has an 
American distributor yet. Other scheduled films include "Bandits," from France; 
"Gonza the Spearman," from Japan; "South," from Argentina, and "The 
Dressmaker," from England.". . . 
</P>
<P>
KFMB-FM (B100) has launched an extensive promotional campaign, but none of the 
ads mention the "morning zoo" team, fueling speculation that a change is in the 
works. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don't plan on seeing any more large furry animals on the Channel 8 news set for 
quite a while. During a Valentine's Day newscast, a bear from the Moscow 
Circus, which was supposed to be warm and cuddly, turned out to be large and 
curious, taking over the set for several minutes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In a step toward rounding out its morning show, KGB-FM (101.5) has hired Shelly 
Dunn from KSLX-FM in Phoenix to do news. She is scheduled to start Tuesday. 
Meanwhile, Jim McInnes continues to team with Cookie (Chainsaw) Randolph, with 
no replacement in sight, but the station has reportedly placed an ad in Radio 
and Record magazine seeking a new morning guy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Channel 10 is producing a one-hour special from reporter Mark Matthews' trip to 
Colombia. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously absent from KNSD-TV's (Channel 39) current ratings sweeps 
strategy is a monthlong "project." Last year, the station relied on the 
projects, which dealt with one subject for the entire month (such as aging, or 
"Life Planning"), as its big gun. But the ratings didn't reward their public 
service, and, for now, the concept is dead. "To identify one single issue and a 
devote a month to it you can dilute it to the point that you take away any real 
importance," said general manager Neil Derrough. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Things were so slow at the La Jolla home of Richard Silberman and Susan Golding 
on Friday afternoon that one news-hungry radio reporter, starving for audio, 
spent a few minutes in a valiant attempt to entice the couple's dogs to bark. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39 won a silver medal at the International Film and TV Festival of New 
York for its "Straight to You" promotional campaign. 
</P>
<P>
. . . For the second year in a row, KKLQ (Q106) assistant program director 
Kevin Weatherly finished first in a national contest in which participants 
predict the hit songs. And, for the second year in a row, he must decide 
whether to accept as his prize a new Porsche or the equivalent in cash. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KFMB radio's Dan McAllister has taken the job of local sales manager with Edens 
Broadcasting's KOY in Phoenix, where he will work for former KFSD-FM (94.1) 
general manager Nancy Reynolds.

Warner Bros. Embargoes Pirates: The Caped Crusader is battling video pirates on 
the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
Pirated copies of the film "Batman" and other blockbusters are big business in 
Cyprus, where local television is limited in scope. Now U.S. film giant Warner 
Bros. has stepped in with a court injunction preventing one of the island's 
biggest video stores from renting out pirated copies of Batman. The film 
company and its local distributor are claiming up to $52,500 for damages and 
copyright infringement. SHAUNA SNOW

NBC Shuffles Lineup: NBC has announced several changes in its prime-time 
lineup, including moving the comedy series "Alf" to Saturdays at 8 p.m. and 
bringing back "My Two Dads" on Mondays at 8 p.m. "Alf" will replace "227," 
which will go on hiatus, to return to the schedule later in the season. The 
changes, which are scheduled to go into effect the first week of March, are the 
first of a series of shuffles that will make room for tryouts of "close to a 
dozen" new NBC series, according to NBC Entertainment President Brandon 
Tartikoff. SHAUNA SNOW

More on Buchwald Trial: When the second phase of the Buchwald vs. Paramount 
Pictures trial begins later this year, the studio can be held liable for 
punitive damages should Buchwald's attorneys prove impropriety in Paramount's 
bookkeeping for "Coming to America." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider added the punitive damages ruling to his 
original verdict in the case, handed down last month, in which Buchwald and 
co-plaintiff Alain Bernheim were awarded 19% of the net profits of the Eddie 
Murphy hit. Paramount maintains that the movie, which has taken in an estimated 
$350 million, has earned no net profits. Paramount is to begin turning over 
documents to Buchwald's auditors during the discovery portion of the accounting 
phase beginning next month. Attorneys expect to go to trial by early summer.

Director Files $6-Million Suit: Director Adrian Lyne claims he is still owed 
money from making the movie "9 1/2 Weeks." Lyne, who also directed "Flashdance" 
and "Fatal Attraction," went to court Friday in Los Angeles, saying the 
production company Jonesfilm and financier Sidney Kimmel agreed to pay him 
$200,000 two years after the movie was released in 1986. Lyne claims his 
contract entitled him to 10% of the gross receipts from the Kim Basinger/Micky 
Rourke film, so he's seeking more than $6 million in damages, an accounting of 
the film's box office receipts and an injunction to prevent "9 1/2 Weeks" from 
being distributed or exhibited. SHAUNA SNOW

POP CAPSULES : ITALS AT MUSIC MACHINE: PUSHING TOO HARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Itals stood conventional roots reggae wisdom on its head during an hourlong 
performance at the Music Machine on Friday. Reggae is often criticized for 
being too laid back, but the Jamaican vocal trio's harmonizing was more edgy 
and shrill than the smooth, rounded singing offered by, say, the Mighty 
Diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was exciting at first but gradually became grating, but the 
Itals made a dramatic comeback during an encore that lasted as long as the set 
proper. 
</P>
<P>
There, the group didn't push the singing at the audience so relentlessly, the 
fuller, deeper singing of Ronnie Davis took the lead from Keith Porter on a 
couple of numbers (particularly a great snippet of the Temptations' "Ain't Too 
Proud to Beg"), and the eight-piece band borrowed from second-billed Ras 
Michael grew more accustomed to backing the Itals. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening set, Ras Michael's use of Nyabinghi drumming (the "heartbeat" 
rhythm early reggae drew from Rastafarian devotional music) and Arabic-tinged 
melodies was unusual enough to overcome some ragged stretches. DON SNOWDEN

MUSEUM'S 'IMAGES' INTRIGUING, BUT ART IT'S NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Millions of people see the fool-the-eye three-dimensional dove on their Visa 
card every day without realizing they're looking at a hologram, a miniature 
marvel of technology and optics. 
</P>
<P>
"Images in Space and Time," an exhibit of 200 holograms from 15 countries 
continuing at the California Museum of Science and Industry, attempts to show 
how the growing use of holography is affecting such diverse fields as medicine, 
manufacturing, information storage and the fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
The scientific and industrial applications constitute the most interesting part 
of the exhibit. "Coronary Artery" by Lee Lacey (U.S., 1985) reveals how the 
blood vessels embrace the heart muscle -- and how a doctor can find a partially 
blocked artery that requires surgery. Lacey's "Holo/CAD" (1985) combines 
holography with computer-generated drawings of an instrument panel for a new 
car. The three-dimensional image tells more about how the finished panel would 
look than a flat drawing would, enabling the designer to make adjustments early 
in production. 
</P>
<P>
Some Soviet experiments using holograms to replace fragile art objects in 
museum displays are somewhat less successful. Holographic diamonds don't 
sparkle, which takes a lot of the fun out of looking at a case of jeweled 
medallions. As a hologram only records a single point of view, it's impossible 
to examine some ancient gold ornaments from various angles to see how they were 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the most sophisticated technical accomplishments often produce the 
least impressive images. Toshiro Kubota has devised a way of layering 
monochromatic holograms to create fully colored, three-dimensional images: His 
"Dojo: Japanese Doll" (Japan, 1985) represents a technological breakthrough, 
but it's so realistic that to the casual observer, it just looks like a doll in 
a case. 
</P>
<P>
The examples of "fine art" are the least successful works in the exhibition. 
The 3-D effect is initially intriguing, but when the novelty wears off, the 
viewer is left contemplating a series of vapid technical exercises that are 
devoid of content. These tendencies are summed up in Robert Schinella's 
hilariously kitsch study, "Witch and Devil" (U.S., 1973), created for the 
Museum of Witchcraft and Magic on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco -- where 
it should have remained. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, none of the artists represented here seem able to go beyond that 
penny arcade/peepshow mentality. 
</P>
<P>
In "Wine Goblet" by Charles Lysogorski (U.S., 1986), the full bowl of a glass 
hovers over its broken stem; odd bits of junk seem to float inside a real 
aquarium in Claudette Abrams' silly "Personal Effects" (Canada, 1986). Michael 
Snow's attempts to do portraits and figure studies make real people look like 
cheap department store mannequins. 
</P>
<P>
With 200 holograms on display, there's a lot to look at in "Images," but that 
doesn't mean there's a lot to see. The viewer learns that holography is good 
for more than those little doves that make it tough to counterfeit credit 
cards. But the technology is still waiting for someone to explore its aesthetic 
potential seriously, the way contemporary composers are exploring synthesized 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
A word of caution: The show is designed to be seen by someone about 5-feet-6. 
Boxes are provided for children to stand on, but tall people should be prepared 
for sore knees and shoulders from all the stooping they'll do.

"Images in Time and Space" continues in the Armoury Room of the California 
Museum of Science and Industry, 700 State Drive, through March 25. Information:

POP CAPSULES : TUCKER GOES FOR GLOSS AT CELEBRITY THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As if to underline her growth from the 13-year-old child star of old into a 
31-year-old adult, Tanya Tucker announced from the Celebrity Theatre stage on 
Friday that her tastes nowadays range "from Mozart to Kitty Wells." 
Unfortunately, much of what Tucker sang during the Anaheim concert was a slick, 
country-pop hybrid delivered with too much regard for the show-biz conventions 
she grew up with, and not enough simplicity and heart. 
</P>
<P>
That's too bad: With her distinctive, burry twang of a voice, Tucker has the 
potential to be a countrified Bonnie Raitt, someone with real depth and 
authority. Raitt's genius is to sing every song as if she has lived it. Too 
often, Tucker just went for the gloss, and came off as a singer with no 
ambition or motivation beyond being popular. 
</P>
<P>
The Desert Rose Band's hourlong opening set was a cornucopia of brilliant 
instrumental soloing, rich vocal harmonies and strong material from the band 
that is single-handedly restoring country-rock's good name. Other ex-Byrds are 
more famous, but Desert Rose leader Chris Hillman is the one stretching his 
creative wings most impressively 25 years on. MIKE BOEHM

POP CAPSULES : 'CUBES, PRIMITIVES IN HOLLYWOOD'S BASTION OF ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iceland's Sugarcubes and England's Primitives are two bands noted for "attitude 
problems" -- audience-baiting and aloofness, respectively. Thus were they 
suited to pair up for a Friday double-bill at that steamy bastion of attitude, 
the Hollywood Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
The intricacies of the Sugarcubes' inventive sound were lost in the Palladium's 
non-musical acoustics, and singer Einar Orn's thickly accented insincerity got 
older faster. It didn't help that the 65-minute set was sabotaged halfway 
through by the departure (from "vocal strain") of female singer Bjork 
Gudmundsdottir, the yearning musical good cop to Orn's ranting bad cop. Left to 
front the group alone, Orn did so as if leading a thrash band, and some of 
their most popular numbers were necessarily preempted. 
</P>
<P>
If the 'Cubes weren't quite up to their good rep, the Primitives -- who got 
mediocre notices for previous club appearances -- overcame their bad one and 
were actually enhanced by the hall. Their noted lack of charisma was less of a 
drawback in this unintimate setting, and their simpler sound -- a Velvet 
cushion with bubble-gum underneath -- filled the Palladium with a big, bouncy, 
beautiful post-Blondie power-pop foam, as if new wave never went away. CHRIS 
WILLMAN

MALATHION OUTCRY ANGERS GROWERS IN CENTRAL VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANGER, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cold wind blew across Sarkis Sarabian's back as he walked between a line of 
grapevines, which fill the landscape like rows of dark skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
Four generations of Sarabians have lived on this land in the Central Valley, 
surviving successive invasions of powdery mildew, frost, torrential rain, 
root-eating nematodes, variegated leaf hoppers and any number of other pests 
and threats. 
</P>
<P>
But on this wintry day, Sarabian stood in his field and worried about his 
chances of surviving a new invasion -- this time from an enemy looming 200 
miles away in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be the straw that breaks the camel's back," he said as he scratched 
his boot against the sandy loam of his farm. 
</P>
<P>
The enemy is the Mediterranean fruit fly, a pest that is now separated from the 
farm-rich Central Valley -- which encompasses the San Joaquin and Sacramento 
valleys -- by just the desolate peaks of the Tehachapi Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Seven months ago, when a single fly was found near Dodger Stadium, growers like 
Sarabian barely paid attention to the small talk about this tiny, exotic fly. 
It had been eradicated so many times before that everyone figured the state 
would do it again. 
</P>
<P>
But as the months passed, the persistent spread of the bug in Southern 
California and the growing political opposition to aerial malathion spraying 
have farmers worried that it may not be so simple this time. 
</P>
<P>
For growers, the battle over the Medfly has reached a disturbing point. The 
community opposition in Los Angeles and Orange counties to aerial spraying is 
both shocking and baffling to men who have sprayed crops all their lives with 
far more dangerous chemicals. The bevy of celebrities who have grabbed the 
attention of television cameras in the campaign to stop spraying has left them 
frustrated at their inability to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
In the coffee shops, packing sheds and farmhouses scattered through the Central 
Valley, the farmers are beginning to murmur that this battle could be lost. 
</P>
<P>
"It could get hairy," said farmer Glenn Nilmeier of Sanger. "I haven't lost any 
sleep yet, but it's getting there." 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the economic well-being of one of the richest fruit producing areas 
in the world. The farms in the Central Valley's southern half alone churn out 
more grapes, raisins, nectarines, peaches, plums and pomegranates than any 
other spot in the nation. The state estimates that $5 billion in crops are in 
jeopardy of being infested with the fly. 
</P>
<P>
The danger to these farms that cut a jagged patchwork across the Central Valley 
is real. During the great Northern California Medfly infestation of 1980-82, 
the mere perception that California fruit was infested, coupled with an 
abundant crop that year, sent prices plummeting. Peaches that normally sold for 
$6 a box dropped to $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
While the '80-'82 infestation was largely concentrated around Santa Clara 
County, some Medflies managed to find their way to Stockton and Westley in San 
Joaquin County. Crops in both areas were quarantined. 
</P>
<P>
If that happened in Sanger, Sarabian said, he could lose not just a business, 
but a life that has been passed from generation to generation. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in L.A.," he said, "they just don't understand. I'm going to lose a 
way of life. Maybe that's nothing big to someone else, but it means something 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
Sarabian, 57, has lived nearly all his life within a few hundred feet of where 
he was born. Even today, within hollering distance of his office in an old 
farmhouse are four generations of Sarabians, including his 88-year-old mother. 
</P>
<P>
The landscape is dotted with his family's mementos. Just a stone's throw from 
Sarabian's window is a white mulberry tree his father planted 60 years ago with 
a clipping from their native Armenia. A decaying tree house built by his two 
sons dangles from its branches. 
</P>
<P>
In his father's days, farmers battled the constant flood of insect invaders 
with a mask, a hand sprayer and chemicals so dangerous that even Sarabian 
shudders to think about them. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's done with a tractor and a mechanized sprayer the size of a jet engine 
that can spew pesticide over 40 acres in a day. 
</P>
<P>
For Sarabian, the problem in dealing with the Medfly is not killing it -- 
that's easy, even with a hand sprayer. But if even a few flies are found in the 
area, it would trigger a fruit quarantine by other states and countries where 
90% of his grapes and tree fruit now goes. 
</P>
<P>
If an infestation occurs, "Japan wouldn't even talk to us. Taiwan is just 
looking for an excuse not to take our fruit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "If I can't market my fruit, I walk." 
</P>
<P>
Infested fruit can be fumigated with a pesticide or put in cold storage to make 
it acceptable for export, he said. But it costs money to build those 
facilities, money that the average farmer doesn't have. 
</P>
<P>
Sarabian noted that farmers wouldn't be the only ones to suffer if the Medfly 
found its way into the Central Valley. Much of his fruit is shipped out of Los 
Angeles, he said. The plastic bags for his grapes come from a company in 
Ontario. Labels for Sark's brand peaches come from San Francisco and the paper 
trays he uses to dry raisins come from Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"They better think again about protesting" malathion spraying, Sarabian said. 
"It may mean no jobs up here, but it'll also mean no jobs for people in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Sarabian said he and other farmers could probably survive a Medfly infestation. 
But life in Sanger and thereabouts is economically precarious to begin with, 
and it doesn't take much to tip the balance. 
</P>
<P>
Down the road from the Sarabians, Keith Nilmeier and his father, Glenn, have 
built up their family's farm during the past few decades to about 400 acres of 
grapevines and fruit trees. Nilmeier lost an entire crop of oranges once when 
temperatures dropped to 19 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost everything," the son said, adding that most farmers have lost at least 
one crop in their lives. He went back to driving a truck for a few years to 
keep the farm going. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, Nilmeier estimated he lost about 15% of his crop when the 
temperature dropped to 25 degrees for five hours. He stayed up all night, 
burning bags of peach pits to raise the temperature in the grove 2 or 3 
degrees. The next day, Nilmeier was tired, but calm about the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just something you live with," he said. "You can't fight nature." 
</P>
<P>
What is infuriating to the farmers about the Medfly infestation in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties is that, unlike the cold, they see it as a fight that can 
be won. All it takes is a little malathion, they say. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, the debate over malathion's safety has grown in 
intensity. On the farms around Sanger, people laugh. "I think they're nuts," 
Glenn Nilmeier said of the spraying foes. "They're goofy, they're crazy." 
</P>
<P>
For farmers, malathion is so tame that few have ever used it on their crops. 
There are numerous pesticides that do the job better. "For Christ's sake," 
Nilmeier said. "This kills me. My wife uses (malathion) to kill ants around the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
When Nilmeier sprays, he doesn't use ounces of pesticide per acre, but pounds. 
"I just got through spraying a ton of parathion," he said, referring to an 
extremely toxic cousin of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
But Nilmeier, whose farm was started by his grandparents 90 years ago, is 
growing pessimistic that the state will be able to continue the malathion 
spraying in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980-'82 Medfly infestation in Northern California, he lay awake at 
night worried about the bug slowly buzzing southward toward his farm. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he's not just worried, he's mad. Speaking of Los Angeles, he said, 
"Some stupid jackass down there brought it in in the first place. A damn hippy 
town. The most narrow-minded bunch of people. All they can do is drive fast on 
the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in the Central Valley is comfortable with the heavy use of 
chemicals. Environmental and farm worker groups have raised concerns about the 
decades of pesticide use that in some cases have sickened workers and 
contaminated ground water. 
</P>
<P>
Neither does every farmer support the repeated spraying of malathion to combat 
Medflies. Take David Mas Masumoto, one of the younger generation of farmers who 
have tried to move away from the traditional dependence on chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Masumoto, who farms 80 acres of grapes and peaches with his father in Del Rey, 
refuses to use highly toxic pesticides on his crops not only because of the 
cost, but also the danger. Several years ago, his father broke out in a rash 
after using a fungicide. "He spent the summer inside hiding," said Masumoto, 
36. "I thought, 'This is no way to farm.' " 
</P>
<P>
But even an organic-leaning farmer like Masumoto believes there should be a 
compromise in the Medfly fight. He favors continued spraying, but a restriction 
on the number of times any one spot is targeted. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Nakayama, 36, a third generation Japanese-American who runs a 250-acre 
farm with his father and brother in nearby Fowler, said the frustration of the 
farmer with the Medfly controversy is rooted in the maddening fact that so much 
of a farmer's life is controlled by people who know so little about 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Nakayama gave the example of actress Meryl Streep -- almost a swear word around 
his house -- and her public call for a ban on Alar-treated apples. The federal 
government later declared the chemical safe. "She single-handedly destroyed the 
apple industry that year and not so much as an, 'I'm sorry,' " he said in 
disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
Nakayama said he's given up trying to figure out the public. On one hand, they 
demand fewer chemicals on their fruit. But they also want fruit of such 
perfection that the farmer is forced to turn to an arsenal of toxic fungicides, 
insecticides and herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Nakayama said there used to be a variety of peach raised around 
Fresno called the Alberta that locals still rave about today. It was sweeter, 
juicier and tastier than any peach he's ever eaten, he said. But it spoiled 
quickly and didn't have the red blush that the public loves. 
</P>
<P>
About five years ago, Nakayama finally gave up on the Alberta and pulled out 
the last of his trees. "We could hardly give the fruit away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Medfly reaches the Central Valley, it will only mean more pesticide 
spraying on fruit, he said. And he figures that can only lead to more 
farmer-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has me scared silly," Nakayama said.

JAPAN RULING PARTY WINS DECISIVELY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS OVERCOME POLITICAL SCANDAL TO WIN A MAJORITY OF 
SEATS IN THE LOWER HOUSE. BUT THE SOCIALISTS MAKE GAINS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Recovering from a humiliating defeat only last July, Japan's ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party overcame a record surge by the Socialists to win a decisive 
victory in a crucial House of Representatives election, final returns showed 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democrats and other "unaffiliated" conservatives expected to join or 
vote with the governing party had won 289 seats, a majority of 33 in the 
512-seat lower house, the chamber that chooses the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
A large turnout of 73.3% of the nation's 90.6 million eligible voters cast 
ballots in clear, unseasonably warm weather Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After just four hours of tabulations, NHK, the quasi-governmental national 
radio and TV network, declared that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's party was 
assured of winning a majority. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 opposition party, the Socialists, who advocate unarmed neutrality, 
added a record 55 seats to bolster their position in the lower chamber to 141 
seats, including "unaffiliated" winners expected to vote with them. Their 
biggest previous gain -- 27 seats -- came in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Not since 1967 have the Socialists won as many as 141 seats in the lower house. 
Four years ago, they won only 86, a historic low. 
</P>
<P>
But losses among three other opposition parties enabled Kaifu's party to extend 
its 35-year control of the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
The results were surprising, coming as they did on the trail of political 
problems that had resulted in the unprecedented loss of the LDP's majority in 
the upper house of Parliament in elections last July. These problems included a 
taxation controversy, accusations that many ruling party stalwarts were guilty 
of playing "money politics" and widespread dissatisfaction within Japan's 
important farming sector. 
</P>
<P>
Even without such problems, the Liberal Democrats could not have realistically 
expected a victory larger than the one they achieved, in the view of veteran 
observers. Japanese voters traditionally have swayed away from the Liberal 
Democrats after each major lower house victory scored by the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
In the last lower house election in 1986, the Liberal Democrats wound up with 
310 seats after embracing other conservative winners. 
</P>
<P>
The victory bolstered the fragile position of Kaifu, who was plucked from 
obscurity last August after an influence-buying scandal smeared all mainstream 
party leaders. He promised to use Sunday's victory to carry out political 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her party's gains, Takako Doi, the Socialists' charismatic chairwoman, 
said that the failure to unseat the Liberal Democrats was "very unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Ichiro Ozawa, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general, said opposition parties 
had failed to come up with any clear policy for a Socialist-led coalition. 
Voters, he added, decided they could not turn the government over to such an 
uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
Voters supported Liberal Democrats' "policy formed with eyes on the ground," 
Kaifu said. "Reverse winds" blowing against the party have changed 
considerably, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The turnaround in Liberal Democratic fortunes, however, did nothing to clear up 
the foggy political situation created by the party's loss last July of its 
majority in the House of Councilors. 
</P>
<P>
Ozawa declared that the party would use its majority in the lower house to 
reelect Kaifu as prime minister without attempting to form a coalition. But he 
also stressed the need for the governing party to discuss parliamentary deals 
with opposition parties in light of the conservatives' minority position in the 
House of Councilors. 
</P>
<P>
All legislation, except for the budget and international treaties, must be 
approved by the upper house as well as by the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Masashi Yamakawa, director of Nikko Securities' Osaka stock division, said the 
election result "cleared a big hurdle" but added that stockbrokers "can't 
welcome the news with open hands" Because of expectations that the Central Bank 
would carry out its fourth increase since last May 31 in the central discount 
rate it charges for loans to commercial institutions. The rate is now 4.25%. 
</P>
<P>
The yen finished morning trading at 144.45 to the dollar on the Tokyo Foreign 
Exchange Market, up 0.10 from Friday's close. Because of a fear of higher 
interest rates, stocks, however, fell 217.90 points to 37,242.42 in morning 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the campaign, pollsters had predicted that the Liberal 
Democrats would win only a narrow victory. But voters -- as they did in 1980, 
when the perennial ruling party also faced the threat of defeat going into a 
lower house election -- returned to the fold, apparently out of fear of a 
Socialist-led coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democratic Party and the conservative forces that preceded it in 
office have governed Japan without interruption since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, whose revolt against the conservatives' moves to open markets to 
agricultural imports devastated the ruling party last July, displayed only a 
small measure of discontent this time. 
</P>
<P>
In the rice-rich Tohoku (Northeast) area and on the mikan (mandarin orange) 
island of Shikoku, conservatives lost 11 of the 56 seats they won four years 
ago. The showing, however, was a sharp gain from last July, when Liberal 
Democratic candidates were wiped out in both agricultural regions. 
</P>
<P>
The anger of women voters, who rebelled last year against a controversial 3% 
consumption tax implemented by the Liberal Democrats, appeared to play a 
smaller role in the results than was the case in July. Although 74.6% of women 
voters -- 2.7% more than the male turnout -- cast ballots, 12 out of 66 women 
candidates -- five more than in 1986 -- were elected. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, 22 women won seats in the upper chamber, the highest ever. 
</P>
<P>
Except for one newcomer, all candidates tainted in the Recruit Co. 
influence-buying scandal that forced former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to 
resign last June won reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita, who received nearly $1.5 million in contributions and profits from 
Recruit Co. stocks, was reelected handily, while former Prime Minister Yasuhiro 
Nakasone, who received nearly $800,000, survived the most severe challenge he 
has had in 17 elections dating back to 1947. He finished third among four 
winners in his Gumma prefecture (state) district. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not know the words with which to thank you," he told supporters after his 
victory was confirmed Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition forces made a special attempt to unseat Nakasone, who violated no 
laws despite the money he received from Recruit Co., an information and real 
estate conglomerate. But voters of Gumma prefecture returned three of the four 
candidates they have elected every year since 196. The one exception: Yasuo 
Fukuda, 53, replaced his father, former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, 85, who 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Sosuke Uno, who resigned when he was smeared by a sex 
scandal in the aftermath of July's debacle, also was reelected. 
</P>
<P>
The Socialists' Doi claimed that voters' desire to abolish the 10-month-old 3% 
consumption tax led to a spurt in support for her party. She reiterated her

UNSUSPECTING LANDLADY THRUST INTO DRUG WAR;

A year and a half ago, Marge Andrews put her La Habra Heights home up for rent. 
It was a big place -- $2,500 a month -- with a tennis court and weeping willow 
trees. Within days, a tenant had come forward, a Sacramento businessman named 
William Black Jr. He signed a six-month lease, and the 61-year-old grandmother 
handed him the keys, unaware she had just been drawn into the local war on 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, Andrews dropped by her three-bedroom home and found the 
aftermath of a three-quarter-ton cocaine raid. The house was deserted, door 
locks had been smashed and someone had dug a concrete vault the size of a wine 
celler under the bathroom downstairs. Outside, her 50-year-old trees had been 
stripped bare. 
</P>
<P>
When she complained, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies told her that a 
cadre of Colombian drug dealers had been living in her home, and Black -- a law 
enforcement operative -- had set them up for arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews' story illustrates how the cocaine wars in Southern California have 
reached even the most tranquil corners of suburbia, thrusting unsuspecting 
citizens into the fray. Each year, drug traffickers rent several hundred homes 
in Los Angeles County to store cocaine before distribution, said Curt Hazell, 
head of the district attorney's major narcotics unit. 
</P>
<P>
The dealers typically are drawn to quiet residential communities like La Habra 
Heights because, Hazell said, "their whole M.O. is to be low key." 
</P>
<P>
Although narcotics officers make frequent drug raids -- the sheriff's major 
narcotics teams alone conducted 1,426 such raids last year -- damage complaints 
from homeowners and tenants are relatively rare. 
</P>
<P>
The county counsel's office estimates that 25 claims a year are filed against 
the county for damage done in narcotics raids on homes from South-Central Los 
Angeles to Diamond Bar to Malibu. And the county normally pays no more than 
$25,000 a year to repair homes where narcotics squads have kicked in doors or 
done other damage. 
</P>
<P>
In November, however, Andrews won a settlement of $137,500, one of the largest 
such payments by the county in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the settlement, Andrews said, is a story so bizarre that "when I tell 
people about it, they look at me like, 'uh-oh -- Marge has gone round the 
bend." 
</P>
<P>
Even for a sting, the raid on Andrews' house had unusual intrigue -- and 
ironies. A sheriff's operative rented the house. Two of the narcotics officers 
involved in the case are now targets of a larger investigation into alleged 
skimming of seized drug money. And a neighbor who allowed deputies to use his 
home for surveillance now fears for his life and claims that he was a gunman's 
target. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews says no homeowner should become an unwitting participant in the battle 
against cocaine cartels. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely against drugs," she said. "But they can't just say, 'Damn the 
torpedoes, full speed ahead' and drag innocent citizens along in the wake." 
</P>
<P>
The house sits on an acre and a half of rustic land in the foothills between La 
Habra and Whittier. Built in 1958, it was just three months old when the 
Andrews family moved in. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved that house. I never wanted to sell it," Andrews said. She raised a son 
and a daughter and kept two dogs and a horse there. On a clear day, she said, 
you could see Santa Catalina Island. Even when her children left home, she 
stayed. 
</P>
<P>
Her son, Calvin Andrews, 38, of San Luis Obispo, said, "After my parents 
divorced eight years ago, I tried to get my mother to move many times, but it 
was her tie to the past." 
</P>
<P>
But eventually, to be close to her children, Andrews did buy a second home. In 
the summer of 1988, she set up housekeeping in the Northern California 
community of Fairfield and put a "For Lease" sign outside the house on West 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
A man soon contacted Andrews' real estate agent, introducing himself as William 
Black. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very nice young man, in his early 30s, well groomed, curly dark 
hair," recalled the agent, former La Habra Heights Mayor Glenda Tuppan. 
</P>
<P>
Black said he was in the janitorial supplies business and was just separating 
from his wife, according to Tuppan. He was looking for a house where he could 
bring his children. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no reason not to believe him," Tuppan said, adding that one of 
Andrews' neighbors had even vouched for Black. 
</P>
<P>
Officials acknowledged later that the neighbor was a longtime friend of the 
department who had once donated a battering ram for narcotics raids. 
</P>
<P>
At Andrews' insistence, Tuppan ran a credit check. Black's record consisted of 
a checking account with $50,000 in it, an American Express card and a driver's 
license that traced back to a post office box. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, now I know that anybody can get set up with a credit record like 
that," Andrews said. But at the time, she said, she had no reason to question 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was she suspicious when Black paid her the first three months' rent in 
cash. Nor when he mentioned that he would like to trim the trees back from the 
tennis court a bit, and that he would not need help from the Andrews' regular 
handyman. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 18 -- about 2 1/2 weeks after Andrews moved out -- a Colombian named 
Diego Venegas was seen carrying a pick and shovel into her house, according to 
court affidavits filed by narcotics officers. Soon, the officers said, 
neighbors heard jackhammers pounding at night and saw cars coming and going at 
all hours. 
</P>
<P>
Surveillance outposts were set up nearby, including the home of the neighbor 
who vouched for Black, according to court records and interviews. The view, 
Andrews said, was excellent because the trees around her home had been pruned 
so severely that "they looked like telephone poles." 
</P>
<P>
When a camper truck arrived at the house Oct. 6, 1988, narcotics officers 
watched as the Colombians unloaded about 40 cardboard boxes. A number of 
packages resembling kilogram packets of cocaine fell from the boxes, Deputy 
Stephen Nichols said in an affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, narcotics officers raided the house, seizing 743 kilos, or 1,635 
pounds, of cocaine, court records show. Also confiscated were two vehicles, a 
cellular phone and a loaded MAC-10 machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
Four Colombians were arrested, and three -- including Venegas, the alleged 
ringleader -- pleaded guilty to charges of possession of cocaine for sale. Last 
year, they received sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years in prison. The fourth 
defendant faces trial this spring. 
</P>
<P>
About two weeks after the raid, Andrews dropped by her house to retrieve some 
belongings. She was barely into the driveway when she realized that something 
was very wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The house "looked dead," she recalled. When she saw the extent of the damage, 
she "almost had a heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Johnson, Andrews' 66-year-old fiance, said sheriff's narcotics Sgt. Ed 
Huffman finally explained what had happened at Andrews' house. Contacted by The 
Times, Huffman declined to comment. But Johnson said he was told that the house 
had been damaged in a raid, that Black was in on the "sting" and that the 
Sheriff's Department would pay for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
But months after his conversation with Huffman, the house remained in disarray, 
Johnson said. And Andrews was stuck with a $312.99 electric bill, a $102 phone 
bill and a $115 bill for a water softening service -- plus three months of 
unpaid rent. 
</P>
<P>
In her claim against the county, Andrews said it would cost $26,500 to repair 
and replace the damaged trees. The Colombians had done $18,000 worth of damage 
when they built the concrete-lined vault beneath a trap door, she said. Andrews 
also contended that $13,781.50 worth of family heirlooms were missing from a 
storage shed. 
</P>
<P>
After the claim was rejected by the county, Andrews filed a $952,000 suit 
against the Sheriff's Department alleging fraud, theft and breach of contract 
related to Black's lease. She also said she received $200,000 less than market 
value when she sold her home because she had been forced under state law to 
disclose that the house had been the site of a major drug raid. 
</P>
<P>
The county settled the suit for $137,500. 
</P>
<P>
"I can appreciate the sheriff's standpoint. They wanted to see (the 
investigation) to its conclusion," Assistant County Counsel S. Robert Ambrose 
said. "But there was a lot of destruction, and it was apparently something our 
people were aware of . . . for a hell of a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Undersheriff Robert Edmonds said the department agreed to the settlement 
because officers were aware damage was being done to the Andrews home and 
decided not to alert her. But he would not comment on Black or any role he may 
have played in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
From a law enforcement viewpoint, Deputy Dist. Atty. Hazell said, "it was an 
outstanding investigation." 
</P>
<P>
"People are always saying that law enforcement should go after the big guys," 
he said. "Well, you can't go after the big guys by waiting until the stuff 
(cocaine) is broken down into rocks and then going after some guy on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand she'd rather this had not happened," Hazell acknowledged. 
"But it takes extraordinary methods and imaginative methods if you're going to 
get the people at the top. And there isn't a significant narcotics case made 
that doesn't involve trade-offs and balancing." 
</P>
<P>
But to Andrews, the damage to her home of 31 years went beyond dollars and 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived a lifetime in that house," she said. "And what happened there ruined 
it for me. I was frightened to be there after that. It felt like I'd been 
raped." In the months since Andrews settled her case, fallout has continued. 
The narcotics team that set up the sting has been disbanded along with other 
major narcotics crews in the wake of a federal and local corruption 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen narcotics officers -- including Nichols, the lead investigator on the 
La Habra Heights case, and Deputy Leo M. Newman, who was part of the 
surveillance team -- have been suspended amid allegations that they stole 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in money seized from drug dealers. The 
officers have denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the neighbor who vouched for Black reported that a gunman riddled 
his car with bullets as he returned home one night. In an interview with The 
Times, the neighbor requested anonymity, saying he is "beyond petrified." 
</P>
<P>
As for the mysterious William Black Jr., he phoned Tuppan after the raid. 
</P>
<P>
She did not ask for an explanation and he did not offer one. 
</P>
<P>
"He just said he wanted to apologize for all the trouble," she said.

OIL SPILL CLEANUP EFFORTS WIND DOWN AS STORM HELPS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Efforts to mop up the Orange County oil spill began to wind down Sunday as work 
crews turned their attention to scrubbing boulders and gathering oil-stained 
flotsam driven ashore by the weekend storm. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy surf whipped up by the storm appeared to be helping scour oil off jetties 
and rock formations along the coastline, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still a bit of work to do, but we're out of that high-pressure, 
high-impact phase and into the more detailed work," said Chief Warrant Officer 
Dan Dwell, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Some oil washed up in a foamy film on the Huntington Beach shoreline, but 
workers were finding mostly tar balls no bigger than jellybeans along broad 
stretches of the coast. 
</P>
<P>
The American Trader -- the tanker that spilled 394,000 gallons of crude oil 
Feb. 7 when it impaled itself on its anchor while attempting to moor off 
Huntington Beach -- steamed out of port late Sunday and headed north to a San 
Francisco shipyard for further repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coast Guard officials continued to puzzle over a mysterious oil 
sheen that washed ashore during the weekend, raising suspicions that there 
might be a new source of leakage. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard investigators have yet to determine the origin of the new oil, 
which looked different than the crude that gushed from the American Trader. 
Officials suspected that the sheen might be from a different source because the 
tanker's crude had been drifting southward, while the new oil came ashore 
farther to the north. 
</P>
<P>
The mess left by the sheen along a milelong section of Bolsa Chica State Beach 
was cleaned up by Sunday afternoon. Several oil samples were sent to the Coast 
Guard Oil Identification Laboratory in Groton, Conn., to determine whether it 
matched the crude spilled by the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Dwell said there is speculation that the sheen may have been a small leak from 
one of the oil rigs off Huntington Beach or a spill from a tanker pumping its 
bilges. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays flew over the remnants of the American Trader 
spill Sunday and said he saw only a few oily patches and scattered sections of 
sheen in the ocean. But he said cleanup efforts need to keep moving ahead to 
ensure the shoreline is returned to its original condition. 
</P>
<P>
"This could become a sticky issue between the city and the companies involved 
with this spill," Mays said. "This is going to get down to what they think is 
clean, and what we think is clean." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for British Petroleum, which owned the oil the American Trader was 
transporting, said the firm would stay until the job is done. "We are not going 
anywhere until it is all cleaned up," spokesman Tony Kozlowski said. 
</P>
<P>
The second dead dolphin in two days washed ashore, refocusing concerns on the 
episode's impact on sea life. 
</P>
<P>
John Heyning, curator of marine mammals at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Natural History, said it remains unclear what caused either dolphin to die, 
noting that such "strandings" are normal in Southern California waters. Tests 
to determine whether the spill played a part will be performed Tuesday, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most affected by the spill has been the coast's bird population. As of Sunday 
afternoon, the spill has been blamed for the deaths of 299 birds. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Dan Weikel and Ted Johnson and correspondents Tom McQueeney 
and David Burke contributed to this story.

IRS INQUIRY FOCUSES ON FOREIGN FIRMS' U.S. COMPANIES; 
</P>
<P>
TAXES: AUDITS INTO SUSPECTED 'UNDERPAYMENTS' HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR YEARS. 
THE AMOUNT IN QUESTION COULD RUN AS HIGH AS $12 BILLION.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service confirmed Sunday that it has been auditing 
American subsidiaries of foreign-owned companies to see whether they have been 
underpaying their corporate income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
IRS officials estimated that the cases they now have in progress suggest that 
suspected "underpayments" by such firms over the past several years could 
amount to as much as $12 billion. However, many of the cases are still in 
negotiation and may not yield that much. 
</P>
<P>
The suspicion stems from the fact that although foreign investment here has 
tripled during the past decade and foreign firms are now earning substantially 
more than they did before, the amount they are paying in U.S. taxes has 
remained almost unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
IRS officials confirmed Sunday that data compiled by the agency indicates that 
of about 36,800 foreign-owned companies that filed U.S. tax returns in 1986, 
more than half reported they had no taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
Although authorities say the cases often are a matter of judgment, there is 
suspicion that some foreign-owned subsidiaries in this country have 
successfully reduced their tax liability by "overpaying" for the parts or 
technology they import, thus cutting back the income they report here. 
</P>
<P>
Charles S. Triplett, deputy associate chief counsel of the IRS, said the 
auditing, which was reported Sunday by the New York Times, was begun in the 
early 1980s and was intensified during the last half of the decade when foreign 
firms' presence in the United States increased. 
</P>
<P>
"We stepped it up four years ago -- it's not exactly a hot flash," he said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Triplett said that contrary to some reports, the probe was not being 
concentrated on Japanese companies. But he said it is possible that more 
Japanese-owned firms ultimately may be challenged because they tend to import 
from parent firms rather than buy their parts here. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not picking on any particular country," Triplett said. "We also have a 
lot of Canadian and West German cases, but they don't seem to make the news 
flashes." 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure follows a study last year by the congressional Joint Committee 
on Taxation that suggested there was "some indication that the level of tax 
payments of foreign-owned businesses in the United States is unusually low." 
</P>
<P>
Triplett said the agency's efforts could be bolstered in future audits by a 
1989 law that enables the IRS to fine foreign-owned companies up to $10,000 a 
month if they do not comply promptly with demands for records or testimony, and 
then eventually assess extra taxes. But he said the law does not apply to 
records for tax years before it was enacted and so is of little help in the 
audits that the IRS currently is performing, which primarily involve the 
behavior of corporations during the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
IRS officials said the new law was enacted to reinforce a 1987 ruling by a 
federal district court in Los Angeles that empowered IRS officials to subpoena 
the records of a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign firm. That case involved Toyota, 
U.S.A., the auto importer. 
</P>
<P>
Triplett said the IRS frequently finds a reverse pattern when U.S. subsidiaries 
move to foreign tax havens. In those cases, he said, they sometimes allocate 
too much of their incomes to their foreign operations, thus reducing the amount 
they must pay to Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
Triplett cautioned, however, that in many such instances the allocation of 
income between one country and another is a matter of judgment and eventually 
is determined by negotiation between the IRS and the corporation involved. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not out of compliance necessarily," he said.

MONGOLIAN DISSIDENTS FORM OPPOSITION PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
ASIA: THE GOVERNMENT'S TOLERANCE IS TESTED BY DEMANDS FOR TRIALS AND PUNISHMENT 
OF COMMUNIST OFFICIALS.

<P>
A congress of Mongolian dissidents meeting here Sunday proclaimed the creation 
of an opposition political party, called for the resignation of the nation's 
top Communist leaders, and demanded the trial and punishment of "those 
officials who brought the country its foreign dependence and economic crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Although opposition parties are still illegal in Mongolia, the government 
allowed 500 delegates of the dissidents' organization to meet openly in the 
auditorium of the Trade Union Cultural Palace. 
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian government, which has been affected by the political changes 
sweeping through the Soviet Bloc, has adopted an extremely conciliatory 
attitude toward opposition activities, including a series of rallies that began 
in December. But the limits of the government's tolerance are not clear. 
</P>
<P>
Creation of the new Mongolian Democratic Party was decided on Saturday evening 
at a meeting of 200 of the 500 delegates who attended Sunday's meeting. It was 
announced to the nation during a live Sunday morning television and radio 
broadcast of the opening two hours of the First Congress of the Mongolian 
Democratic Assn., the new party's parent organization. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the congress called for a multiparty system, accelerated economic 
development, a revival of traditional Mongol culture, freedom of religion and 
greater opportunities for private ownership, including an end to limits on the 
size of livestock herds that may be individually owned. 
</P>
<P>
In a "declaration to the Mongolian people," the congress called for members of 
the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party -- the official name for the 
country's ruling Communists -- to work together with the opposition to "speed 
up economic, political and social development . . . and take better care of the 
poor, the handicapped and those victimized in years of repression." 
</P>
<P>
G. Boshigt, one of the leaders of the new party, said in an interview during a 
break in the congress that the decision to launch an opposition party came 
about because "the domestic and international situation is very benign (with a 
suitable climate in which) to establish this new party." 
</P>
<P>
"We trust the ruling party -- that they will be wise and realistic, and take 
their place to be an equal of our party," Boshigt continued. "But of course I 
cannot forecast. . . . According to our political speculations and calculation, 
one of the possibilities is that some people in that party will suggest a 
crackdown. But we know that within the party there are many people who agree 
with our ideas." 
</P>
<P>
At noon Sunday, a group of about 300 university students and supporters held a 
brief pro-democracy rally near Ulan Bator's circus building, then marched about 
15 minutes to the Trade Union Cultural Palace, chanting "Democracy! Democracy!" 
</P>
<P>
Dissident leaders addressed the crowd, which soon reached about 2,500, from the 
roof of the palace's entryway. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are patriotic, we should avoid any kind of disorder," pleaded D. 
Sosorbaram, one of the opposition leaders. "We should protect law and order. We 
should be patient. Everything should be by legal means." 
</P>
<P>
Conversations with protesters gathered outside the meeting hall reflected deep 
dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"For 40 years, we had no voice of our own," said M. Demberel, a 50-year-old 
communications worker. "We, the working-class people, could not say frankly 
what we thought of things, and no one took into consideration our interests." 
Demberel said he felt a majority of the present ruling Politburo should resign, 
including all of those "appointed by the old regime" of former leader 
Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, who was removed from the presidency "on health grounds." 
</P>
<P>
Although a dozen people in the crowd overheard Demberel's remarks, he said he 
felt no fear about speaking bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been suppressed sometimes, but I have no fear," he declared. "The 
times are changing." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, however, is as sympathetic to the opposition. During the march by 
the mostly well-dressed students, a young man attired in dirty and slightly 
torn, padded gray trousers and jacket laughed loudly and shouted: "Have you 
ever worked?" 
</P>
<P>
"They have never worked, and they don't know what work is," the man, a 
23-year-old construction worker named Erdene, later explained to a reporter. 
"They have done nothing yet. They are only studying theory." 
</P>
<P>
Erdene said he does not believe such marches and rallies will cause trouble but 
that he does not support them. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition pressure seems to be having the intended effect of accelerating 
political change. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Dumaagiyn Sodnom told Japanese journalists last week that 
officials of the government and ruling party would meet with opposition leaders 
after Sunday's congress. 
</P>
<P>
The party, however, does not appear fully decided on how to deal with the 
growing opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Communist) Party admits political pluralism," T. Chemiddorj, acting 
director of the government Information Department, told foreign reporters late 
last week. "That means political pluralism can exist both within the party and 
in our society. It doesn't exclude the possibility of a multiparty system. 
</P>
<P>
"The party hasn't announced the terms of proclaiming a multiparty system -- 
whether to announce it this year, next year. It hasn't worked out any plans." 
</P>
<P>
Chemiddorj was then asked what the government would do if the opposition, as it 
did, announced the official formation of a new party at Sunday's congress. 
</P>
<P>
"We had better wait and see," he replied.

SHARON SETS OUT TO UNSEAT SHAMIR, DERAIL PEACE TALKS;

ISRAEL: THE RIGHTIST CABINET DEFECTOR WARNS THAT NEGOTIATIONS WITH PALESTINIANS 
WOULD BE 'DISASTROUS.'

<P>
Ariel Sharon, the former tank commander turned hawkish politician, set his 
sights Sunday on bringing down Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and derailing 
proposed peace talks with Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
In confirming his resignation from Shamir's Cabinet, Sharon predicted doom for 
Israel if the government goes ahead with plans to let Palestinians in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip elect a peace delegation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember as dangerous a situation as we are facing now. The plan will 
not bring us to peace. It will bring us to more tension, bloodshed and maybe 
even to war," said Sharon, who as defense minister led Israel into the 
unpopular 1982 Lebanon War. 
</P>
<P>
The portly Sharon said he would campaign within the rightist Likud Party to 
unseat Shamir in time to run for prime minister himself. "I saw that to 
continue in the government without being able to warn our people about the 
disastrous outcome would be a mistake. It would be lying to myself," he said. 
"I will continue my struggle from the outside." 
</P>
<P>
Elections are not due for almost three years, although a collapse of the 
fragile coalition between Likud and the more dovish, center-left Labor Party 
could bring on a premature vote. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon stepped down from his post as trade and industry minister amid reports 
that Israel may soon engage the United States and Egypt in talks to name a 
Palestinian panel to prepare for elections. His resignation was viewed in 
Israel as a challenge not only to Shamir, but also associates of Shamir who 
might aspire to succeed the 74-year-old prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Among the prime candidates is Moshe Arens, the foreign minister who is in 
charge of delicate negotiations on the peace proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon's dramatic withdrawal from government -- he announced his exit during a 
raucous meeting of Likud last week -- is but the latest episode in a maverick 
style for which he is notorious. 
</P>
<P>
He became a hero of the 1973 Middle East War by leading troops across the Suez 
Canal, despite the misgivings of superiors, and surrounding a main force of 
Egyptians. During the Lebanon War, he was criticized for turning what was 
advertised as a sweep of terrorists up to 25 miles from the Israeli border into 
the siege of Beirut and a frustrated effort to set up a friendly Christian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon resigned from his defense post in 1983 amid charges that he was 
indirectly responsible for a massacre of Palestinians in Beirut at the hands of 
Israel's Christian allies. In 1987, at the onset of the Arab uprising, Sharon 
moved into a private home in the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, 
further inflaming Palestinian passions. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon said that in a matter of months, he could end the intifada, as the 
uprising is called in Arabic. He recommended that known Palestinian leaders 
should be expelled from the country. He was less specific about how much force 
he would use, except by reference to his 1971 effort, as army general, to root 
out nationalist assassination squads from the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
During the seven-month Gaza operation led by Sharon, Israeli troops killed more 
than 100 Palestinians. His troops bulldozed buildings to open the way for 
street patrols and tore down hedges to eliminate hiding places. To keep 
rebellious youths from taking part, Sharon expelled to neighboring countries a 
small number of parents whose children were seen throwing stones at soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"Gaza was completely quiet for 10 years after," Sharon claimed. 
</P>
<P>
In settling the dispute with Palestinians, Sharon insisted, Israel must be sure 
to keep fundamental control of the occupied land. "It will be our right to be 
in charge of the security in Judea, Samaria and Gaza," he declared, using 
Biblical terms for the West Bank. "And that will be forever." 
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to avoid compromises he views as putting Israel's control of 
Jerusalem in doubt. "Jerusalem is the heart of the Jewish people. Jerusalem is 
the heart of Israel," he told reporters. "Jerusalem will not be negotiated." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon views a proposal by Washington and Cairo to let Arab Jerusalem residents 
enter the peace talks to be a risk to Israel's hold on Jerusalem. The United 
States and Egypt are also pressing Israel to let expelled Palestinian leaders 
take part in talks to prepare for elections. It was these two potential 
compromises that prompted Sharon's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, in a search for compromise, Shamir's strongest ally is the Labor 
Party's Yitzhak Rabin, defense minister in the coalition Cabinet. Rabin has 
reined in Labor doves who want to leave Shamir on his own; thus the Likud-Labor 
coalition stands, and Sharon by himself is essentially trying to bring it down.

<P>
Japanese voters demonstrated a deeply conservative bent and a resilient 
commitment to national stability Sunday, shrugging off recent anger over taxes 
and political corruption to hand the ruling Liberal Democratic Party a decisive 
mandate to manage security ties and trade friction with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although the top opposition Japan Socialist Party also fared relatively well in 
balloting for the lower house of Parliament, the message from the electorate 
appeared to be an overriding desire for continuity rather than uncertainty and 
change. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats and their conservative progenitors have ruled since 1948, 
without loosening their grip on Parliament until last July's electoral setback 
in the upper house, where they lost a simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, voters have reaffirmed the traditional view that the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) is the only party fit to govern. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the LDP one-party rule has gone on far too long, but I guess there 
isn't much we can do about it," said Eiji Kikuchi, 36, a Tokyo photographer who 
pushed a baby carriage in the unseasonal sunshine as he and his wife left their 
polling place Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people support the LDP because they're basically satisfied with the way 
things are," said Kikuchi, who voted for a Socialist candidate. "Japan is a 
very peaceful and prosperous place. We really don't have that many serious 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the endorsement of the status quo was a grudging recognition among many 
Japanese that their democracy would be more vital -- in principle -- if the 
splintered opposition could reorganize itself and challenge the LDP in 
something akin to a two-party system. 
</P>
<P>
But with the Socialists clinging to a controversial advocacy of gutting the 
U.S.-Japan security alliance, an amorphous distrust of the opposition seemed to 
loom large in the minds of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
"It might not be a bad idea to have a change of leadership, but I don't care 
much for socialism," said Makoto Watanabe, 62, a civil servant who voted in an 
affluent neighborhood in Tokyo's Meguro ward, where driveways are dotted with 
Jaguars and Mercedes-Benzes. "If you consider the international situation, the 
opposition's policies are obsolete. We have no choice but the LDP." 
</P>
<P>
Strategically, opposition candidates misjudged electoral sentiment by centering 
their campaigns on vows to abolish a 3% consumption tax, which the LDP forced 
through Parliament and implemented last April. Resistance to the new tax, 
widely viewed as regressive and inflationary, was an opposition rallying point 
in last summer's upper house election. But results in the lower house poll 
suggest public rancor over the levy has cooled considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Righteous indignation over political corruption also seems to have spent its 
fury. All the incumbents tainted by the Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal, 
which rocked the government early last year, were returned to office by their 
constituents -- including Takao Fujinami, a former LDP chief Cabinet secretary, 
who was indicted and faces trial on bribery charges. 
</P>
<P>
Fujinami invoked the humble battle cry of misogi, or "purification," in his 
reelection bid, and the remission of his sins appears to have been extended to 
the ruling party as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"The Liberal Democrats may look corrupt from an international point of view, 
but they look pretty good from inside Japan," said Jiro Ito, 52, an auto 
mechanic voting in the working-class district of Shibamata, in Tokyo's 
Katsushika ward. "I'm staying with the Liberal Democrats because I want things 
to settle down." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some key problems remained unresolved for the ruling party as the final 
votes were counted today. Although the LDP exceeded most expectations in 
holding on to a solid majority in the lower house, it still lost a number of 
seats from its pre-election strength. And it was still saddled with a minority 
in the upper house, which must approve all legislation except the budget. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition-dominated upper house has flexed its muscles on a number of 
occasions since last summer, beginning with the symbolic nomination of Takako 
Doi, the Socialist chairwoman, as premier. The feisty chamber also passed a 
bill aimed at abolishing the consumption tax and could continue obstructionist 
tactics unless the LDP reins it in by forging some sort of coalition with the 
centrist Komeito (Clean Government Party). 
</P>
<P>
Also uncertain is the fate of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, a caretaker with a 
clean image who was drafted by political bosses to lead the LDP out of its 
doldrums after corruption and sex scandals undermined the party's credibility 
last year. Political insiders say the Old Guard is preparing to unseat Kaifu 
this autumn when the party picks new leaders, and reassert control over 
statecraft, which has drifted during Kaifu's brief tenure. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Sunday's balloting gives the LDP a stronger hand to deal with 
pending international issues, most notably the protracted confrontation with 
the United States over economic relations. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on bilateral trade and investment have been put on hold until 
after the election, but they are now scheduled to resume with urgency as an 
atmosphere of tension builds over the intractable $49-billion U.S. trade 
deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday and Friday, officials will meet in Tokyo for the third round of the 
Structural Impediments Initiative, talks aimed at identifying and removing 
barriers to free trade. Washington is demanding that Japan take concrete action 
to dismantle market barriers by March. U.S. officials are also pushing for 
further liberalization of agricultural imports -- including rice -- to Japan, a 
contentious issue that has provoked a backlash among the LDP's traditional base 
of support in rural districts.

GERMANYS: HE DOUBTS SOVIETS WILL CLING TO NATO OBJECTIONS. POLE TELLS CONCERNS 
OVER TERRITORIAL CLAIMS.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Sunday that he now believes there is 
"an excellent chance" that Germany will be reunified before the end of this 
year, as West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has predicted. 
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, Baker also minimized the importance of recent Soviet 
objections to having a newly enlarged Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and suggested that over the next few months, Soviet officials may 
see benefits in such an arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Valentin M. Falin, a former Soviet ambassador to West Germany and 
senior adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said that "if the 
Western alliance sticks with its demands for a NATO membership for all of 
Germany, then there won't be any unification." 
</P>
<P>
But Baker, speaking Sunday on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," questioned 
whether the Soviet Union would stick to that position. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to see the degree to which they really feel that way," he 
said. "For myself, I'm not sure that they really strongly feel that way, 
because the NATO alliance is the raison d'etre, if you will, for the presence 
of American forces in Europe. And I think, without putting words in the mouths 
of the Soviets, that they see the stability that is afforded by the continued 
presence of United States forces in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, at a meeting in Ottawa, the Soviet Union accepted a plan 
designed by the United States for talks to work out the details for German 
reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Under that plan, West and East Germany would conduct an initial round of 
negotiations on the domestic issues involved in merging the two countries, and 
the four major World War II Allies -- the United States, Britain, France and 
the Soviet Union -- would then hold a conference to resolve the foreign policy 
and security problems. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan has drawn some criticism from other European governments, 
particularly that of Poland, which argues that it should be included in talks 
on the future of Germany, whose territory used to embrace areas that became 
part of Poland after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say that we feel it is our historic, moral and political right to be 
a part of those agreements which will be linked to German unification. We have 
to be sure that any territorial claims will not be raised against Poland," said 
Poland's ambassador to the United States, Jan Kinast, in an interview on CNN's 
"Newsmaker Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
West German officials have avoided giving absolute assurances that a united 
Germany will make no territorial claims against Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows what the new government will do," Horst Teltschik, Kohl's foreign 
policy adviser, said on CBS's "Face the Nation" on Sunday. "But we are 
absolutely sure that the great majority of all Germans in East and West will 
stick to the border as it is today." 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a lot of discussion between now and the event (German 
reunification)," President Bush told reporters Sunday while walking on a beach 
near his home in Kennebunkport, Me. "We've got our position, supporting 
Chancellor Kohl. We know what Kohl's position is. We're going to stay with it." 
</P>
<P>
East Germany will elect a new government March 18, and West Germany will hold 
national elections Dec. 2. Kohl has been pressing to achieve reunification 
before the West German elections, in which his Christian Democratic Party will 
face a strong challenge from the Social Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was optimistic that Germany can be reunified before the end of 
this year, Baker replied, "I think there's an excellent chance. Unification is 
taking place as we sit here . . . . There is de facto economic integration, 
unification, taking place." 
</P>
<P>
However, he asked, "Will we have resolved all of the external questions 
surrounding German unification at the end of this year? I can't tell you we 
will." 
</P>
<P>
Baker acknowledged that one of the toughest issues that will have to be settled 
by the four World War II Allies later this year concerns future military 
deployments on what is now East German soil. There are about 380,000 Soviet 
troops in East Germany, and the Allies will have to decide whether or when 
these Soviet deployments will be phased out. 
</P>
<P>
"What's been discussed so far . . . is that there would be no extension of NATO 
forces in the territory of the German Democratic Republic," Baker said. But he 
left open the question of whether German troops might be stationed in that 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, who is a former West German defense 
minister, spoke on the same program with Baker. He said he believes the Soviet 
Union would accept a new Germany allied with NATO "under one condition -- that 
we give them a clear guarantee that this is not turning against them."

The Peronist government announced measures to curtail state spending and cut 
taxes on food imports in a bid to brake frantic price markups as Argentina 
suffered its second bout of hyperinflation in seven months. Among other 
measures to reduce state spending, Economy Minister Antonio Erman Gonzalez 
said, the salary of President Carlos Saul Menem will be reduced 20% and set as 
the top wage for federal employees.

Dozens of recently emigrated Soviet Jews in Jerusalem braved cold wind and rain 
to protest living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The group complained of leaking walls and ceilings, and nonfunctional and 
dangerous heating systems. More than 8,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel 
so far this year, and more than 100,000 are expected by year's end. At the same 
time as the protest, Israeli President Chaim Herzog welcomed a group of 110 
Soviet immigrants in a ceremony at Tel Aviv's airport.

MOST THINK PRIVACY RIGHT IS IN CONSTITUTION, POLL FINDS

<P>
Most Americans believe the U.S. Constitution gives them a right to privacy in 
their personal lives that shields them from government interference in such 
things as the sex acts of adult homosexuals and a family's decision to end life 
support for a hopelessly ill relative, according to a survey on the Supreme 
Court and the Constitution released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The notion of a constitutional right to privacy is so firmly entrenched that a 
majority of those surveyed asserted -- incorrectly -- that the right is written 
into the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
While the word "privacy" does not appear in the Bill of Rights or anywhere else 
in the Constitution, a majority of the Supreme Court has concluded that the 
"right to liberty" in the 14th Amendment implies a right to privacy in matters 
such as birth control and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But this conclusion remains a subject of continuing dispute between the court's 
conservative and liberal factions. 
</P>
<P>
The liberals say the general rights set forth in the Constitution should be 
interpreted broadly to protect individuals from the government. But the 
conservatives maintain that the court should not create unwritten 
constitutional rights so as to strike down laws enacted by the majority. 
</P>
<P>
This dispute flares anew with each abortion case to come before the high court. 
It also figures prominently in the battles over drug testing and the "right to 
die." 
</P>
<P>
The survey responses suggest that the public finds the right to privacy as 
tricky and troublesome as has the high court. 
</P>
<P>
Although 73% of those surveyed say the Constitution guarantees a right to 
privacy, a solid majority said this right does not allow employees to refuse 
drug tests, nor does it give teen-age girls the right to get an abortion 
without their parents' knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of 805 adults was conducted for the National Law Journal and LEXIS, 
the computerized legal research service, and was intended to mark the 200th 
anniversary of the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
It found that most Americans could not name a single member of the Supreme 
Court, nor even how many members of the court there are. The respondents also 
said -- incorrectly -- that last year's abortion ruling from the high court 
allowed states to make abortion illegal. The 5-4 ruling in June said states may 
prevent their employees from aiding abortion, but women retain the right to 
terminate a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly six in 10 of those surveyed drew a blank when asked to name a sitting 
justice. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's only woman, was by far the 
best known of the nine justices. Most of those questioned disagreed sharply 
with the court's recent decisions on flag burning, civil rights and 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only 40% agreed with the court's 5-4 ruling last year that flag burning was 
protected as free speech. About 46% disagreed with the decision, and in a 
separate response, 63% favored a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag 
burning. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only 31% said the court has "gone as far as it should" to protect victims 
of discrimination, while 53% said the court has "not gone far enough." In a 
series of 5-4 rulings last year, the court narrowed the scope of federal civil 
rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
 -- About 66% said the right to privacy "protects private, voluntary acts of 
homosexuals," while 26% disagreed. In 1986, the court ruled 5 to 4 that states 
may criminalize private homosexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
However, the public agreed with the court majority on drug testing. Only 34% 
said the right to privacy prohibits random drug testing of employees. Last 
year, the court voted 5 to 4 to uphold drug testing for public employees in 
jobs involving safety or sensitive information. 
</P>
<P>
When asked who should decide whether to "end artificial life support" if you 
lapse into a coma, 88% said "your family." In a pending dispute between a 
Missouri family and state officials, the court must decide whether the parents 
of a comatose woman can decide on their own to stop feeding her.

Kuwaiti-mediated talks between the United States and South Yemen about a 
resumption of diplomatic ties have stopped, South Yemen's foreign minister was 
quoted Sunday as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Abdulaziz Dali told the United Arab Emirates newspaper Al Ittihad that his 
country is not against normalized relations but will not accept any imposed 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
He would not specify any conditions but added, "We reject talk that South Yemen 
supports terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
South Yemen last November signed a pact to merge with Yemen and has announced 
sweeping reforms of its Marxist political system. It broke ties with Washington 
one year after gaining independence from Britain in 1968.

President Bush's approval rating soared to 76% in the latest Time magazine 
survey released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It is the highest popularity rating accorded any President since John F. 
Kennedy in his first year, Time said. The public rating was a result of what 
the magazine called "Peace, Prosperity and Panama." 
</P>
<P>
However, only 35% praised his work on the environment and 28% approved of his 
actions related to the budget deficit, the poll said. 
</P>

A Newport Beach woman has died from injuries related to an attempted suicide in 
her jail cell, authorities said. Pamela Pauline Ayers, 45, had been held since 
Aug. 12 in the Santa Ana women's jail in the fatal shooting of prominent Los 
Angeles attorney Gerald Goldfarb, 49. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies discovered the woman hanging from a bedsheet tied to a shower rod. 
Goldfarb died of multiple wounds to the head and body, and Ayers underwent 
surgery for a self-inflicted wound to the abdomen shortly after the shooting 
incident outside her Newport Beach condominium. Police alleged that Ayers, a 
former interior decorator, fired 10 shots from a 12-gauge shotgun that she had 
bought just hours before the slaying. Ayers' attorney said his client mistook 
Goldfarb's friendship and legal counsel for a love relationship.

<TEXT>
<P>
A state board has approved the $6.3-million purchase of 5,595 acres for a 
wildlife refuge as part of a plan to replace the defunct, selenium-tainted 
Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge. The Wildlife Conservation Board's three 
members voted to buy two parcels of land north of Los Banos, using money from a 
voter-approved 1988 wildlife bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
John Schmidt, the board's executive director, said the two parcels -- Salt 
Slough and China Island -- are located about eight miles apart, but will be 
administered as a single refuge called the North Grasslands Wildlife Area. 
Kesterson was closed four years ago after large numbers of deformed bird 
embryos were linked to selenium poisoning from agricultural runoff. The Bureau 
of Reclamation has filled 1,200 acres of Kesterson ponds with dirt to prevent 
additional poisonings.

Five people have been killed in those two states since the flooding began late 
last week. Extensive flooding was reported along Alabama's Coosa, Black Warrior 
and Tallapoosa rivers, where dozens of families were forced to evacuate. The 
National Weather Service warned that 3 inches of rain could fall on 
already-soggy northwestern Georgia, where flooding has forced more than 1,000 
from their homes. Meteorologist Gary Beeley warned that residents might be 
fooled by lighter rains and fail to take precautions, but that larger rivers 
often flood days after heavy rains.

shuttle Atlantis, carrying a secret satellite that reportedly will spy on the 
Soviet Union. When asked what he thought of the spy satellite, Vladimir 
Lapygin, the committee chairman and head of the delegation, replied with a

The group toured areas where shuttles are worked on, a launching control center

TAKEOFF ABORTED; SMOKE CHASES 193 OFF PLANE AT LAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A TWA jumbo jet aborted its takeoff at Los Angeles International Airport late 
Sunday afternoon, and crew members evacuated the nearly 200 people aboard after 
smoke and steam filled the cabin, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The crew aboard TWA Flight 8, an L-1011 Tristar en route to New York City, 
initially reported fire in the back of the main cabin at 4:22 p.m., a spokesman 
for the Federal Aviation Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles city fire officials said firefighters found no blaze once they 
boarded the plane that carried 181 passengers and 12 crew members. 
</P>
<P>
The jetliner was in its takeoff roll when a pneumatic air duct beneath the 
floorboard of the plane's cabin ruptured and started to fill the compartment 
with a combination of smoke, hot compressed air and steam, TWA spokesman Jim 
Faulkner said in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The duct takes in air from an engine "and supplies air to run various 
components of the plane, such as de-icing systems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After aborting the takeoff, the pilot pulled off the runway onto a taxiway 
where those on board were evacuated using inflatable slides, fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Four flight attendants and one passenger complained of smoke inhalation and 
were taken to area hospitals for observation, Faulkner said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said at least three passengers also reported minor injuries such 
as twisted ankles after coming down the slides. 
</P>
<P>
Two firefighters were also injured -- one in the eye and the other sustaining a 
fractured rib, when a high-pressure water hose burst and whipped into them. 
</P>
<P>
TWA officials said passengers were being offered seats on later flights. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the plane's trouble was being investigated by federal officials.

DRIVE-BY SHOOTING ENDS IN SECOND GANG-RELATED DEATH OF WEEKEND

<P>
One gang member was hit in the head and killed and a second was wounded early 
Sunday by bullets fired from a passing car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The killing was the second gang-related death during the weekend. A 6-year-old 
boy died Saturday of wounds he suffered in a Pomona drive-by shooting that was 
apparently directed at a gang member nearby, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Three other people were wounded in unrelated gang shootings, including a 
15-year-old shot in the back and critically wounded in the Atwater Village area 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In Compton, two men were in front of 210 E. Johnson St. when they were hit by 
gunfire from a passing vehicle, Sgt. John Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were taken to the Dominguez Medical Center where a 23-year-old man 
died of a gunshot wound to the head, he said. A 19-year-old man was treated for 
an arm wound. 
</P>
<P>
Both victims were identified as members of a local street gang and police 
believe the attack was gang-related, he said. No arrests had been made. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old boy arrested in the Pomona shooting, which occurred Tuesday and 
sparked a community march through a gang-infested neighborhood, will face 
murder charges, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Daniel Rodriguez, was wounded in the head by bullets that were 
apparently intended for a gang member who was near him on the porch of a home 
in the 300 block of East Monterey Avenue, Sgt. David Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez died at Pomona Valley Community Hospital about 1:45 a.m. Saturday, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Also wounded in the attack was Olga Perez, 23, who lived at the home. She was 
reported recovering from a head wound. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours before the boy died, several hundred people carrying candles and 
signs marched through a drug- and gang-infested neighborhood in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
In the Atwater Village area of northeast Los Angeles, a 15-year-old boy was 
shot in the back and critically wounded in a drive-by shooting along La Clede 
Avenue late Friday, Sgt. J.J. Cerniglia said. 
</P>
<P>
In southwest Los Angeles, two men were slightly wounded in a drive-by shooting 
along West 25th Street Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
In a shooting that so far has not been linked to gangs, a man was killed on a 
South-Central Los Angeles street corner and detectives had no motive for the 
slaying, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Nicky Miller, 31, was shot as he stood on the corner of Florence Avenue and 
Cimarron Street about 5:45 p.m. Saturday, Lt. George Godwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller died at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, he said. Detectives had not 
established a motive for the killing and no arrests had been made, he said.

HARBOR PROTEST BLOCKS SALVADORAN COFFEE; 
</P>
<P>
BOYCOTT: DOCKWORKERS HONOR PICKETS AND REFUSE TO UNLOAD CARGO IN LONG BEACH. 
THE ACTION IS TAKEN TO HIGHLIGHT THE KILLING OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS. 
</P>

<P>
Waving signs with slogans such as "Decaf the death squads," about 100 activists 
rallied at Long Beach Harbor on Sunday to stop union dockworkers from unloading 
34 tons of Salvadoran coffee beans from a Colombian freighter. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time this month that the vessel, the Ciudad de Buenaventura, 
has docked at a West Coast port but been unable to shed its controversial cargo 
because of protests. 
</P>
<P>
Members of an organization that has called for a nationwide boycott of 
Salvadoran coffee formed a picket line shortly after dawn on a rain-soaked road 
leading to the pier where the Ciudad de Buenaventura was anchored. Arriving 
dockworkers, members of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's 
Union, honored the picket line. 
</P>
<P>
"Boycott Folgers, boycott Hills, Sal-va-dor-an cof-fee kills!" the protesters 
chanted. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, an agreement was announced in which the longshoremen would be 
allowed to work the Ciudad de Buenaventura, unloading any and all cargo except 
the Salvadoran beans. 
</P>
<P>
"This," remarked one union official, "has become the Flying Dutchman of coffee 
(shipments)." He was referring to a bad-luck omen in maritime lore, based on 
the fabled Dutch captain condemned to sail the seas until Judgment Day. 
</P>
<P>
Although longshoremen leaders said they would not touch the Salvadoran coffee, 
there was no way to verify independently what was being unloaded from the ship. 
Bruce Wargo, general manager of the Pacific Container Terminal where the Ciudad 
de Buenaventura had been docked since about 5 a.m., refused to let reporters 
approach the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Later Sunday, however, an operations manager for Pacific Container Terminal 
said no coffee had been unloaded. He said that because of the problems the 
Ciudad de Buenaventura had encountered in other ports, there had never been any 
plan to unload the coffee in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott, sponsored by a private group called Neighbor to Neighbor that 
opposes U.S. policy in Central America, was announced Nov. 21 to protest the 
murders in San Salvador of six Jesuit priests, their cook and her daughter. A 
Salvadoran colonel and eight other officers and soldiers have been charged with 
the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee is one of El Salvador's most lucrative cash crops. Sponsors of the 
boycott maintain the action will put economic pressure on the U.S.-backed 
government and ruling party, some of whose members are the country's largest 
coffee producers. Some leaders of the ruling party have in the past been linked 
to death squads. 
</P>
<P>
But Salvadoran officials contend the boycott will backfire and hurt the very 
people activist groups profess to want to help: peasant farmers who depend on 
coffee to make their living. 
</P>
<P>
As he stood to one side and watched the morning's demonstration, longshoreman 
Luis Clarens said that although politics means little to him, he and his 
co-workers were willing to sacrifice a day's wages if that's what it took to 
cooperate with the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"I never go through a picket line," said Clarens, a native of Uruguay who as 
ship boss headed up the 15-man crew scheduled to work the Ciudad de 
Buenaventura. 
</P>
<P>
Another union member, a white-haired truck driver, was less amenable: 
"Everywhere you go, it's a picket line," he grumbled. "You can't get any work 
done." 
</P>
<P>
With Harbor Patrol units stationed at the pier entrance to "keep the peace," 
the activists -- including at least one nun, children and a few Salvadorans -- 
marched in a circle for about an hour until the agreement to leave the 
Salvadoran coffee aboard the ship was announced. They then broke into cheers, 
held a small rally and drove off, many honking their car horns in a salute to 
the dockworkers. 
</P>
<P>
"This coffee has nowhere to go in the United States!" Neighbor to Neighbor 
spokeswoman Denise Bergez told the crowd. "This is a tremendous victory." 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Ciudad de Buenaventura docked in San Francisco, Seattle and the 
Canadian port of Vancouver, British Columbia. Longshoremen at each port of call 
respected picket lines and refused to unload the Salvadoran coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the ship's other cargo -- coffee beans from Colombia and Costa Rica -- 
was removed in San Francisco and Seattle.

stopped union dockworkers from unloading 34 tons of Salvadoran coffee beans

Bone marrow transplants may cure many sufferers of beta thalassemia, a fatal 
illness of young adults brought on by a genetic defect that cripples the 
blood's ability to absorb oxygen, according to new research. 
</P>
<P>
The technique, a radical procedure commonly used to treat some deadly forms of 
cancer, was pioneered as a thalassemia treatment in the early 1980s. It 
involves destroying all blood-producing cells and injecting new cells from a 
donor. 
</P>
<P>
But if the technique fails, the patient usually dies. 
</P>
<P>
In tests of 222 children under 16 who had the defect, Italian researchers led 
by Dr. Guido Lucarelli reported that 82% were alive one year after the 
transplant, with most experiencing no complications.

STEROIDS LINKED TO HEART ATTACK

<TEXT>
<P>
Men who use steroids to pump up their bodies may be increasing their risk of 
heart attacks and strokes at an early age, a researcher warned last week. The 
potential of the drugs to cause blood clots and blocked arteries may represent 
an "underreported and underappreciated" risk, according to a Michigan State 
University physician who said steroids have been linked to several heart 
attacks and strokes among young men. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Gary Ferenchick 
described the case of a 22-year-old college athlete in Michigan who died of a 
heart attack. An autopsy showed two of his coronary arteries were blocked. 
</P>
<P>
A police investigation revealed that the man -- a weightlifter -- had been 
using androgenic steroids, which build up body and muscle mass, Ferenchick 
said. He said an examination showed the man's blood had clotted in a manner 
that apparently led to the artery blockage and may be linked to the steroids.

TESTS ESTABLISH GENE'S LINK TO TYPE OF CANCER

Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have for the first 
time inserted a human cancer gene into a mouse to produce a specific type of 
human cancer called chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Their research, 
reported last week in Science, demonstrates that the gene does, in fact, cause 
the disease in humans and opens the way for testing of new therapies. 
</P>
<P>
CML affects 10,000 Americans each year. Patients usually respond well to 
chemotherapy for three to five years, then experience a sudden increase in 
abnormal cells, signaling the onset of acute disease. The only therapy for the 
acute stage is bone marrow transplants. 
</P>
<P>
CML was the first cancer associated with a specific abnormality in chromosomes, 
the repository of genetic information. Researchers at the University of 
Pennsylvania reported in the 1960s that, in all victims of the disease, a small 
portion of chromosome 9 had become fused to a piece of chromosome 22, forming a 
characteristic chromosome called the Philadelphia chromosome. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers subsequently found that a new gene is formed from sections of two 
normal genes when the Philadelphia chromosome is formed during development. 
Molecular biologist David Baltimore and his colleagues at MIT inserted ths gene 
into mice to produce CML in the animals.

DRAFTING TEACHER'S CLASSES PROVIDE A BLUEPRINT FOR SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: BELA PALAGYI'S STUDENTS ARE KNOWN FOR WINNING COMPETITIONS AND FOR 
LANDING JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN YAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago, Bela Palagyi, an architectural drafting instructor at Reseda 
High School, lost out on a summer job to a teen-age girl. 
</P>
<P>
Some might have considered it insult added to injury that the young woman was a 
former student who had just graduated. But Palagyi was as happy as if he'd 
gotten the job himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt great," he said. "Why not? One of my students got a job." 
</P>
<P>
Palagyi is still able to parlay that life experience into a lesson for his 
students. "I went to another place and found another job. If you go to one 
place and don't get a job, go to another place," he tells them. 
</P>
<P>
For 32 years, Palagyi has been cajoling and inspiring his drafting students 
toward excellence and, along the way, helping them land jobs with an admirable 
success rate. 
</P>
<P>
Palagyi's pragmatism -- along with some good-natured hollering and storytelling 
-- have catapulted Reseda High students to about 100 local, state and national 
awards in the past 25 years. For 15 years in a row, his students' house and 
landscaping plans have won at least one of three top prizes in an annual San 
Fernando Valley-wide drafting contest among high school students. 
</P>
<P>
As recognition of his dedication, the school recently nominated Palagyi, 56, 
for the governor's Citation for Excellence in Vocational Education, which is 
awarded in April. 
</P>
<P>
Palagyi, a modest man, said there is no particular secret to his teaching 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'm unique in any way," he said. "I do my job. I'm not here for 
a popularity contest. The goal for me is for the kids to do better than I can. 
Then they're going to come back and show me how to be a better teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Palagyi is full of stories about former students: the undercover narcotics 
agent who became a drafting ace, the boy who hovered on the edge of gang 
activity but got a drafting job after studying with Palagyi, the graduate who 
became one of the state's youngest licensed general contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Pettit-Williams, the upstart student who took the job from Palagyi 20 
years ago, is a partner in a Santa Ana architectural firm. 
</P>
<P>
"He's strict, yet he cares about what happens to you," she said. "He's the only 
teacher I ever had that I still send a Christmas card to." 
</P>
<P>
Palagyi's Christmases have brought other good tidings from students. Just 
before he began building a house in Canyon Country eight years ago, a card from 
about 15 gung-ho former students read: "You supply the materials and food, and 
we'll build the house for nothing." They ended up building the garage; Palagyi 
designed his house, which is still under construction. 
</P>
<P>
"His students maintain contact with him," said John Shaw, vice president of 
Ebbe Videriksen AIA Architects and Associates. "If somebody's 25 years old, 
looking for a job and is having trouble finding one, he'd call Mr. Palagyi up 
because he's got a lot of dedication to his former students as well." 
</P>
<P>
Of about 25 student trainees the firm has hired in 15 years, Shaw estimates 20 
have come from Reseda. Looking at Reseda for student drafters has almost become 
a company tradition. It started 25 years ago after owner Videriksen declared 
drafters weren't getting proper training and Palagyi, fond of issuing 
challenges, dared him to visit the high school. 
</P>
<P>
In a field where college graduates are unable to get jobs, Palagyi estimates 
that in the past 25 years 80 of his students have been hired part time during 
the school year by firms in the construction industry and 100 have been offered 
jobs right out of high school. There's a Palagyi hiring network and what he 
jokingly calls a "vicious family circle": Alumni hire Reseda students, 
sometimes "stealing" them from other Reseda graduates. 
</P>
<P>
His track record has created envy among other drafting teachers, who have 
accused Reseda's students of copying from professional plans and Palagyi of 
doing the drawings himself, according to Palagyi and his students. 
</P>
<P>
But Don Runyan, drafting instructor at Cleveland High School and adviser to the 
state Board of Education, said the criticism is "a cop-out from teachers that 
don't have the ability to compete." 
</P>
<P>
"Palagyi sets a standard for the competitions," said Runyan, whose students 
have won about 16 awards in the past seven years. "If you compete against 
Palagyi's students and you really win, you've accomplished something. He's 
probably the top architectural drafting instructor that I've seen. And I've 
seen some good ones across California and the country." 
</P>
<P>
Although Palagyi encourages high expectations and competitiveness, he also 
fosters a sense of camaraderie among students so they feel they've all won when 
a classmate wins, students said. 
</P>
<P>
He treats students as if they're professionals in the field, giving them five 
or six projects at a time, relishing his role as a demanding homeowner, out for 
what he -- and not the architect -- wants. "There are too many egotistical 
designers, and they're good designers," he said. "But I want my idea, I'm going 
to be living in the house." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the all-business facade, students said, Palagyi cares about them and 
their futures. A number of drafting students said few teachers and counselors 
make special efforts to ensure they make it -- in class and in life. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't here for a while and he asked me if I had a problem," said Michael 
Mulverhill, a senior who had set a personal record this semester for being in 
class two weeks straight. "No teacher has ever asked me if I had a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Now set on an architectural career, Mulverhill credited Palagyi with setting 
his priorities back on track. The teacher was surprisingly understanding about 
family conflicts and school problems, Mulverhill said. 
</P>
<P>
Palagyi's own childhood was not particularly troubled. He was an average 
student and affectionate son, he said. After moving to California from New 
Jersey, his Hungarian parents told him: "Go to school, go to school," but never 
told him what he should become. 
</P>
<P>
Drafting was an elective he took in high school, but it wasn't until college 
that he realized he was good at it. Unaware of scholarships and financial aid, 
he had to attend less-expensive colleges that didn't have architectural 
programs. Palagyi became a teacher, thinking it was his best way to stay in 
drafting. 
</P>
<P>
It's a path he does not regret. And the fact that he likes what he does is 
manifested in his classroom and his insistence on working personally with each 
student. 
</P>
<P>
The class is "like a safe haven; it's where we can be ourselves," said 
11th-grader Aditya Chatterjee, who was placed in Palagyi's class three years 
ago by computer error and since has decided to become an architect. Chatterjee 
drew the plans that doubled the size of his family's house. He also bought a 
car with earnings from drafting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Although Palagyi tends to remain businesslike in class, students said they've 
seen him in tears when his proteges win awards. And even the businesslike 
Palagyi admits a little levity never hurts. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have their own personal problems that might be bothering them," he 
said. "It can get rough at this time of the semester when you have tests and 
finals." 
</P>
<P>
Proving the point, Palagyi on a recent morning stepped on a wooden board atop a 
wooden cylinder and rocked from side to side. With the students cheering him 
on, he balanced himself, showing the young hotshots who was really hot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want all these kids to be draftsmen or architects," Palagyi said. 
"What I want them to do is learn the subject and feel they can use that later. 
Who knows, they may end up teaching school and wind up on a bongo board."

<P>
One person was killed and another seriously injured Sunday morning when their 
speeding car smashed into a parked flatbed truck on rain-slick Sepulveda 
Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, who police said appeared to have been drinking, was arrested on 
suspicion of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Glennon, 27, of Long Beach was free on $5,000 bail Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Glennon told police he and two friends were heading north on Sepulveda near 
Valley Heart Drive at 3:05 a.m. when his car was cut off by another car. He 
said he applied his brakes and swerved into the truck, which was loaded with 
3,000 pounds of rubbish, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Glennon was speeding at the time of the collision, but they had not 
determined how fast he was going. 
</P>
<P>
One passenger was pronounced dead at the scene. The other was taken to 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where he was in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
The two passengers were not identified Sunday.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVERS HURT WHEN RTD BUS HITS CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people were injured Sunday morning when a Rapid Transit District bus 
collided with a car in Northridge, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The car driven by Michelle Chon, 25, of Northridge was heading south on Reseda 
Boulevard about 7:20 a.m. when it apparently ran a red light, police said. 
</P>
<P>
It was hit by an RTD bus heading east on Parthenia Street that was driven by 
Laura Allen, 29, of Los Angeles. There were no passengers on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the collision sent Chon's car spinning into the westbound lanes 
of Parthenia. The bus smashed into a retaining wall on the southeast corner of 
the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Allen was admitted to Northridge Hospital Medical Center with a broken arm. 
Chon was treated for a broken clavicle and released. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Greene, an RTD spokeswoman, said the bus was starting its morning route 
along Line 420, which runs across the San Fernando Valley along Parthenia. She 
said another bus was dispatched from the RTD depot in Chatsworth minutes after 
the accident to avoid delays.

The body of a 49-year-old Panorama City man was found Sunday morning near a 
dumpster in Sherman Oaks Park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose name was not released pending notification of relatives, 
apparently died elsewhere and his body was dumped in the park on Van Nuys 
Boulevard near the Ventura Freeway, police said. A park maintenance worker 
found the body about 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police are unsure how the man died and are treating the case as a murder. An 
autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death.

FORSMAN FRETS WAY TO VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: IN THE WIND AND RAIN, A FINAL-ROUND 72 WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR A TWO-SHOT 
VICTORY AT TORREY PINES.

<P>
A round of golf, with its idle time between shots, gives a player plenty of 
time to think. Maybe too much time. At least that's the way it seems for Dan 
Forsman. 
</P>
<P>
Forsman uses every spare moment on the course, but not always to his advantage. 
He worries, he wanders, he fidgets, he frets. 
</P>
<P>
The results sometimes show unfavorably in his score. So with the title of the 
$900,000 Shearson Lehman Hutton Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course resting in his 
control Sunday, Forsman had plenty to think about. 
</P>
<P>
He said he worried about the weather, the national televison coverage, the 
distraction of spectators and a slow-play warning after the 13th hole. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, Forsman was able to put enough of his thoughts aside to walk 
away with his first tour title in four years and the $162,000 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
On a cool, windy and rainy day on which none of his closest challengers could 
sustain a charge, Forsman was able to patiently shoot a par 72 on the South 
Course for a four-round total of 13-under 275 and a two-stroke victory over 
Tommy Armour III. 
</P>
<P>
The victory came when Forsman most needed it. His worrying had reached a peak 
over the past year. He finished 99th on the 1989 money list with $141,174, his 
lowest placing since 1984, his second on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
His drop in play meant a loss of some of the perks, such as a courtesy car, 
that go to the better tour players. At 31, with seven years on the tour, it was 
a shock to lose those extras. 
</P>
<P>
"I would ask about a courtesy car, and they would ask where I was on the 
(money) list," Forsman said. As soon as they asked, Forsman would think, "Oh, 
no, not the list." 
</P>
<P>
"People would see me going out to the driving range, and they would look the 
other way," he said. "They'd think, 'There he is hitting balls again. Maybe he 
should take up tennis.' " 
</P>
<P>
This year began smartly for Forsman with a tie for fourth at Tucson, but then 
the bottom fell out. He tied for 71st at the Bob Hope tournament, was 82nd at 
Phoenix after a final-round 84 and withdrew two weeks ago in the third round at 
Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Forsman said he found himself practicing more and more with less and less to 
show for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worn the groves off a couple sets of irons the past couple years trying 
to improve my game," Forsman said. "Someone asked me, 'Do you have V-groves or 
U-groves?' I have no groves." 
</P>
<P>
So wound up was Forsman, his worrying began early Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an emotional day for me," Forsman said. "I woke up at 5 a.m. and my 
wife, Trudy, was staring at the ceiling like I was. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't sleep very well and I couldn't eat much. I took a bowl of cereal, a 
small portion, but I could barely eat that." 
</P>
<P>
But this was a rainy day which almost everyone would find trying. Of the five 
players who stared the round within five shots of Forsman, none gained a stroke 
on him Sunday, and one of them, halfway-leader Bob Eastwood, who started three 
strokes behind, shot himself out of contention with his second consecutive 76 
to finish in a tie for 14th at 282. 
</P>
<P>
The rain, which had held off for much the day except for a brief early shower 
and an occasional drizzle, began to pour as Forsman stood over his first putt 
on the 17th green. The always worrisome Forsman began to wonder what else could 
go wrong. He does not consider himself a strong bad-weather player. At 
6-feet-4, 195 pounds, he is better known for winning the tour's 1987 
long-driving competition than he is for his finesse. 
</P>
<P>
But this time the weather would turn out to be his friend. Forsman was able to 
two-putt for a par to keep his three-stroke lead, and the downpour eliminated 
any chance Armour had of scoring the eagle on the par-five, 499-yard 18th hole 
that might have put some pressure on Forsman. 
</P>
<P>
Armour found his ball after his drive on the 18th splattered with mud, 
preventing him from taking a chance at the green with his second shot. 
</P>
<P>
"The tournament was over when I walked up and saw that mud on my ball," Armour 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until Forsman reached the green and realized that even a 
three-putt bogey would give him the tournament was he finally able to enjoy a 
moment without care or worry. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point it finally sunk in," Forsman said. "I was stunned. I kind of 
looked around, I sort of gave out a sigh of relief. There was a sort of 
emptiness there because all that pressure was over. There were no more holes. 
This was it. I had won one. Peace, tranquility, happiness." 
</P>
<P>
Armour did sink his 23-foot putt for a birdie and a final-round 72, but all 
that could do was break a second-place tie with Tom Byrum, who shot a 68 to 
finish at 278. Armour won $97,200 for his 277 total, Byrum $61,200 for third. 
</P>
<P>
All that was left for Forsman was to drop in a two-foot putt for par and the 
tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
He hugged his caddie, Greg Martin, and turned to see his youngest son, 
five-year-old Ricky, running toward him. He scooped his son up in his arms and 
lifted him high above his head. The wait for his third tour title -- and first 
since 1986 at the Bay Hill tournament in Orlando, Fla. -- was over. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was such a humbling experience," Forsman said. "I wanted to get off 
to a good start in 1990. This is a big boost, mentally." 
</P>
<P>
There Forsman goes again, thinking, always thinking. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tournament Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jodie Mudd had a hole-in-one on the 210-yard, 11th hole using a three-iron. He 
shot a 71 and finished in a tie for 37th at two-under 286. . . . Jeff Wilson, a 
26-year-old rookie from Vallejo, had the day's low round with a six-under 66 
and finished in tie for 19th at 283. . . . Mark Brooks, who shot a record 61 on 
the North Course Friday, found life on the South Course more difficult, 
shooting a pair of 75s and final 72 to finish at 286. . . . Rick Fehr, who 
shared the first-round lead with Bob Eastwood at 65, shot 71, 74, 75 on his 
final three rounds on the South Course and finished in a tie for 28th at 285. . 
. . John Huston, who shot the high round of the tournament with an 83 Saturday, 
came back to shoot a 68 Sunday, an improvement of 15 strokes . . . Dan 
Forsman's 72 was the highest final-round score by a winner here since Fuzzy 
Zoeller shot a 72 in 1979 . . . Forsman's four-round total of 275 was the 
highest winning score since Bruce Lietzke's 278 in 1981.

STUNNING FINISH AT DAYTONA; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO RACING: WHEN A CUT TIRE FLATTENS EARNHARDT, UNHERALDED DERRIKE COPE COMES 
AWAY WITH FIRST VICTORY. 
</P>

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First Buster Douglas, now Derrike Cope. 
</P>
<P>
In another stunning upset, the unheralded Cope knocked out Dale Earnhardt to 
win the Daytona 500 Sunday before a shocked crowd of 150,000 stock car fans. 
</P>
<P>
Or rather, it was a cut tire less than a mile from the end of the 500-mile race 
at Daytona International Speedway that knocked out Earnhardt, and Cope was 
there to take advantage of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Seldom had any car dominated a race the way Earnhardt's Chevrolet Lumina did, 
leading 155 of the 200 laps and pulling more than half a lap ahead late on the 
sunny day. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a tire go right in front of the chicken-bone grandstands on the back 
stretch," said the disconsolate loser. "I was just sitting there, they couldn't 
catch me. 
</P>
<P>
"Derrike wins the race, but we beat them all day. They didn't outrun us, they 
just lucked into it." 
</P>
<P>
When Earnhardt swung high on the banking going into the third turn heading for 
what would have been his first Daytona 500 win, it was apparent that his car 
was in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Cope, right on his bumper, had to jerk his car to the left to avoid the slowing 
car, and then had to beat Terry Labonte, Bill Elliott and Ricky Rudd in a 
trophy dash to the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
"I just turned that baby left as hard as I could and said, 'Stick, baby,' " 
Cope said. "I never turned a car as hard as that before. It was really amazing 
because I'd kept telling myself to keep cool and hold on to second place. 
</P>
<P>
"Labonte was making it tough for me, making my car loose by getting up close, 
but all I had in mind was hanging on to Dale and having him pull me along." 
</P>
<P>
Cope was so unprepared for the way the race ended that he did not know where to 
go to Victory Lane. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea where it was," he said. "I figured I'd keep on driving down pit 
row until I saw my crew. I figured they'd find it before me." 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt slipped all the way back to fifth place before he limped home with a 
badly mangled right rear tire. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit some debris, I don't know what," Earnhardt added. "I heard it hit the 
bottom of the car and then it hit the tire. That's when it popped. There ain't 
nothing you can do about something like that." 
</P>
<P>
The debris turned out to be a piece of bell housing that later ended up in 
Rudd's radiator, where crew chief Waddell Wilson found it after the race. 
</P>
<P>
Although his Purolator Chevrolet ran close to the leaders all day, the 
32-year-old Cope was a most unlikely beneficiary of Earnhardt's misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
He had never won a Winston Cup race in 71 starts, had never finished better 
than 27th before in the Daytona 500, had never finished better than sixth in 
his NASCAR career and last year had only four top-10 finishes. 
</P>
<P>
The $188,150 he won Sunday far exceeded the $125,630 he won in 23 races last 
year. His highest previous single-race purse was $16,775 for a sixth place at 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
And he is the first driver from the Winston West series to win at Daytona, or 
any other NASCAR track other than Riverside International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Cope, who is from Spanaway, Wash., began racing in late model sportsman cars on 
the West Coast in 1980 after a knee injury cut short his baseball career as a 
catcher for Whitman College. 
</P>
<P>
He drove first for his father, Donald, who raced top fuel and top gas dragsters 
in San Diego before moving the Cope family to Washington when Derrike was four. 
In November of 1982, Cope made his Winston West debut with longtime West Coast 
driver George Jefferson as his car owner. His first race was in the Winston 
Western 500 at Riverside, driving an '82 Ford that failed to finish. 
</P>
<P>
He was voted rookie of the year in 1984 and missed winning the championship by 
only four points behind Jim Robinson of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 Cope decided to move to Charlotte, N.C., and challenge the big boys. 
</P>
<P>
After several uneventful years, he joined car owner Bob Whitcomb, a New England 
businessman, midway through last season and with veteran Buddy Parrott as crew 
chief, the team began to show improvement. Parrott, who was crew chief for 
Richard Petty when he won his 200th race in 1984 at Daytona, says Cope reminds 
him of a young Darrell Waltrip, with whom he worked in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some changes this year, like switching from a Pontiac to a Chevrolet 
and getting our engines from Hendrick Motorsports," Parrott said. "When we 
tested well over the winter, we were looking forward to winning a race or two 
this season. But not the Daytona 500!" 
</P>
<P>
Cope is the fourth driver to make stock car racing's premier race his first 
win. The others are Tiny Lund in 1963, Mario Andretti in 1967 and Pete Hamilton 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Before Earnhardt's surprising exit from the lead, the race had been a ho-hum 
affair where the cars were strung out around the 2 1/2-mile track most of the 
day behind the black No. 3 Chevrolet that showed no signs of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
When Geoff Bodine spun in the second turn on lap 193, Earnhardt elected to pit 
for four tires and a splash of fuel. Cope did not stop and took the lead, but 
when the green flag came out with five laps remaining, Earnhardt wasted little 
time in returning to the lead. 
</P>
<P>
For four laps, Earnhardt never looked back as Cope, Labonte and Elliott 
followed single file -- until the loose bell housing ripped open his tire. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it happened," Earnhardt said. "This is the biggest buildup and 
biggest letdown I've ever had in racing. There's nothing you can do about it, 
though. You can't kick the car and cry and pout and lay down and squall and 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to take it and move on. We just ran a quarter of a lap short on 
luck today." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second late-race heartbreak for the three-time Winston Cup champion. 
In 1986 he appeared to have the race won after leading for 34 laps when he ran 
out of gas three laps from the finish and had to watch as Geoff Bodine cruised 
past to the checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the wrecks that made Daytona look like a junk yard the past week, 
Sunday's race was remarkably clean. Only three minor accidents, which brought 
out the caution flag for 15 laps, slowed the pace, enabling Cope to average 
165.761 m.p.h. for the race. 
</P>
<P>
The first caution came when Richard Petty spun into the infield on lap 27, 
killing hopes for Petty fans that stock car racing's No. 1 idol might regain 
some of his lost luster. Petty later returned and limped around, 17 laps behind 
the leaders, to finish 34th. 
</P>
<P>
Another legendary character, A.J. Foyt, dropped out with dizziness after 
finishing 115 laps. 
</P>
<P>
"I got so dizzy I couldn't see," Foyt said. "The problem was with my helmet and 
uniform. The fumes of the glue in the helmet got me drunk. I thought I better 
park it before I hurt myself or someone else. I don't know how anybody can take 
drugs and drive. I never had anything like this ever happen to me before." 
</P>
<P>
Two movie cars, shooting scenes for the Tom Cruise film, "Days of Thunder," 
kept pace with the field for 100 miles and then retired, as planned, without 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Schrader, who started at the rear of the 42-car field after crashing his 
pole-sitting Chevrolet during one of the Twin 125 qualifying races last 
Thursday, provided most of the excitement early in the race. Schrader picked 
off cars by the bunches, moving all the way up to second behind Earnhardt, in 
24 laps. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, after slow pit work by his crew, Schrader again was forced to move from 
15th up to second again and then from 16th to third before he slowed on the 
backstretch with a blown engine on the 58th lap.

SOCKERS FINISH FRUSTRATING TRIP WITH BIG VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Sockers finally picked up a victory Sunday on the last game of this 
four-game trip, but if you believe Socker Coach Ron Newman, this is one they 
didn't deserve. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing, really," said Newman after a 6-4 victory over the Tacoma Stars 
(14-21) snapped a three-game losing streak. "We probably deserved to win the 
last two games with Tacoma, but not this one. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it strange? All of a sudden, the goals are coming for us. Out of the 
blue. At the right time. We weren't quite on our game, and it worked out. This 
was a mystery game, this one." 
</P>
<P>
What was not a mystery was the outstanding game turned in by Socker goalie 
Zoltan Toth, who made 17 saves, many of which were of acrobatic caliber. 
</P>
<P>
That helped the Sockers (14-18) exact a bit of revenge on Keith Weller, who 
left his assistant position with the Sockers Dec. 5 to take over as Tacoma's 
coach and has since returned with the Stars to defeat the Sockers twice at the 
San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same old story," said Weller, whose team has now lost seven of its 
past eight. "Missed chances and mistakes have cost us." 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, the Sockers remain in third place in the Western Division, 5 
1/2 games behind first-place Dallas and a game-and-a-half ahead of Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do?" asked Kia, Tacoma's high-scoring forward, who was 
turned away repeatedly by Toth. "He was making saves with his face, with his 
feet. You look back and you think, 'If I put a couple of those in, it could 
have been a different game.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tacoma fought back from a 4-1 deficit to 4-3 before the Sockers, who played 
without injured midfielder Brian Quinn, put it away with a freaky goal and a 
nicely executed three-on-two break. Branko Segota got the freaky goal, the 
second strange one of the game for the Sockers, by bouncing a free kick from 
the circle off of Kia's leg and the crossbar at 2:04 of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Zoran Karic scored the fast-break goal at 8:20 after Jacques Ladouceur stripped 
Tacoma's Brent Goulet and started it with a nice pass. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still playing a little nervous," said Newman. "When they came back a 
couple of goals, we didn't look like the same team. That's the nature of the 
game, when you're struggling near the bottom. You make things worse for 
yourself. We couldn't afford to lose this one."

ANOTHER 0-FOR-PAULEY STREAK ENDS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: STANFORD HOLDS OFF FURIOUS UCLA RALLY IN FINAL 3:51 FOR 
70-69 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
Return to glory? 
</P>
<P>
A return to the National Invitation Tournament might be more like it for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
After losing Sunday to Stanford, 70-69, in front of 10,936 at Pauley Pavilion, 
the Bruins might be in danger of missing the NCAA tournament, a possibility 
that seemed highly improbable only a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Could it happen? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said. "I haven't had time to think about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
He will now. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' third consecutive loss -- and fourth in their past five Pacific 10 
Conference games -- dropped them to 16-7 and 9-5 in the Pac-10, leaving them 
only a game ahead of fifth-place Oregon in the conference race. 
</P>
<P>
And up next are games this week at Oregon and Oregon State. UCLA has won only 
two of its past 10 games at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got (today) off and we get to do some soul-searching, trying to get this 
team back together," Bruin forward Don MacLean said. "This was a must-game for 
us. Our chances of winning the conference are slim and none." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford took care of that. 
</P>
<P>
Winning in Pauley Pavilion for the first time after 24 losses, the Cardinal 
built an 11-point lead with 3:51 left, prompting several thousand disgruntled 
fans to walk out, before withstanding a furious Bruin rally. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Wilson had two chances to pull the Bruins even in the last 10 seconds, 
but after missing a driving bank shot, grabbing the rebound and drawing a foul 
as he attempted a follow shot, the UCLA senior missed the first of two foul 
shots with four seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA kept taking it at us, taking it at us, and we couldn't shut it off," 
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "But at that point, I felt like we 
deserved to win. We'd done so many things well." 
</P>
<P>
In gaining its fourth consecutive victory over UCLA, the Cardinal (15-8, 7-7) 
outplayed the Bruins from the start, opening a 5-3 lead in the first 75 seconds 
and never losing it. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford led at halftime, 37-26, after shooting 60.9%. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half, we played as well as we could play," Montgomery said. "I 
was very concerned about the first five minutes because I thought UCLA would be 
very hungry, based on us having beaten them (last month at Stanford) and them 
losing Thursday night (to California)." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Bruins seemed uninspired, almost disinterested. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like we were under water," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Vlahov, a plodding, muscular forward who matched a career high by 
scoring 15 points Thursday night in a 71-62 loss to USC, scored 14 in the first 
half against UCLA, making seven of 10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We were more worried about (Adam) Keefe," MacLean said of Stanford's sophomore 
center, the Cardinal's leading scorer and rebounder. "That hurt us because 
Vlahov was getting the ball and scoring. They told us not to worry about Vlahov 
and he ended up hurting us in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not blaming the coaches. I'm just saying Keefe's one of the best players 
in the conference and we were definitely worried about him." 
</P>
<P>
Vlahov scored 20 points. Keefe made only two of seven shots, but made 13 of 15 
free throws, and grabbed 10 rebounds, and Deshon Wingate scored 12 as 
Stanford's front line accounted for 49 points. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean led UCLA with 15 points, but made only three of nine shots. Darrick 
Martin scored 14, but made only five of 14 shots, and Wilson and Tracy Murray 
each scored 13, but Wilson made only four of 14 shots. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA shot 40.7% from the field, which wasn't all that surprising considering 
its recent slump and Stanford's defensive prowess. In their previous two games, 
the Bruins shot 39.2% against Arizona and 41.2% against Cal, and Harrick called 
Stanford the Pac-10's best defensive team. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their poor shooting, the Bruins almost won, taking advantage of four 
Stanford turnovers to score nine consecutive points and cut a 67-56 deficit to 
67-65 on a fall-away jump shot by Wilson with 1:57 left. 
</P>
<P>
But UCLA never got closer until four seconds remained. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who made five of 10 free throws, missed one with 57 seconds left that 
would have cut the deficit to 68-67, then missed again at the end after 
Stanford's John Patrick missed the front end in a one-and-one with 20 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
After victories by California Thursday night and Stanford Sunday, Washington 
State is the only Pacific 10 Conference team that has never beaten UCLA in 
Pauley Pavilion. . . . Before winning in March at the Forum in the semifinals 
of the Pac-10 tournament, Stanford had not beaten UCLA in Los Angeles since 
1952. . . . At this point last season, UCLA was 17-6 and 10-4 in the Pac-10. . 
. . UCLA Coach Jim Harrick is 1-4 against Stanford. . . . Stanford had not 
swept a season series against UCLA since the 1941-42 season. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Wilson, on his sprained right wrist, re-injured in a fall Sunday: "I 
can't put into words how it feels, so what's the use of talking about it?" . . 
. Wilson needs one rebound to pass Willie Naulls and move into fourth place on 
the Bruins' all-time list.

LENDL JUST TOO FAST, TOO GOOD FOR MAYOTTE ONCE MORE, 6-3, 6-0

<P>
Ivan Lendl was in a hurry and Tim Mayotte couldn't slow him down. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl had a plane to catch so he took only 1 hour 4 minutes to register a 6-3, 
6-0 victory over Mayotte Sunday in the final of the SkyDome World tournament at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, Lendl, who is on the Hartford Whalers' board of directors, 
headed for the airport to catch a flight to Buffalo, where the Whalers played 
the Sabres in an NHL game Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The match was shorter than I wanted," said Mayotte, who also lost to Lendl 
last week in the final of a tournament at Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The $167,500 winner's share, from the $1.2-million purse, lifted Lendl's career 
earnings above $16 million. Mayotte earned $88,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl broke Mayotte in the seventh game of the first set and ended the set with 
another service break. The top player in the world powered through the second 
set with ease. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova used her intimidating serve and precise shots to overpower 
Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria, 6-3, 6-2, in 54 minutes and win her 10th Virginia 
Slims of Chicago title. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, top-seeded and ranked No. 2 in the world behind injured Steffi 
Graf, took the $100,000 first prize to boost her leading career winnings to 
$15,434,813. Maleeva made $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 147th career tournament victory for Navratilova, second only to 
Chris Evert. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Boris Becker swept past Carl-Uwe Steeb, 7-5, 6-2, 6-2, to win the 
Belgian Indoor Championship at Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
Steeb upset Becker last month in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
In the first all-West German final in a major tournament since 1973, Becker won 
$77,500, while Steeb earned $43,000.

2-STROKE PENALTY HITS POCKETBOOK

<P>
Rookie mistakes are commonplace, but how about the one that cost Michael Allen 
money in the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open at Torrey Pines? 
</P>
<P>
When Allen played Steve Pate's golf ball on the 12th fairway Saturday, it 
appeared to be no more than a bizarre sidelight to the main focus of the 
tournament. Neither Allen nor Pate was in the running anyway so it didn't 
appear to matter that each was socked with a two-stroke penalty. 
</P>
<P>
But that was before Allen got hot in the final round Sunday. His five-under-par 
67 gave him a 72-hole total of 282 and led him to wonder what might have 
happened if he hadn't committed a monumental goof 24 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's finishing kick gave him a tie for 14th place and a check for $15,300, 
more than he had made in four previous tournaments in his maiden season on the 
PGA Tour. His money total going in was only $11,788. 
</P>
<P>
Now consider where Allen might have wound up if he hadn't made that grievous 
error Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Subtracting the two shots he sacrificed by playing the wrong golf ball would 
move Allen into a tie for 10th place with Bob Estes, who earned $24,300. And 
since Allen probably would have had a birdie three instead of the par four he 
eventually shot -- before the penalty -- it's likely that he would have joined 
six players in a tie for fourth. Each of them pocketed $32,625. 
</P>
<P>
Allen completed his disastrous round with a 78 after shooting 68 and 69 the 
first two days. 
</P>
<P>
Pate, who won this tournament in 1988, never recovered from Allen's blunder. He 
went on to shoot 77 Saturday and 74 Sunday, finishing in a tie for 56th place 
at 288 and earning only $1,998. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, an unusually mature rookie at 31, is a personable sort who lists wine 
tasting and the San Francisco 49ers among his special interests. He was born in 
San Mateo and now lives in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"A golfer was something I never wanted to be," he said. "It was something that 
kind of happened. I was more interested in mountaineering until I broke my left 
wrist rock-climbing." 
</P>
<P>
Allen finally got hooked on golf while attending Nevada Reno. He turned pro in 
1983, but didn't make it through qualifying school until last fall. In the 
interim, he played on the European tour and won two tournaments, the Bordeaux 
Open in 1986 and the Scottish Open in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Did he ever hit somebody else's golf ball before? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I did, probably in college," he said. "All I know is that whenever I 
did it, it didn't make as much difference as it did here." 
</P>
<P>
Allen recounted these details from the shot he will never forget: 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best shot I hit all day. It put me on the green in two, about six 
feet from the cup. Steve (Pate) went ahead and hit my ball, and he holed out, 
having no idea it was the wrong ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I had marked what I thought was my ball, and I was all set to putt for a 
birdie when I looked at the ball before putting it back on the green. When I 
saw it, I said, 'That's not my ball.' Then we took the penalties and went back 
to our second shots." 
</P>
<P>
How did this happen? 
</P>
<P>
"My drive hit the right edge of a bunker and must have bounced toward the 
fairway," Allen said. "Steve's went down the middle of the fairway and must 
have bounced to the right, past mine. They were 10 or 15 yards apart, and I 
went to where I had seen my ball land. Maybe the wind had something to do with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Allen wished he had those two -- perhaps three -- strokes back 
when he went on a roll Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the back nine first, he shot a sizzling 30 that included four birdies 
and an eagle, on No. 18. Then he cooled off but still would have tied Jeff 
Wilson for the best round of the day if he hadn't bogeyed No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell asleep out there," he said. "But outside of that third round, I had a 
great tournament. I just wish I was still in contention after yesterday."

FORSMAN LEAVES HIS WORRIES BEHIND; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO OPEN: HE SHOOTS PAR 72 ON FINAL DAY TO EARN HIS FIRST PGA TOUR 
VICTORY IN FOUR YEARS.

<P>
A round of golf, with its idle time between shots, gives a player plenty of 
time to think. Maybe too much time. At least that's the way it seems for Dan 
Forsman. 
</P>
<P>
Forsman uses every spare moment on the course, and not always to his advantage. 
He worries, he wanders, he fidgets, he frets. 
</P>
<P>
The results sometimes show unfavorably in his score. So with the title of the 
$900,000 Shearson Lehman Hutton Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course resting in his 
control Sunday, Forsman had plenty to think about. 
</P>
<P>
He worried about almost everything -- the weather, the national television 
coverage, the distraction of spectators and a slow-play warning after the 13th 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, Forsman was able to put enough of his thoughts aside to walk 
away with his first tour title in four years and the $162,000 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
On cool, windy and rainy day when none of his closest challengers could sustain 
a charge, Forsman was able to patiently shoot a par 72 on the South Course for 
a four-round total of 13-under 275 and a two-stroke victory over Tommy Armour 
III. 
</P>
<P>
The victory came when Forsman needed it the most. His worrying had reached a 
peak over the past year. He finished 99th on the 1989 money list with $141,174, 
his lowest placing since 1984, his second on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
His drop in play meant a loss of some of the perks, such as a courtesy car, 
that go to the better tour players. At 31, with seven years on the tour, it was 
shock to lose those extras. 
</P>
<P>
"I would ask about a courtesy car, and they would ask where I was on the 
(money) list," Forsman said. "Oh, no, not the list. 
</P>
<P>
"People would see me going out to the driving range, and they would look the 
other way. There he is hitting balls again, maybe he should take up tennis." 
</P>
<P>
He started this year with a tie for fourth at Tucson but then slumped. He tied 
for 71st at the Bob Hope tournament, was 82nd at Phoenix after a final-round 84 
and withdrew two weeks ago in the third round at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Forsman said he found himself practicing more and more with little results. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worn the grooves off a couple of sets of irons the past couple of years 
trying to improve my game," Forsman said. "Someone asked me, 'Do you have 
V-grooves or U-grooves?' I have no grooves." 
</P>
<P>
So wound up was Forsman, his worrying began early Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an emotional day for me," Forsman said. "I woke up at 5 a.m. and my 
wife, Trudy, was staring at the ceiling like I was." 
</P>
<P>
But this was a rainy day almost everyone would find trying. Of the five players 
who stared the round within five shots of Forsman, none gained a stroke on him 
Sunday and one of them, halfway-leader Bob Eastwood who started three strokes 
behind, shot himself out of contention with his second consecutive 76 to finish 
in a tie for 14th at 282. 
</P>
<P>
The rain, which had held off for much the day except for a brief early shower 
and an occasional drizzle, began to pour as Forsman stood over his first putt 
on the 17th green. The always worrisome Forsman began to wonder what else could 
go wrong. Forsman does not consider himself a strong bad-weather player. At 
6-feet-4, 195 pounds, Forsman is better known as the winner of the tour's 1987 
long-driving competition than for his finesse. 
</P>
<P>
But this time the weather would turn out to be his friend. Forsman was able to 
two-putt for a par to keep his three-stroke lead, and the downpour eliminated 
any chance Armour had of scoring an eagle on the par-five, 499-yard 18th hole 
that might apply pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Armour found his ball after his drive on the 18th splattered with mud, 
preventing him from taking a chance at the green with his second shot. 
</P>
<P>
"The tournament was over when I walked up and saw that mud on my ball," Armour 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not over until Forsman reached the green and realized even a 
three-putt bogey would still give him the tournament, he finally was able to 
find a moment without care or worry. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point it finally sunk in," Forsman said. "I was stunned. I kind of 
looked around, I sort of gave out a sigh of relief. There was a sort of 
emptiness there because all that pressure was over. There were no more holes. 
This was it. I had won one." 
</P>
<P>
Armour did sink his 23-foot putt for a birdie and a final-round 72, but all 
that could do was break a second-place tie with Tom Byrum, who shot a 68 to 
finish at 278. Armour won $97,200 for his 277 total, Byrum $61,200 for third. 
</P>
<P>
All that was left for Forsman was to drop in a two-foot putt for par and the 
tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
He hugged his caddie, Greg Martin, and turned to see his youngest son, Ricky, 
5, running toward him. He scooped his son up in his arms and lifted him high 
above his head. The wait for his third tour title and first since 1986 was 
over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jodie Mudd had a hole-in-one on the 210-yard, 11th hole using a three-iron. He 
shot a 71 and finished in a tie for 37th at two-under 286 . . . Jeff Wilson, a 
26-year-old rookie from Vallejo, had the low round with a six-under 66 and 
finished in tie for 19th at 283 . . . Mark Brooks, who shot a record 61 on the 
North Course Friday, found life on the South Course more difficult, shooting a 
pair of 75s and final 72 to finish at 286. . . . Rick Fehr, who shared the 
first-round lead with Bob Eastwood at 65, shot 71, 74, 75 on his final three 
rounds on the South Course and finished in a tie for 28th at 285 . . .John 
Huston, who shot the high round of the tournament with an 83 Saturday, came 
back to shoot a 68 Sunday.

TREVINO SHOOTS FINAL-ROUND 67 TO GET SECOND SENIOR TOUR WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Trevino held off a late challenge by Bruce Crampton at Naples, Fla., Sunday 
to win the Aetna Challenge by one shot for his second PGA Senior Tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino had a final-round of 67 for a 16-under-par 200 total over three rounds 
over the 6,719-yard, par-72 course at The Club at Pelican Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Crampton finished with a 66 and total of 201. The Australian pocketed the 
$35,000 second prize. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, who earned $60,000, won 27 tournaments on the regular PGA Tour before 
joining the seniors in 1989. The victory raised his senior tour earnings to 
$169,258. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm striking the ball better from tee to green than I can remember and 
that would include my best year on the regular tour in 1980," Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Crampton was Charles Coody, who shot 67 and finished third at 205. Mike 
Hill scored 206 to finish fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Crafter broke a five-way tie when she sank a 40-foot birdie putt on the 
final hole to win the Inverrary Classic at Lauderhill, Fla., for her first 
victory in more than nine years on the LPGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Crafter finished with a 54-hole total of seven-under-par 209 to edge Nancy 
Lopez by one stroke. It was Lopez's first tournament of the season after 
suffering a miscarriage in January. 
</P>
<P>
Crafter, who began the day tied for the lead with Dale Eggeling and Tammie 
Green, shot an even-par 72 over the Inverrary course. Eggeling shot 74 to 
finish two strokes back. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Greg Norman shot a 68 over the Huntingdale course in Melbourne to 
win his sixth Australian Masters title by two shots. 
</P>
<P>
England's Nick Faldo was second. Norman's 72-hole total was 19-under-par total 
of 273.

NEWSWIRE: CARBAJAL BEATS DELUCA TO WIN FIRST PRO TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Olympic silver medalist Michael Carbajal scored a unanimous 12-round 
decision over Tony DeLuca Sunday in Phoenix to win the North American Boxing 
Federation junior-flyweight title 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal (12-0) took control early in the fight, weakened slightly in the 
middle but dominated the final three rounds to earn his first pro championship 
before a hometown crowd at the Phoenix Civic Plaza and a national television 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Carbajal won easily on all three judges' cards. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Kizer scored the fight 118-110, Chuck Giampa had it 117-111 and Vince 
Delgado saw it 120-108. 
</P>
<P>
DeLuca (17-3-3) was making the second defense of the title he won Aug. 17 in 
San Diego with a 12-round split decision over Willy Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Bob Arum said Carbajal will have a non-title fight April 1 in Lake 
Tahoe, Nev., and then face champion Muangshi Kittikasem of Thailand for the 
International Boxing Federation junior-flyweight championship May 13 in either 
Las Vegas or Atlantic City, N.J.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Frenchman crumbled, a former San Diegan tumbled and friends and teammates 
rumbled. All in all, an interesting day at USD Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The final rounds of the 18th San Diego Intercollegiate Men's Tennis Tournament 
began under threatening skies, but the weather cooperated long enough to 
complete the 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 singles finals. Winning all the divisions were 
the sweep-happy Toreros: sophomore Jose Luis Noriega (1-2), senior Dan Mattera 
(3-4) and freshman Kevin Bradley (5-6). 
</P>
<P>
Although players and coaches agreed that, overall, this tournament field was 
not as strong as in previous years, there were some colorful matchups, starting 
with Peru vs. Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Lima's Noriega, the No. 2-ranked college player in the country, met UC Santa 
Barbara's David Decret, the 200th-ranked player in the world in 1988. The 
international set barely managed to produce a full set. Decret, a sophomore, 
wore a bandage on his left thigh and moved gingerly through his 6-2 first-set 
loss, then suddenly retired trailing, 3-1, in the second. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara Coach Don Lowry explained that Decret aggravated a muscle 
Friday and tore it during his semifinal victory against USD's J.R. Edwards 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably should have retired earlier," Lowry said of Decret. "It kept 
tightening up on him today. He couldn't put weight on it to set up his points." 
</P>
<P>
Lowry said he feels Decret is capable of a top-10 collegiate ranking. One 
reason he entered this event was the chance to play Noriega in hopes of a high 
national ranking come Feb. 26, when the rankings are to be released. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Decret) is very experienced," Lowry said. "But you shouldn't ever walk out 
on the court against a player like Noriega without being 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Noriega broke his ankle in the semifinals here and was out six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy because of what happened last year," said Noriega, playing in 
front of his family, which is here on a two-week vacation from Lima. 
</P>
<P>
The day before Mattera met Chris Toomey in their 3-4 final, Mattera said that 
the opponent less affected by playing a teammate would have the edge. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, we're pretty even," Mattera said. "It will come down to who can 
concentrate better.. . . Playing a teammate is tough." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Mattera was seven games (6-2, 6-3) better at it than Toomey. 
</P>
<P>
Both prefer to stick to the baseline, and they went furiously about proving 
that early on, slapping the ball back and forth until Toomey made some costly 
mental errors from which he couldn't recover. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas' Bradley, on the other hand, played like a proud gambler. He is 
aggressive, powerful, and not afraid to take chances. USD Coach Ed Collins said 
Bradley is the one player who gives Noriega absolute fits in challenge matches. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday he gave plenty of fits to UC Irvine's Bill Tontz, overpowering the 
San Diegan, 6-0, 6-1, in 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The three doubles finals (1, 2 and 3) were suspended because of rain. Play will 
resume today.

KEEPING UNIVISION ALIVE; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: HALLMARK HAS A PLAN TO RESCUE ITS TROUBLED SUBSIDIARY, THE NATION'S 
LARGEST SPANISH-LANGUAGE TELEVISION NETWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Hallmark Cards Inc. acquired a 63.5% stake in Univision in 1988, the 
Spanish-language television network had just four news correspondents -- all 
stationed in the United States, far from Latin America and many stories of 
interest to the network's mostly Latino viewers. 
</P>
<P>
But hoping to capitalize on increased advertiser interest in the nation's more 
than 20 million Latinos, the closely held greeting card concern spent heavily 
to make Univision a first-class operation. 
</P>
<P>
It hired 16 more news correspondents to work in the United States and Latin 
America, said Guillermo Martinez, Univision's vice president for news. And 
programming Vice President Rocita Peru made a similar expansion in the non-news 
area, increasing domestically produced programming by more than 25%. 
</P>
<P>
The changes at Univision -- the nation's largest Spanish-language TV network, 
with eight U.S. television stations including KMEX Channel 34 in Los Angeles -- 
have drawn praise from Univision broadcast advisory board member and former 
skeptic Herman Gallego, who now calls the network "first-rate." But the heavy 
spending, Hallmark officials concede, has rendered some of Univision's 
financial IOUs second-rate. 
</P>
<P>
Early this month, after disclosure that Univision missed interest payments on 
$270 million of junk bonds, Hallmark offered to rescue its troubled Univision 
Holdings subsidiary by buying back its bonds for about 40 cents on the dollar. 
Kansas City, Mo.-based Hallmark would then give Univision breathing room by 
defering interest payments for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the restructuring plan is implemented within a reasonable period of 
time, (Univision) will continue to be unable to meet its debt service 
obligations as they come due," forcing the company into bankruptcy or 
liquidation, Hallmark stated in its repurchase offer, which requires at least 
95% of the bonds to be tendered. 
</P>
<P>
Hallmark's offer, set to expire March 7, is the latest fallout in a series of 
leveraged buyouts gone sour and comes as New York-based Univision faces 
increasing competition from rival Telemundo Group and upstart Spanish-language 
cable network Galavision. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1986 and 1989, Telemundo purchased or built television stations in Los 
Angeles and four other cities already served by Univision. And next month, 
Galavision will begin its expansion from a basic cable network to a regional 
over-the-air broadcast network serving California, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico 
and Illinois. (Galavision already has one part-time over-the-air affiliate, 
KWHY-TV Channel 22 in Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
The three networks have waged a heated battle for the $119.6 million that 
Hispanic Business magazine estimates was spent last year to advertise on 
Spanish-language network television. Although officials say advertising 
revenues and ratings have increased for all three networks, the growth has been 
fastest at Telemundo. 
</P>
<P>
"To some extent, our growth (came) at the expense of Univision," conceded Henry 
R. Silverman, who resigned as president of Telemundo to join the New York 
investment banking firm Blackstone Group on Feb. 2. Silverman also noted that 
because Telemundo's expansion has been financed by a 1987 sale of stock rather 
than bonds, Telemundo, compared to Univision, "has a strong competitive 
advantage on a purely financial basis." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Univision's financial problems, news vice president Martinez said so 
far there has been no belt tightening and the network continues to hire news 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Although Univision officials declined to comment for this story, Univision 
Holdings President J. William Grimes has been quoted as saying he supports such 
heavy program expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertisers tell us they want their ads run in programs that look modern and 
address the needs of the U.S. Hispanic market," Grimes recently told the trade 
magazine Advertising Age. 
</P>
<P>
Many close to Univision, such as Leobardo Estrada, a UCLA professor of urban 
planning who also sits on Univision's 12-member broadcast advisory board, said 
they have also been told by Univision officials that the network will not cut 
back in the face of its financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us they had lower revenue than expected and much higher than 
expected expenditures on equipment and facilities," said Estrada, who attended 
a meeting with Univision officials in December. "But the company did not back 
down to its commitment to improve the quality of programming." 
</P>
<P>
Univision was put together over the past two years as Hallmark and partner 
First Chicago Corp. acquired eight television stations in California, Texas, 
New York, New Mexico and Florida, as well as the Univision network, for about 
$600 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, however, the company took on a huge debt load, totaling $555 
million at the end of last year. Annual debt service totals about $52.2 
million, according to Hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, former Telemundo President Silverman estimates that network's 
debts at about $250 million, of which only about $60 million requires cash 
interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
Univision was finally overwhelmed by its crushing debt on Feb. 1, when it 
failed to make interest payments due on its bonds and bank loans. Because 
Hallmark expects that the defaults will continue without some form of 
reorganization, it has proposed to reduce Univision's debt service by buying 
back its bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But in proposing the plan, Hallmark is driving an unusually hard bargain, 
offering just 40 cents on the dollar for the discount bonds, for which 
investors originally paid almost 67 cents for each dollar of face value. 
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that Hallmark thinks it will be difficult for Univision 
investors to sell their issues for more than that in the depressed $200-billion 
junk bond market, which has become even more chaotic in recent days after the 
collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert. (The acquisition of Univision was financed, 
in part, with junk bonds issued by Drexel.) 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you can put a value on Univision paper outside the context of 
the junk bond market," said Ronald Vannuki, managing director at Drake Capital 
in Santa Monica. "Although the long-term prospects of Spanish-language 
broadcasting are excellent, I'd say (Hallmark's) offer is generous considering 
the state of the junk bond market today." 
</P>
<P>
Hallmark is offering 45 cents on the dollar for Univision's senior subordinated 
discount notes, or a total of about $74 million for the $165 million issue. 
It's offering 30 cents on each dollar for the subordinated debentures, or a 
total of $31.5 million for the $105-million issue. And Hallmark is seeking 
concessions from the bank group headed by Continental Bank Corp. on $315 
million in loans as well as undisclosed concessions from First Chicago, which 
holds a 21.5% stake in Univision. 
</P>
<P>
Although nearly all media -- including newspapers, magazines and broadcasting 
-- are feeling the financial pinch from a recent slowdown in advertising, 
Spanish-language television has been especially hard hit because of advertiser 
resistance in some key categories such as automobile replacement parts, 
cosmetics and children's toys, according to Jack Feuer, editor and publisher of 
U.S. Hispanic Report, a national newsletter on the Latino market. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Feuer believes that advertiser interest will increase and revenue will 
climb once Nielsen and other television ratings services complete installation 
of newer and more accurate TV rating meters in Latino households across the 
United States during the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a bad investment" for 
Hallmark, Feuer said. "If they can hold on for a little while longer, the 
situation should turn out for the better."

VONS' DAVILA PLANS A BIGGER ROLE IN LATINO COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Davila, the Vons supermarket executive catapulted to near-celebrity status 
by his television and radio pitches, now faces one of his trickiest public 
relations jobs yet: He wants to assure people that he isn't being pushed out of 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
The supermarket industry has been rife with speculation over last week's 
announcement that Davila, 58, will take early retirement in April, 1992. 
Davila's associates say he has long made no secret about wanting to retire 
around age 60, but some supermarket industry executives were surprised about 
the speed with which many of his key duties are being given to the company's 
new chief operating officer, Dennis K. Eck. 
</P>
<P>
Davila, who retains the title of Vons Cos. president, acknowledges some concern 
that people will think he was forced to take a demotion. He and others close to 
the company insist that isn't the case. Still, Davila said that sort of false 
impression could undermine his plans to play a bigger role in Los Angeles' 
Latino community upon his retirement and could create the appearance of "a 
void" in that community's business leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been no forcing out or anything else. I'm sure Roger (Vons Chairman 
Roger E. Stangeland) would love me to stay longer," Davila said. 
</P>
<P>
His eventual retirement, Davila added, will be "good for our people . . . I'll 
have more time. I'll be able to do more for the Hispanic community." 
</P>
<P>
For Vons, Davila's image is important, too. Company officials are taking great 
pains to make sure that they don't damage the credibility of a man who has 
become a hugely popular spokesman for their stores and who has agreed to 
continue in that role after retiring. Even since appearing in his well-received 
first commercial about five years ago ("I'm not an actor, I'm a grocer."), 
Davila has personally symbolized Vons in the minds of many shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
But 42 years after starting at Vons as a floor sweeper, East Los Angeles-bred 
William S. Davila says he has come to a point in his life where he wants to 
have more time to devote to social causes. 
</P>
<P>
He said his main goal is to act as a role model to inspire minority youths, and 
he plans to speak at schools and community centers to champion the virtues of 
"education, assuming responsibility and improving one's position in life." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see these values built up in the next generation of people coming 
forward," said Davila, who himself has no college education. 
</P>
<P>
Davila, never before active politically, also said he might want to run for 
public office or, more likely, use his influence to help the candidacies of 
"business-minded" political hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
While Davila maintains his high public profile, Vons officials plan to support 
his image by emphasizing that he will remain on Vons' board and serve as its 
commercial spokesman indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"We are focused on having the public and employees understand why Bill is 
seeking early retirement and that he is continuing (with the company) and that 
it's not a demotion for him," said Mary M. McAboy, Vons' director of investor 
relations and corporate communications. 
</P>
<P>
Some public relations specialists doubt that many customers will even be aware 
that Davila is heading toward retirement. Perhaps more important, they say, 
will be assuring employees that Davila isn't being shoved out the door. 
</P>
<P>
He is well-liked among Vons workers, and is known as an executive who enjoys 
walking the aisles of his stores. Jack Ackroyd, advertising director for Hughes 
Markets, marveled over seeing Davila recently with his sleeves rolled up at a 
Vons store, actually judging a bagging contest rather than "just acting as a 
celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of guy Bill is," Ackroyd said. 
</P>
<P>
To industry executives, the most puzzling part of Vons' management change was 
why Davila's retirement plans were announced two years in advance. Some say the 
retirement announcement, together with Eck assuming responsibility for such 
crucial areas as merchandising and buying, is turning Davila into a lame duck. 
</P>
<P>
Why was it handled that way? "To hire the quality executive we were looking 
for, we needed to be candid about what the opportunity was," Stangeland 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Stangeland said he wanted to ensure an orderly transition and to pave the way 
for Eck, 47, to eventually become Vons' president and, ultimately, its 
chairman. Davila was not regarded as a likely successor to Stangeland, who at 
age 60 is less than two years older than Davila and who has given no sign of 
stepping down soon. 
</P>
<P>
Other industry insiders suggested that Davila has been diverted from his 
administrative duties by his time-consuming role in Vons' advertising campaigns 
and his frequent public speaking engagements. Meanwhile, Vons posted losses of 
$28.1 million over the 40-week period ended Oct. 8, a consequence of the heavy 
debts and complicated logistics of a 1988 deal in which the company acquired 
162 Safeway stores in Southern California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, those developments may have convinced Stangeland that Vons 
needed another top-level executive to run daily operations and hold down costs, 
industry sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Vons executives say they expect Eck, who joined the El Monte-based company as 
vice chairman and chief operating officer, to provide needed expertise in what 
they call the drugstore side of their business. Eck, who quit as vice chairman 
of American Stores to take the Vons job, was executive vice president of 
American's Sav-On Drugs chain in Southern California in 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
Eck also will eventually oversee a stepped-up expansion campaign by Vons. Still 
the No. 1 supermarket chain in Southern California with a market share of 
roughly 25%, Vons opened a relatively scant six new locations last year and is 
expected to open only four more this year while it concentrates on absorbing 
the former Safeway stores. 
</P>
<P>
By 1992, Stangeland said, Vons should be back to opening more than 10 stores a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the few operational responsibilities that Eck won't assume soon are 
marketing and advertising. They will remain Davila's turf -- for good reason, 
industry observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Davila "has a quality that makes him at one with the customers," said Scott A. 
Tagliarino, senior vice president for the Fleishman Hillard public relations 
firm in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was no longer the spokesman," Tagliarino added, "they'd have a hard time 
bringing in someone else who has as much credibility."

India to Ground Airbuses: India will ground its fleet of new A320 airbuses 
while experts study the airworthiness of the planes following the crash of an 
Indian Airlines airbus last week in which 90 people died. Civil Aviation 
Minister Mohammad Arif Khan said technical snags had since been reported with 
other airbuses among the remaining 14 so far delivered to India's domestic 
carrier by the four-nation West European consortium Airbus Industrie. Khan said 
Indian Airlines would suspend further airbus deliveries pending the outcome of 
a preliminary inquiry into the crash.

William J. Crawford said Friday that he will retire as commissioner of the 
California Department of Savings and Loan at the end of April, when he turns 70 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
Though he hasn't handed in his formal resignation yet, he said he has long 
intended to leave at that time and will recommend to Gov. George Deukmejian 
that the agency's reins be turned over to his chief deputy, William D. Davis. 
</P>
<P>
He also told his superiors in the Deukmejian Administration that he plans to 
leave on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody said they wanted me to stay, I might change my mind," Crawford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"But my wife has been waiting five years for me to travel with her, and I don't 
want her to go alone." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, who has operated two S&amp;Ls and sold them, has been the state's top 
thrift regulator for five years. The blunt-talking Newport Beach resident 
became an increasingly tough regulator as he found abuses running rampant at 
several thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, he was moving ahead of federal regulators in enforcing regulations 
against S&amp;Ls, even though he had a small staff and limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
Before federal regulators had acted, for instance, his department imposed a 
series of orders against Ramona Savings &amp; Loan, a defunct thrift in Orange, 
after its owner, John L. Molinaro, took a $2-million dividend in May, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Molinaro and one-time Ramona co-owner Donald C. Mangano were sent to prison 
Wednesday for 12 years and 15 years, respectively, for their convictions on 
fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with the collapse of Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
The sentences are believed to be the stiffest that have ever been handed out in 
California for insider fraud violations. 
</P>
<P>
The state agency also acted before federal regulators in seizing North America 
Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana, an institution that Davis called the worst 
case of insider fraud in state thrift history. Crawford turned it over to 
federal regulators a week later after determining that it had become insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Faye McKinzie, an aide to North America's owner, and others are defending 
themselves in a federal criminal trial in Santa Ana. The owner, Duayne D. 
Christensen, died in a car crash hours before the state agency took over the 
S&amp;L in January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford's luck ran out in the summer of 1987 when he seized Universal Savings 
&amp; Loan in Orange, claiming that it was about to send $10 million in loans 
improperly to the chairman of its parent firm in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the takeover was unprecedented because Universal was a healthy 
S&amp;L. The Australian firm fought back and, within a month, won an 
unprecedented decision reversing the state's action and returning control of 
the S&amp;L to its owner.

Harness-Racing Drivers' Request Rejected: Judge John Davies of U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles denied a request Friday by harness-racing drivers that Los 
Alamitos stop limiting the number of drivers who may race during the track's 
five-month meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Roger Craigo had argued that the track was effectively revoking the 
licenses of the plaintiff drivers by only allowing "popular" drivers with 
winning records to work. (Filed Jan. 24, 1990. Case No. CV90-00357 JGD)

DEALS / ALLAN SLOAN: MARKET WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
THERE ARE PLENTY MORE STILL TRAPPED IN ROACH MOTEL

Just because the world didn't end in a puff of smoke last week when Drexel 
Burnham Lambert went belly-up, you shouldn't make the mistake of thinking that 
things have settled down in the junk bond market. Far from it. There is plenty 
of carnage yet to come. The apparent calm is deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of a collapse wasn't because the market calmly absorbed the bad 
news about Drexel, which invented the modern junk bond market and was then 
consumed by its own creation. The reason the market didn't blow apart is that 
regulators and junk bond holders were trying to keep the market rising by the 
power of talk alone -- and because there weren't very many actual transactions 
taking place. 
</P>
<P>
To understand why things in the junk market are actually worse than they look, 
you have to understand that the junk bond market isn't a real market. At one 
point, when Drexel Burnham and Michael Milken were flying high, parts of the 
market were probably real. But that was a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
In a real market, you can buy or sell sizable blocks of securities at something 
close to the quoted prices. In today's junk market, you can buy as much as you 
want at the quoted prices, or even lower. But except for a few issues -- such 
as some of the bonds issued in the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout last year -- 
it's virtually impossible to sell significant numbers of bonds without driving 
the price way down. And even then, it's iffy. 
</P>
<P>
Think of the junk market as a financial Roach Motel: You can check in, but you 
can't check out. Why has this happened? It's a chicken-and-egg problem. When 
people have faith in the junk market, the market functions, and the fact that 
it functions reinforces the faith. When people lose faith -- which has been the 
case for months -- the market doesn't function. When the market doesn't 
function, no one has faith. 
</P>
<P>
Junk boomed in the early 1980s because Drexel Burnam Lambert, under the 
inspiration of Milken, the now-deposed junk bond king, brought new believers 
into the tent. Before Milken, who in his prime was a marvelous analyst and 
possibly the world's best salesman, junk bonds were shunned as being too risky 
and too tacky for most investors. 
</P>
<P>
But as the gospel according to Milken gained adherents, normally conservative 
investors -- pension funds, traditional insurance firms, mutual fund buyers, 
even the occasional bank trust department -- began putting money into these 
strange, complicated securities. Because the supply of junk buyers expanded 
more quickly than Milken and his imitators at other brokerages could spew out 
more junk, the prices of these securities kept rising. While the occasional 
bond issuer might crater, a mania set in and everyone just had to put junk 
bonds into his or her portfolio or be laughed out of the bars where money 
managers go to drown their sorrows. Unlike the stock market, where brokers 
match sellers and buyers, the bond market is one in which the broker typically 
buys the bonds from you and resells them to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
To make this go smoothly, brokerage houses had to carry very large inventories 
of bonds. They didn't mind doing this, even though they had to borrow billions 
of dollars on a short-term basis to carry the inventory. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty of this, for the brokers, was that the interest rates on the bonds 
they carried in their inventory was higher than the interest rates that the 
brokers paid on their short-term borrowings. What's more, since junk prices 
were heading upward, the value of their inventory rose. A double profit. Pretty 
neat. 
</P>
<P>
But what happens when junk prices begin to head downward? Funny you should ask. 
</P>
<P>
When bonds are heading down, no one dares to hold a lot of them in inventory. 
Even if you are making a spread of four points a year by carrying Texas Air 
notes yielding 15% a year with borrowed money that's costing you 11%, you can 
get killed in an eye blink if the bonds fall five or 10 points in a day, which 
is the kind of thing that's been happening. Because there's not much inventory 
at the brokers, the market gets choppy. When the market gets choppy, everyone 
wants to sell -- but there's no one to sell to. Just as the cycle feeds on 
itself going up, it feeds on itself going down. 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent victim of this downward death spiral is Drexel itself. One 
of the major reasons the firm went busto is that the value of its bond 
inventory rotted out and nervous lenders cut off credit. Even though Drexel 
tried to protect itself by cutting down its inventory, it got killed anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The current collapse of junk prices was started last summer when Integrated 
Resources, one of Drexel's stranger creatures, announced out of the blue that 
it was defaulting on its debts. It seemed only fitting that Drexel and 
Integrated -- the creator and the creation -- filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
petitions the same day. 
</P>
<P>
The fall of Drexel and Integrated is part of a historical process. The junk 
bond explosion of the 1980s is being replaced by the junk bond implosion of the 
1990s, as the market collapses in on itself. Unless you are a professional 
willing to spend a lot of time and take a lot of risk, you will do well to take 
your money off the table and go home. Some junk bonds may, in fact, be so cheap 
that they're bargains now. But if history is a guide, they'll be a lot cheaper 
a year from now.

Have trouble picking stocks? Try looking for a mutual fund. The choices are 
dizzying. 
</P>
<P>
There's stock, bond, growth, global, flexible, balanced, convertible and mixed 
funds -- to name a few. There are loads, no loads, high fees and low fees. In 
fact, there are twice as many mutual funds as companies listed on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprising, there is also a wide variety of measures to gauge mutual fund 
performance. And a plethora of publications trying to help investors sort it 
all out. 
</P>
<P>
"With the proliferation of mutual funds, we've seen a proliferation of 
newsletters and services that purport to follow the funds and advise investors 
as to which funds they should consider," said Patricia Harden, spokeswoman for 
Fidelity Investments, one of the nation's largest mutual fund companies. Do 
they work? "Yes and no," Harden said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, investors have been barraged with several more -- from 
Business Week's two-part series to Forbes' expansive tome, as well as rankings 
by Lipper Analytical Services, which are published quarterly in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
But these rankings and ratings may just add to the confusion because few 
consider the same funds to be top-notch. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, most of the services are quite accurate," said A. Michael Lipper, 
president of Lipper Analytical Services in New York, which tracks mutual fund 
performance. "The differences are not mistakes but different measurement 
techniques." 
</P>
<P>
Business Week tries to account for risk, while Forbes looks at performance in 
down markets. And The Times simply publishes rankings of total return over 
specific periods of time. Other services weigh in a wide variety of measures, 
including fund size and liquidity. 
</P>
<P>
But even when rankings do agree, experts say it is not always advisable to pick 
last quarter's or last year's top performer. 
</P>
<P>
"It is probably wrong to pick the short-term top performer, because they rarely 
repeat over a short period of time." said Ken Waggoner, spokesman for T. Rowe 
Price Associates in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
So how does one choose? 
</P>
<P>
First, investors must answer a raft of personal questions, starting with their 
age, affluence and willingness to take risks, said William E. Donoghue, 
publisher of Donoghue's Moneyletter, a newsletter on choosing mutual funds. 
They also have to decide whether they want to make investment decisions 
themselves -- and possibly save commissions and fees by buying into a no-load 
fund -- or whether they are willing to pay more for the counsel of a financial 
planner or broker. Finally, they must determine whether this is a short-term or 
a long-term investment, and whether they plan to watch it closely. 
</P>
<P>
Watching long-term investments on a day-to-day basis is a big mistake because 
sometimes investors panic and sell at the wrong time, "turning what might be a 
brilliant long-term decision into a disastrous short-term investment," Lipper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Then it's time to look at the rankings and ratings. The two differ because the 
first simply reports yields, while the other tries to factor in additional 
information, such as risks, liquidity, investment objectives and the like. 
</P>
<P>
The rankings are helpful because they provide a simple, objective measure of a 
fund's return over specific periods of time. Firms such as Lipper report these 
yields over periods as short as a week and as long as 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Others try to qualify the numbers by looking at additional measures to 
determine overall performance. 
</P>
<P>
The recent Business Week rating, for example, assesses risks by weighing in the 
volatility of the funds' investments. Business Week, consequently, recommends 
some lower-yielding funds because they are considered low risk. 
</P>
<P>
Still, experts acknowledge that the risk formula is flawed in that it can only 
track volatility as a proxy for risk. It cannot weigh the less quantifiable 
dangers in the underlying portfolio. Consequently, junk bond funds may come out 
as "low-risk" ventures because their returns were relatively stable until 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Forbes ranks funds by total annual yields, but it also grades them 
on their performance during good times and bad. Some of the top-yielding funds 
-- such as the US Gold Shares fund -- got "D" ratings during both good and bad 
market cycles, Forbes reported. 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as the Mexico Fund, did spectacularly well during up markets but 
relatively poorly when the market soured. And the Strategic Investments Fund 
got an "F" for its performance during good markets and a "D" for bad. How it 
become one of the top yielders on Forbes' Feb. 5 listing is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
RATING THE MUTUAL FUNDS 
</P>
<P>
The top-performing funds and their rate of return according to three recent 
surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Lipper and Forbes returns are for 1989. Business Week lists average.

ARCHITECTURE: THE LANDSCAPE AS A PARABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid the din of traffic and buzz of busy sidewalks, landscape architects Pamela 
Burton and Katherine Spitz take refuge in the tranquillity of a tiny downtown 
park they designed on Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
"In this very urban space we've called upon metaphor, narrative and journey to 
evoke a special sense of place," Burton says. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, this new vest-pocket park, named the Broadway Spring Center, 
celebrates Biddy Mason, a nurse, midwife and former slave who, a century ago, 
opened a refuge for black families at this location. A mural at the park's 
entrance memorializes Mason's long and charitable life. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, because the graceful 1893 Bradbury Building backs onto the park, 
this urban space evokes the memory of Spring Street and Broadway in their 
social and commercial glory in the first decades of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Predating the architecture and the street itself is the recollection of the 
country lane in the midst of a cow pasture that later became Spring Street, 
once Los Angeles' main financial thoroughfare. Burton explains that the grove 
of camphor trees in the center of the park "narrates" the site's country lane 
origins. 
</P>
<P>
A fountain -- composed of a series of pipes constructed of copper, stainless 
steel and concrete -- mimics the profile of an oil refinery, a metaphor for the 
industries that funded the city's early prosperity. The present is represented 
by the small retail outlets lining the park, businesses that represent 
Broadway's resurgence as a commercial hub, this time serving Los Angeles' 
Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Their imaginative emphasis on metaphor, narrative and journey has placed Burton 
and Spitz among the leaders of a new wave of younger designers who are 
rethinking the role of landscape architecture in relation to the city. From 
their small office in a brick building in the industrial section of Santa 
Monica, the two women have collaborated with some of Southern California's most 
avant-garde architects. 
</P>
<P>
Morphosis' Thom Mayne says he "likes the way Burton and Spitz deal with 
landscape as a set of emotional and intellectual ideas. They're are no longer 
mere pretty horticulturists supplying plants, but actual conceptualizers of the 
urban scene, and their concepts are deeply poetic, like the best architecture. 
Since both Pamela and Kathy were trained as architects as well as landscape 
designers, they understand how we think and so can integrate their ideas 
seamlessly with ours." 
</P>
<P>
The architects at Morphosis collaborated with Burton and Spitz on the winning 
entry for the Performing Arts Pavilion in the proposed Arts Park in the 
Sepulveda Basin. The plans call for most of the complex to be underground, "to 
preserve the integrity of the surface plane and honor the urban grid that 
dominates the Valley," Mayne said. 
</P>
<P>
Working with Barton Myers Associates in the design of the Cerritos Community 
Arts Center, Burton and Spitz helped knit the architecture with its 
surroundings by creating "outdoor rooms" such as an Actors' Garden, which 
expresses its dramatic metaphor in a symbolic "tragic" weeping willow and a 
"comic" monkey puzzle tree. 
</P>
<P>
"Burton and Spitz create landscapes as parables," said BMA principal Jonathan 
Hankin. "Their depth of thought is wonderful and adds great resonance to the 
architecture." 
</P>
<P>
For their entry in the Napa Valley Domaine Clos Pegase Winery competition, with 
architect Robert Mangurian and sculptor James Turrell, Burton and Spitz devised 
a Garden of Seven Mysteries that included a "Devil's Chase" and several "Spirit 
Mounds." The purpose of these landscape elements was "to symbolize the 
transition between day-to-day consciousness and the states of dreams, 
disturbances and ecstasies that wine provokes," according to the text that 
accompanied their submission. 
</P>
<P>
Trained as a painter before she became an architect and then a landscape 
architect, Spitz is accustomed to the use of visual metaphors. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to ask, 'What are our myths?' That is always the first question," she 
said. "In Los Angeles we have the myth of the wilderness fused with an overlay 
of settlement expressed in landscape patterns imported from Spain, Italy, 
England and Japan. We have to experiment with the tensions this juxtaposition 
generates, and feel our way through at last to a truly local urban tradition. 
Developing our own landscape is vital to creating our own sense of identity in 
this strange and unique environment." 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately enough, Spitz first met Burton in Pistoia, Italy's nursery-garden 
capital. A native New Yorker, Spitz had worked in a Los Angeles plant nursery 
while still a student. Burton, who was born in Santa Monica but grew up in the 
Bay Area, was employed by Frank Gehry as a model builder before she qualified 
as an architect (and later a landscape architect), and these varied backgrounds 
seemed to both partners to mesh perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
"We love working together, though we often disagree vehemently to the point of 
verbally duking it out," Spitz said. "Pamela provokes the confrontation, while 
my way is to sulk. It's a great way to get on." 
</P>
<P>
Burton and Spitz are in total agreement about the need to develop a truly local 
landscape philosophy for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
They say that three main principles should form the basis of this regional 
philosophy: appropriateness; a vision of landscape as a true form of 
architecture, and an appreciation of the symbolic value of plants. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriateness demands that local landscape, now dominated by a "salad" of 
imported varieties from all over the world, should shift to patterns based on 
the region's native chaparral such as the manzanita and native live oak. As a 
form of architecture, landscape should be used to define spaces and knit 
buildings to the terrain to provide "direction, function and aesthetic 
pleasure." And as an appreciation of the symbolic value of plants, horticulture 
should be linked to its history, including its ancient or contemporary 
mythologies. 
</P>
<P>
"By consciously calling upon these symbolic values," Burton said, "landscapes 
can work at conceptual and metaphoric levels as well as the purely 
horticultural." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles' fragmented urban sprawl Burton and Spitz perceive an urgent 
need to "reinforce connections." They suggest that major boulevards, such as 
Olympic, should be developed as linear gardens scaled to the movement of cars. 
"The automobile is a permanent part of our urban landscape, and has played a 
major role in giving shape to the city," Spitz said. "Yet few landscape 
architects have given thought to the ways in which we can make the experience 
of motoring through the city more pleasurable while taming the car and tuning 
it into the visual rhythms of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Such linear gardens need to be varied, the designers explain. Our endless 
boulevards pass through many different districts, and each stretch should be 
keyed to the character of its surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Burton points to the section of San Vicente Boulevard that runs 
through Brentwood, marked by a central median planted with South African coral 
trees. She suggests that, by these distinctions, motorists as well as 
pedestrians are made aware of the contrasts between one part of town and 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying such specific concepts, Burton and Spitz sense an urgent need to use 
landscape as a means to create a sense of comfort and meaning amid the stress 
and confusion of a modern metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
They quote UC Berkeley urban sociologist Clare Cooper Marcus to express the 
core of their philosophy: "Under the inexorable march of technology and urban 
growth, and the increasing sense of insecurity these advances bring in their 
wake, people yearn for a place to call home in a world in which almost everyone 
is in a sense homeless."

COMING-OUT PARTIES FOR TWO MAGAZINES;

REVIEWS ARE IN AT TIME'S BASH LAUNCHING EW 
</P>

What does it take to launch a new national magazine? Investors. A distributor. 
Lots of presold ads. A writer or two. Oh, yes, and a launch party, the kind 
with a catered buffet, guests to be impressed and napkins and match books with 
the magazine's name engraved on them. 
</P>
<P>
That was the scene Thursday night, when Time Inc. introduced its new 
Entertainment Weekly, a publication devoted to brief and beyond-brief reviews 
of movies, TV shows, recordings and books. Two and a half years in the making, 
EW is a multimillion-dollar gamble founded upon editor Jeff Jarvis' 
journalistic credo, put forth in his first editor's note: "Short is fine." 
</P>
<P>
The guests at the kickoff included local media types come to check out the 
competition, as well as the usual have-food-will-travel party hangers-on. 
Someone inventive slung fluorescent plastic Slinkies from the ceiling for 
decor, and video monitors around the club bore a mysterious Big 
Brother-meets-Moon Zappa legend, "Kick back. Chill out. Hang loose. Have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Party buzz reported one teensy problem so far: EW inadvertently miffed the 
powerful Disney Corp. this week with its less than flattering placement of a 
full-page ad for the studio's upcoming summer extravaganza, "Dick Tracy." (Dick 
was relegated to a lowly page somewhere in the back.) That morning, Disney 
sources were reportedly unhappy about the magazine's gaffe, and a Disney 
employee at the party confirmed that "the office is pretty ticked off" -- only 
she didn't say ticked. 
</P>
<P>
Guests received complimentary copies of Volume 1, Issue 1, with country singer 
k.d. lang grinning on the cover. The lack of a star turnout seemed strange at a 
Hollywood affair, but the magazine had opted to fete its advertisers rather 
than a bunch of freeloading celebrities -- even preferring, it appeared, to 
feed a bunch of freeloading free-lance writers. 
</P>
<P>
And publisher Michael Klingensmith went a long way toward assuaging any 
celebrity withdrawal symptoms when he announced, "In the grand tradition of 
Time and Time Inc., the bar is open." Now that was a journalistic philosophy 
everyone seemed to salute.

FORBES HATCHES HIS NEW EGG AND CELEBRATES IN L. A.

The East Coast media Establishment met West Coast club trendies at a launch 
party for Egg magazine, that wider-than-it-is-long publication with the odd 
name brought to you by Mr. Moneybags himself, Malcolm Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes and his minions presided over a fete Friday night at Arena, the latest 
club happening from club happening veterans April and Christian. It was 
probably the only launch party/club launch ever with a receiving line. First in 
line was Malcolm and son Tim (with wife Anne), who offered handshakes and 
smiled identical smiles while wearing uptight suits and ties. Malcolm, we know 
you have some black leather jackets in your closet. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, it was night life as usual, with oval bar, really loud house music 
and a crowd that looked like leftover extras from "Slaves of New York." 
</P>
<P>
The Slaves of L.A. were an eclectic group, including Faith Ford and husband 
Robert Nottingham, Robert Townsend with Charlayne Woodard, artist Andre 
Miripolsky (still handing out those "Fear No Art buttons"), Allee Willis, 
"thirtysomethingers" Polly Draper and Melanie Mayron, public access star Mr. 
Pete with Maggs, actor Charles Busch (his show, "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom," is 
coming to L.A.), Burt Sugarman and wife Mary Hart (her gams adorn the premiere 
issue cover), Hollywood Kids Lance and John, Mary Crosby, Barry Krost, Dolph 
Lundgren, plus Egg editor Hal Rubenstein and West Coast editor Jeff Yarbrough. 
</P>
<P>
One woman was thrilled to see actress Julie Newmar, otherwise known as 
Catwoman. "I couldn't believe it," she said. "I said to the man standing next 
to me, 'Gosh, I thought she was dead.' And it turned out he was her publicist." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Busch perused his own spread in Egg titled "The Guys in the Freudian 
Slips," in which editor Hal Rubenstein chatted with three men who are the toast 
of New York theater, appearing on stage as women. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank god, some of this stuff got edited out," said Busch with a relieved 
sigh. 
</P>
<P>
At the coat check, one guest was distressed to find that her wrap had been hung 
on a wire hanger. "Wire hanger?" she said, eyebrows arched. "Don't worry," said 
the man behind the counter. "Joan Crawford is dead."

Broadcasting its new position as a socially and politically concerned 
organization, the College Art Assn. capped its 1990 conference with a 
provocative speech by Los Angeles artist June Wayne and granted all but one of 
its annual awards to women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference last week brought about 6,000 artists, art historians, 
curators and other art professionals to New York, where they attended more than 
100 programs and panels, participated in an employment market and visited art 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne, a longtime political activist who was introduced as "the conscience of 
the art world," drew frequent applause and a standing ovation when she 
delivered the keynote address last Friday night at the CAA's convocation at the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art. Talking about recent controversies on censorship 
and government funding of art, Wayne skewered Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) as a 
"demagogue on a rampage," but noted that his conservative views are far from 
unique in the 20th Century.

"During the last 40 years, I have seen many epidemics of artist-baiting. They 
tend to peak around election time. The names keep changing like flu viruses. As 
one who takes her flu shots every year, I am interested in immunity, not 
aspirin," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne warned her audience against compromising on issues that affect artists 
and cited two precedents. One occurred in 1969 hearings of the Senate Finance 
Committee, when visual artists organizations "traded away the right of artists 
to tax-deduct the market value of their gifts to museums in return for 
continuing deductibility for art collectors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"That precedent resulted in the eventual loss of all market-value deductibility 
of art gifts in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Now that collectors compare their 
profit at auction to the cost of philanthropy, the national patrimony comes up 
short," Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
Another compromise took place in 1965 with the creation of the national 
endowments for the arts and humanities. The endowments could have followed the 
autonomous, permanent model of the National Science Foundation, she said, but 
artists settled for the temporary, renewable endowments that have been under 
attack and are now subject to increasing layers of review. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne advocated restructuring the endowments into "The National Foundation of 
Arts and Humanities, with an independent board to interface with Congress and 
the White House as is the case for science," and securing "a Cabinet seat for 
the arts and humanities to make them integral to the interest of the nation." 
She also said that every art museum should have an effective artists' 
representative on its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging Helms' argument that taxpayers should not be forced to pay for art 
that might be deemed offensive, Wayne noted his support of far more costly 
tobacco subsidies, which "the majority of taxpayers oppose." 
</P>
<P>
"What work of art can boast of killing even one human being, let alone 390,000 
Americans dead of cigarette-related diseases in 1988?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne also found it ludicrous that a few "objectionable" artworks, such as the 
late Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs, could cause a storm of 
protest and even splinter the art community when far more serious problems are 
constantly in the news. 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't Washington know that the American people have seen Jimmy Swaggart, the 
Bakkers, the HUD hearings, the savings and loan scandals, the homeless, the 
crack babies, the crime on the streets? What photograph, sculpture or painting 
can shock anyone who has been conscious during these last 20 years?" she asked. 
The audience answered with thunderous applause. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the program, an awards ceremony honored achievements of artists and 
art historians. The awards reflected the 1990 conference's focus on social 
issues. The formerly staid CAA now attempts to serve the needs of a broad 
constituency and to extend the study of art history beyond the traditional high 
culture of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Three black artists were among honorees at the Friday night program. Jacob 
Lawrence, a widely exhibited painter and a child of the Harlem Renaissance, won 
the Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Howardina Pindell, a professor at the State University of New York at Stony 
Brook and an artist whose work often addresses Third World problems, was 
granted the Artist Award for a Distinguished Body of Work. The Distinguished 
Teaching Art Award went to printmaker Robert Blackburn, who has taught art for 
40 years at Cooper Union, New York University, Columbia University and the 
Maryland Institute of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Critic Douglas Crimp presented the Frank Jewett Mather Award for criticism to 
Martha Gever and Jan Zita Grover, who have written about AIDS and homosexuality 
in small independent journals. In citing two critics instead of the customary 
one, Crimp (who won the award last year) said "It doesn't take two women to 
equal one man" but that the honors were overdue because they were the first 
Mather awards to go to women in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
He also said it was appropriate for "two open lesbian critics" to be honored at 
a time when homoerotic art has been equated with obscenity and an exhibition 
about AIDS, at Artists Space in New York, came under attack because it was 
supported by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Three of CAA's annual awards honored writers and publications. "Rembrandt's 
Enterprise: The Studio and the Market," Svetlana Alpers' revisionist treatment 
of a celebrated master in his social and economic context, won the Charles 
Rufus Morey Book Award. 
</P>
<P>
Following more traditional lines of art history awards, Lynn Jacobs captured 
the Arthur Kingsley Porter Prize for her article on South Netherlandish carved 
altar pieces, published by CAA in "The Art Bulletin." "Painting in Renaissance 
Siena: 1430-1500," by Keith Christiansen, Lawrence B. Kanter and Carl Brandon 
Strehlke, won the Alfred H. Barr Jr. Award for an exhibition catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Awards also went to Anne Coffin Hanson and Hollis Clayson for Distinguished 
Teaching of Art History.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost every morning since the tanker American Trader poured 394,000 gallons of 
crude petroleum into the sea, Kennon Cory has gone to the Bolsa Chica wetlands 
to sit among the thickets of pickle weed and look for oil-soaked birds. 
</P>
<P>
Since he was a child, Cory has been drawn to the quiet of this marshy expanse 
where scores of rare and migratory waterfowl have found sanctuary in an urban 
landscape. Protected pockets of nature like Bolsa Chica and Upper Newport Bay 
shaped Cory's interests -- and future. 
</P>
<P>
Now a graduate student studying ornithology, Cory hurried back to Bolsa Chica 
after the Feb. 7 spill to patrol with binoculars the mud flats and tiny nesting 
islands for incoming grebes, Forster's terns and willets coated with blackish 
goo from the offshore slick. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very sad that these areas, already under such stress, face this kind of 
threat," said the Cal State Long Beach student. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, the wetlands at Bolsa Chica -- like those near Seal Beach, the Santa 
Ana River mouth and Upper Newport Bay -- have not been seriously damaged by the 
Alaskan crude that blackened miles of shoreline. The timing of the spill, 
Mother Nature and cleanup efforts have combined to minimize the damage 
inflicted on the wetlands, tide pools and marine life. 
</P>
<P>
But any appreciable oil is a serious threat to Orange County's fragile and 
dwindling wildlife resources. And many naturalists, biologists, bird watchers 
and fishermen bristle at suggestions that the environmental threat in Orange 
County has been exaggerated, that it pales by comparison to the 
11.2-million-gallon Alaskan oil spill of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife refuges in the county are measured in acres, not miles. And various 
bird species and marine mammals that live here number in the hundreds, not 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
What natural and protected areas do exist on the county's coast are critical, 
experts say, because much of the shoreline has been developed or dedicated to 
high-intensity recreation. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me so mad when they compare this to Alaska," said Marielle Leeds, an 
environmental activist from Laguna Beach. "A few hundred birds here is like 
thousands of birds up there because that's all we've got. . . . We're getting 
attacked from all sides -- sewage, oil, malathion spraying and development." 
</P>
<P>
It is too early to assess the long-term consequences of the spill, biologists 
say. And perhaps, when all is said and done, the spill may prove to be only a 
short-term setback for the birds and marine mammals that frequent local 
estuaries and coastal waters. But some observers contend that the noxious oil 
came close to destroying what precious little contact Orange County has with a 
rich natural world of organisms and wildlife that inhabit local wetlands, tide 
pools and kelp beds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Years to Dissipate 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Michel, a science adviser to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, said it takes one to three years for the effects of an oil 
spill to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, humans as well as birds and marine animals will have to contend 
with oil on the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
For example, oil that washed ashore has seeped as deep as three feet into the 
sand in some areas, according to cleanup officials. As the hot sun heats the 
sand, the oil will percolate to the surface as tiny pools of fresh tar, meaning 
thousands of beach-goers who flock each summer to Newport Beach and Huntington 
Beach may have to watch their step on the sand. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as people start lying on the beach, they're going to find out, because 
their skin will burn," said businessman Jerry Rusher, who specializes in oil 
cleanup products. 
</P>
<P>
Swimmers and surfers may have to contend with swirling pools of foamy oil sheen 
for weeks, although much of the brownish muck should be gone by summer. City 
officials in Newport are worried about beach erosion because so much of the 
oil-soaked sand is being hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are also concerned about what lives under the sand now laced 
with North Slope crude. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a whole world of organisms that live in the intertidal zone that are 
going to be affected as oil washes up on the beach," said Dorothy Green of Heal 
the Bay, a Santa Monica-based environmental group. "Just think of where the 
shore birds usually are, following the waves in and out and poking at the 
beach. Those birds are feeding on those organisms." 
</P>
<P>
The primary concern, however, remains the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of the wetlands that were here (historically) are gone, and 
they're gone forever," said Pat Baird, an ornithologist at Cal State Long 
Beach. "If you keep chipping away at habitats, with pollutions, with oil spills 
. . . there's just so much these birds can take." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gordon Smith, chairman of the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy: 
"Biologists consider the wetlands to be the most productive ecosystems on 
earth. . . . Coastal property is so valuable, conservationists are fighting to 
preserve every square foot. Any damage is critical." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breeding Concerns 
</P>
<P>
In the initial hours of the spill, state fish and game officials focused on 
stopping the slick from reaching entrances to wetland areas. Dozens of 
migrating waterfowl inhabit the estuaries, including the endangered California 
least tern, a gull-like bird that nests on the sandy islands. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the spill did not occur during the spring, the height of the 
breeding season for the least tern and most other birds. Studies show that 
birds ingesting even a small amount of oil may suffer reproductive problems. 
Because most sea birds produce only a small number of chicks -- only one per 
season for some species -- any impact on the breeding rate could have long-term 
consequences. It could prove disastrous for an endangered species like the 
least tern. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of feet of protective boom eventually safeguarded Anaheim Bay, which 
leads to the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge and the Bolsa Chica Ecological 
Reserve. Newport Harbor also was closed with a series of booms -- floats with 
mesh skirts attached -- to keep tainted seawater from filtering into Upper 
Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
At the Santa Ana River mouth, surging tides breached several booms at one 
stage, prompting officials to erect earthen dikes to stave off the frothy goo 
that lapped within a few hundred feet of the newly restored Huntington Beach 
wetlands -- a success story in the long, sad decay and disappearance of 
saltwater marshes. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the 25-acre plot was neglected, but last year enough money had been 
raised to reclaim the wetlands. Thus, when the spill's leading edge threatened 
the area, wildlife biologists, county officials and members of a private 
conservancy banded together to build berms and dikes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have worked too long to get this far, and we're determined not to lose 
this," said Smith, who spent several sleepless nights monitoring the oil 
slick's movement in the river mouth near the wetlands. "We want this to be a 
place where the sound of birds can be heard again, where people can appreciate 
what was once a common sight on our coast." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to defend the landlocked estuaries generally succeeded as the bulk of 
oil from the American Trader washed up on the broad sandy beaches of Huntington 
and Newport. In fact, cleanup officials and some environmentalists cheered the 
arrival of the lava-like crude on the beaches, contending that it is easier to 
capture on the flat sand than at sea, or worse yet, to the south in the craggy 
rocks and coves of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tide Pool Peril 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, a thin brown residue from the dissipating slick worked its way 
into the rocky tide pools that dot Crystal Cove State Park south of Corona del 
Mar. Teeming with sea stars, urchins, anemones and crabs, the tide pools are a 
magnet for wide-eyed schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the richest environments to observe, and it's one that holds an 
inherent interest for children," said Harry Helling, director of education at 
the Orange County Marine Institute in Dana Point. "All the animals have such 
strange adaptations that it's a wonderful lesson in life forms." 
</P>
<P>
In the shallow waters just offshore from Crystal Cove, scores of skin divers 
often probe the fish-filled kelp forests which are part of a 1,000-acre 
undersea reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"At times, diving off Crystal Cove is like diving into an aquarium," said Frank 
Wilton, a La Habra electrician who has dived off the Laguna coast for nearly 
two decades. "The giant kelp lures in all kinds of fish and creatures. The 
bottom has abalone, crabs and occasionally a lobster or two." 
</P>
<P>
The ocean and tide pools were posted off-limits over the weekend as dozens of 
cleanup workers in yellow slickers battled wind and rain to remove the filmy 
sheen from the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Scouring oil from rocky coastline, such as that in Alaska's Prince William 
Sound, is far more difficult than extracting oil from the kinds of sandy 
beaches that have so far been blackened in Orange County. Fortunately, the oil 
washing up near Corona del Mar and as far south as Emerald Bay in north Laguna 
was not the thick ugly crude that was six inches deep along stretches of 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
However, Helling expressed concern about the long-term effect of the spill on 
intertidal areas like Crystal Cove. Tide pools in Orange County -- already 
impacted by human trampling and pollution -- support as little as half to 
two-thirds the number of species as those in the more remote Channel Islands 
near Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tide pools, even here in Dana Point, are not in full, pristine condition 
to begin with. If you start looking at the full impact of an oil spill in the 
intertidal (zone), nobody knows the long-term picture," biologist Helling said. 
"I would say that the subtle impacts of this could go on for months afterward, 
at least." 
</P>
<P>
To assess the oil's impact at Crystal Cove, state officials said, monthly or 
bimonthly surveys of marine and plant life will begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The kelp -- a hearty, fast-growing sea plant -- is not expected to be adversely 
impacted. Visible from Corona del Mar south to Dana Point, the large, thick 
beds of brown kelp have adapted to increasing levels of ocean pollution, marine 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects for marine mammals are less certain. Dennis Kelly, a marine 
biologist at Orange Coast College, said the bodies of several sea lions have 
washed ashore in 
</P>
<P>
recent days, but so far none apparently died as a result of the oil spill. 
Kelly is more concerned about the long-term impact on dolphins, often seen off 
the Orange County coast. 
</P>
<P>
"I've received reports of at least 10 sightings of dolphins in the slicks," 
said Kelley, who has studied the mammal in local waters for more than a decade 
and wants to establish a dolphin research center in Anaheim Bay. He said that 
if the dolphins ingest too much oil by feeding on contaminated sea life, their 
livers might stop functioning. 
</P>
<P>
"In time we might see a lot of dead dolphins," he said. "We just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the level of exposure, clams and mussels may also become 
contaminated from the spill, based on studies of shellfish following the Valdez 
spill in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The most visible victims of the spill have been the birds, which have been 
found injured or dead from Long Beach to south Laguna. More than 360 waterfowl 
have been treated, and several dozen have been released back into the wild. 
However, another 299 have died, including 15 brown pelicans, an endangered 
species, and experts say several hundred more birds may never be found. 
</P>
<P>
How will the Orange County spill effect local shore birds in the future? 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what's going to happen," said Marge Gibson, director of the Bird 
of Prey center in Villa Park and a wild bird rehabilitation specialist who 
spent several months in Alaska monitoring bald eagles after the Valdez spill. 
"It sometimes takes several years (for problems) to show up." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Anderson, director of the Long Beach-based Southern California Coastal 
Water Research Project, said the spill should have no lasting impact on the 
food chain. 
</P>
<P>
But Pat Baird at Long Beach State is not convinced, saying it's too early to 
draw any firm conclusions. "It's just like caffeine. Fifty percent of the 
people say that it hurts you, the rest say that it doesn't." 
</P>

Threatened: Orange County Coastal Habitats 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife in the aquatic habitats along Orange County's coast, already suffering 
from development and other human activities, must now cope with the effects of 
the 394,000-gallon oil spill from the ruptured tanker American Trader. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wetlands 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's most significant wildlife resources are its coastal estuaries, 
rich habitats that support a variety of marsh and shore birds. Wetlands near 
Seal Beach, at Bolsa Chica and near the Santa Ana River mouth and in Upper 
Newport Bay are important for scores of migrating waterfowl. Much of the spill 
containment effort was directed at keeping oil out of these areas. Among the 
endangered species mating in local wetlands is the light-footed clapper rail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shoreline 
</P>
<P>
Much of the oil washed upon the sandy beaches of Huntington and Newport, where 
it can be mopped up relatively easily and where damage to wildlife was 
apparently mininmal. However, there is concern about microscopic bacteria and 
protozoa in the sand that provide food for larger invertebrates, which in turn 
are eaten by sasnderlings and other shore birds. Grunion came ashore ahead of 
schedule last week to lay their eggs and died in the oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tide Pools 
</P>
<P>
With their rough, rocky surfaces, tide pools are much tougher to clean than 
sandy beaches. Also, they support a wider variety of life: about 200 species in 
local pools, from octopuses to sea stars. Tide pools are a popular destination 
for school field trips. Some of the county's richest, in Crystal Cove State 
Park on the Irvine Coast, were fouled by oil from the spill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coastal Waters 
</P>
<P>
Most of the wildlife affected by the oil as it drifted on the open waters in 
the first few days after the spill were birds. S ome birds, such as surf 
scoters and Western grebes, were vulnerable because they spend much of their 
time floating on the surface of the water; others,such as the endangered brown 
pelican, were slicked when they dived in after fish. Some of the oil may have 
settled to the bottom sediments, where it could affect such bottom-dwelling 
fish as halibut. Long-term effects on local marine mammals, meanwhile, are 
difficult to predict.

SPILL CLEANUP FOCUSES ON DETAILS, STORM DEBRIS

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Efforts to mop up the oil spill that smudged nearly 20 miles of Orange County's 
coast began to wind down Sunday as rain-soaked work crews turned their 
attention to scrubbing seaside boulders and gathering oil-stained flotsam 
driven ashore by the weekend's storm. 
</P>
<P>
While rains hindered the cleanup, heavy surf whipped up by the storm appeared 
to help scour oil from jetties and rock formations along the coast, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still a bit of work to do, but we're out of that high-pressure, 
high-impact phase and into the more detailed work," said Chief Warrant Officer 
Dan Dwell, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, some oil washed ashore in a foamy film, but workers were 
mostly finding tar balls no bigger than jelly beans along scattered stretches 
of the coast. The crews also busied themselves gathering branches and other 
debris, piling it into huge mounds that gave the beaches the look of hayfields. 
</P>
<P>
Booms that had been tattered by the weekend storm were put back in place or 
replaced on the Newport Harbor entrance and Santa Ana River mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Bay was expected to open today, but with a boom gate at its entrance 
that a skiff will open to allow individual vessels through. Authorities, 
however, decided Sunday to postpone rebuilding a sand berm on the mouth of the 
rain-swollen Santa Ana river. 
</P>
<P>
Beaches from Newport Beach through Bolsa Chica remained closed because of the 
spill. As cleanup work continued, the oil tanker American Trader, which spilled 
394,000 gallons of crude oil Feb. 7 when it impaled itself on its anchor while 
attempting to moor off Huntington Beach, steamed out of the Port of Long Beach 
late Sunday afternoon and headed to a San Francisco shipyard for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials gave the ship permission to head to the Southwest Marine 
shipyard after inspecting a temporary, concrete patch fitted over two holes in 
the craft's hull. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coast Guard officials continued to puzzle Sunday over a mysterious 
oil sheen that washed ashore during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard investigators have yet to determine the origin of the latest oil 
sheen, which appeared different than that of the crude that gushed from the 
American Trader. Officials also suspected that the sheen might be from a 
different source because the tanker's crude had been drifting south, while this 
oil came ashore farther to the north. 
</P>
<P>
The mess left by the sheen along a milelong section of Bolsa Chica State Beach 
was cleaned up by Sunday afternoon. Several samples of the oil were dispatched 
to the Coast Guard Oil Identification Laboratory in Groton, Conn., to determine 
whether it matched the oil spilled by the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Dwell said there is speculation that the source of the latest sheen may have 
been a small leak from one of the oil rigs off Huntington Beach or a spill from 
a tanker pumping its bilges. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays said he was troubled by such a 
possibility, saying he hopes "someone didn't take advantage of this situation." 
</P>
<P>
Mays flew over the remnants of the American Trader spill Sunday and said he saw 
only a few oily patches and scattered sections of sheen in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
But Mays said he is particularly eager to ensure that crews mop up any oil and 
tar that has percolated into the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Webster, a spokesman for British Petroleum, said that cleanup officials 
"don't anticipate much under the surface" but acknowledged that crews have 
found "a few locations" where oil has been found up to six inches below the 
beach surface. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, teams were taking core samples at regular intervals along a 14-mile 
stretch of beachfront from Newport Beach to Bolsa Chica to assess how much oil 
has seeped below. When the extent of the problem is determined, British 
Petroleum will either clean the sand or replace it, officials with the company 
said.

As the extent of oil washing up on beaches declined in recent days, the number 
of cleanup workers also was reduced. On Sunday, 320 workers patrolled the 
shoreline, down from 470 on Saturday and 635 Friday. At the peak of the cleanup 
last week, more than 1,400 workers were deployed. 
</P>
<P>
Webster said that the crew is expected to be down to about 100 workers later 
this week but that when the mop-up is concluded, British Petroleum will keep an 
oil cleanup firm on standby in case of new problems. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the focus now will shift to removing oil from breakwaters, jetties and 
other rock formations along the coast. Although steam was used to clean rocks 
in Alaska fouled by the Exxon Valdez spill, that tactic has been rejected for 
Orange County because of fears that it would kill sea creatures lurking among 
the boulders, Newport Fire Capt. Ray Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, authorities are trying to use saltwater heated to 82 degrees, hoping 
it will melt the oil while not harming mussels and other marine life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday afternoon, 299 birds had been reported dead from the spill, and 
another 425 were found alive but covered with oil. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the second dead dolphin in two days washed ashore Sunday, reviving 
concerns about the episode's impact on sea life. 
</P>
<P>
John Heyning, curator of marine mammals at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Natural History, said it remains unclear what caused either dolphin to die, 
noting that such "strandings" are not uncommon in Southern California waters. 
Tests to determine whether the spill played a part will be performed Tuesday or 
Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heyning said the seven-foot-long Pacific white-sided dolphin found dead Sunday 
was not covered with oil when it was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a sheen of oil was discovered on the waters of the Bolsa Chica and 
Huntington wetlands, but authorities said it appeared that the film was a 
result of runoff from nearby roads. Workers had contained the sheen with 
oil-containing booms.

OFFICIAL FACES A BUMPY RIDE TO COMPLETION OF TOLL PROJECTS; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: WILLIAM C. WOOLLETT JR. PRESIDES OVER THE FIRST EFFORT TO BRING 
MAJOR, PUBLICLY OWNED, USER-FEE HIGHWAYS TO CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His friends call him Wild Bill. Some weekends he can be found roaming rustic 
Bommer Canyon in Irvine, or sailing a 16-foot catamaran off the coast, or river 
rafting in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
But at age 61, William C. Woollett Jr. says he has met his biggest challenge: 
serving as executive director of Orange County's Transportation Corridor 
Agencies, which plan to build a 70-mile, $2-billion network of three tollways 
by mid-decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this job because it involves something that's never been done before," 
Woollett said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Woollett presides over the first effort to bring major, publicly owned 
user-fee highways to California. 
</P>
<P>
Although Woollett may not be well-known outside of Irvine, where he served for 
17 years as the city's first city manager, he is one of Orange County's 
highest-paid public officials, receiving $118,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
It's a pressure-filled job. John Meyer, Woollett's predecessor, quit last 
summer, citing job burnout. Developers and politicians clamor to have the roads 
built "yesterday"; environmentalists threaten to file lawsuits at every turn, 
and engineers spend the agencies' money for design work faster than developer 
fees can pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Woollett has been at the tollway post less than four months, but agency board 
members, transportation officials and developers already give him high marks 
for boosting morale and gaining control of what was an understaffed, unfocused 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been tremendously impressed by him," said San Juan Capistrano Mayor 
Gary L. Hausdorfer, who chairs the Foothill-Eastern Transportation Corridor 
Agency board. "He is a very quiet and competent leader. He's a good organizer. 
He is a quick learner who very quickly grasps very complicated transportation 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Hausdorfer said, Woollett hired a financial expert -- Wallace D. 
Kreutzen -- as a deputy director to bring board members much better cost and 
cash flow analyses than they had before. Also, Woollett has been giving board 
members written, weekly updates on financial, environmental and construction 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, final design contracts have been signed for portions of the 
tollways, with construction expected to begin later this year or in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But Woollett still faces major hurdles, including: 
</P>
<P>
* Foothill-area opposition to federal legislation that would permit Orange 
County's tollways to pass through park land, and an almost-certain 
environmental lawsuit aimed at blocking the planned San Joaquin Hills tollway 
bridge across Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
* Continuing criticism from some public officials and developers who complain 
that the San Joaquin Hills tollway project is already two years behind 
schedule, even though the planned Foothill tollway is far ahead of its original 
timetable. 
</P>
<P>
* Pending final tollway financing plans, with tollway officials still 
negotiating developer fees and offsetting credits for donated rights of way and 
grading. 
</P>
<P>
Even Hausdorfer has acknowledged that tollway financing will be "very tight" 
and critically dependent, perhaps, on projections that motorists will be 
willing to pay tolls higher than the $2 to $3 maximums previously anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be easy," Hausdorfer said. But I'm confident the roads will 
be built." 
</P>
<P>
Said Woollett: "I didn't come here to fail." 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to head off potential financial problems, Woollett has discussed with 
some officials the possibility of borrowing money from the state or other local 
transportation agencies, who would be repaid when tolls are collected. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind that the lack of an organizational framework 
over there cost them some time," said Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of 
the Orange County Transportation Commission. "But Woollett just got there, and 
he's definitely brought a high degree of professionalism with him." 
</P>
<P>
Tollway employees say Woollett is best at bringing people of opposing views 
together and then quickly deciding what needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some people who remain unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
When the Tustin Hills Homeowners Assn. recently alleged that tollway officials 
were white-washing projected tollway noise levels in their community, Woollett 
promised to respond with the best scientific data available, even if it hurts 
his cause. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jeffrey Katz, president of the homeowners' group: "We'll see. He listens 
to us, but it's clear that he knows who he works for. . . . He wants to get the 
(tollways) done." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, developers such as the Mission Viejo Co., which had griped last year 
that the tollways were taking too long to build, have been mostly quiet after a 
series of private briefings begun by Woollett's predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
During such sessions, Woollett has developed a reputation for saying exactly 
what's on his mind, even to the influential Irvine Co., one of the agency's 
staunchest defenders and a major donor of rights of way. 
</P>
<P>
"I was attending a meeting with him (Woollett) and several others recently, 
when we got into an argument and he turned to me and said simply, 'Hugh, you're 
full of crap,' " said Irvine Co. transportation planner Hugh Fitzpatrick, 
</P>
<P>
Still, critics point out that the tollway agency has spent about $54 million 
since its inception in 1986, without any concrete poured. Much of the money, 
though, has gone for environmental and route alignment studies, legal advice 
and legislative lobbying in Sacramento, and costly design contracts. 
</P>
<P>
And while Woollett is under pressure in some quarters to quickly appoint a 
respected transportation engineering expert to an unfilled, second deputy's 
position on his staff, he has bided his time, saying it's not easy to attract 
the best people at a salary the agency can afford. 
</P>
<P>
Known for his off-the-wall humor, Woollett kids board members by offering to 
carry their bags on lobbying trips to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Woollett, the father of a son, 29, and a daughter, 27, reads historical novels 
and admits to a certain fascination both with futurism and management 
expertise, collecting works such as "Megatrends," "The One Minute Manager," and 
-- most recently -- "The Excellence Choice," by James A. Belasco, which 
Woollett said is about how vision creates excellence. 
</P>
<P>
No stranger to issues such as growth control and land-use planning, Woollett 
once worked privately on the development of Hollister Ranch north of Santa 
Barbara, which is not unlike the Irvine Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
While he was Irvine's city manager, his office discovered an error by the 
city's Community Development Department that had led to too many development 
permits being issued for the tightly controlled Irvine Business Complex. 
</P>
<P>
And although urban planners have criticized Irvine's reliance on mostly 
pro-automobile, anti-pedestrian development, Woollett has a jaundiced view of 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
"During World War II, we were forced to look at alternatives," Woollett said. 
"But now it just isn't as high a priority for us -- at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Front porches allowed people to see what was going on around them, to 
communicate face to face with their neighbors and children playing in the 
neighborhood. Now nobody builds them anymore. We've lost that source of 
communication. Similarly, cars have cut us off from each other. We're wrapped 
in steel, chrome and glass." 
</P>
<P>
But in a county where some government officials drive Cadillacs, Mercedeses and 
BMWs, Woollett wheels around town in a 1969 El Camino that was so much in need 
of a face lift that his former Irvine co-workers sprang for a bright red, 
$2,000 paint job. 
</P>
<P>
"He's basically a cowboy at heart," said Paul Brady Jr., who succeeded Woollett 
as Irvine's city manager. "The El Camino fits right in." 
</P>
<P>
But there's another side to Woollett. 
</P>
<P>
In his spare time, he gets together with an architect and an upholsterer to 
build bird cages. The men call themselves Red Door, because they attach a 
little red-painted door to each cage they make. The cages are sold at Out of 
the Woods, a crafts shop in El Toro, where Woollett's wife, Diane, works as a 
floral designer. 
</P>
<P>
Woollett said he sees no connection between his hobby and his job except the 
urge to be creative. 
</P>
<P>
The tollways, he said, will be state-of-the art masterpieces for the world to 
copy. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he's convinced that new development will not burden the tollways with so 
much traffic that they will be obsolete as soon as they open, citing so-called 
demand management strategies for the tollways that include the proposed 
installation of rail transit in the medians, as well as car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
And in addition to speeding traffic, he said, the tollways will include vista 
points that will open up thousands of acres of backcountry and spectacular 
views above the Irvine coast to public view for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to travel around California and see the countryside," Woollett said. 
"And this is part of California."

</P>
<P>
Organization: Transportation Corridor Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Purpose: Started in 1986 as joint powers authorities by Orange County and the 
cities along planned routes to finance and build freeways. State legislation 
later provided authority to collect tolls. 
</P>
<P>
Top Administrator: William C. Woollett Jr., 61, of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Headquarters: There are two corridor agencies that share the same office and 
staff, at 345 Clinton St., Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Policy makers: The San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency is overseen 
by a board chaired by Newport Beach Councilman John Cox and consisting of 
County Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez and council members 
from Costa Mesa, Dana Point, Irvine, Mission Viejo, San Clemente, San Juan 
Capistrano and Santa Ana. The Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency 
is overseen by a board chaired by San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer 
and consisting of Riley, Vasquez, and city council members from Anaheim, 
Irvine, Mission Viejo, Orange, San Clemente, Santa Ana, Tustin and Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROJECTS 
</P>
<P>
* The 15-mile San Joaquin Hills toll road would extend from the Corona del Mar 
Freeway from its present terminus at MacArthur Boulevard in Newport Beach to 
Interstate 5 near San Juan Capistrano, through Laguna Hills, Aliso Viejo and 
Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
* The 23-mile Eastern toll road would begin at the Riverside Freeway near the 
Riverside County line and parallel the Costa Mesa Freeway through the Santa Ana 
Mountains, splitting into two legs near Santiago Canyon Road. The west leg 
would end at Jamboree Road near the Santa Ana Freeway, and the east leg would 
connect with the Laguna Freeway at the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
* The 32-mile Foothill toll road would connect the east leg of the Eastern toll 
road with Interstate 5 near the San Diego County line, through Portola Hills 
and Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Construction: Ground-breaking on all three projects in 1991. Portions open at 
various intervals through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Cost: $2 billion-plus. 
</P>
<P>
Tolls: Not final, but range could be 75 cents to $4, depending on facility and 
distance traveled. 
</P>
<P>
Financing: Developers must donate 120-foot-wide right of way without 
compensation. In addition, 48.44% of the construction costs are to be paid 
through the collection of development fees. The rest of the money is expected 
to come from a combination of construction bonds, paid off with toll revenue 
and state and federal loans or grants. However, developers receive credits 
against the fees they owe when they donate additional land or do grading work 
that is included in the cost of building the toll roads. Officials expect 
development fees to increase, and tolls may be higher than originally planned. 
Tolls must be removed when construction debts end.

MORE CITIES TURN TO HIRING HALLS TO SOLVE DAY LABORER PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first, the city of Orange resorted to force to try to stop day laborers from 
congregating along East Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
In an all-out assault three years ago, the Orange police arrested hundreds of 
the mostly Latino laborers on misdemeanor violations and turned over almost all 
of them to the U.S. Border Patrol for deportation. The next day, laborers again 
flocked to Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the city is planning a gentler approach to the problem of day 
laborers, whose presence has drawn complaints from local residents and 
businesses. Last week, the City Council voted to open a hiring hall to match 
laborers with jobs. 
</P>
<P>
By so doing, Orange joins a growing number of Orange County cities which, after 
trying everything else to discourage growing congregations of day laborers, 
have reconciled themselves to living with them and opened hiring halls to get 
them off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
But the halls are widely diverse in operation and none has succeeded in ridding 
the streets entirely of day laborers. Some of them also create the same traffic 
congestion that prompted complaints about the workers in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the obvious limitations of such a hiring hall plan is that this is 
difficult to do without simply moving the 'problem' from one geographic 
location to another," said Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Orange 
County Human Relations Commission, in a report to local cities last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Complaints about workers rushing up to vehicles may continue. Also, it is very 
difficult to control employers and those seeking employment. They often 
eventually drift back to the original pickup site." 
</P>
<P>
City officials, though, say that hiring halls are better than having nothing at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a win-win situation for everyone involved," said Karen Nobrega, 
assistant to the city manager of Orange. "It's effective for business owners 
who complain about large groups congregating. Employers have a central location 
that they can drive through. And it is a good place for the laborers because 
the employers are there." 
</P>
<P>
Cities, too, are trying to learn from each other's experiences. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Costa Mesa started Orange County's hiring hall trend in October, 
1988, as the worsening economies of Latin America and other factors propelled 
hundreds of workers onto street corners throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Laguna Beach has established an outdoor hiring hall; Dana Point 
began a telephone placement service, and Brea plans to open a hall this spring. 
All of these programs are operated at city expense. 
</P>
<P>
Orange officials expect to open their hall on March 26 and to pattern it after 
Costa Mesa's, where only legal residents of the United States are welcome. And 
like both Costa Mesa and Dana Point, Orange has also outlawed solicitation of 
jobs on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't solve the problem 100% but we think it's the right way," Orange Mayor 
Don E. Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
But if Costa Mesa's experience is any indication, Orange may run into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa is fighting two lawsuits brought by human rights groups challenging 
the constitutionality of its day-laborer ordinance. Both suits are pending in 
Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
And by excluding workers without green cards, work permits or other documents 
showing legal residency, the Costa Mesa plan literally is leaving some workers 
out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the city ordinance and near-freezing temperatures one morning this past 
week, some two dozen Latino men stood shivering in Lions Park -- directly 
across the street from the Costa Mesa Police Department -- as they have done 
for countless mornings in search of work. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here because it is a necessity," said Abraham Martinez, 41, an 
undocumented immigrant who sends money home to his wife and two children in 
Mexico City. "If I don't make money for my family, they don't eat." 
</P>
<P>
At the Costa Mesa Job Center about a mile away, more than two dozen legal 
immigrants waited patiently as contractors drifted through to pick up workers. 
The jobs are doled out by lottery. Although the workers said finding work is 
much easier through a hiring hall, they sympathized with the others such as 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us need to eat," Pedro Estrada, a 56-year-old immigrant from the 
Mexican state of Michoacan, said with an expansive sweep of his arms. "They 
need to open the doors of this center to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it's really sad," agreed Christina Sanchez, coordinator of the Costa 
Mesa Job Center. "But it's the city's rules and we have to follow them." 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials, under criticism by 
some cities for not doing more about day laborers, tout the Costa Mesa plan as 
a national model. 
</P>
<P>
Donald B. Looney, INS deputy district director in Los Angeles, said the program 
helps legal residents and discourages illegal ones. He predicted that 
undocumented workers eventually would drift away as employers become 
increasingly reluctant to hire them. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1986 Immigration Control and Reform Act, employers face penalties, 
including seizure of their vehicles, for hiring undocumented immigrants. With 
that law in mind, many employers say they like the idea of going to hiring 
halls where the workers have already been screened. 
</P>
<P>
"It is peace of mind knowing that they have ID," Don Hanson, a contractor from 
Costa Mesa, said as he picked up two workers at the Costa Mesa hall on a recent 
morning. "I just drop by whenever I'm short a man." 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, Laguna Beach and eventually in Brea, hiring halls don't 
require papers. The advantage of that, said Kennedy of the Human Relations 
Commission, is that they move more day laborers off street corners. Studies by 
the INS show that, depending on location, between 10% and 80% of day laborers 
are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities have found that, regardless of whether they check documents or not, 
a hiring hall simply won't work if it's placed in the wrong location. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Kamsvaag, an attorney for the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights in 
Los Angeles, said the city of Glendale's hiring hall failed recently because it 
was in an out-of-the-way industrial location. Seeing that employers were not 
following them to the hall, the workers slowly began returning to their old 
pickup site in a retail district, Kamsvaag said. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach ran into a similar problem when, two years ago, it set up an 
informal hiring hall on a remote stretch of Laguna Canyon Road for dozens of 
workers who had been gathering outside a convenience store in North Laguna. 
Even with free shuttle buses between the store and the parking lot site, city 
officials found that many of the workers preferred to remain near the store. 
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of day workers eventually drifted to the Laguna Canyon 
Road site, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said that a few laborers still show up 
each morning at the old location. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike cities with indoor hiring halls, Laguna Beach chose the low-budget 
approach of simply designating a pickup site for workers. But the city ran into 
major problems when the workers began darting in and out of busy Laguna Canyon 
Road after prospective employers, Frank said. Three of the workers were struck 
by vehicles and injured. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to hear screeching brakes all the time," said Joe Jahraus, owner of 
Laguna Beach Lumber across the highway from the lot. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council responded to the safety problem by spending nearly $9,000 to 
upgrade the lot so workers will not need to leave. The upgrading, completed two 
weeks ago, included installation of a toilet, benches and a paved entrance and 
exit for the lot. Jahraus said the workers don't dash into the street any more. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most successful and inexpensive hiring programs in the county has 
been the telephone job bank started last August in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mike Eggers, chief architect of the plan, said workers and employers 
call a special line staffed by volunteers and a part-time coordinator and are 
matched according to need. As of Oct. 6, a city report found that the job bank 
was placing 74% of its workers. 
</P>
<P>
The Telephone Hiring Exchange, as it is called, costs $9,000 a year. Orange's 
hiring hall will cost an estimated $95,000 to open, while Brea's is expected to 
cost $37,000. Costa Mesa spends about $20,000 a year on its program. 
</P>
<P>
As successful as it is, a telephone hiring hall has geographic limitations that 
would prevent it from being effective on a more widespread scale, Kennedy said. 
Eggers also admits some workers still gravitate to an old pickup site on Doheny 
Park Road in Capistrano Beach but in far fewer numbers than before. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their approach, city officials throughout the county agree that the 
day-laborer problem is not going away any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The lure of Southern California to those living in villages in Mexico and 
Central America is almost overwhelming," Eggers said. "As long as we continue 
to create this paradise in Southern California, one of the results of that 
paradise is going to be the lure of immigrants to this area." 
</P>
<P>
HIRING HALLS IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
COSTA MESA: Opened Job Center in October, 1988. The center assists only those 
workers who can furnish documentation of legal U.S. residency. The city has 
adopted day laborer ordinances that make it a misdemeanor to solicit employment 
on the street, hire anyone off the street or have the intent of soliciting 
employment. Plan aimed at reducing number of workers who gather in Lion's Park 
for work. Cost: $20,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
LAGUNA BEACH: Designated city parking lot as outdoor hiring hall for day 
laborers in December, 1988. Original site was on the Act V parking lot on 
Laguna Canyon Road but was moved last year to a nearby parking lot on the same 
road. Council recently authorized $9,000 in improvements to the lot, including 
installation of a portable toilet, benches and paving. Program aimed at 
reducing congregations of workers outside Circle K store in North Laguna. Cost: 
$9,000 for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
DANA POINT: Started Telephone Hiring Exchange Aug. 28 to match dayworkers with 
jobs. City does not attempt to verify legal residency. City also enacted 
ordinance prohibiting street solicitation of jobs. The telephone hiring hall is 
aimed at reducing worker congregations on Doheny Park Road in Capistrano Beach. 
Cost: $9,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE: Will open hiring hall March 26. It will be open only to workers who can 
furnish documentation of legal residency. The city has also enacted a 
day-laborer ordinance that makes it illegal to seek work on the street during 
posted hours and in designated locations. Ordinance will be enforced 30 days 
after the hiring hall is open. Plan is aimed at reducing number of workers who 
gather along East Chapman Avenue. Cost: $95,000 to start up. 
</P>
<P>
BREA: Plans to open indoor hiring hall this spring for both documented and 
undocumented workers. Council in December began soliciting bids for a nonprofit 
agency to run the hall. Program is aimed at reducing worker congregations on 
Walnut Avenue at Imperial Highway. Cost: $37,000 a year.

POLICE DISARM MAN IN DOMESTIC DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After first firing a shot that missed, police late Saturday disarmed and 
subdued a 52-year-old man who had allegedly threatened family members with a 
loaded pistol inside their home, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
Isauro Mendoza Mora of Santa Ana was held in the incident on suspicion of with 
assaulting a police officer with a deadly weapon, Sgt. Kevin Brown said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said officers wrestled a 9-mm handgun from Mora on the porch of his house 
at 1006 S. Karen St. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, at least two officers went to Mora's home at about 
11:10 p.m. to handle a quarrel. As family members fled out the front door, 
police entered the house and saw Mora carrying a handgun, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
When Mora advanced on them, an officer fired one shot, but missed, Brown said. 
According to police, Mora was disarmed on the front porch, where one officer 
grabbed the gun while a second struck Mora on the head. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just fortunate that no one was seriously hurt," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was in the wrong," said Mora's son, Jose. "He hit my mother and gave 
her a black eye." 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the bullet holes in the wall," Jose Mora told a reporter. "He was 
trying to scare her I guess. He was acting crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Isauro Mora, who was treated for injuries to his face and head, was being held 
in Orange County Jail. Brown said no officers were injured in the encounter.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: JAIL ESCAPEE ARRESTED IN ANOTHER COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTYWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A County Jail prisoner who escaped Friday allegedly by stealing a county-owned 
car has been arrested in San Bernardino County, sheriff's deputies said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
David Edward Osborne, 20, of Buena Park was booked on charges of escape and 
grand theft auto at San Bernardino County Jail on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The county vehicle he reportedly stole also was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said Osborne, who was set to be released Feb. 27, took the tan 1988 
Pontiac Bonneville four-door from a Sheriff's Department garage at 550 N. 
Flower St., where he was assigned to wash and park vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently he decided he didn't want to park cars and just took off," said Lt. 
Robert Rivas of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. "It was his first day 
on the job." 
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department spotted the stolen 
vehicle after authorities in Orange County put out a bulletin to law 
enforcement agencies describing the suspect and car.

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER PRIVACY ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The release of city employees' home addresses, a controversial campaign issue 
in the past, will be debated by the City Council on Tuesday night when it 
considers a proposal to prevent the city from releasing personal information on 
any city employee. 
</P>
<P>
The ban would ensure the privacy of city employees, said Councilman Richards L. 
Norton, who made the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Edward J. Cooper opposes the idea because state law already 
prohibits the release of confidential information about employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the proposed ordinance is more restrictive than state law, in our 
opinion it would be preempted and unenforceable," Cooper wrote in a two-page 
memo to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Norton argued that the proposed ban is a precautionary step. 
</P>
<P>
"With such an ordinance, you can never release this kind of information in the 
future. It would ban it outright," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The release of home addresses has been a sore point between Norton and 
Councilman Daniel E. Griset, who usually vote on opposite sides of issues. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal stems from a dispute about whether the city can legally release 
the addresses of its police officers, a point that flared up in a 1988 council 
race between Griset and Norton. 
</P>
<P>
That year, Griset, on behalf of a neighborhood organization, had sent campaign 
letters to about 300 members of the Santa Ana Police Benevolent Assn., the 
police officers' union. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the union sought and received a court order to stop the release 
of their home addresses. The union argued that officers feared that their 
addresses had somehow been made available to the public and that they feared 
for their families' safety. But Griset's attorney argued that as a city 
official, he was entitled to such information. 
</P>
<P>
Griset described the current proposal by Norton as being a "window-dressing 
motion." 
</P>
<P>
"It lacks substance and is designed to take attention away from real issues," 
Griset said. LILY ENG

EDISON'S GIRLS FEEL RIGHT AT HOME WHEN PLAYING IN MARINA'S GYM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best news Coach Phil Abraham received last week was that his Edison High 
School girls' basketball team couldn't use its gymnasium Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers had a home game against Walnut High Saturday night in the second 
round of the Southern Section 4-AA playoffs. But the 4-A wrestling 
championships were scheduled for the same night at Edison. 
</P>
<P>
A problem? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham chose Marina as the site for the game. As alternate sites go, it was 
not exactly neutral. The Chargers defeated the Mustangs, 56-50, raising their 
record to 6-0 at Marina this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave us an edge subconsciously," Abraham said. "Our players are just real 
comfortable in the Marina gym. I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, the Chargers won four games in the Marina tournament, 
including a victory over Ocean View in the championship game. It was one of 
only two losses the Seahawks have had this season. Edison also defeated Marina 
in a road game during Sunset League play. 
</P>
<P>
With Saturday's victory over Walnut, the Chargers have won twice as many games 
at Marina than at Edison, where they are 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played some really good teams at home, which is a big reason why our 
road record is better," said Abraham, whose team finished tied for fourth in 
the Sunset League. "But we also seem to play better on the road. And Marina has 
been really good to us." 
</P>
<P>
Besides playing the game at Marina, the Chargers (17-8) also practiced in the 
Vikings' gym Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham had to get permission from Southern Section officials to practice at 
Marina. Under section rules, teams aren't allowed to practice in a gym in which 
they will use as an alternate site. But because Edison was scheduled to have a 
home game, section officials allowed the Chargers to practice at Marina. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, the way we're playing right now, we would have won no 
matter where the game was played," Abraham said. "But when you're in the 
playoffs, any edge you can get helps." 
</P>
<P>
Edison's success in Marina's gym was part of Abraham's pregame speech. The 
Chargers also wanted to bring an Edison banner to drape over the scorer's 
table. 
</P>
<P>
But Abraham said there was a Marina banner at the scorer's table in the five 
previous victories. 
</P>
<P>
"They dropped that idea right away," Abraham said. "They wanted everything to 
be exactly the same. When you're dealing with kids, these things work." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will not be able to use Marina's gym again during the playoffs, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Teams must play at alternate sites during the rest of the playoffs. Because 
Edison has practiced at Marina, it is no longer considered a neutral gym by the 
Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can't worry about things that are one or two games down the road," 
Abraham said. "You have to be concerned with the game you're playing. But I 
would like to have played at Marina again. The kids are a little 
superstitious." 
</P>
<P>
More superstitions: Abraham said guard Debbie Fischer was worried about the 
Walnut game. Or, rather, the pregame warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being the Chargers' leading scorer, Fischer is in charge of the music 
played at Edison games during warm-ups. But Fischer forgot to bring the tape to 
Marina and the Chargers had to warm up without it. 
</P>
<P>
"Debbie is very religious about that tape," Abraham said. "She made it and 
feels it's her main duty to bring it. It worries me when little things like 
that bother my players." 
</P>
<P>
Abraham had no reason to worry. Fischer handled her other main duty, scoring 30 
points in the victory over Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Lost in America: The Esperanza boys' soccer team took an indirect route to the 
second round of the Southern Section 2-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Calexico was scheduled to play at Esperanza in a first-round game Friday, but 
some misleading directions from one of the Bulldogs' officials caused them to 
miss the game. Calexico officials had problems getting transportation for a 
make-up game and forfeited on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza (15-4-5) will play at Anaheim in the second round at 3 p.m. 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Lunceford's high school soccer career came to an abrupt end on Friday 
when Trabuco Hills was upset by Foothill, 2-0, in the second round of the 3-A 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Lunceford scored 31 goals this season and had 87 during her three-year career 
at Esperanza and Trabuco Hills. She played at Esperanza as a sophomore before 
her family moved to Mission Viejo. Lunceford ranks fifth in career goals in the 
Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer will not be her sport when she goes to college, however. Lunceford is 
being recruited to play softball. She led Orange County last season with a .500 
batting average. 
</P>
<P>
Lunceford, who plays shortstop, has made visits to Cal State Long Beach, 
Colorado and Minnesota. Coaches from Ohio State and Iowa also have shown 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
A prediction by Trabuco Hills' basketball Coach Rainer Wulf came true in the 
Mustangs' 3-AA playoff game against Servite. 
</P>
<P>
He rather would have been a false prophet. 
</P>
<P>
Wulf said the Mustangs could win the 3-AA if guards Tim Manning, Randy Kriech 
and Beau Hossler played up to their potential. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll go only as far as those three take us," Wulf said before Friday night's 
game. "If they all play well, we can win the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
The final destination was Servite. The Friars eliminated the Mustangs with a 
58-53 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three, only Manning played well. He made seven of 14 shots, including 
four three-point baskets, and scored 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Hossler scored 20 points, but made only seven of 17 field goals. Kriech was 
two-of-eight from the field and scored only four points. 
</P>
<P>
Judy McKnight, wife of Mater Dei basketball Coach Gary McKnight, is expecting 
their fifth child. According to tests, it will be the couple's fifth son. 
</P>
<P>
"We had ultrasound tests done," Gary McKnight said. "Another boy." 
</P>

When asked if the tests revealed whether the upcoming arrival would be a 
shooting guard, the less-than-slim Gary McKnight said, "If he's built like me, 
he'll have to be. He's lucky. He's the coach's son."

<TEXT>
<P>
Adjua Abi Naantaanbuu, a graceful woman with languid eyes and pointed wit, 
sipped tea and talked about that day more than 20 years ago, the day the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr. died. It was 1968 and he had had dinner at her house the 
night before. Those events changed her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew something was wrong" in America if a man as revered as King could be 
murdered for his color and his nonviolent beliefs, she told a visitor to her 
home in a quiet Memphis neighborhood, the same one in which she was host to 
King. 
</P>
<P>
Naantaanbuu, who in 1968 was Tarlease Mathews, began "embracing the African 
culture and being proud of who I am." Now, she says, the only "European 
clothes" she owns are jogging outfits. All the rest are African, like the long, 
loose purple and white dress, with matching gele that she wore on a recent day. 
</P>
<P>
She produces an annual African-American cultural festival in Memphis. At 53, 
she has carved out her niche in this city. 
</P>
<P>
But another incident connected to King has come along, again altering her life 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Ralph Abernathy, in his recently published book, "And the Walls Came 
Tumbling Down," described that last dinner at Naantaanbuu's house, and, without 
naming her, called her "a 'friend' of" King. 
</P>
<P>
She "had provided dinner partners" for King and another activist, Bernard Lee, 
that night, Abernathy wrote. And, he wrote that, sometime after dinner, "Martin 
and his friend came out of the bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
The implication was clear -- that King was an adulterer on his last night 
alive, with his closest aide a near witness. 
</P>
<P>
That account, published in October, infuriated black people generally, but in 
Naantaanbuu's view, it amounted to libel. She has sued Abernathy, his 
publisher, Harper &amp; Row, and the book's editor, Daniel Bial, seeking a 
total of $10 million -- $5 million from Abernathy, $2.5 million each from the 
publisher and editor. And she wants a stop-publish order on any books 
containing what her 10-page complaint calls "the defamatory material." 
</P>
<P>
Abernathy did not return repeated telephone calls, but in past interviews he 
has stood by his account. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday, Harper &amp; Row officials said that the 
company "has complete confidence in this book and in the integrity and veracity 
of its author. We believe the lawsuit is without merit, and we will defend it 
aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
Abernathy's account is "a lie," Naantaanbuu said, holding a well-worn copy of 
the book, asserting that Abernathy makes her out to be "a madam." 
</P>
<P>
In more than three hours of conversation, Naantaanbuu gave her own account of 
King's last night alive, including his comments about the likelihood he would 
be murdered and his threat to leave the civil rights movement. She compared her 
feelings about King and Malcolm X, whose philosophy she finds more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Naantaanbuu and her attorney reject the notion that the lawsuit, filed in New 
York earlier this month, weakens the civil rights movement, and Naantaanbuu 
asserts that her own faith in "the movement" remains unshaken. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Naantaanbuu said that Abernathy's book has taken a terrible toll 
on her. Stress has caused her to gain 30 pounds, she said. Strangers stop and 
stare. And the talk tears her apart. "I have a friend who said that a lady told 
her: 'She's no different from Jessica Hahn,' " (the one-time church secretary 
with whom the Rev. Jim Bakker had a sexual encounter before his television 
evangelical empire crumbled). 
</P>
<P>
"It's so depressing to have to deal with something like this," she said. "My 
reputation is on the line. I walk out in the street, and people look at me and 
you can see all eyes going (here, she rolls her eyes). They're saying, 'That's 
the woman that Abernathy said was coming out of the bedroom.' Well, think what 
they read into that -- coming out of the bedroom, you know? It's a very ugly, 
nasty thing." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Naantaanbuu's story illustrates how any person can go from 
obscurity to notoriety in the stroke of a computer key. 
</P>
<P>
Naantaanbuu was asleep one night last October when the first friend telephoned 
her to tell her that she had joined the notorious. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got something important to tell you," the friend said, citing news 
reports. "Abernathy has written a book. And . . . he talked about them being at 
your home and seeing you and Dr. King coming out of your bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
Naantaanbuu recalls responding, "Oh, you gotta be kidding." 
</P>
<P>
She said: "I just couldn't imagine Abernathy having something like that printed 
when it wasn't true." 
</P>
<P>
Naantaanbuu and Abernathy agree on much of what happened on the night of April 
3. Their major differences center on two paragraphs on Page 434 of the book, 
rapidly becoming known as the "$10-million paragraphs." 
</P>
<P>
In the first paragraph, Abernathy wrote that King's "friend" invited the three 
men over for dinner and that when they arrived, "we found three ladies 
waiting." He went on to describe a "heavy meal along with some light 
conversation." In the other paragraph, Abernathy wrote that he was exhausted, 
fell asleep in an easy chair in the living room and awoke as "Martin and his 
friend came out of the bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
As Naantaanbuu tells it, she had never met King before she was "volunteered" by 
local rights activists to chauffeur him, along with Abernathy, Jesse Jackson 
and Bernard Lee, from the Memphis airport to the Lorraine Motel. The group was 
coming to town to lend support to striking garbage workers. 
</P>
<P>
She recalls picking up the four men in her car, "a large car, a deuce and a 
quarter," as the fancy Buick 225 was called then. After the men checked into 
the motel -- the same one on whose balcony King would be shot to death the next 
day -- Naantaanbuu delivered them to a church meeting. After the meeting she 
delivered three of them -- Jackson rode off in a limousine and was not at the 
dinner -- back to the motel, where Abernathy "asked me if I would prepare some 
food for them." 
</P>
<P>
He also asked her to supply some liquor, she said, which she did, asserting 
that Abernathy drank liberally from the fifth of gin. (Abernathy's account does 
not mention any alcohol being served at the dinner.) 
</P>
<P>
Excited at the prospect of having King and his colleagues as dinner guests, 
Naantaanbuu said she phoned her sister, Cleopra Mitchell; a woman friend, Marie 
Jones, and several other people and told them that "Dr. King was coming over to 
my house," and invited them to drop by. 
</P>
<P>
The meal -- steak, potatoes, salad -- would be eaten after King delivered his 
stirring, prophetic "I've been to the mountaintop" speech to the striking 
garbage workers, in which he thundered: "Like anybody, I would like to live a 
long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I 
just want to do God's will. . . . And so I'm happy tonight. I'm not worried 
about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the 
coming of the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
Still high after the electrifying rally, the group -- Naantaanbuu, King, 
Abernathy, Lee, Mitchell and Jones -- ate about midnight, Naantaanbuu said. 
Jones left about 1:30 and the rest of them stayed and talked until 2:45 a.m., 
she said, noting that Abernathy was nodding off in the living room while King 
talked. 
</P>
<P>
Abernathy, not King, Naantaanbuu said, went to lie on her bed. "He had had too 
much to drink," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said, King talked as if he "knew he wasn't going to be around 
long," recalling a conversation with Robert Kennedy in which both men predicted 
their murders. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, she said, King said he had thought of quitting the movement, 
saying that once when colleagues came to his house in Atlanta, "he said he sent 
his wife to the door to tell them that he wasn't there. He said at that point 
he had decided to get out." 
</P>
<P>
At no time, Naantaanbuu said, did she and King become intimate. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been highly unethical," she said, fuming, "to pull somebody off 
to my bedroom, you know, especially somebody I'd never met before. The whole 
thing is just terrible." Mitchell and Jones plan to testify for her during the 
trial, Naantaanbuu said. 
</P>
<P>
Naantaanbuu views her plight as ironic, having her life turned upside down 
because she played the "good Samaritan" to King, especially since she considers 
her temperament closer to Malcolm X's -- the charismatic black nationalist who 
was murdered in 1965 -- than to King's. 
</P>
<P>
She said that although she admired King's nonviolent approach to civil rights, 
turning the other cheek is not her style. 
</P>
<P>
"Malcolm is the kind of brother I admire very much," Naantaanbuu said, 
gesturing toward a copy of his autobiography, which occupies a prominent place 
on her bookshelf. She is fond of telling the story of meeting Malcolm at a 1963 
Mississippi protest, where he lent moral support but refused to join the 
demonstration because, as she reported his saying, "If those (people) spit on 
him or kicked him, he was going to die in Mississippi." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in loving those who love you," said Naantaanbuu. "Fight those who 
fight you. That is my philosophy. Same as Malcolm's." 
</P>
<P>
It was not always that way. She said her grandfather was a minister, "and I was 
in church everytime the door opened." She later came to believe that it was 
wrong to "be meek and humble and believe the Lord will open up the window of 
heaven and pour out your blessings." 
</P>
<P>
The coming battle against Abernathy fits Naantaanbuu's style. Her attorney, 
Gail Boyd, who practices in New York City, portrayed the suit as a necessary 
response -- regardless of the fallout. 
</P>
<P>
"When the shot has been fired from the opposing camp," she said, "you have to 
fire back." 
</P>
<P>
As the case winds its way through the court system -- Naantaanbuu is seeking a 
jury trial, and pretrial proceedings are scheduled for April 20 -- Naantaanbuu 
continues her effort to spread Pan-Africanism. 
</P>
<P>
She is partial to large gold earrings and a nose ring, along with a necklace 
bearing a gold African pendant. A wall in her home is filled with books and 
artifacts extolling African and black American culture. 
</P>
<P>
A barber and beautician, Naantaanbuu is separated from her husband. She is the 
mother of three children, aged 34, 26 and 16, and has extended her family by 
creating a program for children who are enrolled in a local Head Start program, 
aimed at familiarizing the 3- to 5-year-olds with black culture and heroes, 
African and American. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, 22 youngsters sat in a circle at a Head Start center, and one 
by one, they stood, greeting the group in Swahili, then introducing themselves, 
taking on names of famous black people. There was a little King, a Frederick 
Douglass, a Cleopatra, a Nat Turner, an Angela Davis, a Jomo Kenyatta, a Cicely 
Tyson. And Malcolm X was there. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour, Naantaanbuu, asked: "How many of you all know the movement song, 
'We Shall Overcome?' " Most of the little hands shot up, and a minute later, 
they were all singing, led by Naantaanbuu. 
</P>
<P>
Back at home, Naantaanbuu is reflective. 
</P>
<P>
No, the stress has not worn her all the way down. The episode, she says, 
"increases my determination to educate the sisters and brothers because Ralph 
Abernathy is an unconscious brother." 
</P>
<P>
No, she has not talked with Abernathy, whom she once considered a friend, since 
the book was published. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, sometimes she has second thoughts about having filed the suit because 
"I was just not prepared for the kinds of changes I have had to go through as a 
result of this." 
</P>
<P>
But, she goes on, "I've been damaged. My reputation -- I'll always have that 
stigma that will follow me all the days of my life. If I win, they'll say that 
there was the woman that Abernathy said . . . " her voice trails off. "And if I 
lose in court, '(people will say) that's the woman that slept with King.' 
That'll always be. I mean, regardless of what happens, that'll always be."
