NEWSMAKERS: TO GEORGE, WASH., PRESIDENTS' DAY IS A PIECE OF CAKE

George Washington's birthday provided people on opposite sides of the nation a 
good reason for a party. Residents of George, Wash., a Columbia River Valley 
farming community, celebrated Presidents' Day by eating a 190-pound cake 
decorated with the face of their town's namesake. The birthday party has been a 
tradition for more than 30 years in the town of about 250. Meanwhile, in New 
York, the countdown to the 200th anniversary of Washington's inauguration in 
that city as the first U.S. President began with exhibits at Federal Hall, 
built on the site of the nation's first Capitol, and at Fraunces Tavern, where 
Washington said farewell to his officers in 1783. Irwin Layne, a 70-year-old 
singer retired from the Brooklyn Opera who is a volunteer guide at the tavern 
museum, said the life mask of Washington made in plaster by French sculptor 
Jean Antoine Houdon in 1783 is his favorite exhibit. "I look at that every day 
I work here," he said. " . . . There's not enough patriotism today. When I hear 
young people come in here and say things that degrade our heroes, I tell them 
in an emphatic way they are wrong."

 -- In Delaware, the wreck of a British man o' war hauled from Delaware Bay is 
providing a glimpse of shipboard life during Washington's time. The discovery 
has shown that sailors in the 1790s were well-fed and used Wedgwood ceramic 
plates and good-quality muskets, said Charles Fithian, curator of archeology 
for the Delaware Bureau of Museums and Historic Sites in South Bowers. The 
vessel had machine-manufactured fittings, one of the earliest products of the 
Industrial Revolution. The DeBraak, lost in a 1798 squall, was raised by a 
salvage firm in 1986.

 -- First Lady Barbara Bush, long an advocate of literacy programs, will visit 
local literacy and reading projects around the country this year as honorary 
chairwoman of the "Year of the Young Reader," a campaign started by the Library 
of Congress. "Our young people need to know that reading is a joy as well as 
the most essential of skills, and that libraries are inviting, accessible 
places dedicated to the joy of reading," she said. SHIRLEY MARLOW

TROJANS SUFFER A MELTDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER USC TAKES LEAD, STANFORD TAKES OVER FOR A 68-52 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
George Raveling, USC basketball coach, kept staring at the scoreboard during 
Monday night's game against Stanford at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the scoreboard was broken," Raveling said "It seemed like we were 
stuck on 49 (points) forever." 
</P>
<P>
The scoreboard was functioning properly, but the same cannot be said of 
Trojans, who unraveled like a cheap suit in the final 10 minutes of a 68-52 
loss to No. 16-ranked Stanford before 2,531 fans. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford blitzed USC, 19-1, in the final 10 minutes to beat the Trojans for the 
10th consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half we just did a horrible job of attacking the zone," Raveling 
said. "We didn't get any penetration and we weren't able to hit the outside 
shots. And out of frustration some players started to go one-on-one." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Ronnie Coleman, who scored 26 points, including 17 in the first half, 
said USC's offense was out of sync against Stanford's 1-1-3 zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We just took a few shots too fast," Coleman said. "We were rushing our shots." 
</P>
<P>
Raveling also played role in USC's demise. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing by as many as 13 points in the first half, the Trojans outscored 
the Cardinal, 12-3, at the start of the second half to take a 43-42 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Raveling was called a technical foul with 13:59 remaining after complaining 
that Stanford center Eric Reveno was playing too aggressively while checking 
Coleman under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to get the official's attention because they were mugging Coleman in 
there," Raveling said. "I didn't swear (at the official). I was just grabbing 
my clothes telling them that Reveno was holding Coleman's clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford scored five straight points after Raveling's outburst to take command 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Lichti made two foul shots after the technical to give Stanford a 44-43 
lead and Scott Meinert added a three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling, however, didn't think the technical was a critical call. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt at that point in the game the technical didn't have that much effect," 
Raveling said. "There were 14 minutes to go." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, USC did rally to within a point after the technical before its offense 
conked out. The Trojans missed 11 consecutive shots before Ken Countryman hit a 
three-point shot with four seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
USC is 8-18 overall and 1-13 in the Pacific 10 Conference, and Stanford is 21-5 
overall and 12-3 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery was worried that the Cardinal would overlook 
USC, which lost 13 straight before beating Arizona State last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cardinal had enough left to overtake the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"We really dodged a bullet tonight," Montgomery said. "I was worried about this 
game and rightly so. But we finally switched gears and got going again." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Howard Wright scored 20 points for Stanford and Lichti added 16. 
</P>
<P>
Wright had eight points and one assist in the Cardinal's surge and Lichti added 
four points and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
USC Notes 
</P>
<P>
Harold Miner, a 6-foot-5 guard from Inglewood High who has already signed with 
USC, watched the Trojans play for the first time this season. Asked if he can 
help turn around USC, Miner smiled and said, "I think I can." . . . USC plays 
Washington State Thursday at 8 p.m. Turi Carter, USC reserve forward, sat out 
the game with a sprained toe.

LONG BEACH WOMEN AGAIN ARE BEST IN BIG WEST, 91-77 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach clinched the Big West Conference women's basketball 
championship Monday night. Again. They beat Nevada Las Vegas. Again. 
</P>
<P>
A sellout crowd of 2,001 in the University Gym cheered wildly as the 49ers 
wrapped up the title with a 91-77 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers (22-4 overall, 15-0 in the Big West) have dominated the conference 
since they joined it, which has made them few fans among their competitors. 
Least friendly is UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say they are our toughest rivalry," Long Beach Coach Joan Bonvicini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some rivals: Long Beach is 16-1 in its series against Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth consecutive conference championship for Long Beach. The 49ers 
have lost only one conference game since joining the conference in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas (20-5, 10-5) allowed the game to get out of control in the first 
half, when Long Beach led by as many as 28 points. With its fast break fed by 
Rebel turnovers -- they committed 49 in the game -- the 49ers turned up the 
tempo. 
</P>
<P>
"They are like a train," Las Vegas assistant coach Rick Glenn said. "You can't 
stop 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Traci Waites scored 21 of her 29 points in the first half for Long Beach, 
making four of six shots from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"Traci Waites was on fire," Bonvicini said. "I don't know if I've seen her 
shoot like that in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not the last time Long Beach played UNLV, when Waites severely 
sprained her right ankle and had to be carried off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just blessed that I can still be playing after that injury," Waites said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels lead the nation in rebounding and crushed Long Beach in the game at 
Las Vegas. Tuesday night the roles were reversed as the 49ers outrebounded the 
Rebels, 49-40. 
</P>
<P>
"It may not have shown up in the stats, by Cheryl Dowell really helped us, 
especially in the first half," Bonvicini said. 
</P>
<P>
Dowell was assigned to Pauline Jordan, UNLV's leading rebounder with 13.5 per 
game, who had 6 points and 7 rebounds at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach led, 52-24, at the half. The Rebels whittled down the lead as Jordan 
had 21 points and 8 rebounds in the second half, but Las Vegas could come no 
closer than the 14-point margin at the end.

Louisville. 
</P>

Pepsi-Cola Co. will air what it calls the first Spanish-language commercial on 
U.S. network television -- without subtitles or dubbing -- during Wednesday's 
Grammy Awards broadcast on CBS, the company announced Monday. The spot will 
feature Puerto Rican singer Chayanne, 20, who gained attention as a member of 
the group Los Chicos and who topped the Latin chart in the United States in 
1985 with his album "Sangre Latina." "Our international experience with 
English-speaking superstars like Michael Jackson and Tina Turner has proven 
that music has universal appeal and bridges language and cultural differences," 
Alan Pottasch, a Pepsi senior vice president, told United Press International. 
The commercial, filmed in Chile, features Chayanne's single, "Este Ritmo Se 
Baila Asi" ("You Dance That Rhythm Like This") from his current album, 
"Chayanne." Pottasch said the commercial would air following a Grammy show 
segment in which Linda Ronstadt sings in Spanish. Shauna Snow

Actress Kathleen Turner spoke to about 2,700 Girl Scouts in Springfield, Mo., 
over the weekend about her film-making career and then appeared at a 
fund-raising dinner for Girl Scout Camp Finbrooke. "The older girls mainly 
wanted to know what it was like kissing Michael Douglas" in the movies 
"Romancing the Stone" and "Jewel of the Nile," Turner said. "I told them 'he's 
not bad.' " Turner, whose mother has been a Girl Scout volunteer since the 
1960s, said she grew up with the Girl Scouts. Shauna Snow

Former presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson is taking to the TV screen again, but 
this time as a guest on NBC's "A Different World." The episode, which will be 
taped the week of March 13 (no set air date as yet), will focus on voter 
registration. "TV is the medium to reach our youth," Jackson told USA Today, 
adding that voting is a "way for our youth to choose political participation 
over guns and violence." The Jackson episode was the idea of "A Different 
World's" producer-director Debbie Allen who says her mission is to make the 
show "about something that's important, not just who's your date this Friday."

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: A CRUEL TALE IN 'RAT CATCHER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Contemporary Documentary Series 
continues at UCLA Melnitz tonight at 8 with Andrzej Czarnecki's 22-minute "The 
Rat Catcher" (1986) and Frank Heiman's 55-minute "Paradise Camp" (1986). 
</P>
<P>
The first is a creepy stunner, a close-up, deadpan look at Poland's only 
industrial rat exterminator at work, an ordinary-looking, heavy-set middle-aged 
man who takes justifiable pride in his work, which involves getting his prey to 
trust him. No doubt this man is invaluable, but Czarnecki disturbingly 
confronts us with the repelling yet clearly seductive and gratifying aspect of 
his work as a mass killer. 
</P>
<P>
Since "The Rat Catcher" so easily functions as parable, it's tasteless to have 
paired it with a film in which humans, not rats, are the victims. "Paradise 
Camp" is the usual mix of interviews with Holocaust survivors and archival 
materials, but there's a difference. The camp in question is Theresienstadt, a 
quaint walled city in Czechoslovakia, which, in cruelly deceiving propaganda -- 
including even a faked documentary -- the Nazis passed off to the Swiss Red 
Cross as a paradise for Jews and typical of all concentration camps; survivors 
attest to the fact that it too was a hell on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The New Beverly Cinema is presenting on Wednesday and Thursday (with the recent 
and exquisite "Sorceress") a rare revival of Robert Bresson's "The Trial of 
Joan of Arc," a terse, 65-minute, documentary-style courtroom drama in which 
the heroine's speeches come verbatim from historic transcripts and which 
derives its impact from Bresson's dry detachment. Florence Carrez is the 
resilient Joan, who may weep in private, but who answers her inquisitors with 
an almost monotonous matter-of-factness.

'DARWIN, DINOSAURS' ISSUE NOT EXTINCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who thinks that the debate over the teaching of evolution in our public 
schools is passe should take a look at "God, Darwin and the Dinosaurs," a 
"Nova" segment airing tonight at 8 on Channels 28 and 15 and at 9 on Channel 
50. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the battle is heating up -- witness the California State 
Department of Education ruling last month forcing a Christian school in Santee 
to separate its creationist teachings from its science courses. Religious 
fundamentalists fighting for the right to teach the biblical view of creation 
have taken a new tack -- teaching creationism as a science -- that promises to 
make the famous Scopes Monkey Trial look like a minor skirmish in the ongoing 
war over the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
Producer-writers Thomas Lucas and Larry Engel have done a solid, balanced job 
delineating complex legal and religious issues. Teachers, scientists and 
religious leaders from both sides are given sufficient time to make their 
points. 
</P>
<P>
The historical information in "God, Darwin and the Dinosaurs" is fascinating 
stuff, showing the incredible impact Charles Darwin's theory had on 
19th-Century science and 20th-Century social movements. We are also reminded 
that Scopes was convicted, that the Tennessee law stayed on the books until 
1957, and that the law was used as a model in other states, and that it wasn't 
until the 1950s that there was a rebirth of science teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Although "God, Darwin and the Dinosaurs" drags a bit toward the end, it is 
nonetheless an enlightening and interesting look at an emotional issue that 
all-too-often devolves into name-calling arguments. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

'FRONTLINE' PROBES THE LAUNDERING OF DRUG PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television reporting is rightly accused of frequently distorting or simplifying 
a subject, usually as a result of little reflection or investigative time spent 
on the issue at hand. The epidemic of the drug trade is a case in point. So 
Byzantine are the forces at work in this massive, international business that 
no government investigation anywhere, let alone journalist, has gotten to the 
bottom of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Who Profits From the Drug Trade?" (on "Frontline" tonight, at 9 on Channels 28 
and 15, 10 on Channel 50) suggests what happens when television resources and 
months of research are lavished on a story. What had been a mystery -- with 
sinister results -- begins to be comprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
As "Frontline" follows the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's (DEA) penetration of 
a multi-million-dollar drug-profits laundering operation, the viewer's whole 
perception of the drug business is altered. The DEA's Operation Man (so-called 
for Britain's Isle of Man, whose bank-secrecy laws make it a haven for 
laundering) uncovers not swarming nests of Colombian coke dealers driving 
speedboats down Florida waterways, or urban gangs enforcing "justice," but 
white, college-educated male American yuppies who know how to convert 
burdensome mountains of cash into such investment purchases as real estate and 
John Lennon's auctioned piano. 
</P>
<P>
The report's message is unmistakably political: American business, based on its 
logic of "make profits or die," is quickly becoming hooked on the drug market. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest profiteers -- outside of drug cartel warlords -- from an American 
addiction destroying the lives of countless urban poor are lawyers, 
accountants, politicians, bankers and the like. The connective thread is of 
professionals brilliantly using their skills to exploit a cultural and social 
malaise. 
</P>
<P>
"Who Profits From the Drug Trade?" is so compelling as a meticulous detective 
story that the viewer, at least for the hour the story takes to tell, suspends 
the deeper questions left unexplored here: Who needs drugs, and why? ROBERT

AUTOGRAPH PROFITS; 
</P>
<P>
FOR RETIRED ATHLETES, IT PAYS TO SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former pitching great Warren Spahn was signing autographs at a baseball card 
show in Idaho Falls, Ida., when a boy asked for his signature. When Spahn asked 
why, the boy answered: "My daddy said you're getting old and you're going to 
die soon, and it's going to be valuable." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, father and son won't have to wait for Spahn to leave life's starting 
rotation: His signature is already worth far more than the paper it's printed 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Spahn, 66, has plenty of company. Baseball's unprecedented popularity and a 
meteoric rise in the value of the national pastime's memorabilia in the 1980s 
has spawned a rapidly growing, multimillion-dollar sideline: sports autographs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earned More Than $100,000 
</P>
<P>
Retired Yankees sluggers Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio are the field's 
financial clean-up hitters. Each makes up to $30,000 for a two-day signing 
session. Mantle, whose autograph has sold for as much as $30, earned more than 
$150,000 last year signing on occasional weekends -- more than he ever made 
during a season patrolling center field at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But as autograph prices increase, so do the cries of "foul." Some fans find the 
spectacle of youngsters paying large sums for millionaire athletes' autographs 
downright unsportsmanlike. 
</P>
<P>
Others, including several baseball card show promoters, complain that the high 
prices have led to an assembly-line process that severely limits fans' 
interaction with the athletes. Some say the resulting public disillusionment 
threatens the image of the industry as well as the reputations of several of 
baseball's biggest names. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's gotten out of hand," said Bruce Paynter, a Chicago prosecutor who 
has promoted shows for the past 11 years and is producing the annual national 
show this July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'People Want Contact' 
</P>
<P>
"The ballplayer doesn't have time to look up, to pose for pictures, to talk. 
People want to have personal contact. . . . But sometimes the promoters are so 
concerned with making ends meet they might not recognize the public relations 
value of people getting to speak to the players." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Rosen, a premier dealer of old baseball cards, is blunter: "Pretty soon 
we're going to put down $20, look through a little peep hole and genuflect 
before them. It's absurd." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the gripes, the bottom line continues to rise like the trajectory of a 
Mantle home run. A record was set last month when hundreds of hobbyists and 
investors paid $30 each for autographs of Mantle and ex-Red Sox star Ted 
Williams in Atlantic City, N.J. Only months before, the going rate for Mantle's 
signature was $15; in mid-1987 it was a mere $8. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland All-Star Jose Canseco, another hot commodity on the signature circuit, 
even reported late to spring training last year because of baseball card show 
commitments. Moreover, Canseco and teammate Mark McGwire have retained a 
Newport Beach firm to sell their autographs on their used bats, jackets, socks 
and the shirts off their backs. A signed jersey from Canseco's 1988 
record-setting season of 40 home runs and 40 stolen bases goes for $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
The autographs and other memorabilia are part of a business built on a 
foundation of baseball cards -- one of the best investments of the 1980s -- 
that produces an estimated $200 million in annual sales. The industry is 
growing at a rate of 10% to 20% a year, says Bob Lemke, publisher of Sports 
Collectors Digest, Baseball Cards magazine and other Krause Publications 
periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 baseball card shows were held nationwide last year, an average 
of nearly 100 each weekend, Lemke said. Millions attended these shows, 
including an estimated 500,000 serious hobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ex-Coin Collectors 
</P>
<P>
Although boyhood collectors remain the industry's mainstays, more and more 
adult investors, including many who have switched from stamps and coins, are 
entering the market. Fathers and sons often find common ground in a hobby that 
also bridges generations of ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
Most promoters maintain they are merely providing a service that would 
otherwise not be available without painstakingly tracking down major leaguers 
at hotels or ball parks. The athletes demand an appearance fee for their time, 
which the promoters seek to recoup by charging for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
The higher the fee, the higher the charge and the greater the pressure to cram 
as many signatures as possible into a three- or four-hour appearance. The 
average player signs 300 times every 60 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent show at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, patrons paid $20 each 
for Mantle, Williams and Muhammad Ali autographs, $11 for ex-Dodger pitcher 
Sandy Koufax and $10 for all-time hit leader Pete Rose and waited in lines for 
an hour or more for each athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are great ballplayers," said Everett Sheely, 36, a general 
contractor from Orange moments after he and his 10-year-old son had obtained 
Mantle's signature. "They get hounded by people to give them autographs. If he 
gave it to me, I can turn around and sell it for $35. I don't have a problem 
(with the price) at all." 
</P>
<P>
Ali, although slowed by Parkinson's disease, created a hubbub when he entered 
the cavernous converted parking garage where the show was held and announced 
over the loudspeaker, "I am the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Books, Photos, Trunks 
</P>
<P>
The Greatest sat at a long table clad in a safari jacket, surrounded by burly 
body guards and his entourage, as fans placed before him color photos, boxing 
gloves and trunks, copies of Ali's book and, at one point, a cast on a broken 
arm. Meticulously, Ali signed each object, occasionally blowing on the ink to 
avoid a smudge. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Gonzalez, a construction supervisor, and his 7-year-old son, also named 
Mike, had driven 100 miles from Lancaster, paid their $20 and stood in line for 
90 minutes. When they reached the front, Gonzalez asked the former champ to 
inscribe his autograph to his son, even though a voice on loudspeakers 
repeatedly blared: "No personalizing." 
</P>
<P>
"To Mike, Muhammad Ali," the ex-champion wrote on a picture of himself. Then, 
he looked up, the inimitable Ali twinkle in his eye, and pinched the boy's 
cheek. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something I wanted to do all my life," Gonzalez senior gushed 
afterward. "I would have paid $100." 
</P>
<P>
The autograph business started in the mid-1970s but hit its stride recently 
when the number of baseball card shows increased dramatically. The presence of 
a big-name player began as a way to make one show more attractive than another. 
At first, the players received a nominal fee and the promoters did not charge 
for their autographs. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, 90% of the ballplayers would sign autographs if you saw them 
at the ball park or in person or mailed something to them," show promoter 
Paynter said. "What woke them up to reality was when people began sending them 
five photographs of them to autograph. They realized the person would probably 
sell four of them." 
</P>
<P>
With the proliferation of shows, the competition to attract the most idolized 
athletes intensified. It is not unusual for a dozen or more players to appear 
at a single major weekend show -- making the dealers peddling their old cards 
and other memorabilia play second fiddle to the autograph hunt. 
</P>
<P>
The up-front cost to promoters is substantial. Harlan J. Werner, a Canoga Park 
promoter, paid nine athletes -- including Mantle, Williams, Ali and Koufax -- 
more than $150,000 to do his Anaheim show in December. With a $5 admission 
charge, a $400 charge for each of the 175 dealer booths and the autograph fees, 
he said he barely broke even. He had hoped to net $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Air Fare, Limousines 
</P>
<P>
Such stakes make promoters akin to baseball general managers negotiating with a 
league of free agents. Most well-known players demand at least $2,000 for an 
appearance. In addition, the deal may include air fare, a limousine to and from 
the show and, for weekend events, accommodations for the athlete and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Mantle, who reportedly plans to sit out the rest of this year's autograph 
circuit because he's tired of the shows' demands, once put the figures in 
perspective when, Werner recalled, he said: "I get as much money for signing 
one autograph as my dad got for working a whole day in the mines." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, several promoters said, Mantle and former teammate DiMaggio keep a wary 
eye on each other's rates amid a quiet but intense rivalry to be America's 
highest-paid sports signatory. 
</P>
<P>
Mets infielder Greg Jeffries is an example of autograph inflation run amok. 
Jeffries -- whose rookie card became a hot commodity last year, spurred by 
speculation that he was a star-to-be -- joined the Mets late in the season. He 
then performed well. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted $10,000 and three first-class airline tickets -- one for his agent 
and one for his girl friend -- to do a show this winter in New York," said 
veteran promoter Jon Gallen of New York. "The guy has fewer than 50 lifetime 
hits" in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics maintain that ballplayers are paying a price for 
autograph-profiteering with a currency that cannot be measured in dollars and 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
After a well-publicized brouhaha triggered last year when legendary center 
fielder Willie Mays tried to charge for his autograph during a book-signing 
tour, Washington Post sportswriter Shirley Povich opined: 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever laid down those ground rules was a rapacious blackguard who was giving 
baseball a black eye, and giving kids' hero-worship and Norman Rockwell and his 
America a kick in the groin." 
</P>
<P>
So sensitive are athletes about the public criticism that Mantle, DiMaggio, 
Koufax, Rose and ex-Dodger pitcher Don Drysdale declined through intermediaries 
to be interviewed for this story. And at least one big-name player balks at 
doing any shows. 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly, a current Yankees star, did several shows early in his career 
but not in recent years when the first baseman became one of baseball's top 
players. His recalcitrance has prompted astronomical offers: bids have reached 
$125,000 for a two-day show in New York, according to Ray Schulte, Mattingly's 
full-time marketing agent. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Mattingly just says no. 
</P>
<P>
"The shows aren't really that well-organized and Donnie doesn't want to 
disregard some of the kids who wait on line a long time" but are turned away, 
Schulte said. He added that Mattingly signs thousands of autographs a year for 
free at the ballpark, charity events and other public places. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who do shows regularly are undisputed hits with the public. 
Former Orioles third baseman Brooks Robinson is one. Retired greats Koufax, Al 
Kaline of the Tigers, Harmon Killebrew of the Twins, Ernie Banks of the Cubs, 
Stan Musial of the Cardinals and Spahn of the Braves are also warm, cooperative 
and considerate with fans and collectors, promoters report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adulation Appreciated 
</P>
<P>
Retired players no longer in the limelight generally appreciate the adulation 
more than current stars who often take it for granted. Moreover, say industry 
veterans, many of the ex-big leaguers have more time to chat or pose for 
pictures because they are less in demand. One of those is Spahn, whose 
signature goes for about $5. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, several promoters said that Hall of Famers Mays and ex-Cardinal 
pitcher Bob Gibson are among the surliest signers. Cincinnati Reds Manager 
Rose, meanwhile, lives up to his nickname of "Charlie Hustle," industry 
veterans say. He is utterly businesslike. 
</P>
<P>
During part of a season with the Montreal Expos at the end of his playing 
career, Lemke said, Rose wore a uniform jersey for a few days and then gave it 
to his equipment agent to sell for $395 to $500. Others have done this as well 
-- with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
Players generally are issued uniforms by their respective teams but make their 
own arrangements with equipment manufacturers for bats and gloves. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers say the popularity of authentic equipment has led to the sale of 
counterfeit items. It has also made celebrities in some circles of an unlikely 
group: those in charge of uniforms and bats and balls. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to a couple of clubhouse guys who are now very popular on the 
road," said Schulte, Mattingly's marketing agent. "They have to go out the back 
door to the stadium because the collectors know who they are."

SANTA MONICA GETS WIRED: COMPUTER LINK TO CITIZENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica is officially "on line." 
</P>
<P>
Starting today, residents can sign on to their personal computers and, in 
effect, talk to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring itself "the city of the future," Santa Monica has activated a new 
computer network that puts a storehouse of information -- ranging from where to 
get a parking permit to what books are checked out of the local library -- at 
the fingertips of city residents with access to a computer keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, questions and complaints can be computer-messaged to City Hall, 
and, the city promises, officials will respond -- right to the inquiring 
resident's computer. Finally, citizens and officials can discuss burning issues 
of the day in the computer equivalent of a town hall meeting. 
</P>
<P>
When the first message bleeps up on the system's central computer, Santa Monica 
will be a pioneer in the use of interactive computer networks to enable the 
public to communicate with government. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, cities and counties across the nation are offering some form of 
public access to government information through computers. The product of an 
inevitable coupling of technology and civics, the trend is being hailed in many 
quarters as an important step toward better, more accessible government. 
</P>
<P>
Some people suggest, however, that a system based on the use of computers is 
elitist and question whether adequate security measures can be adopted to 
prevent abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that more and more cities are looking at," said Randy Arndt, a 
spokesman for the National League of Cities in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Computer access "makes a city more responsive and efficient," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain efficiencies to having a computer interface rather than an 
employee answer a phone or write a letter," Arndt said. 
</P>
<P>
California communities, Arndt said, are on the leading edge of exploring uses 
of computers to link up with their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, for example, residents already can browse through a variety of 
government data and calendars of events by home computer, and a private company 
contracted by the city expects to add an interactive system similar to Santa 
Monica's in about two months, said Edwin J. Stevens, president of the firm, 
EMDA. 
</P>
<P>
In Bay Area cities, residents are using computers to scan library catalogues to 
search for books by title, subject or author. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the country, a nonprofit organization in Cleveland offers a 
computer network through which the public can debate issues and retrieve 
information, while officials in Kansas City and Tampa, Fla., as part of an 
IBM-sponsored project called The 24-hour City Hall, have installed terminals 
with touch-sensitive screens in shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
What Santa Monica is providing, however, appears to go beyond what most other 
cities are doing and is a harbinger of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lead to Sales 
</P>
<P>
The $350,000 system, called Public Electronic Network (PEN), was donated to the 
city, with Hewlett-Packard giving the hardware and Metasystems Inc. the 
software, both hoping that this will be a showpiece leading to sales elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are offered four types of services. 
</P>
<P>
The first is the bulletin board, where users can scan a menu of topics and call 
up for reading such entries as earthquake safety tips, job openings and bus 
schedules. Also on the menu are agendas, minutes and staff reports from the 
City Council, Planning Commission and Rent Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, users can discover how to apply for licenses and permits. 
Eventually, they will be able to make applications through the computer as 
well, Assistant City Manager Lynne C. Barrette said. 
</P>
<P>
The second feature is electronic mail. A resident can send messages directly to 
City Hall with questions, comments or complaints. Answers will appear on the 
individual's computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Town Hall 
</P>
<P>
The third element is called conferencing, a sort of electronic town hall. Files 
will be opened on topics such as the homeless or the pace of development. A 
resident can enter comments, which will become part of the file and can be read 
by anyone else calling it up. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the network gives users access to a computerized library catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
People who want to log into the system will first have to register with the 
city and sign a pledge to obey computer laws. The contract also relieves the 
city of liability and preserves the city's right to deny use of the system from 
anyone who abuses it. 
</P>
<P>
Users are then assigned an identification number and given a 15-page manual. 
They choose a secret password and dial into the system. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to the city of Santa Monica's Public Electronic Network," reads the 
computer greeting. 
</P>
<P>
For people who do not own computers, terminals will be set up at libraries and 
other public centers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phone Bill 
</P>
<P>
The system is available to residents only. Its use is free, although some 
residents may see a larger phone bill if they spend a lot of time signed on. 
</P>
<P>
No special software is necessary, and any brand of computer will do, Barrette 
said. But the home computers must have a modem -- a device that enables one 
computer to hook up with another via telephone lines -- and corresponding 
communication software. 
</P>
<P>
Users will be able to "download," or pull information onto their screens, and 
those who own printers will be able to produce printouts, said Ken Phillips, 
the city's director of information systems. 
</P>
<P>
The new network is not expected to do away with the traditional ways the city 
conducts business. Concerned and angry citizens will still telephone their 
officials and write letters. Die-hard activists and persistent gadflies will 
continue to attend City Council meetings held every other Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But for people who work all day or who have little time to visit City Hall, the 
ability to log on for information at home around the clock will be a valuable 
tool, City Manager John Jalili said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's especially for those (people) who don't have time to write letters or 
call" during regular office hours, Jalili said. 
</P>
<P>
The city conducted a survey last year of 1,000 residents. Of those who 
responded, 33% said they own personal computers and 23% said their computers 
have modems. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hill, an activist from Santa Monica's Ocean Park neighborhood, first 
suggested the computer network two years ago. He said it seemed the logical way 
to enlist "participants in democracy" in an electronic age. 
</P>
<P>
"To participate effectively (in government), one needs to be informed," said 
Hill, a counselor at the Venice Skills Center, a public vocational school. 
"That has meant schlepping down to City Hall, getting staff reports, finding 
the right staff person, getting the report photocopied. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This is a marvelous way to access the staff reports, (get information) you 
want. You can play a truly effective role. People who feel disenfranchised can 
find a way to be a part of government." 
</P>
<P>
To publicize the network, the city is mailing out brochures. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine," the pamphlet says, "the city of the future . . . a city where 
computers keep you in touch with city issues and services . . . a city where 
useful information is at your fingertips any time of the day, instantly and 
free . . . that future is now in the city of Santa Monica. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Danger Warning 
</P>
<P>
There are a few voices of caution, however. Some experts in the field warn of 
the danger of "technology push" -- the eagerness to offer a sophisticated 
electronic system before the public is ready to use it or officials ready to 
handle the new demands it brings. 
</P>
<P>
"It may overburden ambivalent department heads and city employees who want to 
be responsive but aren't getting additional resources," said Judith Payne, a 
social scientist at the RAND Corp. think tank. 
</P>
<P>
The city's own programmers have been loading data into the system, and there 
are no plans to add staff. All of the messages from the PEN system will arrive 
on a central terminal in the information services office on the ground floor of 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Several officials acknowledged that they worried that the network would create 
an image of elitism, that the city was catering to the professional well-to-do 
who own personal computers and that low-income residents would be left out. 
They hoped to overcome that by installing terminals in public areas, such as 
the library. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica officials say the public-access computer network is a natural 
evolution from a decision four years ago to start up an internal electronic 
mail system for council members and top administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the seven council members was given a $3,000 briefcase-size portable 
computer, and they soon reported saving large amounts of time by discussing 
ideas and hashing out problems through computer messages. An estimated 600 city 
employees are plugged into the internal system. 
</P>
<P>
When officials considered creating a public computer system, security 
inevitably was a major concern. Several cities, in fact, have been reluctant to 
pursue similar programs because of fears that the computer system could be 
abused. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica consulted numerous security experts who tested the system, and 
officials believe that they have taken adequate precautions to stop computer 
hackers from getting into private files and to prevent "viruses" from being 
entered into the system and destroying data or programs. 
</P>
<P>
The computer network that residents will be tapping is entirely separate from 
the city staff's internal computer system, but officials have declined to 
detail other security measures. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are eager to see how residents in the beach city, which is known 
for its heated politics and liberal causes, will respond to the novel computer 
network. 
</P>
<P>
It "won't revolutionize the city overnight, but it's a significant step in 
opening up City Hall," predicted Alan Katz, chief of staff to Lt. Gov. Leo 
McCarthy and a former Santa Monica city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is the public will find uses that no one imagined," he said.

AIDS AND INMATES -- DEBATE OVER TESTING IS RENEWED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the state announced recently that it had conducted blind AIDS tests on 
prison inmates, it brought home an urgent message: An estimated 2,000 felons 
infected with the AIDS virus are entering California prisons each year. 
</P>
<P>
The large-scale testing -- in which new inmates were tested without being 
identified -- provided the first concrete evidence of the magnitude of the AIDS 
problem in the state's prisons. But it also left prison officials wondering 
just which of the 77,000 inmates in state penitentiaries are carrying the 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the state Department of Health Services study has renewed the debate over 
whether existing law should be changed to give prison authorities a free hand 
in testing inmates for the presence of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Bolstered by the study, Deukmejian Administration officials and other advocates 
of mandatory testing for acquired immune deficiency syndrome are again calling 
for passage of legislation that would allow authorities to order any inmate to 
undergo AIDS testing. 
</P>
<P>
"After seeing that report, it seems imperative to me that we do mandatory 
testing," said Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside). "Otherwise, how are we going 
to know and how are we going to prepare for it in the prison system?" 
</P>
<P>
The question of AIDS in prison has pitted corrections officials against public 
health experts, who are nearly unanimous in opposing mass screening and 
segregation of people infected with the deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
And the controversy has focused attention on a wide variety of unresolved 
issues in the complex field of AIDS policy. 
</P>
<P>
Is mandatory testing an effective way of controlling the spread of AIDS when 
there is no cure for the disease? Is it justifiable to segregate inmates who 
are infected with the virus but otherwise healthy? When these prisoners are 
released, who, if anyone, should be told of their condition? 
</P>
<P>
Some legislators and public health officials question whether conditions in 
prison are sufficiently different from those outside to justify deviating from 
the accepted approach to AIDS screening in society at large -- that is, that 
testing should be voluntary, that the results should remain confidential and 
that there is no good reason for any form of segregation. 
</P>
<P>
They also question whether the estimated $327,000 a year it would cost to test 
all new inmates could be spent more effectively on education programs aimed at 
halting the spread of the disease outside prison. 
</P>
<P>
And some fear that authorizing prison officials to test inmates could lead to 
mandatory testing of other groups outside prison and erode confidentiality 
provisions that are now a part of state law. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't just automatically say 'test them all' before we address these very 
necessary and important consequences," said Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Los 
Angeles), a key opponent of mandatory testing. "I would be much more receptive 
to proposals regarding narrow and justifiable testing if we had a clear law in 
place protecting people with AIDS from discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Transmission of the virus from one inmate to another actually is believed to be 
rare, according to Dr. Harold Jaffe of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. 
And no corrections officer has ever been proven to have become infected on the 
job, Jaffe and others said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin) said that "given what happens in the 
correctional setting, it (testing) is the only way I know to protect the other 
inmates. They do have intravenous drugs. They do have homosexual encounters." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a bill by the conservative Doolittle giving prison officials the 
power to conduct mandatory tests was approved by the Senate. But it died in the 
Assembly Public Safety Committee when Friedman and other liberal Democrats 
refused to authorize the program. This year, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco) and other Democrats have indicated they again will block a 
new version of the Doolittle bill unless their concerns about cost and 
confidentiality are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
If the Department of Corrections wins passage of the measure, officials plan to 
segregate all inmates infected with the virus in separate facilities, even 
prisoners with no symptoms of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Some states that already have enacted AIDS testing and segregation programs -- 
and even some that have not -- have found themselves facing court challenges by 
inmates. So far, the courts have tended to defer to corrections officials, 
giving them leeway in deciding which course to take. 
</P>
<P>
But last September, Prisoners' Legal Services of New York won a preliminary 
injunction barring the state from carrying out its plan to house ambulatory 
prisoners with AIDS or AIDS symptoms in a special ward. The lawsuit, still to 
be fully tried, argues that the policy violated the inmates' constitutional 
right of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a major new issue in prisoner litigation," said Claudia York, a 
Kansas City, Mo., attorney who has been representing prisoners for 10 years. 
"AIDS impacts on every constitutional issue that's been raised previously, and 
we have a new twist on it all." 
</P>
<P>
California's blind study, which tested 6,179 felons entering prison, found that 
2.55% of the men and 3.1% of the women were infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. Most of the prisoners are 
believed to have gotten the virus through intravenous drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Based on these findings, the study estimated that between 1,509 and 2,184 
inmates entering prison each year are infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
However, health officials cautioned that the study's estimates may be low 
because 227 felons who were believed to be intravenous drug users were excluded 
from the blind screening for various reasons. These inmates presumably ran a 
much higher risk of getting AIDS, and most likely would have pushed up the 
overall rate of infection in the study. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials said the results of the blind testing are in line with their 
earlier projections that between 2% and 4% of California prison inmates are 
infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, citing the results of the study, say the testing and 
segregation of HIV-positive prisoners is necessary to protect other inmates 
from exposure to the disease through sexual contact or intravenous drug use, 
both of which occur behind prison walls even though they are prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
"Prison is a situation where you're holding people in close proximity to each 
other and public health issues have to be treated differently than on the 
outside," said Steve Blankenship, Deukmejian's deputy legislative secretary. 
"The plan is to treat them as much like any other inmate as we can." 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration is backing the legislation by Doolittle that 
would require the testing of all new inmates and permit prison officials to 
order the testing of any other convicts. 
</P>
<P>
Blankenship said the Administration also is contemplating establishment of a 
permanent prison testing program. All inmates found to be infected with the 
AIDS virus but who have not developed symptoms of the disease would be placed 
in separate facilities that can hold up to 800 convicts each. These prisoners 
would have all the privileges of inmates confined in normal units, including 
the opportunity to earn reduced sentences by working, Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the plan contend that prisoners who are infected with the virus 
would benefit from being tested and segregated because they would then be 
eligible for any treatment that might prevent the onset of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates who develop symptoms of the disease would be placed in separate medical 
wards, as they are now. As of Jan. 1, there were 252 prisoners with AIDS in 
such units. 
</P>
<P>
Upon release from prison, under the Deukmejian Administration's plan, an 
inmate's parole officer and family would be notified if the prisoner had tested 
positive for exposure to the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, it is not known what percentage of the prison population is 
infected. Screening in selected systems suggests the numbers vary widely -- 
from 0.2% in the South Dakota state prisons to 17% of New York state inmates 
coming from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The rate of increase in AIDS cases among inmates has remained constant since 
1985, according to annual surveys by the National Institute of Justice, a 
federal research group, and that rate is lower than the rate of increase in the 
general population -- 60% over a recent 12-month period for inmates compared to 
76% for the general population. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, states increasingly are beginning programs of screening and 
segregation. 
</P>
<P>
As of October, 12 states and the federal Bureau of Prisons were conducting 
mandatory mass screening -- either of new inmates, current inmates or inmates 
being released. Two more had plans to shortly begin mass screening. 
</P>
<P>
Far more states offer HIV testing on request or in response to violent 
incidents or medical symptoms. Other prison systems selectively screen inmates 
believed to be at high risk of infection because of intravenous drug use or 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
As for housing, 20 states segregate inmates with AIDS, according to Larry 
Gostin of the American Society of Law and Medicine in Boston. Eight of those 
also segregate inmates with pre-AIDS symptoms and six of the 20 segregate all 
inmates infected with the virus, even if no symptoms are present. 
</P>
<P>
But the appropriateness of such practices is in hot dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The National Commission on Correctional Health Care, which represents medical 
and law enforcement officials and inmate advocates, opposes mandatory mass 
screening and special housing for anyone other than those with symptoms of 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization, American Public Health Assn. and American 
Correctional Assn. have taken similar positions. Instead of mass screening and 
segregation, they favor intensive education of inmates and prison workers about 
AIDS and how the virus spreads. 
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Correctional Health Care even quietly endorsed "the 
unorthodox conduct of making available . . . appropriate protective devices" -- 
for example, the distribution of condoms in an attempt to ensure that the virus 
does not spread in prisons through illicit sex. 
</P>
<P>
But some corrections officers believe education and safe-sex measures are not 
enough. They say infected inmates pose a risk to other inmates as well as 
guards, especially in the confined and volatile environment of a prison where 
needles and razor blades are common. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not worried about casual contact," said Fred Parks, executive director 
of the Michigan Corrections Organization, the state prison guards' union. "It's 
those other kinds." 
</P>
<P>
Now those questions are being argued in courthouses throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
In California, lawyers representing inmates with pre-AIDS symptoms or AIDS are 
challenging the conditions of their confinement and medical treatment in 
special wings set aside for inmates with the disease at state facilities in 
Vacaville, Chino and Frontera. 
</P>
<P>
A federal court in Arkansas, meanwhile, rejected an uninfected inmate's demand 
that the state begin screening and segregation. The court ruled that the 
inmate's request was based on "unsubstantiated fears and ignorance" of how the 
virus is spread. 
</P>
<P>
Other lawsuits have challenged states' policies of excluding inmates with AIDS 
from furloughs, conjugal visits, work release programs and some job training. 
Many of the pending cases allege that systems provide inadequate medical care 
for people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments in many of the cases are similar. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawyers argue that segregation -- and any accompanying loss of traditional 
prison programs and privileges -- violates a 1973 statute barring 
discrimination against handicapped people in federally funded institutions.

PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS NOW CHALLENGED BY FEDERAL LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today the Supreme Court takes up a Massachusetts employment case that seems 
narrow in scope but is actually part of an important and growing legal battle 
that affects millions of people throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The clash involves the burgeoning number of worker protection initiatives being 
launched by state and local governments and state prosecutors -- such as 
statutes requiring companies to give workers advance notice of plant closings 
-- and the attempts of business, sometimes aided by the federal government, to 
halt those efforts by asserting that they are preempted by some federal law. 
</P>
<P>
"In virtually any kind of lawsuit that is filed on employment issues today 
there is some kind of preemption defense that can be raised," said Glenn 
Rothner, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents a number of unions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Case 
</P>
<P>
Rothner is involved in a major preemption case in which Southern California 
Edison has asserted that the National Labor Relations Act preempts an 
employee's right to assert in state court that the company's drug-testing 
program violates the California Constitution's right-to-privacy provision. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Jackson, a San Francisco lawyer who represents corporations in labor 
matters, agreed that preemption cases have become increasingly important in 
recent years and are now at the cutting edge of employment-related litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The legal battles, ranging from a Los Angeles taxi franchise case to a Maine 
severance pay provision, are the outgrowth of some profound shifts in American 
life, particularly the diminished power of unions and the increased propensity 
of many state governments to regulate certain aspects of workplace life. 
</P>
<P>
The potential impact of many of these cases can be seen by the volume of 
friend-of-the-court briefs filed in them. Last year, 17 states, the AFL-CIO and 
other groups wrote briefs in support of Illinois in a case where a division of 
Magic Chef Inc. asserted that the National Labor Relations Act preempted an 
Illinois law that prohibits employers from firing workers simply because they 
have filed workers' compensation claims. 
</P>
<P>
The case being heard by the Supreme Court today involves a Boston banker, 
Richard Morash, who is challenging the constitutionality of a 1985 state law 
requiring any employer who discharges a worker in Massachusetts to pay all 
unpaid wages, including accrued vacation pay, to the employee on the day of the 
discharge. 
</P>
<P>
Morash contends that this rule should be overturned under the Constitution's 
supremacy clause because it conflicts with, and is preempted by, federal law, a 
contention Massachusetts vigorously disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The Morash case will not be the last word on preemption law, according to legal 
scholars. However, if the Supreme Court upholds the Massachusetts law, it could 
create a more favorable atmosphere for states to enact similar regulations, 
said Clyde Summers, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, preemption issues have also been raised in many other cases in 
state and federal courts, including a number that ultimately reached the 
Supreme Court. The results of the cases have been mixed, but enough of them 
have been resolved in favor of pro-worker state regulations that union lawyers 
and strategists believe that new avenues have been opened to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tremendous Inroads' 
</P>
<P>
"States have been making tremendous inroads in employment law," said Jackson, 
the San Francisco attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for all the activity at the state level is a recognition of the fact 
that the vast majority of American workers are unorganized and in need of more 
legal protection, according to Summers, who has been studying the trend. 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that workplace governance in the United States has not developed 
in the manner anticipated when the National Labor Relations Act, authored by 
Sen. Robert Wagner of New York, was enacted in 1935. The law gave formal 
protections to people participating in union organizing campaigns and put the 
government's stamp of approval on collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
"When we passed the Wagner Act . . . we created an image that we were going to 
regulate the labor market in this country through collective bargaining" rather 
than controlling it through a series of laws governing separate issues 
affecting workers, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 years ago, "it began to dawn on people that this had not come to 
pass," Summers said. "We had not achieved a (broad) system of collective 
bargaining; it was only a fraction of the labor market. As that awareness 
dawned, people began to ask themselves, 'What are we going to do about all the 
people who are not protected by collective bargaining that need to have 
protection from some other source?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Management Unhappy 
</P>
<P>
Initially, he said, the federal government began to fill some of those gaps 
through passage of laws such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the 
Employees Retirement and Income Security Act, the federal statute at issue in 
the Morash case. Then state and local governments began to get in on the act 
and management was unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
Companies, particularly national companies, are deeply concerned with having to 
comply with a welter of disparate regulations on the same subject, so they file 
preemption challenges, said R. Theodore Clark, a senior partner at 
Chicago-based Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather &amp; Geraldson, the nation's largest 
labor law firm on management's side. 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley labor law professor David Feller said the preemption conflict 
reflects the ironic convergence of two seemingly contradictory trends that have 
emerged in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is now a much larger constituency to provide legislation to protect 
individual workers," while there is a smaller constituency to strengthen the 
National Labor Relations Act, which offers workers collective protections, 
Feller said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the result of the decline of collective bargaining and the decline of 
unionism," said Feller, who once served as general counsel to the United 
Steelworkers of America. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan's appointment of conservatives to the federal 
bench and the National Labor Relations Board also prompted organized labor to 
look for relief in other venues, such as state courts and state legislatures, 
said Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco labor lawyer who writes a number of 
appellate court briefs for the AFL-CIO. "People are looking for alternatives to 
the NLRB," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This represents a marked change from the past, said Washington labor lawyer 
Michael Gottesman. Historically, organized labor viewed state courts as 
oppressive tribunals that issued picketing injunctions at the drop of a hat and 
state legislatures as enemy territory where conservative officeholders 
attempted to pass laws restricting organizer activity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Laws 
</P>
<P>
For years after the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, the labor 
movement looked to federal laws as protections that were uniform throughout the 
country. In the past, it was predominantly unions that raised preemption 
challenges, trying to knock out state laws or administrative decisions it 
considered unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Reagan. The increasingly difficult climate for labor in Washington 
and at the bargaining table has prompted a fundamental re-examination of how 
labor can best achieve its goals, including the use of state courts, challenges 
to the all-encompassing primacy of federal labor laws and a willingness to 
support cases filed by individual employees seeking the establishment of 
minimum labor standards in certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
"These are tactical choices," Gottesman said. "In an ideal world, the country 
would be better with unified labor law," but he quickly added that the world is 
far from ideal and that the labor movement has to adapt to changed 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's unrealistic to think (non-unionized) employees will sit idly by," 
waiting to get collective bargaining to give them greater protection. The 
movement to give these workers greater protections "will not go away," 
Gottesman said. "The labor movement's intelligentsia has been philosophically 
reluctant to openly advocate that, as a legal proposition, states have open 
season. But the pressures are irresistible." 
</P>
<P>
And such pressures create complications for labor, said David Silberman, the 
AFL-CIO's associate general counsel. "On the one hand, the notion that a state 
could enact a cap on wages or could fix wages certainly takes a lot away from 
the collective bargaining process," Silberman said. "On the other hand, there 
are all kinds of minimum labor standards that look desirable to us." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, organized labor has supported raising the minimum wage beyond the $3.35 
an hour the federal government set it at in 1981. There is no preemption issue 
on minimum wages and 11 states, including California, have a minimum above the 
$3.35 level. 
</P>
<P>
But while no one is raising the preemption issue regarding state minimum wage 
laws, many other state laws offering greater worker protection are being 
challenged on that basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toxic Chemicals 
</P>
<P>
One of the most heavily litigated issues are state laws directing employers to 
give workers and communities information about the toxic chemicals they are 
using. Although President Reagan espoused "states rights," his aides supported 
legal challenges by business groups to state "right-to-know" laws compelling 
disclosure of information about toxic chemicals that were stronger than those 
enacted subsequently by the federal Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, an agency whose political tilt shifted sharply after Reagan 
became President. 
</P>
<P>
A protracted court battle on the state disclosure laws has been something of a 
draw. In three separate cases in 1985 and 1986, a federal appeals court in 
Philadelphia ruled that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act 
preempted state "right-to-know" laws as they applied to employees. However, the 
court upheld the state laws as they apply to workplaces not covered by the 
federal OSHA standard or if the laws are designed to protect the public or the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
In several of the major cases, though, workers, unions and the states have 
emerged victorious. For example: 
</P>
<P>
Last June, the court unanimously upheld the Illinois statute on workers' 
compensation-related firings in the case of Jonna Lingle vs. Norge Division of 
Magic Chef Inc. This was considered a particularly important precedent because 
the fired worker, Lingle, was a union member whose contract had a provision 
saying that employees could only be discharged for "just cause." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the company's assertion that Lingle 
should be barred from filing a state court damages suit in which she could be 
awarded monetary damages because there was a remedy available to her in the 
collective bargaining agreement. The company contended that since an 
interpretation of the agreement was required, the matter came under the 
National Labor Relations Act and was therefore preempted. 
</P>
<P>
But Justice John Paul Stevens' opinion for the entire court said there was no 
need to interpret the collective bargaining agreement because the facts showed 
that the company had fired Lingle in clear violation of the Illinois law. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld a Maine law 
requiring employers to provide a one-time severance payment to employees not 
covered by an express contract providing for severance pay. The court held that 
Maine's law was not preempted by federal law. Maine's "establishment of a 
minimum labor standard does not impermissibly intrude upon the collective 
bargaining process," the majority opinion stated. 
</P>
<P>
But the states and their labor allies certainly have not won all the recent 
preemption cases. For example: 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1986, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, ruled that a 
Wisconsin statute was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. That law 
prohibited a state agency from awarding a contract to a company that had 
frequently violated the National Labor Relations Act. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1986, in an 8-1 opinion, the high court ruled that the city of Los 
Angeles' denial of a taxi franchise to a company until it settled a strike 
"destroyed the balance of power designed by Congress" in the National Labor 
Relations Act "and frustrated Congress' decision to leave open the use of 
economic weapons." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are still situations in which union lawyers argue in favor of 
preemption. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the time now, they are arguing against preemption and in favor of 
greater state authority in the workplace. Just a few weeks ago, they were 
pleased by a highly awaited decision by the Illinois Supreme Court. In a 
unanimous opinion, the Illinois court ruled that the federal Occupational 
Safety and Health Act does not preempt local prosecutors from bringing their 
own criminal cases against employers who knowingly endanger workers on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"It is totally unreasonable to conclude that Congress intended OSHA's penalties 
would be the only sanctions available for wrongful conduct which threatens or 
results in serious physical injury or death to workers," the court wrote. 
</P>
<P>
State criminal prosecutions of safety and health violations are considered 
important because in 18 years, the federal government has filed only 14 
criminal cases against OSHA violators. Although the decision is not binding on 
any state other than Illinois, and is likely to be appealed, it is the 
highest-level ruling on the issue to date and is considered likely to spur more 
criminal prosecutions of workplace safety violations. Local prosecutors from 
Boston, New York and Los Angeles, who have filed similar cases, wrote amicus 
briefs on behalf of Cook County prosecutors who had charged five executives of 
Chicago Magnet Wire Co. with aggravated battery and reckless conduct because of 
safety conditions at the company's Elk Grove, Ill., plant. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Chatten Brown, head of the occupational safety unit in the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office, praised the decision, saying that states and 
localities had "a deeply rooted interest" in protecting worker safety that 
should not be usurped.

ADMINISTRATION SENDS PANEL FBI REPORT ON TOWER; NO DAMAGING EVIDENCE SEEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The White House on Monday sent the Senate Armed Services Committee the final 
results of an investigation which Bush Administration officials said turned up 
no evidence to derail the nomination of Defense Secretary-designate John Tower. 
</P>
<P>
The delivery of the FBI's 140-page report is expected to clear the way for a 
Senate floor showdown on Tower's confirmation, possibly before the end of this 
week. The FBI report was delivered to the White House on Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, returning by helicopter from his presidential retreat at Camp 
David, Md., gave a vigorous "thumbs-up" gesture Monday when asked by reporters 
how Tower, a former senator from Texas, had fared in the latest FBI background 
check. After being briefed on the report's contents, Bush sent White House 
Counsel C. Boyden Gray to deliver the report to the Senate panel. 
</P>
<P>
"The report shows no reason why Sen. Tower should not be confirmed, in our 
judgment," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. "The President 
urges that Sen. Tower be confirmed as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The report is known to include the results of detailed questioning on 
allegations that defense contractors' funds ended up in Tower's last Senate 
campaign, but there was no indication that Tower had any knowledge of the 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Also covered in the report were so-called "life style" aspects of Tower's 
career. Among those interviewed, an Administration source said, was Kenneth L. 
Adelman, former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, who 
alleged last week that Tower's indiscretions while heading the U.S. strategic 
arms negotiations in Geneva raised questions about his overall judgment. 
However, it was learned, Adelman was unable to provide many specifics to 
support his overall criticism. 
</P>
<P>
And as the Senate committee neared the end of its deliberations, a national 
poll showed that Americans oppose Tower's nomination by a 2-1 margin. In a 
Louis Harris poll, conducted between Feb. 10-14, a majority of every major 
segment of the American population -- including evangelical Christians, 
conservatives and those who voted for Bush last November -- said they were 
against the choice of Tower as defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"The best-educated people are against (Tower), and he has no conservative 
backing either," Harris told The Times. "There's no major group that's for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stalled by Allegations 
</P>
<P>
Tower's confirmation has been stalled for more than three weeks by allegations 
of drinking and womanizing, and, more recently, by charges that he accepted 
allegedly illegal campaign contributions from defense consultants. 
</P>
<P>
While President Bush has stood firmly behind Tower during the Senate 
deliberations, Harris said that Bush's choice of Tower also has dragged down 
ratings of the President's performance. By a 62%-29% margin, a majority of 
those polled faulted Bush's judgment in naming Tower to the top Pentagon post. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) told reporters Monday 
that the panel will vote this week on whether to recommend Tower's confirmation 
to the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said Monday that he would meet with individual members of the Armed 
Services Committee today and that a full committee session would be possible on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials are pressing Senate leaders to schedule a final floor 
vote as soon as possible after the committee is polled, possibly by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the Senate's deliberations has become critical, since Bush will 
be traveling to Japan and several other East Asian capitals between Wednesday 
and next Monday. If the Senate rejects Tower's nomination while Bush is 
consulting with foreign heads of state, some analysts fear the political damage 
to Bush could be extensive. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn refused to rule out the possibility that Monday's FBI report would be the 
final one, although he said he would like to make a final decision on whether 
to support Tower after reading the report. But he said he would not announce 
his position until other committee members have read the report. 
</P>
<P>
Staff aides of Nunn's Senate panel on Monday interviewed State Department 
investigator Berne Indahl, one of two government investigators who probed 
security lapses at the headquarters of the U.S. arms negotiating team in Geneva 
during 1985-86. Indahl was said to have "independent corroboration" of reports 
that Tower maintained two secretaries as mistresses while he was a member of 
the U.S. negotiating team in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
According to congressional sources, Indahl on Monday backed off none of his 
earlier testimony relating to Tower's activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Mohammed Hassan Sharq resigned Monday, broadening the power of 
President Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
Sharq, 63, had remained in Najibullah's 28-member Cabinet after a weekend 
shake-up in which the president replaced seven of 10 non-Communist Party 
ministers with members of his Marxist People's Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Sharq is not a member of the ruling party but had been selected as premier by 
Najibullah last May to help portray his government as enjoying broader support. 
</P>
<P>
A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said Sharq met with Najibullah and 
agreed that the president should head the Cabinet during the state of emergency 
that was declared Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Also over the weekend, Najibullah created a new military council that appeared 
to take over as the most powerful body in his government. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-member Supreme Military Council for the Defense of the Homeland met 
Monday to discuss the government's battle against the guerrillas. It consists 
of the most powerful Cabinet members, the Communist Party Politburo and Central 
Committee and military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said Sunday that the council will coordinate 
economic and military activities. He said it would not replace the Cabinet, but 
he did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, meanwhile, Muslim rebel leaders attempting to organize an interim 
Afghan government in exile again made little progress Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The last Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan last week, ending the Red 
Army's nine-year intervention and leaving Najibullah's forces alone in the 
fight against the U.S.-supported guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas and some Western diplomats believe the government in Kabul will 
soon fall without the help of Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
Sharq's resignation after nine months in office had been widely expected, but 
the reasons were not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
One government source said he had cited poor health. Another said he and 
Najibullah had mutually agreed on the move. The premier's office would only say 
that Sharq was at home. 
</P>
<P>
Sharq's appointment last year was portrayed as a sign that the People's 
Democratic Party, which seized power in 1978, was prepared to share power, and 
he was given a high profile. But Western-backed rebels dismissed him and 
refused to contemplate joining any coalition with the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency, declared over the weekend, suspends or limits freedom 
of expression, privacy and public assembly.

GREEK COURT DROPS WEAPONS CHARGE ON ARAB WANTED IN U.S.

PIRAEUS, Greece 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Palestinian sought by the United States in the 1982 bombing of a Pan American 
jetliner was cleared Monday of illegal weapons charges after a homemade knife 
was found in his prison cell. 
</P>
<P>
The court decision came after an anonymous telephone caller said a bomb had 
been planted in the heavily guarded courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Bomb squad units with dogs searched the court in Piraeus, Athens' main port, 
for two hours but failed to find any explosives. 
</P>
<P>
The trial then resumed and Mohammed Rashid, 39, was cleared of the misdemeanor 
weapons charges. He was returned to Korydallos prison, where he has been jailed 
since his arrest in Piraeus in May. 
</P>
<P>
"I had it (the knife) because I fear for my life. I also fear they may 
extradite me to the United States," Rashid told reporters in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Found During Jail Search 
</P>
<P>
Prison guards found the knife and a file in Rashid's cell during a random 
search on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the objects found in his cell could really be used to harm 
anyone," prosecutor Zacharias Kokkinakis told the court. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member panel of judges acted on the prosecutor's suggestion and voted 
2 to 1 in favor of acquitting Rashid. 
</P>
<P>
Rashid is wanted by U.S. authorities on charges of planting a bomb that 
exploded aboard a Pan Am jet over Hawaii. A Japanese teen-ager was killed and 
15 people were injured in the blast. The explosion blew a hole in the fuselage, 
but the plane was able to land safely in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek Supreme Court twice has delayed a decision on whether to extradite 
Rashid. The case was further delayed last month when three Supreme Court judges 
resigned after a terrorist group responsible for killing a Supreme Court 
prosecutor threatened to act against court officials if Rashid were extradited. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has called the case a test of Greek willingness to cooperate in the 
fight against terrorism and warned Athens that relations could be damaged 
unless Rashid is handed over. 
</P>
<P>
Rashid was arrested after a U.S. tip last May when he was in Greece on a 
four-day transit visa. He served five months in jail for using a false Syrian 
passport and has been held since, pending a decision on extradition.

BLACK MARKET BASED ON 'BEER STANDARD' FLOURISHES IN MARXIST ANGOLA 
</P>

LUANDA, Angola 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Domingos Francisco, a 15-year-old in a Michael Jackson T-shirt, studied the 
passing prey from behind mirrored sunglasses. Slowly, he began to grin the grin 
of dollar signs. He had a live one. 
</P>
<P>
"Have a look," he said, selecting a slightly scuffed black loafer from his 
tilted wooden table. "Real Italian leather. A good price, too." 
</P>
<P>
How much? 
</P>
<P>
"Sixty thousand kwanzas," said the would-be tycoon. At Angola's bank, about 
$2,000. On Angola's quirky black market, based on a "beer standard," about 24 
cans of Heineken. 
</P>
<P>
Good old Western capitalism, with a touch of Yankee profiteering, is surfacing 
in the darndest places in Africa. Here in Marxist Angola, atop a sunbaked old 
trash dump overlooking the Atlantic, is a new market called Roque Santeiro, 
"the miracle worker." And anyone with a little nerve can make a fast buck. 
</P>
<P>
It's all illegal, of course. But everyone from Angolan police officers to Cuban 
soldiers to Portuguese diplomats are too mesmerized by the sheer variety of the 
selection to complain: light bulbs and batteries, argyle socks and Winston 
cigarettes, lace panties and nylon boxer shorts, even toy trucks. All theirs 
for a fistful of kwanzas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Overlooks It 
</P>
<P>
And the Angolan government, trying to resurrect an entrepreneurial spirit 
deadened by 13 years of state controls, is looking the other way. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been an intoxication here with the rhetoric of Marxism over the 
years," the ambassador of a small African nation said recently. "But in 
practical terms, between us, it doesn't amount to much today." 
</P>
<P>
All across Africa, from Tanzania and Ghana -- birthplaces of African socialism 
-- to Mozambique and Congo, capitalism is peeking out from beneath the 
smothering blanket of Marxism. Countries are peddling their state enterprises 
to private firms, letting their currencies float, lifting price controls and 
generally trying to ride free-market forces out of their troubles. 
</P>
<P>
The independence movement in Namibia, for example, is amending its long 
commitment to socialism as it prepares to take over the newest sovereign nation 
in Africa. Seeing the rough going for state control in most of Africa, the 
South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) recently announced that it 
supports limited private enterprise in an independent Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deal With Realities' 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has to deal with realities," Anatoly L. Adamishin, the Soviet 
Union's deputy foreign minister for Africa, said recently. "Personally, I don't 
think they are going to build socialism in Namibia. And there are few people in 
the Soviet Union who would advise them to." 
</P>
<P>
Angola is the newest and one of the most surprising examples of Africa's move 
away from state-controlled economies. 
</P>
<P>
Strongly tied to the Soviet Union and officially unrecognized by the United 
States, the Angolan government began to embrace a free-market economic recovery 
plan about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The government has not accomplished much so far, but it has drafted some new 
laws, ended price controls on fruits and vegetables and promised to eventually 
sell off the state-run companies, open a Chamber of Commerce and invite foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
But the nation's change of heart, along with its willingness to sign the 
U.S.-mediated peace accord with Cuba and South Africa, has raised hopes here 
not only for an economic recovery but also for a thaw in Angolan-American 
relations and an increase in development aid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Earnings Finance War 
</P>
<P>
Although rich in oil and easily capable of feeding itself, Angola remains one 
of Africa's least-developed countries. About half of the country's oil earnings 
is used to pay for its 13-year war with the U.S.-backed rebels of Jonas 
Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. (The Soviet 
Union contributes $1.5 billion a year in military assistance to the government, 
U.S. officials say.) 
</P>
<P>
The war has forced 1 million people from their homes in the countryside, 
leaving them with a margin of survival that is "very, very slim," a U.N. relief 
worker said. One child in three dies before its fifth birthday. Only in 
Afghanistan and Mozambique do children have less of a chance to survive. 
</P>
<P>
The seaside capital of Luanda, once a picture postcard of coffeehouses and 
Portuguese architecture, is a study in decay. Many elevators have not worked 
for years, and long ago the salt air turned the pastel facades a slate gray. 
Interruptions in the water supply are so frequent and persistent that one 
embassy keeps a private stock and sends its workers home with buckets full. 
Hospitals exist, but medicine does not. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens if we get sick?" a recently arrived relief worker asked an 
Angolan health official. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're tough, you live," the official said. "If you're not, you die." 
</P>
<P>
Housing is scarce, and foreign diplomats, relief officials and even U.N. 
workers must often spend months in crowded, $100-a-night government hotels 
awaiting permanent accommodations. Large steel crates used for oceangoing 
freight are being turned into middle-class housing in one neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
One of Angola's most glaring shortages is of skilled workers. Hundreds of 
thousands of Portuguese workers, from plumbers to economists, left in 1975 when 
Angola became independent from Portugal. Now Angola spends much of its valuable 
foreign exchange earnings to hire foreign companies for the simplest tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Luanda's garbage, for example, is carried away these days by a German-owned 
firm, run by Swiss managers, that imports everything from trucks to garbage 
bins. 
</P>
<P>
Roque Santeiro is one of the signs that things are changing in Angola. The 
market pulses like a Prohibition-era saloon, festive and nervous. On a recent 
afternoon, a pair of Angolan soldiers chasing a thief through the crowd fired 
two shots into the air, sending hundreds of women with heavy shopping bags 
diving for cover beneath wooden tables topped with merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, I try not to come here. I don't feel safe," Alice Schacht, a 
38-year-old single mother, confided. "But at least you can buy things." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shelves Are Never Bare 
</P>
<P>
Roque Santeiro, and several new markets like it, are the only places in Luanda 
where the shelves are never bare. Striped slacks, soda pop, watches, children's 
shoes, tape players, shoes, deodorant spray and irons are among the goods that 
seem to materialize out of thin air. Prices at the market are set by the force 
of demand, not by government fiat as in the rest of Angola. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere else in the world, some people work in the government and other 
people prefer to work in the market. That's what we do here," said a woman 
selling children's clothing, who identified herself only as Maria. "If we buy 
this pack of cigarettes for 2,000, and sell it for 2,500, we win 500. Then we 
take that money and look for other things to sell." 
</P>
<P>
Domingos Francisco, like most of the marketeers, buys his wares early each 
morning at the docks from ships arriving from Europe. When school lets out, he 
becomes a shopkeeper, carefully displaying only one shoe of a pair to guard 
against theft. He says he makes a profit of about $2.50 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"My family needs many things," he said, "so I must sell things to try and help 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The markets serve a valuable purpose in Angola's economy by providing a safety 
valve for the overvalued local currency. The official exchange rate is 29 
kwanzas to the dollar at the bank, but everywhere else it is 2,000 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
That puts foreign embassies and foreign companies in a bind. To pay their local 
employees a living wage would require millions of dollars at the official 
exchange rate. A pair of shoes at Francisco's stand would cost $2,000, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
So, many foreign firms use the "beer standard" to meet their payrolls. They 
give employees credit at a government supermarket that caters to foreigners and 
accepts only dollars. The workers use their credit to buy Heineken or Beck's 
beer, for about 50 cents a can, then carry the beer across the street and sell 
it for 1,000 kwanzas a can, roughly 70 times the price at the official rate of 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Beer, hot or cold, is the most readily convertible currency in Angola. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pushed by Lenders 
</P>
<P>
Like most countries in Africa, Angola was pushed toward free-market principles 
by its need for Western development help. Organizations such as the World Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund, heavily influenced by the United States, 
insist on a Western-style economic recovery plan before lending money or 
assistance to African nations. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the only major relief organizations working in Angola were 
UNICEF and the Red Cross. But half a dozen international relief agencies have 
set up offices or made exploratory visits in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The desire for friendship with the United States burns deeply, and it was 
partly for this reason that Angola agreed to the recent peace accord that calls 
for 50,000 Cuban troops to leave Angola and for free elections in neighboring 
Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Angola remains entwined in a superpower stalemate. While both the Soviet 
Union and the United States supported the peace agreement, the Soviets continue 
to support the government army and the Americans continue to support the 
anti-government guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Oil Companies Active 
</P>
<P>
Americans already do plenty of business with Angola. American oil companies 
extract 90% of this country's petroleum. UNICEF distributes $6 million a year 
in U.S. food aid. But the United States has never had formal diplomatic ties 
with the Angolan government. 
</P>
<P>
"Normalization of relations with the United States is very important to us," 
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos told American journalists recently. 
"We have a poor and small country. We have no interest in confrontation with a 
superpower." 
</P>
<P>
A prime piece of real estate near Luanda is often cited as evidence of Angola's 
sincerity. Situated on a hilltop with sweeping ocean views, the plot has been 
vacant throughout the more than 13 years of independence. 
</P>
<P>
Local folklore has it that the government is holding the lot open for an 
American embassy.

A U.S. Navy captain on trial for not rescuing Vietnamese refugees was

Balian, commander of the amphibious transport Dubuque, is charged with 
dereliction of duty for failing to rescue a boatload of refugees encountered by 
his ship in the South China Sea last June. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees said they turned to cannibalism after the Dubuque left them. Just 52 
of the 110 who left Vietnam survived the journey. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield was captain of the Kilauea, a civilian ship steaming behind the 
Dubuque. 
</P>
<P>
"He expressed to me remorse. I guess it was disappointment" that he had to 
leave the refugees behind, Butterfield said, recalling the radio conversation 
he said he had with Balian after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. naval ships, according to Navy rules, may pick up refugees if their craft 
is unseaworthy, if there are sick or injured aboard or if the refugees face 
imminent death. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield said Balian advised him he was not picking up the refugees but had 
given them food, water and navigational assistance. He said his impression from 
Balian was "these people were not in distress" and that the boat was seaworthy. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, in its second week, is being held at the U.S. naval base at Subic 
Bay. If convicted, Balian faces a maximum prison sentence of four years and 
three months, thousands of dollars in fines, discharge and loss of naval 
benefits.

PAYOFFS, KICKBACKS CALLED ROUTINE IN NAVAJO SYSTEM

John Paddock, a construction contractor hoping to land work on the Navajo 
reservation, said he picked up the $700 tab when Peter MacDonald and his wife 
flew to Las Vegas two years ago to celebrate MacDonald's reelection as chairman 
of the Navajo Tribal Council. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of several payments and gifts to MacDonald that Paddock estimated 
eventually cost him more than $110,000. "I felt it was just the price of doing 
business," Paddock told congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Similar stories told to a Senate special investigating committee have raised a 
furor on the Navajo reservation, where MacDonald and his critics are now 
struggling for political control. 
</P>
<P>
The hearings, which resume today, are examining problems on the Indian 
reservations. They have prompted widespread concern about the laws and 
regulations that govern Indian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gap in Law Seen 
</P>
<P>
"(The hearings) point out a serious gap in federal law that allows bribes and 
kickbacks in the Indian country" to go unpunished, Sen. Dennis DeConcini 
(D-Ariz.), chairman of the subcommittee, said. "Tribes need to have an 
independent court system and independent law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee is trying to determine whether new laws are needed to combat 
corruption, sexual abuse of children, ties to organized crime, inadequate 
medical services and other problems on reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The first round of hearings started Jan. 30. A second round is to open in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
"The long-term solution is self-sufficiency," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), 
one of the subcommittee members, "but we must (act now) to change the policies, 
regulations and laws that govern the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other 
agencies." 
</P>
<P>
The BIA is the largest of the 17 government agencies that manage Indian 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The need for new laws is disputed by some legislators, BIA officials and 
Indians who believe that more legislation will only aggravate their problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say," said Russell Means, an Indian activist who has called for 
abolition of the BIA, "every time the U.S. government has interfered with 
American Indian life styles, it has proven to be disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
The debate centers around the conflict between the tribal leadership and the 
federal government that has raged since the Indians were forced onto 
reservations in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the North American tribes represented a variety of beliefs, 
languages and organizations. "(The government's attempt) to make them all 
conform to one model was part of the problem" said Rayna Green, a Cherokee who 
directs the Smithsonian Institution's American Indian program. 
</P>
<P>
Many Indians say that federal policy toward the Indians has been a failure from 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Switchbacks in Policy 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1900s, the government tried to integrate the reservation Indians 
with the general population. Then in 1934, Congress passed the Indian 
Reservation Act, urging the tribes instead to develop their own governments and 
written constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
The Dwight D. Eisenhower Administration sought to cancel many federal 
obligations to the Indians. That policy gave way during the Richard M. Nixon 
Administration to promotion of self-determination, and the tribes were pushed 
to become independent and self-sufficient entities. 
</P>
<P>
Green said that most Indians want the government to continue to fulfill 
obligations to tribal Americans established through more than 300 treaties. She 
drew a distinction, however, between fulfilling obligations and meddling in 
Indian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The government should fulfill their treaty obligations to us as we have 
mutually defined them," she said. "What they should not do is redefine those 
obligations" without consulting Indian officials. 
</P>
<P>
While few Indians are calling for withdrawal of government aid, many say they 
fear that new laws respecting the tribes would only aggravate conditions on the 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government, they say, is not in a position to know what is best for 
any given tribe, and should allow Indian governments to manage their own 
affairs locally. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell (D-Colo.), the only Indian serving in Congress, 
said that laws intended to help the Indians often have the opposite effect. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, Campbell said, "whatever they are going to propose is not going to 
solve the problem." He said that Congress needs to adopt a more "hands-off" 
attitude toward Indian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini said he believes there is a middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
He said the committee is likely to propose making tribal leaders subject to the 
same criminal laws as city, county and state officials, but that legislators 
should keep in mind the goal of reducing tribal dependence on the federal 
government and the goal of self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Wilma Mankiller, chief of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, said that any new 
federal legislation should promote local control by tribal leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Mankiller, who is known for her willingness to work with the federal 
government, called the Bureau of Indian Affairs "an anachronism." She said 
Congress should streamline the agency to "make it more responsive to the 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the bureau, which employs nearly 14,000 people and has an annual 
operating budget of about $1.5 billion, say that mismanagement is pervasive. 
</P>
<P>
"The complexity of the . . . Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs . . 
. is paralleled only by their Byzantine accounting, auditing and record-keeping 
practices," DeConcini said in his opening statement at the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
McCain called it "well-meaning incompetence." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Ragsdale, the agency's interim director, disputed McCain's characterization 
and compared the bureau to a car that simply needs a tune-up. 
</P>
<P>
The outgoing BIA director, Ross Swimmer, acknowledged the bureau's shortcomings 
and said he hopes its involvement in Indian affairs eventually can be reduced. 
Swimmer, a former chief of the Cherokee Nation, called for a "simple transfer 
of authority and responsibility" from the BIA to tribal governments over the 
next 10 years.

LEGISLATOR SAYS HE WILL CHALLENGE SEATING OF DUKE

<P>
A freshman legislator said Monday he will challenge the seating of former Ku 
Klux Klan leader David Duke when the Legislature convenes in a special session 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
In Metairie, the nearly all-white suburb of New Orleans where Duke was elected, 
David Sherman, a lawyer who convened a private meeting Monday night, said that 
a group of citizens would sue, questioning Duke's residency, if the 
legislator's challenge failed. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, 38, defeated home builder and fellow Republican John Treen, 63, in 
Saturday's election for a seat in the Louisiana House, despite endorsements for 
Treen from President Bush, former President Ronald Reagan and powerful 
political figures in suburban New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at Duke's headquarters said he could not be reached for comment on the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Odon Bacque, the only registered independent in the House, said he will 
challenge Duke's seating on grounds that Duke did not live in the district for 
a year, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents said that utility records showed Duke's condominium had no 
electricity for the first six months he said he lived there. They noted that 
papers he filed during his 1988 presidential campaign listed a different 
address, outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
Duke has said he did indeed live in the district and on Sunday dismissed 
further questions as frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents were unable to get Duke's name off the ballot before the election 
because state law limits such challenges to 10 days after a candidate signs up 
to run. Duke is scheduled to be sworn in Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bacque said several legislators have tried to persuade him to change his mind 
because the publicity would hurt the state. "Some things are right and some 
things are wrong," he said. "I have no problem with him being elected if he did 
it the right way." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gov. Buddy Roemer, in his first public statement on the election, 
said it reflected the will of the voters in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"In a democracy, that fact must be respected regardless of what one might think 
personally about David Duke's philosophical principles," he said.

SOVIETS, IN A FIRST, FLY ACROSS BERING STRAIT FOR TALKS IN ALASKA

For the first time ever, an Aeroflot passenger jet Monday flew across the 
Bering Strait to Alaska, delivering government officials from the Soviet Far 
East for talks about trade and travel across the U.S.-Soviet maritime border. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ecstatic to be here," said Vyacheslav Kobets, chairman of the Magadan 
region, after embracing Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet plane carried 100 people -- Soviet Far East Communist Party and 
government officials, Soviet and foreign journalists, musicians, dancers, 
teachers, students, scientists, researchers, workers and Soviet Eskimos. 
</P>
<P>
A large crowd appeared at Anchorage International Airport to see what airport 
officials said was the first Soviet jetliner to fly across the Bering Sea 
border to nearby Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
At a brief news conference, government leaders from Alaska and the Soviet Far 
East congratulated each other for making the unprecedented trip a reality. 
</P>
<P>
A single previous official delegation from the Soviet Union traveled across the 
Bering Strait by boat. That group was small and not nearly as diverse as 
Monday's Aeroflot flight. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation will spend a week in Alaska, talking trade and tourism but also 
being tourists themselves, with about half the group staying in private homes. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important ways to establish strong personal relations is to 
have fun together," Cowper said. A lot of that fun was planned for two concerts 
next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been able to take steps to melt the 'Ice Curtain' that has existed 
between Alaska and the Soviet Union since 1948," Cowper told a crowd of 
international journalists.

TWISTERS HIT LOUISIANA TOWNS; FLOODED KENTUCKY GETS MORE RAIN 
</P>

<P>
A line of severe storms in central Louisiana spawned tornadoes that touched 
down in three areas Monday, downing power lines, toppling trees and damaging 
buildings, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of miles away, the same storm system brought more rain to waterlogged 
Kentucky as highway crews struggled to reopen scores of roads closed almost a 
week ago by the worst flooding to hit the state in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
In Louisiana, tornadoes hit Alexandria and Pineville in Rapides Parish and 
Jonesville in Catahoula Parish, but no serious injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Tornadoes hit in about seven different locations here in Rapides Parish," said 
Bill Godron, the local Civil Defense director. "We've also had a great deal of 
flooding throughout the entire area. We've had to evacuate some people to 
shelters and we had to close one of the shelters because it was flooding." 
</P>
<P>
He was unable to say how many people were forced from their homes, but at least 
one mobile home was demolished. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had trees down, power lines down and so forth all over our town," 
Alexandria police Sgt. J. W. Ferrier said. "We've had high winds all over town, 
various sections of the town." 
</P>
<P>
A police dispatcher said that homes, cars and trees were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Up to half an inch of rain fell on western Kentucky by noon Monday, and the 
National Weather Service posted a flash-flood watch for the entire state. 
Forecasters said two to three inches of rain would fall in most areas by dawn 
today, swamping ground that already was saturated with water. 
</P>
<P>
Rivers in western Kentucky posed the greatest problems because water from the 
swollen Ohio River could back into tributaries and cause them to flood, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kentucky and Licking rivers could take that precipitation and not get back 
to flood stage, but the Salt and Green rivers are still up in some places and 
are back up from the Ohio River," said Mike Murphy, a hydrologic technician at 
the weather service office in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of Kentucky received more than 10 inches of rain last week, causing the 
worst flooding since December, 1978. At least four deaths in Kentucky and one 
in neighboring Tennessee were blamed on the weather. 
</P>
<P>
National Guard troops Monday used a helicopter to tote a massive pump to the 
streets of Lebanon Junction, 30 miles south of Louisville, and work crews 
reopened a 100-mile stretch of the Western Kentucky Parkway that had been 
closed because of high water since last Wednesday. More than 100 other roads 
still were impassable. 
</P>
<P>
Schools in Lebanon Junction and the nearby cities of Boston and West Point, 
Ky., remained closed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In western Tennessee, about 130 people were still unable to return to their 
homes in Obion County, where nearly 400 were displaced last week, said Cecil 
Whaley, an operations officer for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Obion River was beginning to recede but that another inch or so of 
rain could send the water back into evacuated houses and could cause flooding 
in some previously untouched places as well. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain was scattered over parts of western Tennessee during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Along the Cumberland River in central Tennessee, people who evacuated their 
homes last week probably would not be seriously affected by additional rain, 
Whaley said. 
</P>
<P>
"In those places, an inch or two might not be too bad in their situations," he 
said. "It takes about 30 to 40 hours after the rain hits for them to feel the 
effects on the Cumberland. If it only lasts 24 hours . . . it may not be too 
bad of an effect on them." 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky's latest deluge and the tornadoes in Louisiana resulted from a new 
storm system that developed over the southern plains, drawing moisture from the 
Gulf of Mexico and rapidly spreading it across much of the nation's interior. 
</P>
<P>
Rain reached from Texas to South Carolina and Kentucky. Snow spread from 
Colorado into Michigan, and the storm system brought five inches of snow to 
Quincy, Ill., and four inches to Hardin, Ill. Omaha, Idaho Falls, Ida., and 
Knob Noster, Mo., reported two inches of snow.

SCHOOLMATES HELP SPELL THE DIFFERENCE FOR TROUBLED PUPILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time the 10th-grade student at O'Farrell School of Creative and 
Performing Arts showed up at a weekly student support group, it was only to 
give moral support to her boyfriend, who had elected to attend in lieu of 
serving after-school detention. 
</P>
<P>
But on her second visit -- drawn back by the comfort of some three-dozen 
students talking of common problems with alcohol or drugs or parents -- the 
girl stammered out that she had contemplated suicide during the Christmas 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, the school nurse, who also sits in every Tuesday, prepared to 
contact the parents to arrange professional help, while other students -- a few 
of whom had also thought about taking their own lives at one time -- surrounded 
the girl to offer their hugs, their telephone numbers and promises of support. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, the student continues to show up every Tuesday after school, 
chronicling her slow but steady progress in coping with home and academic life 
and showing that positive results can come from seeking assistance. Her mother 
comes regularly to a support group for O'Farrell parents, held at night twice a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peer Counseling 
</P>
<P>
The group that helped the girl was established last fall by O'Farrell students 
and administrators, an extension of the school's extensive peer counseling 
program, where students are trained in communication and listening techniques 
to seek out classmates in need of a caring hand. 
</P>
<P>
Peer counseling in some fashion has been used in schools for many years, mainly 
to have higher-achieving students tutor students at risk of failing 
academically. But in the past several years, schools across the state have 
begun to emphasize the role that teen-agers can play in helping peers who have 
problems with stress, alcohol, drugs, broken families or parental abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The staff at O'Farrell, a magnet school in Southeast San Diego that attracts 
students citywide for its performing arts curriculum, has enthusiastically 
endorsed the peer counseling efforts of teacher Paul Combs. His students offer 
help one-on-one and also run the campus Students Against Drunk Driving club, 
work with disabled students to make them feel more at home at O'Farrell, and 
set the ground rules for the Tuesday after-school sessions. 
</P>
<P>
At Orange Glen High School in Escondido, teacher Darwin Bree also runs a large 
peer counseling effort. His students receive regular referrals from the 
school's adult counselors and also work with neighborhood social-service 
programs for teens. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista High School students have been asked to co-sponsor a statewide peer 
counseling conference in San Diego this April. More than 2,000 students and 
teachers from across California are expected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting Started 
</P>
<P>
"All the documentation shows that, especially from junior high on, kids are 
influenced more by their peers than by anyone else," said Allan Bright, a 
project specialist with the county Office of Education. Bright has created a 
steering committee of educators to help schools develop peer counseling 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that negative peer pressure can be intense, where kids succumb to 
alcohol and drug use and an inability to say 'no,' so here we are saying that 
students can bond together over issues that are positive." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist John Giebink, who heads the student health services at UC San 
Diego, said professional counselors "are always somewhat reluctant to allow 
that lay people can be effective . . . but I think there is general agreement 
today that these programs can be worthwhile and effective because they open up 
an avenue for students or people who will otherwise be reluctant to get 
themselves involved with professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"You must constantly stress, however, that peer counselors are not 
professionals and that they must always be aware of getting in over their 
heads." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and students in the O'Farrell and Orange Glen programs readily 
acknowledge there are limits and that they are practicing therapy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focused Listening 
</P>
<P>
"We constantly harp on the fact that we are not equipped to diagnose or 
prescribe, that we are there to support and listen and give suggestions for 
referrals to send on to others who can do things," said O'Farrell's Combs, a 
former race-human relations counselor for the San Diego district. "But it is 
true that a great deal of help can be given by someone who listens and cares" 
in what Combs calls focused listening. 
</P>
<P>
At O'Farrell, Combs -- who also teaches English and sings in the San Diego 
Opera chorus -- has about 30 students a year sign up for peer counseling. He 
began the course as a result of his race-human relations experiences, where he 
found that teachers and students can accomplish as much counseling as 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is to persuade kids that they can make an actual, measurable, 
observable difference in the way things happen on campus," Combs said. 
</P>
<P>
The two-semester class teaches students communications and problem-solving 
techniques, how groups function, and how leaders can guide a group and improve 
dialogue, Combs said. There is also instruction in recognizing alcohol- and 
drug-related problems and various theories behind professional counseling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Establish Trust' 
</P>
<P>
"We learn to establish trust and respect for a person despite (his or her) 
problems," senior Cynthia Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
Added peer counselor Rosemary Barnes: "We are taught to point out that there 
are other ways of dealing with problems besides taking drugs, for example. But 
we do it through suggesting alternatives and supporting students in seeking 
options . . . and telling them that we respect them for coming to us." 
</P>
<P>
Heidi Vaught said that students who approach her and peer counselors "already 
in a sense have identified their problem, and what we try to do is get them to 
come around to our point of view without preaching, because they will value the 
solution more if we don't preach." 
</P>
<P>
Attendance coordinator David Libbey, the school's on-site disciplinarian, has 
directed many students to peer counseling as an alternative to detention, which 
he found had little lasting effect for most campus violators. "I think that 
most kids do know right from wrong, but peer pressure to (do the wrong thing) 
is very, very strong and many kids are followers. . . . We're telling them that 
this is a way to get out of that." 
</P>
<P>
Combs' class, now in its fourth year, has received powerful support from 
O'Farrell Principal Florence Johnson, who subscribes strongly to the theory 
that students should be treated as much like adults as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, when students come up with an idea, I really try to listen and make it 
come true," Johnson said. "Peer counseling works well, the kids are very, very 
competent, it fills a need that the (adult) district counselors could never 
handle due to time, and it doesn't cost us any additional money." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has a reputation among San Diego principals for having a particular 
interest in the emotional well-being of students, in part because of her own 
background in successfully adopting and raising five foster children. 
</P>
<P>
"Florence has the interest and real commitment to the whole child -- not that 
other principals don't consider that -- but rather that she has strong 
expertise in counseling and is particularly keen about improving students' 
self-esteem," said Beverly Foster, the assistant school district superintendent 
who oversees O'Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
"For peer counseling to succeed, the administration has to make it a top 
priority, and she has done that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On-Campus Support 
</P>
<P>
Johnson agreed to the Tuesday group after peer counselors said that some 
students, who were in drug rehabilitation, could use an on-campus support 
group. She had it broadened to include students who just wanted to talk about 
problems or who simply were seeking friendship. Both she and other teachers 
share their own experiences as well, letting students know that adults also 
must cope with stress and failure. 
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday sessions offer no direct "should or should not" advice. Everyone is 
guaranteed confidentiality unless someone talks of committing a crime, of 
suicide, of child abuse or of being pregnant, Libbey said. A student who talks 
about a particularly pressing problem may be approached afterward by the nurse 
or Combs and asked about the possibility of seeking professional assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, 40 students showed up after school. Among them were recovering 
alcoholics, those with alcoholic parents, recovering drug addicts, some worried 
about child abuse, and many just present to express support for fellow 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here because I care" was a common refrain. 
</P>
<P>
Nurse Catherine Brugman shared her pain with students over her mother's recent 
death. A San Diego police officer who works with the school recounted painful 
personal events so that students would understand that she is also open and 
sympathetic to communication, and not a person to be seen just as an enforcer 
of rules. 
</P>
<P>
A few students said that such open communication with their parents was "easier 
said than done." Another pointed out that "the resolution doesn't always happen 
like in 'On Golden Pond,' " the movie where an estranged daughter and father 
reconciled differences as he neared death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents' Meetings 
</P>
<P>
The same problems with relationships came through at a nighttime parents' 
meeting. Libbey has found parents supportive of peer counseling, since parental 
approval is needed before a student can be assigned to the program instead of 
regular detention. At the night meeting, parents heard from vice principal Jean 
Mason, who brought her college-age daughter along to talk about the highs and 
lows of raising children as a single parent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think parents need to see that we as teachers are not perfect either, that 
we cope with some of the same things they do, that they are not alone," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While Escondido's Orange Glen High, nestled among Eucalyptus trees on the 
outskirts of the North County city, at first seems a world away from 
O'Farrell's urban core, the need for peer counseling is just as great to 
improve attendance and avoid problems, school administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
"The peer counselors are terrific in being out on campus, with their sensors 
out, to find situations before they become crises, as sort of an early warning 
system," said Bea Warner, an adult counselor at the school. Warner told of one 
student who came to her terribly upset over having broken up with a boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"Her mother and all her friends told her just to forget it and go on," Warner 
said. "But she needed a peer counselor who took more of an impartial attitude. 
. . . I hope the solution is the same as that suggested by her friends, but 
it's important that the answer come on her own." 
</P>
<P>
At Orange Glen, the students in Darwin Bree's class -- after going through 
training similar to that at O'Farrell -- have students they see on a weekly 
basis. Many are referred by the adult counselors, others by teachers who worry 
when a student becomes lethargic and spends time in class with a head on the 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
"As we make referrals to a peer counselor, we make it clear that we are very 
aware of who is good to refer and who needs therapeutic intervention by a 
psychologist," Warner said. "I am not giving them students with potentially 
major disorders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crisis Management 
</P>
<P>
Fellow counselor Joan Freitas praised the peer counselors for their 
participation in the school's crisis management team, which has dealt with the 
aftermath of three suicides by students during the past year. Some classmates 
take blame for the deaths; others have contemplated a similar act. 
</P>
<P>
"The peer counselors know how to take charge, such as determining that seniors 
respond in a different way than ninth-graders and need different kinds of 
intervention," Freitas said. "We have revised our program as a result of that." 
</P>
<P>
Peer counselor Larry Martineau said that a key element during training is 
learning about yourself. "You learn what your limits are," Martineau said. "We 
also learn that we have to support each other as peer counselors," which 
instructor Bree does during weekly debriefings with his class each Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The closeness we have as a group is incredible," senior Ed Simm said. "When we 
walk into class, everyone gives each other a hug." At the end of training 
sessions each year, Bree takes the class on an Outward Bound wilderness 
experience, which he said "binds" the students together even more tightly. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bree has professional counselors from Escondido's Neighborhood 
Recovery Center and Escondido Youth Encounter work with the class. Several 
students also serve as counselors for the community programs, which Bree said 
gives them additional skills in dealing with teen-agers. The class periodically 
visits junior high schools and members talk about drugs as well as give 
orientations for eighth-graders who will attend Orange Glen the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of students in school these days are hurting from something and teachers 
don't have the time or training to intervene," Orange Glen teacher Marilyn Tam 
said. "While peer counseling doesn't always succeed, I have never seen a 
negative impact." 
</P>
<P>
Said O'Farrell's Johnson: "I think peer counseling will improve attendance and 
morale, and especially in getting students to take more responsibility for 
their role in the educational system." 
</P>
<P>
The O'Farrell 10th-grade student who shared her thoughts of suicide would 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been helped to get motivated more to work in class, although doing well 
in school has not been my No. 1 priority," she said. "But the group has given 
me some confidence to confront the academic side and I think it has helped me 
understand my parents a bit more. 
</P>
<P>
"I really need the group."

HOLDEN PROMISES CHANGES FOR VOTERS IN WILMINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Los Angeles Councilman Nate Holden -- attempting to woo voters in a district 
where people blame the Port of Los Angeles for pollution, traffic and unsightly 
junkyards -- told a group of Wilmington residents Thursday night that if he is 
elected mayor, he will curb the growth of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"I pledge to you that this program they have in place (to further expand the 
port) will end," Holden declared. "Your problems will be reduced -- if I have 
to close down the harbor." 
</P>
<P>
He also promised that if elected mayor this spring -- the primary is in April 
with a runoff, if necessary, in June -- to appoint new harbor commissioners 
who, he said, will be more responsive to residents' concerns. When one man said 
he believed that the community had been making progress with the current harbor 
commissioners, Holden replied: "Don't be fooled or used. Your problems are not 
being dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
In his wide-ranging talk before the Wilmington Home Owners, Holden also pledged 
to beat the city's gang and drug problems. He offered few specifics, however, 
except to say that he wanted to steer youths into a program similar to that of 
the California Conservation Corps. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to break these gangs up," he declared. "Well you say, 'How are you 
going to do that?' I pledge to do that and it will be done. . . . I want you to 
know that we're going to clean up this crime. Trust me. . . . If need be, I'll 
put a black-and-white in front of every rock cocaine house. That's what I'll 
do." 
</P>
<P>
The one-time state senator and former aide to Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn painted himself as a candidate of the people, an outsider in Los 
Angeles city government but an insider at the county, state and federal levels. 
He was elected to the City Council in June, 1987, defeating Homer Broome Jr., a 
candidate backed by Bradley for the 10th District seat. 
</P>
<P>
While saying he was "not a member of the club" -- meaning the insiders on the 
City Council -- Holden peppered his talk with anecdotes about his chats with 
other public officials, including Hahn, Gov. George Deukmejian and even former 
President Gerald Ford. 
</P>
<P>
"You want someone who is committed," Holden told about 100 residents at the 
meeting. "When I want something done at the local level, I get it done because 
I can talk to the governor. The mayor can't -- and won't." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners had invited Holden to their meeting, just as they invited 
Bradley last month. Next month, the group hopes to host the remaining candidate 
in the three-man race, Baxter Ward, a former Los Angeles County supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warm Reception 
</P>
<P>
The group gave Holden a generally warm reception, although at least one 
community leader said she was disappointed that he did not offer more concrete 
solutions to the harbor area's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel tonight that they (those problems) weren't really addressed fully," 
said Simie Seaman, whose group, the Banning Park Neighborhood Assn., had sent 
Holden a four-page typewritten list of questions. "I wasn't comfortable with 
the way they were addressed." 
</P>
<P>
But others seemed hopeful about Holden, who is considered a long shot against 
Bradley. "He presented like he has a lot of power," said Joe Mendez, who asked 
the councilman if he would consider pushing the refineries to help clean up 
Wilmington. "Whether he had that power or not, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wilmington Home Owners President Peter Mendoza: "I like him. I agree with 
him. It's time for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Holden hammered away at the theme of change throughout his talk, often 
challenging the residents -- like a preacher -- to shout out the word. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we want change?" he yelled. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes!" the residents replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Then that's what we'll have."

FISHERMEN SAY ENCINITAS REFUGE WOULD DEVASTATE THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randy Miller has been a commercial fisherman for a quarter of a century, plying 
his trade up and down the North County coast in his 26-foot boat, the Seaway. 
</P>
<P>
It is not an easy business. Even with tricks of the trade gleaned from years on 
the water, Miller wages a constant battle to keep fiscally afloat. There are 
the whims of the weather, problems with poachers and the perpetual toll of the 
elements on boat and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes a new challenge. Little more than a week ago, state legislation was 
introduced that would create a marine refuge along a half-mile strip of 
coastline in Encinitas, effectively putting it off-limits to commercial and 
sport fishermen, as well as divers looking for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ecologically Rich Area 
</P>
<P>
The bill, written by Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) and championed 
by city officials, is designed to protect in perpetuity the ecologically rich 
area, prohibiting the harvest of all manner of marine life from the tide pools 
to a mile offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, however, sees the proposal as yet another shot across the bow of his 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best fishing reef in North County, bar none, absolute, period," 
Miller, president of the Southern California Lobster Fisherman's Assn., said 
one recent day. "It's a mortal blow to local fishermen. It would be 
devastating." 
</P>
<P>
The unfriendly reception the legislation has received from local fishermen, who 
promise to fight the bill to the end, has taken Encinitas officials as well as 
Mojonnier by surprise. The proposal has been in the works since mid-1988 and, 
until now, no one had uttered a word of disapproval, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing we've hidden. This thing is months and months old," said David 
Wigginton, the city's community services director. "I think the fishermen have 
to look out for their interests, and I'm sure their concerns will be heard. . . 
. The intent wasn't to jeopardize anyone's welfare, the intent was to preserve 
an area of coastline for all people to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would establish an ocean sanctuary stretching south from D 
Street at Moonlight Beach to the southern edge of Swami's, a popular surfing 
spot noted for an extensive reef system that stretches well beyond the 
breakers. 
</P>
<P>
A rugged ocean outcropping, the reef serves as a feeding ground for a wide 
array of fish, and harbors perhaps the most abundant crop of lobster north of 
La Jolla Cove, which is already designated a marine refuge. Moreover, the tide 
pools that appear as the ocean recedes each day play host to sea anemones, 
crabs, sea cucumbers and other flora and fauna of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"At low tide it's beautiful," Wigginton said. "There's everything imaginable 
out there. You don't see the same things twice." 
</P>
<P>
The bill was sparked by Encinitas City Councilman Gerald Steel, who pushed 
through a unanimous resolution in July, asking that the sanctuary be 
established. Steel has since moved to Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
Given his marching orders, Wigginton approached Mojonnier's office with the 
idea. State Department of Fish and Game officials were consulted, and they 
advised the assemblywoman that the quickest avenue to secure a refuge would be 
through the Legislature instead of the cumbersome bureaucratic process. 
</P>
<P>
State law protects about three dozen ocean sanctuaries. While the zones are 
open for scientific and recreational purposes, they are off-limits to fishermen 
and divers, with a strict look-but-don't-take rule enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon Goehring, the DFG's legislative coordinator, said the agency has yet to 
take a position on Mojonnier's bill, but suggested that the region off 
Encinitas is not a unique habitat nor does it play host to a specific plant or 
animal threatened by extinction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Endangered Species 
</P>
<P>
"There's no particular species that's endangered there," Goehring said. "I'm 
not saying protection of tide pools isn't important, but it isn't to a point 
where there is an endangered species that is native only to that particular 
location." 
</P>
<P>
Mia Tegner, a marine ecologist with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 
La Jolla, said she is unfamiliar with the spot under consideration, but 
supports the concept of marine refuges as a way of protecting the fragile ocean 
ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the general idea of reserves is a good one," she said. "It would be 
nice to take my grandchildren out and show them what an abalone looks like." 
</P>
<P>
Tegner noted, however, that the sector "may well be the North County hot spot" 
for fishermen, meaning the anglers have "a legitimate gripe here." 
</P>
<P>
"If fishermen say they have to have every square inch of coast, it's one thing, 
but if they say this particular spot is a source of livelihood, it's another," 
Tegner said. 
</P>
<P>
Local fishermen, meanwhile, make no bones about it -- the stretch of ocean off 
central Encinitas is the prime ocean acreage for anglers and lobster men in 
North County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Be a Disaster' 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of guys who make their living off Swami's," said John Guth, a 
lobster fisherman for more than 20 years. "This would be a disaster for us. 
We've already had so many closures. If they take another, there's just not 
going to be that much there." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Perdew, a lobster fisherman out of Oceanside Harbor, agreed. "I would rate 
it one of the best, if not the best," he said. "I hope the thing doesn't go 
through. I'm sorry that our legislators don't have the courtesy of checking 
with the people it would most affect." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a third-generation Encinitas resident and chief spokesman for the local 
lobster fishermen, suggested that the key flaw of the proposal is that it 
underestimates the ability of the ocean to renew itself when properly handled. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to ask why we are saving it," Miller argued. "Just to look at? The 
ocean is renewable if we manage it properly. It can serve the fisherman and the 
general public. To have it for one interest group is like saying the rest of us 
aren't good enough. . . . It's kind of utopian. They want to create a private 
pond off the city." 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Miller lived with his family on the bluff overlooking Swami's. He 
recalls the days when a small wooden wharf extended from the rocky point. 
Miller grew up with fishermen all around. Later, he became a surfer, but turned 
to fishing for his livelihood when he realized his skills on a board would not 
put bread on the table. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls years past when the lobster population off the coast had dwindled to 
record lows. A fisherman could throw as many traps as he'd like into the water, 
but the things would generally come up empty. The area was all but fished out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Young Ones Can Escape 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, lobster have rebounded, most notably because of new traps that 
allow the younger and smaller crustaceans, which will grow into next year's 
whoppers, to escape through a portal in the steel mesh, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the past six years have been very good, said Miller, who also 
fishes for shark, sea bass, yellowtail and other fish after the close of 
lobster season, which begins the first Wednesday in October and lasts more than 
five months. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how we'll fight it," Miller said. "We'll probably have to go up 
to Sacramento and deal with it there. It's not something that we haven't had to 
do before." 
</P>
<P>
Such talk aside, room for compromise may remain. 
</P>
<P>
Wigginton said his impression of the original intent of the proposal is that it 
primarily sought to protect the tidal areas off Encinitas. By spreading the 
refuge boundaries a mile out to sea, the legislation may have unintentionally 
snared the fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"If a mile is too far out, maybe we can negotiate it back in," he said. "But 
not having heard the concerns of those parties firsthand, it's hard to say what 
direction any action might take." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Heiserman, an administrative assistant to Mojonnier, said the 
assemblywoman's staff was unaware of the fishermen's concern before introducing 
the legislation, but would be happy to arrange a meeting with all parties 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly want to hear these people out," Heiserman said. "If they've got a 
legitimate beef, we'll want to put that on the scale, too."

PORT VOTES TODAY ON RENAMING CONVENTION CENTER FOR KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From heated radio talk shows to placid television editorials, from tense City 
Council sessions to solemn parades, the debate over whether San Diego's new 
$160-million bayfront convention center should be renamed for the Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. has once again reached a critical point. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Board of Port Commissioners, which is paying to build the landmark 
edifice, is scheduled to vote on the name change, the first step in a two-part 
bureaucratic sequence that ends back at the City Council, which is responsible 
for operating the center when it opens later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, that would be it, the two votes signifying an 
official conclusion. But these are far from normal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Both supporters and opponents of the name change have vowed grass-roots 
referendum or initiative campaigns over any decision they disagree with, a 
prospect that puts the final outcome in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extraordinary Divisiveness 
</P>
<P>
What is clear, however, is that such a drawn-out political battle carries with 
it the potential for extraordinary community divisiveness, cutting along highly 
emotional -- and, in the worst case, racial -- lines. 
</P>
<P>
It's a circumstance with which San Diego is all too familiar. Two years ago, 
voters overturned a council decision to rename Market Street for King, and the 
city has struggled to find a suitable civic tribute for the slain civil rights 
leader since. 
</P>
<P>
Those in favor of the convention center change, led by Wes Pratt, the council's 
only black member, maintain that the center provides the best means for 
honoring King because it is new and will be highly visible both locally and 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
But those in opposition say the city has done enough for King, such as naming a 
park and an elementary school after him, and they note that he had no personal 
ties to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The main opposition group, which, in its few public appearances has been all 
white and mostly senior citizens, says its motives are not racist. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, some leading black supporters contend that the issue can be 
defined in terms of race, and the city's black community is solidly behind the 
name change. 
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric in the debate remains fervent judging from the many calls to radio 
talk shows and the abundance of letters written to newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor Roger Hedgecock, host of the city's top-rated radio talk show, 
says the name change has been one of the hot topics of the new year, rivaled 
only by the proposed takeover of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and 
discussions of the border. 
</P>
<P>
"The SDG&amp;E takeover, that one kind of faded out . . . (but) this one has 
gotten more listener reaction and more listener emotion," Hedgecock said. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Wolfsheimer, a veteran member and current chairman of the Board of Port 
Commissioners, said, "This is by far the most controversial issue in my nine 
years on the board, by a factor of 10." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flood of Letters 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer, a lawyer, says his office has received many letters about the name 
change, and added that "every time I walk outside," someone seems to be there 
to offer an opinion. The letters have been running 75 to 1 against changing the 
building name from the San Diego Convention Center to the San Diego Martin 
Luther King Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer said each letter is different, leading him to assume they aren't 
part of an orchestrated campaign. Most have been signed and are without racist 
comments. "There aren't a lot of out-and-out nuts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another veteran member of the port board, Bill Rick, said he too has received 
many letters, and "I've worn out several coat lapels," he joked, referring to 
people who have grabbed him to pass on their advice. Almost invariably, he 
said, the opinions have been against the name change. 
</P>
<P>
But both Rick and Wolfsheimer said they intend to follow the Jan. 10 decision 
by the council to add King's name to the center. In doing so, they join two 
other commissioners, Dan Larsen and Delton Reopelle, who have said they also 
intend to vote for the change, thus accounting for a majority of the 
seven-member board. 
</P>
<P>
The seven are appointed by the five cities surrounding the bay. Rick, 
Wolfsheimer and Larsen represent San Diego, and Reopelle represents National 
City, whose City Council also favors naming the center after King. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Burk of Coronado says he is against the change, Milford Portwood of 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach has said he is leaning against it, and Robert Penner of Chula 
Vista has said he has not made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Some commissioners, such as Reopelle, at first said they were leaning against 
the renaming, but later changed their minds when pressured by their city 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to the City 
</P>
<P>
In explaining his position, Rick echoed the feelings of some of his colleagues: 
</P>
<P>
"I say the city of San Diego has to operate the center. . . . They (council 
members) are the ones who get elected." 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of today's 2 p.m. meeting, the Port District has rented a 
ballroom at the Embarcadero Holiday Inn to accommodate an anticipated crowd of 
several hundred. It isn't the first time the district has done so. In the past, 
it has used hotel ballrooms for public hearings of high-profile issues such as 
airport noise and landing curfews at Lindbergh Field, as well as taxicab 
licensing. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Wilkens, a Port District spokesman, said letters to the agency concerning 
the renaming have run into the thousands. As of early last week, the district 
had received about 1,700 signed letters, about 60% in favor of the name change. 
</P>
<P>
By midweek, a coalition of groups supporting the renaming -- consisting of the 
San Diego Unity League, Community Preparatory School and the Alliance of 
Survival -- submitted 3,000 more letters to the district, and were urging 
supporters to attend today's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Councilman Pratt, another leader in the King renaming effort is the 
Rev. George Stevens, who is black and who says the debate has turned into "one 
of the most politicized issues in the city in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Very Serious Concern' 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who was on a committee appointed by the City Council to find a fitting 
memorial for King, said that while "there's no big coordinated effort" on the 
part of those favoring the renaming, "this is a very serious concern for many 
people." 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects that word of today's meeting will be emphasized in the black 
community, through community newspapers and from the church pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
If the name-change effort fails, because it is rejected by the Port District or 
by the City Council or is overturned by a referendum, Stevens has threatened to 
do two things: lead a national boycott of the center and lead an initiative 
effort in San Diego to keep the name. 
</P>
<P>
"This time we're not backing down. . . . I'm not worried about (the opponents) 
at all," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Should port commissioners approve the change, the matter will go back to the 
City Council. That's because the council vote in January was on a resolution 
and not an ordinance, and the latter is necessary to make the name change 
legal, City Atty. John Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
Renaming the center requires the approval of both the port commissioners and 
the council, and a referendum against either the city or the Port District 
would scuttle the change, according to the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Procedural Differences 
</P>
<P>
Allen Giesen, a spokesman for the main opposition group, which is called 
Citizens to Keep the Name San Diego Convention Center, said his organization 
has not yet decided whether to launch a referendum against the city or the Port 
District. There are procedural differences between the two because the district 
was created by the Legislature while the city is governed by the City Charter. 
</P>
<P>
A referendum against the city would require collecting 25,593 signatures of 
registered voters within 30 days, while a similar drive against the Port 
District would require collecting a total of about 32,000 valid signatures in 
the five port cities of San Diego, National City, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach 
and Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to take this mess to the other cities," Giesen said, adding that 
since there are fewer blacks living in the four cities outside San Diego, based 
on census data, it may be easier to obtain signatures in those areas. "We think 
the rest of the county doesn't really care about this. It has no special 
significance to them." 
</P>
<P>
As for today's meeting, Giesen said he and the group's organizer, Robert 
Pruett, plan to present statements and the several thousand petition 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
But Giesen said he didn't know how many other opponents would also attend. He 
claimed that members of the group have been verbally abused and that death 
threats have been left on his and Pruett's answering machines. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been painted as such a racially negative thing" that some of the 
group's supporters are hesitant to attend, Giesen said.

MOBILE HOMES FOR HOMELESS GET A SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest chapter in an effort to temporarily house homeless families in 
city-owned trailers was unveiled Monday at a former airport shuttle bus 
terminal in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen mobile homes -- part of 102 trailers bought by the city for $500,000 
two years ago -- sit on the parking lot of the former Flyaway bus terminal on a 
strip of federal land across the San Diego Freeway from the Veterans 
Administration Hospital and one-half mile from upscale Westwood Village. 
</P>
<P>
Families of veterans will be given priority for the two- and three-bedroom 
mobile homes, said Harry Pregerson, a judge on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals who negotiated with the General Services Administration for the land. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, acknowledging "we haven't begun to scratch the surface" of 
the homeless problem, called it "a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing with Bradley and Pregerson at a news conference were two of the 
families who will begin moving in Wednesday. During their maximum six-month 
free stay, residents will be offered job counseling and training. The city will 
pay for utilities on the furnished, carpeted trailers.

AL MARTINEZ: ROARING UNDER THE BIG TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let me say first I am not one of those who ever wanted to grow up to be a 
cowboy, a fireman, a fighter pilot or a handsome movie lover who got to kiss 
the hell out of Lana Turner, cinema's queen of sex at the time of my 
pubescence. Similarly, I had no desire to run away with the circus, the reason 
being there is nothing in a circus I can do. I am afraid of height, nervous 
around wild animals and appalled at the very notion of bouncing around a tent 
in a clown suit trying to make little children laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is something about the circus that fascinates me, the way a seal 
intrigues a killer whale, and when the opportunity arose to interview Clifford 
Vargas, I jumped at the chance. Well, actually, I expressed interest at the 
chance. I rarely jump. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas owns the L.A.-based Circus Vargas, which for the past 20 years has 
traveled the nation with an eclectic troupe of aerialists, animal trainers, 
jugglers, dancing dogs and others in an effort to prove there continues to 
exist a form of entertainment in America that has absolutely nothing to do with 
what a friend calls the sexual arts. 
</P>
<P>
My preconceived notion of a circus owner, especially one his press notices 
describe as a guy with "sawdust in his veins and stardust in his eyes," was 
that of a jolly, off-season Santa who ran his company with a quality of 
forbearance roughly equivalent to that of Mother Teresa . . . until I heard 
Cliff Vargas chew out a truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred in Pico Rivera, where the circus was set up at the time. Vargas, a 
slight man with an intense, unsmiling manner, had already dispelled my notion 
of circus owner as saint. Here was someone absolutely in charge of all he 
surveyed, striding around the big top in Western boots and amber-tinted 
sunglasses, inspecting every sequin in an elephant headdress, roaring with 
displeasure at sloppy workmanship and spiking with glacial distaste anyone who 
appeared to be conducting himself in a less than productive manner. 
</P>
<P>
He was a classic example of hands-on entrepreneurship, leaving no detail to 
chance. One had the feeling that if a high wire needed repair, Vargas would 
personally shinny up a pole to the peak of his tent to see that it was repaired 
properly. If a sick elephant needed bottle-feeding, he would feed it. In fact, 
Vargas has done all of that from the day he mortgaged everything he owned to 
buy the circus, and he's still doing it, even though the company is worth about 
$5 million and operating in the black. 
</P>
<P>
More than once during the first 15 years of his ownership, Vargas teetered on 
the brink of what he likes to call "the edge of the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
"I was green when I started and wasted money buying things I didn't need. No 
one subsidized me. I drove the diesels, patched the tents, fed the animals and 
slept in a truck. Even today we get no help. We visit 100 cities a year, and 
each one has a different set of rules and licenses. No one is keeping the 
circus alive but me." 
</P>
<P>
For all the intensity he evokes as he stalks about the big top like a leopard 
among impalas, Mr. Vee, as he is called, manages to maintain a sense of 
belonging to the enterprise he runs with an iron will. His pervasive presence 
is actually a settling factor, a cohesiveness that binds the whole thing 
together, the way Cecil B. DeMille bound together those religious epics with 
casts of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
"I like doing what I'm doing," Vargas was saying as we settled in a house 
trailer near the big top. "Even if I sold it all, I would still probably stick 
around as general manager. It's a hard place to walk away from." As he spoke, 
his attention was diverted by something occurring just outside the trailer. "I 
can't imagine myself in a . . . " He stopped speaking suddenly, leaped out the 
door and fired off a string of invectives that would blister a nun. 
</P>
<P>
A driver, attempting to connect his truck cab with a large trailer still 
propped up on its permanent underpinnings, had missed the connection device and 
was backing into the trailer itself, a move that could have snapped the 
underpinnings and tipped the $200,000 vehicle into the dirt. To say Vargas was 
angry would be to describe Sean Penn as mild-tempered. 
</P>
<P>
The chewing out, a classic of its kind, lasted a furious few seconds, after 
which Mr. Vee returned to the interview with whatever placidity he had managed 
to display before the eruption. "Didn't mean to scare you," he said 
matter-of-factly. "I've just got to be sure things are done right. Otherwise, 
where would the circus be?" 
</P>
<P>
As I left, a lady was walking an elephant nearby, and the truck driver was 
making a second effort to hook up the trailer. Mr. Vee was watching them both 
with equal intensity.

A firehouse's traditional mascot is a dog. But county Fire Station No. 149 had 
a problem that 101 Dalmations couldn't have solved -- mice. So the station 
recruited Phyllis, a gray and white cat, from an animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"No more mice," said Capt. Duane Deever at the station house, which is located 
in the north county near Lake Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from being an effective piece of mouse-fighting equipment, Phyllis is the 
only feline mascot of any county fire unit. In fact, firehouse mascots in 
general are disappearing. Fewer than a dozen of the county stations even house 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to get three different shifts of firefighters to agree on 
anything, let alone one animal," Deever said. "If you have people on one shift 
that aren't interested in all phases of taking care of her, including medical 
care, then it won't work." 
</P>
<P>
The 12 firefighters at Station 149 are, however, devoted to Phyllis, even 
though she doesn't attend fires. 
</P>
<P>
"When we start up the truck," Deever said, "she runs and jumps in her bed." 
</P>
<P>
Traffic sighting du jour: Three callers phoned KNX radio to say they had 
spotted a man walking a camel down Highland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Score another victory for Ski Demski, the Long Beach character who flies a 
giant American flag on a 125-foot pole in his front yard. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been trying for years, without success, to have it removed for 
allegedly violating noise laws (his Old Glory flaps loudly). 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Long Beach recently built a Centennial Plaza downtown to 
celebrate its 100th anniversary and decorated it with plaques and tiles paid 
for, and signed by, residents. Patriotic Ski bought a plaque that immortalizes 
his notorious flag post with this message: 
</P>
<P>
"A Tribute to Old Glory, May She Always Fly High and Free in Long Beach, Ski 
Demski. The Pole, 1988." 
</P>
<P>
Demski said with a laugh: "I was surprised they let me put it on city 
property." 
</P>
<P>
Local Presidents' Day report: 
</P>
<P>
Washington High was closed as were campuses at Kennedy, Garfield, Monroe, Taft 
and Grant. Construction continued on the Ronald Reagan State Office Building 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Duffers flocked to the Eisenhower, Coolidge, Wilson, Roosevelt, Harding and 
Ford (par 3) golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was lighter than usual on Jefferson, Hoover, Lincoln and Adams 
boulevards, as well as on Madison Avenue in Culver City. There was no rush hour 
in the Obscure Chief Executives section of Monterey Park, which features Polk 
Way, Harrison Road, Buchanan and Pierce places and Van Buren, Tyler, Taylor and 
Fillmore drives. 
</P>
<P>
No problems were reported on the Marina (formerly the Richard M. Nixon) 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Late Bulletin: The man walking the camel down Highland Avenue was determined to 
be an employee of the visiting Circus Vargas.

Since its incorporation in 1850, the City of Los Angeles has been gobbling up 
territory through annexation to expand its borders from 28 square miles to more 
than 464. The map below shows the original city and the parcels acquired along 
the way. The table shows the city's area and population at the end of each 
decade.

Many people heard the barrage of gunfire that killed Andrea Denise Garrett in a 
housing project on the Eastside recently, but at first, few thought much of the 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
"You're always hearing stuff like that around here," said Michael, a 
self-described gang "associate," who was talking with friends several blocks 
away when the shooting occurred early on Feb. 12. "All I knew was, the bullets 
weren't coming at me." 
</P>
<P>
But even in the Aliso Village and Pico-Aliso city housing projects, considered 
by authorities to be among the most troubled public complexes in Los Angeles, 
the gunning down of an innocent person -- the 20-year-old Garrett, who was 
pregnant with her third child -- has shocked many who live in the aging, 
sprawling 2,400-resident mini-city that straddles East 1st Street in Boyle 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is -- oh, my God, she was pregnant," lifelong Pico-Aliso resident 
Breavon McDuffie said, echoing the sentiments heard throughout the projects. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the death 10 years earlier of Communist organizer Damien Garcia, who 
was stabbed for allegedly sassing local gang members, have area residents been 
as upset as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
Tenant leaders, such as Anita Moore, have scoured the housing projects, talking 
to neighbors and strangers alike and urging cool heads. 
</P>
<P>
"All we need is another shooting for folks in Malibu to say, 'Well, those folks 
are at it again,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of fencing off the housing projects to outsiders, considered a major 
source of the trouble there, has surfaced as tenant leaders discuss possible 
solutions with city housing officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evictions Continue 
</P>
<P>
Also, evictions are continuing for residents who are involved in cocaine and 
other drugs. Authorities said drugs are usually to blame for most acts of 
violence, including Garrett's death, in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The area is commonly known to many as "Pico-Aliso," but there are two distinct 
housing projects. Aliso Village is north of 1st Street and the Pico-Aliso 
project stretches for a mile south from 1st Street to within the shadow of the 
Whittier Boulevard bridge. Community meetings to decry the violence have been 
organized but with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one gathering scheduled Friday by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) 
was canceled when authorities said the atmosphere in the aftermath of the 
shooting was too tense. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual show of force, even for the two 50-year-old housing projects, a 
special task force of more than 50 Los Angeles police officers and other law 
enforcement personnel in recent days has converged on Aliso Village to 
discourage any retaliation for Garrett's death. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just buying a few days of peace," said Lt. Sergio Robleto, who is 
heading the Hollenbeck Division investigation into the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Even the members of a local gang that police suspect was involved in the 
Garrett shooting are keeping a low profile, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
"They know they're going to get hit (in retaliation)," one veteran officer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett was friendly with -- but not a member of -- the East Coast Crips First 
Street gang, a predominantly black gang that police officers say controls the 
cocaine trade in the projects. The area in the past was the territory of Latino 
gangs and police believe the shooting resulted from the growing tension between 
the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
Caught in the middle of the showdown are the residents who, for the most part, 
seem to enjoy life in Pico-Aliso. Dolores Leyva -- a 22-year-old single mother 
of two whose $150-a-month two-bedroom apartment is next to a freeway on-ramp -- 
a lifelong resident, is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up here," she said. "I know my neighbors and I have friends here. All 
that other stuff with drugs doesn't bother me. I'm not into drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Other Latinos, who make up an estimated 90% of the projects' residents, are 
more tentative, perhaps because they do not speak English or do not have legal 
residency in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Approached by a visitor, a group of chatty women hanging out their wash on 
clotheslines late one recent afternoon said they wanted peace and that they 
opposed the gangs. But in the next breath, several of them said they were 
powerless to prevent their sons' involvement in the gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, senor, I try to do the best I can with my (four) sons," said Avelina 
Martinez. "But I can't be at all places at the same time to see if they're 
getting into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believes She's Stuck 
</P>
<P>
Ofelia Gomez added, "I just want to get out. But I can't afford to. I'm stuck, 
no?" 
</P>
<P>
Anita Moore, another Aliso Village resident, is more hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel safe here," the mother of five boys said, "I really do. Period." 
</P>
<P>
As she spoke -- several days after the shooting -- police officers raided 
several nearby vehicles, looking for a cache of semiautomatic rifles and other 
weapons. The noise of screeching tires and loud voices occasionally drifted 
into Moore's Spartan-looking living room, forcing a listener to lean forward to 
hear her words. 
</P>
<P>
Reminded of the police action outside, Moore, who has lived in the project for 
17 years, proudly said one son, Keith, has a steady job and her youngest, 
Marty, aspires to become a psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
"I know all the gang members around here and they give me respect," she said. 
"I could go out in the middle of a gang fight and they'd stop. I'm not a God or 
some kind of queen (because) maybe they may go fight somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to stay because I want to make them gang free. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The day after the interview, however, Moore's upbeat mood turned to anger. One 
of her other sons had been arrested for stealing a car. 
</P>
<P>
The killing of Garrett has reinforced the need for more security and better 
accommodations at the Eastside projects, according to tenants' representatives, 
who are among the most vocal in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Security Forces 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, city Housing Authority police and Hollenbeck Division 
officers provide the only security for the two housing projects. There are no 
physical barriers to keep out strangers who wander into the area. 
</P>
<P>
Most units, built during the flurry of post-Depression construction in Los 
Angeles, need painting, new floors and other repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives like McDuffie and Lucia Mendoza are constantly talking to 
neighbors, carrying their ideas to city housing officials, who promise to do 
their best to help them out. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Pico-Aliso units are currently being painted and anti-graffiti 
projects are an ongoing campaign. Some graffiti eulogizing the Garrett woman 
was among the first to come off the walls after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"That graffiti with her name is just plain vandalism," Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
McDuffie has talked about erecting a fence around the housing projects to keep 
strangers out. The wide-open areas of grass between the apartments, the parking 
lots and the adjacent streets make it easy for outsiders to come in. 
</P>
<P>
But the fencing may give some residents, already down on themselves for living 
in public housing, further embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want people to feel fenced in," McDuffie said. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza, the mother of three, is involved in organizing protests and community 
events to avert violence. She was among many residents who campaigned for more 
police foot patrols in the area and for citizen watch groups in her part of 
Aliso-Pico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peaceful Dance 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, on the night of the Garrett shooting, the 60ish-looking Mendoza 
helped organize a dance -- less than a mile from the crime scene -- where the 
evening passed peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone enjoyed themselves," she recalled. "There were even some gang members 
there and they, too, had a good time. I saw the police cars as I was leaving 
the dance. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know someone had been killed until the next morning." 
</P>
<P>
The best hope for the projects' residents, most agree, is the fight against 
drugs. But it's a struggle that few realistically expect to win. 
</P>
<P>
Housing Authority officials have evicted numerous residents of the projects for 
a variety of offenses in recent months, ranging from non-payment of rent to 
involvement in drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to stay on top of it but we need more help from the residents who can 
point out these people to us," said one Aliso Village housing official, who 
asked not to be identified. "In many cases, people who claim to be against 
drugs are harboring these dope dealers from the police." 
</P>
<P>
Frequent patrolling by Los Angeles police and Housing Authority officers scares 
away dope dealers for a while, but they return when the heat is off and police 
manpower is diverted elsewhere, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
The most disheartening side effect of the battle against the gang-controlled 
drug trade is is in how the projects' young are affected. 
</P>
<P>
"I was outside the other day," recalled Mendoza, "and this little chavalito, 
only 6 years old, says, 'I'm from TMC (a local gang that is allied with East 
Coast Crips). 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine . . . a 6-year-old boy saying that?"

SAMOANS PROTEST TACTICS OF DEPUTIES IN RAIDING PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singing hymns and praying in their native language, nearly 250 members of Los 
Angeles' Samoan community demonstrated Monday in Carson to demand an apology 
for the unnecessary force the protesters say sheriff's deputies used recently 
to break up a bridal shower in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying such signs as, "You Don't Wear Riot Gear to a Samoan Bridal Shower," 
the demonstrators picketed for nearly an hour outside the sheriff's station in 
Carson, where three-fourths of Los Angeles County's 60,000 Samoans live. 
</P>
<P>
"Sheriff Sherman Block said the deputies acted with restraint," UCLA law 
student Falefatu Alailima-Utu told the crowd. "He's lying. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Alailima-Utu and other speakers called on Block to apologize for the Feb. 11 
incident in which many of the 35 people arrested were allegedly clubbed while 
handcuffed by deputies. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's spokesman declined to comment when asked if Block would respond to 
the calls for an apology. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no information about anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Events Disputed 
</P>
<P>
The show of community support for the Arthur Dole family, at whose Cerritos 
home the incident occurred, is the latest round in the ongoing dispute over 
what actually happened during the bridal shower held for one of Dole's 
daughters, Melinda. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the family, which is of Samoan ancestry, said about 100 
deputies stormed the home in an unprovoked attack, beating many people, after 
they said they complied with a request from officers to turn down loud music 
that apparently annoyed neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
When family members at one point came outside the home to assure deputies that 
the people inside had no weapons and were prepared to leave, the deputies 
allegedly forced their way into the home for no apparent reason, using 
profanity, and ransacked the house, Dole's daughter Emily said. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's rally, protest organizers showed color photographs of the broken 
arms, cuts and bruises that Emily Dole and others said they suffered at the 
hands of the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference last week, however, Block said the deputies acted with 
"great restraint." 
</P>
<P>
Although the incident involved deputies from the sheriff's station in Lakewood, 
rally organizers explained that the protest was held at the Carson station 
because that is where most of the county's Samoans live. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying that this is part of continuing abuse against Samoans," said 
the Rev. Filipo Robertson. "But Samoans, all Americans, have rights that should 
be protected." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters sang several songs, including "God Bless America" and "We Shall 
Overcome," in Samoan as they walked in front of the sheriff's station. Several 
deputies monitored the protest, which ended peacefully around 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Emily Dole, a member of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW) who is known to 
television audiences as Mt. Fiji, said her family was gratified by the support 
shown at the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a retired baggage handler has accused sheriff's deputies of using 
explosives to blow the screen door off his East Compton home in a predawn raid 
in which the place was ransacked and his son arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer Lampkins, 77, said his ailing 71-year-old wife Elsie suffered a mild 
heart attack and was hospitalized Saturday, the day after the raid occurred. 
The elderly couple were forced to stand outside in the cold while deputies went 
through the home on McDivitt Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's 29-year-old son, Keith, who has served jail time for drug 
possession, was booked on suspicion of being a felon in possession of a 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies were part of a joint sweep operation targeting gang members in 
eight locations in East Compton and Lynwood, sheriff's spokesman Gabe Ramirez 
said. Seven people, including Keith Lampkins, were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
No one who was involved in the search of the Lampkins' home was available for 
comment. But Sgt. Jack Ewell of the Lynwood sheriff's station said deputies are 
not authorized to use explosives to break open doors.

JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN BOMB DEATHS OF 2 OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jury selection will begin today in the murder trial of a North Hollywood makeup 
artist, in which the defense says it will claim that two Los Angeles police 
bomb experts caused their own deaths in trying to dismantle a bomb found in the 
defendant's garage. 
</P>
<P>
The pipe bomb, one of two that police found in the home of Donald Lee Morse, 
exploded with what one investigator described as "a terrific force," instantly 
killing the two officers. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old Morse is charged with two counts of murder and two counts of 
possessing explosives in the Feb. 8, 1986, deaths of Detective Arleigh McCree, 
46, then commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad, and 
Officer Ronald Ball, 43. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted in the San Fernando Superior Court case, Morse, a film and 
television makeup artist, could be sentenced to life in prison without 
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling E. Norris said Superior Court Judge John H. Major 
"appears to have sided with me" in ruling on pretrial motions about the 
admissibility of evidence of "alleged negligence by the victims." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Bernard J. Rosen agreed that Major has indicated that he will 
not allow such evidence to be introduced. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is sort of a unique case for which there aren't any good precedents," 
Rosen said. "I expect that we won't know the judge's final ruling until the 
witnesses are on the stand and I ask my questions and Norris makes his 
objections." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police went to Morse's home to search for a pistol that had been 
used four days earlier in the shooting of an official of the Makeup Artists and 
Hairstylists Union Local 706, of which Morse was a member. 
</P>
<P>
The gun was not found, and Morse was not charged in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
While conducting the search, officers found two bombs and summoned the police 
bomb squad. 
</P>
<P>
McCree and Ball dismantled one bomb, but were killed when they set off the 
second one while trying to defuse it. 
</P>
<P>
At Morse's preliminary hearing in September, 1986, police testified that the 
defendant denied any knowledge of the bombs when they were discovered. 
Prosecutors argued that as a result, Morse contributed to the officers' deaths 
by withholding information that could have helped the officers defuse the 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Norris contends that the prosecution need not show that Morse intended to kill 
the officers to obtain a murder conviction, only that he possessed an illegal 
lethal weapon that had no use other than to kill. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, police experts said Morse's fingerprints were found on several 
items surrounding the bombs and that explosive powder, batteries, tape, 
electrical wires and other items used to manufacture bombs were in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
Also, an estranged in-law testified that Morse had threatened to have him blown 
up in his car shortly before the bombs were found. 
</P>
<P>
Since the preliminary hearing, the case has been continued repeatedly, first at 
the behest of defense attorney Pierpont M. Laidley, who said he needed time to 
interview expert witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Major removed Laidley from the case 14 months ago when the attorney asked for 
more money to prepare the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Morse's trial has been postponed, first while Rosen studied the 
case and more recently because he became involved in another murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
Morse has been in County Jail without bail since the officers were killed.

ARSON BLAMED IN $25,000 FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arson is blamed for a fire that destroyed about $25,000 worth of building 
materials behind the San Diego Urban League headquarters in Southeast San Diego 
early Monday night, San Diego fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
When firefighters arrived at 5:20 p.m. at the Urban League office in the 4200 
block of Market Street, they saw a column of smoke rising from a storage area 
behind the one-story building. It took firefighters about 15 minutes to control 
the blaze, which destroyed wood and other building materials intended to be 
used for Urban League projects, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said late Monday night that arson had been determined to be the 
cause of the fire and that the Metro Arson Strike Team is continuing its 
investigation.

BALIAN FELT REMORSE, COURT TOLD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Navy captain Alexander G. Balian, on trial for not rescuing Vietnamese 
refugees, was remorseful at not picking them up but said Navy rules did not 
allow him to do so, a defense witness said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt bad about it. He had picked up people before. . . . He felt sorry, I 
guess, that these people didn't meet the guidelines," Bruce Butterfield said at 
Balian's court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
Balian, commander of the amphibious transport Dubuque, is charged with 
dereliction of duty for failing to rescue a boatload of refugees encountered by 
his ship in the South China Sea last June. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees said they turned to cannibalism after the Dubuque left them. Just 52 
of the 110 who left Vietnam survived the journey. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield was captain of the Kilauea, a civilian ship steaming behind the 
Dubuque. 
</P>
<P>
"He expressed to me remorse. I guess it was disappointment" that he had to 
leave the refugees behind, Butterfield said, recalling the radio conversation 
he said he had with Balian after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. naval ships, according to Navy rules, may pick up refugees if their craft 
is unseaworthy, if there are sick or injured aboard or if the refugees face 
imminent death. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield said Balian advised him he was not picking up the refugees but had 
given them food, water and navigational assistance. He said his impression from 
Balian was "these people were not in distress" and that the boat was seaworthy. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, in its second week, is being held at the U.S. naval base at Subic 
Bay. If convicted, Balian faces a maximum prison sentence of four years and 
three months, thousands of dollars in fines, discharge and loss of naval 
benefits.

PULPIT ARREST BRINGS CLAIM OF $15 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dispute in a small Monrovia church has escalated into a $15-million claim 
against the city by a former pastor who was handcuffed by police and taken from 
the pulpit during a Sunday service. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Obie S. Fox, who was arrested Dec. 18 at the 125-member Community 
Baptist Church, said he believes racism played a part in the unusual arrest at 
the black church. Fox contends that police would not have disrupted a service 
in a white church. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Robert Bartlett said he could not discuss the case because of pending 
litigation, but he said the arrest was legal. 
</P>

Fox was arrested for investigation of trespassing and disturbing the peace 
after two deacons lodged the charges. The incident was videotaped by another 
deacon, who routinely records the services. 
</P>

Bent Pastor's Arm 
</P>
<P>
The videotape shows Deacons Leon Washington and Clarence Jackson telling police 
Sgt. Rand Loechner and Officer Rich Wagnon to arrest Fox. When Fox attempted to 
show Wagnon the church bylaws, the officer took him by the right arm, bent it 
behind his back and escorted him from the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said the dispute "should be settled civilly." 
</P>
<P>
Fox last week filed a $15-million claim against the city of Monrovia and its 
Police Department, alleging "false arrest, assault and battery, intentional 
infliction of emotional distress." 
</P>
<P>
The city has six months to respond to the claim. After that time, Fox may file 
suit, said Stephen Wolfson, Fox's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson declined to discuss the issue on advice of his attorney. Washington 
could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Fox said he believes the uproar between the two factions arose from budget 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Larking, a former deacon, said he had questioned a financial report 
Jackson and Washington had submitted. He said the two deacons told congregants 
at a meeting the day before Fox's arrest that the pastor "was spending all the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
But Deacon Olen Graves called Larking's allegations "a bunch of lies."

VIOLENCE AND PORNOGRAPHY

Normally, The Times presents balanced views of qualified individuals. However, 
the diatribes of Jerry Kirk ("Ted Bundy Shows Us the Crystallizing Effect of 
Pornography") and Al Goldstein ("The Perversion of Truth Continues in Alleging 
a Porn-Crime Link") ill serve the reader (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 8). 
</P>
<P>
Kirk, who has a financial interest in puritanism, argues that the 1986 Attorney 
General's Commission on Pornography statistics show that 81% of the serial 
murderers studied "said their biggest sexual interest was in reading 
pornography." Thank God they usually found reading more interesting than 
killing! 
</P>
<P>
He uses the statements of Arthur Bishop, who killed boys, to support the 
contribution of pornography to the abuse of women. Isn't the indication instead 
that the sickness is in the mind and not the material? 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what " 'family' video outlets" Kirk habits but violent sexual 
films are not available there although fantasy films featuring explicit sex 
between consenting adults sometimes are. Kirk is as confused about the 
difference in sex and violence as the offenders he condemns. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein, who has a financial interest in pornography, implies that any 
censorship of pornography leads to Soviet-style repression. This is a lot like 
the National Rifle Assn. worrying about a ban on AK-47s leading to the 
Nicaraguan invasion of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
He also uses loaded illogic, discrediting the Meese panel because of the former 
attorney general's alleged improprieties which, if true, are reprehensible but 
have nothing to do with sex. 
</P>
<P>
There is a point at which censorship has a certain validity, Mr. Goldstein. 
There is certainly validity in further studies in deviant behavior, Mr. Kirk. 
Neither of you presents much validity in your self-interested arguments.

Confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi said he was one of two hooded 
hostage-takers who appeared at a Beirut news conference during the 1985 
hijacking of a TWA jetliner. Hamadi, charged with air piracy and murder in the 
hijacking, made the admission in court in Frankfurt, West Germany, after 
officials watched a videotape of the news conference. A U.S. Navy diver was 
killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days after the plane was 
diverted to Beirut. Hamadi has previously admitted his part in the hijacking 
but denies the murder charge.

Members of Greenpeace USA built a makeshift wire fence around several open 
barrels of cyanide found abandoned in a field in the Kern County desert 
community of Rosamond several weeks ago. Greenpeace workers were dressed in 
protective gear when they erected the 200-foot-long fence around the field to 
keep people out until the barrels can be removed, a spokeswoman for the group 
said. The group also posted a large sign at the location that read, "Warning: 
Cyanide Site Neglected by Your State Officials." Greenpeace said the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency will begin an investigation this week to find 
out who dumped the barrels there. Greenpeace alleges that the state has known 
about the cyanide for more than a year but has made no plans to remove or 
dispose of it.

As many as 7,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Port Arthur, Tex., 
after a leaking crude oil tank at a Chevron plant created a noxious cloud of 
gas with traces of hydrogen sulfide, officials said. More than 20 people were 
treated and released at hospitals for minor reactions, most for fume 
inhalation, officials said. Chevron officials said they were monitoring air 
quality in the area of the leak since it was discovered in the early afternoon, 
and described the gaseous release as a minimum health hazard. "Most crude oils 
in Texas have sulfur in them, and that means their gas containes hydrogen 
sulfide . . ." said Chevron spokesman Art Spencer. Hydrogen sulfide is a 
flammable, poisonous gas with an odor of rotten eggs. The odor got so strong 
that officials decided to evacuate people downwind of it, he said.

The Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, which was directed by President 
Bush to reform and revitalize federal ethical standards, is framing 
recommendations that would sharply reduce requirements for financial disclosure 
by government employees, the Washington Post reported. Among the proposals 
being considered are ones to eliminate requirements to report estimated income 
from stocks, partnerships and rental properties; gains or losses from sales of 
such assets, and the size of personal debts over $1,000, sources said. At a 
meeting Feb. 14, the panel took a preliminary vote to eliminate the need to 
assign estimated values to a person's financial holdings. One source said that 
"the public doesn't need to know" details of a person's financial situation, 
other than the names of holdings worth more than $1,000.

Costa Rica's ruling National Liberation Party nominated conservative economist 
Carlos Manuel Castillo, 60, as its presidential candidate for next year's 
election. With only 12% of the votes counted, engineer Roland Araya conceded 
defeat to Castillo, who was leading with 65% of the ballots. An estimated 
350,000 members of the party voted. President Oscar Arias Sanchez was not 
permitted to support either candidate, and the constitution prohibits him from 
running for reelection. Castillo will face Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier, who 
won the nomination of the opposition Social Christian Unity Party last 
November. Elections are scheduled for next Feb. 4.

A former Mexican army soldier, who admitted he shot 60 political prisoners and 
helped kill more than a hundred others, was granted political refugee status in 
Canada, according to his lawyer. Zacarias Osorio Cruz, 32, now lives near 
Montreal and is employed as an agricultural worker. A report published in the 
Toronto Star said Cruz told authorities that between 1977 and 1982, he was 
ordered to secretly kill prisoners who were "troublesome or bothersome to the 
high command." The Mexican government has denied having political prisoners. 
Attorney Stewart Istvanffy said Cruz tried to desert three times before 
slipping illegally into the United States in 1982. He moved to Canada in 1987.

A search was called off for two boys swept away by a riptide while playing in 
the surf north of Morro Rock, authorities said. Steve Dooty, 17, and 
Christopher Cabral, 13, were surfing on boogie-boards about 50 to 75 yards from 
shore Sunday when they disappeared, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman said. The 
father of the two boys, who are believed to be stepbrothers from Dinuba, was 
watching them, but "lost sight of the boys and was unable to locate them," 
Officer Manuel Silva said. "Moments later their boogie-board washed ashore 
without the boys."

Rhode Island failed to meet a deadline for eliminating prison overcrowding and 
faces potential fines of $50 a day for each of the 147 excess inmates. The 
intake center at the state prison complex held 397 people, said Joseph A. 
DiNitto, assistant to Corrections Director John Moran. U.S. District Judge 
Raymond Pettine, responding to a complaint from the American Civil Liberties 
Union, had set a limit of 250 prisoners at the intake center and threatened to 
impose fines of $50 per day for excess inmates. Pettine warned state officials 
Jan. 31 that he would be "very hard-nosed about this" when he considers levying 
fines at a March 13 hearing. DiNitto said the state has made a good-faith 
effort to comply with the judge's order, removing 135 inmates from the intake 
center since Wednesday.

An article by Daniel Williams ("Israeli Doctors and Arabs: Politics, Ethics in 
Collision," Part I, Jan. 23) paints a distorted picture of the availability of 
health care for Palestinian Arabs of Judea, Samaria and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations that Hadassah discriminates against any patient, under any 
circumstances, are totally without foundation. Since 1913 Hadassah has provided 
health care of the very highest quality to all who come to us in need -- Jews, 
Christians, Muslims, Druze -- regardless of their ethnic origin, religious and 
political beliefs or ability to pay. Throughout eight decades, as the Hadassah 
Medical Organization has grown to become Israel's largest and finest 
health-care complex, that policy has remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Arab doctors in Judea, Samaria and Gaza continue to refer patients to Hadassah 
facilities despite the unrest in the territories, as they have done since the 
hospitals first opened their doors. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 20 years, Hadassah has been working to upgrade health care in the 
territories by providing advanced professional training for Arab doctors and 
nurses. At present, 85 doctors from Judea and Samaria and 11 nurses from Gaza 
are participating in these programs. In addition, Palestinian Arabs are well 
represented among graduates of Hadassah's international master's degree program 
in public health and community medicine. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the conflict in the territories has had an impact on health 
care for Palestinian Arabs. Like all Israelis, residents of the territories 
contribute from their salaries to a fund for their medical needs. As Arab 
unrest has taken its toll on earnings, less money has been available to pay for 
medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
However, under an agreement between Hadassah and the civil administration of 
Judea and Samaria, Hadassah will be reimbursed for the care of any patient who 
is certified as being "in immediate risk of life or limb" on admission. In 
other cases, the cost of treating patients who cannot afford to pay is absorbed 
by Hadassah. Despite economic obstacles and the continuing conflict between 
Palestinian and Israeli, Hadassah remains committed to caring for all who come 
to us for help, without regard to race, creed or economic circumstances.

SORTING OUT SNITCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The unfolding scandal over the Los Angeles County district attorney's alleged 
misuse of jailhouse informants raises deeply disturbing questions about the 
operation of the criminal-justice system. When they are found, the answers to 
those questions may be more disturbing yet. 
</P>
<P>
But the questions have to be asked, and the answers must be found. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal began last October, when Leslie Vernon White -- a jailhouse snitch 
for whom prosecutors had done numerous favors in return for his testimony in 
numerous cases -- demonstrated his ability to fabricate confessions by other 
inmates whom he never even had met. White later said that he had lied on behalf 
of the prosecution in several cases. Defense attorneys and prosecutors 
subsequently have discovered more than 200 felony cases in which White and 
other such informants have testified over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Unpleasant questions arise from these unsavory facts: Have innocent people been 
convicted by lies? Have individual prosecutors turned a blind eye to perjury or 
been less than diligent in seeing that it did not occur? What role has the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which runs the jail, played in creating 
opportunities for the snitches to ply their shabby trade? What role have 
members of other law-enforcement agencies had in encouraging the creation of 
such opportunities? 
</P>
<P>
Both the defense Bar and the district attorney's office believe that answering 
these questions will require a grand-jury investigation. But to undertake such 
a probe the jury requires its own special counsel. This role cannot be filled 
by the state attorney general's office, which itself uses jailhouse informants 
in its prosecutions, or by the county counsel's office, which must act on 
behalf of the county or the Sheriff's Department in any civil actions arising 
from this scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, we say again what we have said before: The grand jury should ask the 
presiding judge of the Superior Court, Richard P. Byrne, to appoint a 
distinguished, disinterested member of the Bar as its special counsel. And it 
should do so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
In this case justice deferred is not yet justice denied, but it is justice 
under a cloud.

PLANET IN TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1990s must be "a turnaround decade" in curbing environmental pollution 
around the world. The degradation of the planet was much on America's mind last 
year, with farms baking in the drought and medical waste washing up on beaches. 
Before the concern fades to mere memory, the public must find ways to force 
legislators and international organizations to face the hard decisions needed 
to relieve the stress on the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 State of the World report by Worldwatch Institute provides an agenda 
and hopeful signs of grass-roots mobilization to overcome the dire risks that 
the experts describe. Worldwatch, a foundation-financed 
environmental-monitoring group, outlines four main areas for action: converting 
to energy systems that contribute less to global warming than do current fossil 
fuels, protecting imperiled forests and planting new ones, improving the world 
food supply and curtailing population growth. 
</P>
<P>
Half the global warming now occurring is caused by concentrations of carbon 
dioxide, which traps heat in the lower atmosphere. Less carbon dioxide would be 
produced if less fossil fuel was burned. That means improving the fuel 
efficiency of cars, appliances and power plants, Worldwatch suggests, as well 
as encouraging greater use of hydro, solar, wind and geothermal power. 
</P>
<P>
The Earth's vegetation and soil store carbon, so, when forests are cleared or 
burned, that carbon is released, adding to the buildup of carbon dioxide and 
increasing global warming. Forests must be planted and protected, yet many 
tropical countries lack the money to do so and need the income from logging and 
development. Worldwatch suggests that commercial banks could reduce the debt of 
Third World countries in return for those countries' agreement to improve 
conservation policies. The World Bank should also use its leverage to promote 
reforestation. 
</P>
<P>
Massive increases in food production are unlikely in many areas, Worldwatch 
reports, although yields can be raised in the Soviet Union, Brazil, Argentina 
and India. But during the 1990s there may be 90 million more people to feed 
each year, so "future food security may lie more in the hands of family 
planners than farmers." 
</P>
<P>
And the family planners face many countries that may have waited too long to 
shift to smaller families. Now those countries may have to decide on China's 
stern one-child-family goal or a decline in living standards. The experience in 
China and Japan since World War II shows that cutting population growth is not 
out of the question, but it requires education, family-planning services, 
incentives for small families and widespread improvements in economic 
conditions. In all those areas the United Nations, the World Bank and the rest 
of the international-development community can and must provide assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Where will the world find leadership and technical expertise for the kind of 
global effort that lies ahead? It can and should come from the superpowers. 
George Kennan first suggested years ago that if -- instead of concentrating on 
weapons -- the United States and the Soviet Union worked together to preserve 
the environment, they would add not only to their own national security but to 
that of the planet as well. It is time to take the suggestion seriously.

VIOLENCE AND PORNOGRAPHY

I fully agree with Kirk on the destructive nature of pornography. It's a 
progressive "disease." It feeds on fantasy. If one continues to expose one's 
self to pornography on a regular basis, what's normal and what's not gradually 
gets blurred. 
</P>
<P>
But ban pornography? That scares me more than the crime. The argument for 
banning it to reduce the crimes of violence associated with it can validly be 
used on other freedoms we have: i.e., the freedom to drink, to bear arms, and 
on and on. To regulate it on moral grounds terrifies me. Who's going to be 
making my moral decisions? 
</P>
<P>
Pornography is not a positive thing for society. But who among us does not have 
a vice, that if taken to the extreme, does not have the possibility of being 
destructive?

SIMI SCHOOL OFFICIALS TRY SONG AND DANCE STRATEGY TO GET VOTERS' ATTENTION

Simi Valley school district officials say they learned their lesson after 
losing a close bond election last year. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the town hall meetings that the district holds to promote its 
position are short on statistics and long on shtick, with performances by 
singing and dancing students whose parents are almost a sure bet to attend. 
</P>
<P>
The coffee-and-cookie Talent Night performances are just part of the district's 
campaign to pass two new measures asking voters to approve $43 million in 
school bonds in a special election March 7. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making a major effort to get into the community," school board President 
Lew Roth said. So far, the strategy is working. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 parents showed up for a recent district presentation to watch 
their children sing, dance, play the piano, perform skits and lead cheers. The 
performances by students of four elementary schools and one junior high 
followed a 15-minute presentation by district officials and community members 
in support of the two measures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Really Too Intensive' 
</P>
<P>
"Last year they had meetings for the school bond at every single school," said 
Pamela Spencer, the district's public relations coordinator who came up with 
the entertainment idea. "They were cumbersome, very long presentations that 
were really too intensive for the general public." 
</P>
<P>
So instead, parents and students at the Sinaloa Junior High School meeting, one 
of four districtwide, got to hear a pint-sized Michael Jackson imitator, the 
first movement of Sonatina No. 2 by Clemente and an elaborately costumed 
flapper girl routine. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Psik said that although he enjoyed the performance, he resented being 
lured to the meeting to see his sixth-grade daughter, Janelle, and her 
classmates from Abraham Lincoln Elementary School perform patriotic songs, 
including "America the Beautiful," in sign language. "I'm not convinced yet," 
he said of the measures. 
</P>
<P>
Voters last year narrowly defeated a $35-million bond issue to repair aging 
schools in part because supporters took victory for granted, officials said. In 
addition, town hall meetings on the issue were sparsely attended, only a 
handful of volunteers were recruited and not enough money was raised to 
campaign effectively, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley attorney Robert O. Huber, co-chairman of Citizens for Yes on School 
Measures A and B, said the committee hopes to persuade voters that the bond 
measures are a matter of city pride. "It's a community issue; we can't be real 
proud of the way our schools look," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volunteers Recruited 
</P>
<P>
The committee has recruited more than 200 volunteers to staff telephones and 
walk door-to-door and so far has raised more than $6,000 to pay for a political 
consultant and other campaign expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The 27 elementary, junior high and high schools in the Simi Valley Unified 
School District probably won't look much different even if the two measures 
pass, district officials said. Most of the $35 million sought in Measure A, 
about 77%, will pay for air conditioning and heating. The rest will be for 
plumbing, roofing and asphalt repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's cold the air conditioning goes on and when it's hot the heater seems 
to kick on," said Sinaloa Junior High ninth-grader Michelle McMorris, one of 
several students stumping for the measure by speaking to groups around town. 
</P>
<P>
The district's nearly 19,000 students attend schools that are, on average, 
about 26 years old, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Measure B, which calls for an $8-million bond issue, would pay for three new 
junior high school gymnasiums and an auditorium at a fourth junior high, as 
well as a football stadium at Royal High School. Although voters could approve 
Measure A and reject Measure B, Measure B cannot be approved alone. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds would be paid off in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The combined annual cost of both measures to the average Simi Valley homeowner 
would range from about $20 the first year to a high of about $65, district 
officials said. The average homeowner pays about $120 a year on the $13 million 
the district still owes on state school construction loans, said Associate 
Supt. Cathi Vogel. 
</P>
<P>
A bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and passed 
Friday would, however, extend the repayment time of the existing debt from 
three to six years, officials said. The bill was approved by the state Senate 
35 to 0 and is expected to be signed by Gov. George Deukmejian later this 
month, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The extension would cut the annual amount now paid by taxpayers. It is 
contingent on passage of Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
Endorsements for the two ballot measures have come from the Ventura County 
Taxpayers Assn., the local Chamber of Commerce, the area's Board of Realtors 
and local service clubs. Mayor Gregory Stratton is one of the signers of the 
ballot argument in favor of the measures. 
</P>
<P>
But even with such widespread support, as well as no organized opposition, 
Huber and others said tax hikes are a tough sell because they require approval 
by two-thirds of the voters. Last time, the bond issue failed only by 100 or so 
votes, prompting frustrated school board members to blame the local newspaper, 
even though it had endorsed the measure, as well as residents who were given 
absentee ballots but did not return them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last Year's Opponent 
</P>
<P>
The most vocal opponent to last year's bond measure, Ventura County Community 
College District board member Tom Ely, said he has yet to decide whether to 
speak out on this year's measures. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should we be giving people responsible for the deterioration more money to 
handle when they haven't properly handled the money they already have?" Ely 
said. "But I don't want to deny educational benefits to students just because 
the district administrators and board are inept." 
</P>
<P>
At least two parents who had come to see their children perform at a recent 
town hall meeting on the bond issues had similar questions. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a $50-million to $60-million annual budget now, why isn't the work 
being done with the money you have?" Gordon E. Micklos asked during a 
question-and-answer session Wednesday at Sinaloa Junior High. He said most 
districts in the state are making do without new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said about 85% of the district's annual budget is used to pay salaries and 
benefits, leaving little for the needed repairs.

SIMI VALLEY MAN HELD IN ROBBERY, KIDNAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Simi Valley man was arrested Monday on charges of robbing, kidnaping and 
stealing the car of a 17-year-old youth who picked him up while he was 
hitchhiking. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Police Sgt. Neal Rein said Ronald Edward Miller, 23, was arrested 
at his home at 2:30 a.m., based on the victim's description. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began shortly after midnight Sunday when the victim, also from 
Simi Valley, picked up Miller, who was hitchhiking on Tapo Street near Township 
Avenue. The victim's name was not released because he is a minor. Miller told 
the youth that he had a gun, stole about $12 and forced him to drive toward the 
San Fernando Valley on the Simi Valley Freeway, the victim told police. 
</P>
<P>
Near Topanga Canyon Boulevard, the youth deliberately crashed into the freeway 
divider, jumped out and flagged down a passing driver, police said. Miller 
allegedly drove off in the victim's car. 
</P>
<P>
When Miller was arrested Monday morning, the stolen car was parked in front of 
his home, police said. He was being held in lieu of $50,000 bail.

OFF-DUTY DEPUTY SHOT IN FIGHT WITH SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty sheriff's deputy was shot in the hand during a struggle with a 
suspected auto thief who police said tried to grab the deputy's pistol early 
Monday outside a Woodland Hills condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Russell, 32, a five-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department, was on his 
way to work about 5 a.m. when he saw two men jump over a security fence in the 
22100 block of Burbank Boulevard, said Los Angeles Police Det. Phil Quartararo. 
The men, who were carrying flashlights, tried the door handles of a Porsche and 
a Cadillac limousine in the parking lot of the condominium complex, Quartararo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Russell identified himself as a sheriff's officer and ordered the men to stop, 
Quartararo said. 
</P>
<P>
The men ran. Russell chased one of them and cornered him in the courtyard of 
the complex near the pool, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
Russell and the man struggled over the officer's gun, which went off and 
injured two of Russell's fingers on his left hand, Quartararo said. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, with the aid of two condominium complex residents, held the man until 
police came, Quartararo said. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Bryan Albert Bernard, 20 of Panorama City on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer. He was being held in West 
Valley police station in lieu of $15,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Russell underwent surgery, which saved both fingers, Monday morning at 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center. He was in good condition, according to 
hospital spokeswoman Leslie Wither.

REFLECTIONS: 'FROM MY CHILDHOOD, MY FATHER TOLD ME I WAS GOING TO BE A DOCTOR.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PERRY C. RIDDLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Uzma Khalid selected psychiatry as her specialty when as an intern she 
found that her first choice was incompatible with raising a family. Today she 
has her own practice in Agoura Hills. Khalid, her husband, Shahid, and their 
three children live in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up in many different towns. My father was a government servant in 
Pakistan and he got transferred to many small towns. In my early years, I 
remember going from one school to another. 
</P>
<P>
My grandfather was very much into education and really wanted all his 
grandchildren to become well educated and become professionals. He saw what was 
happening, and when I was 11 years old, he called my father and he said: "What 
are you doing to your kids? You don't stay in one place more than six months. 
You're going to destroy their education. They'll spend summer vacations with 
you, but they're going to stay with me to go to school." 
</P>
<P>
Where I come from, if your grandfather says something, that's what happens. 
</P>
<P>
From my childhood, my father told me I was going to be a doctor. And I always 
wanted to be a physician. I got admission into Kinnaird College for Women where 
you do two years of preparation for medical school. I worked very hard, because 
I knew there was no other thing for me but medicine. We have a final exam for 
students all over Pakistan. The first year I took it I was the top student in 
the entire country. 
</P>
<P>
The second year, I was working very hard and not looking after myself. I got 
typhoid. At times I was so faint that I couldn't even look at my paper. The 
final exam couldn't be postponed. If I didn't do it, I wasted one year. 
</P>
<P>
I had studied the whole year, so even though I was sick, it was still with me, 
and I survived. When the results came out, I had come in third and I got a 
national talent scholarship. That put me through medical school. 
</P>
<P>
When I graduated in 1970, I took the Education Council for Foreign Medical 
Graduates exam to come to the States. I thought it was just like any other exam 
in Pakistan. But ECFMG is different. It's a race against time. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't make it, and that was a blow to me. I had never failed in anything 
after I came to my grandfather's house. I was always top of the class. 
</P>
<P>
There was a lot of frustration, a lot of humility. I learned there's nothing 
wrong with making mistakes, as long as you use those mistakes as stepping 
stones toward bettering yourself. I passed my ECFMG the second time I took it. 
</P>
<P>
When my daughter was just five months old I got a rotating internship in 
pediatrics at Children of Mercy Hospital, in Kansas City, a very busy hospital. 
There were no weekends. Every other night I slept at the hospital, and the 
nights that I came home around 10 she would already be asleep. 
</P>
<P>
Coming from the culture that I came from, that was very difficult for me. I was 
a mother that was abandoning my child. I can remember nights crying. What to 
do? I had to be a good physician, I had to be there, because those kids needed 
me. 
</P>
<P>
After those four months, I thought, "Do I want to do pediatrics?" I considered 
psychiatry, but coming from Pakistan, we're still at the mental asylum stage. 
It wasn't until I rotated in a psychiatric unit that I saw a totally different 
side of psychiatry that was appealing. I saw people who were very sick, and 
also people who were going through a crisis in their life. They needed guiding 
and help. 
</P>
<P>
Patients come to you, and they open their heart and soul to you. It's all in 
front of you, and it makes you feel so close to them. It's a very private sort 
of relationship. 
</P>
<P>
So that's why I chose psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
When I was growing up with my grandfather, I never thought that I would be a 
psychiatrist. But I'm very happy with where I have come. I feel I still haven't 
reached the number of women I want to reach. I haven't said what I want to say. 
I haven't helped as many people as I want to help. But I feel very good about 
what I've done in my life.

SILL TAKES A LIKING TO THE LANES, TOPS QUALIFYING 
</P>

Aleta Sill likes the oil at Kearny Mesa Bowl. That's the long and the short of 
things. 
</P>
<P>
Long oil -- when the lane is oiled nearly all the way to the pins -- tends to 
give her game a boost. On short oil -- when it's stopped after 24 feet -- she 
usually slips out of contention early. 
</P>
<P>
Sill, of Dearborn, Mich., jumped from third to first place Monday, finishing 
with a total of 3,853 pins to take a 139-pin lead over second-place Alberta 
Acosta of Pacifica at the conclusion of the two-day qualifying round of the 
Ladies Pro Bowlers Tour tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Sill doesn't find herself in first often these days, particularly because the 
trend has shifted from using long oil on lanes to short oil. Long oil favors 
bowlers like Sill, who put more spin on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a really rough time of it," said Sill, who has won 14 career titles. 
"Most all tournaments are short oil. You have to be really on to score good on 
it. It gets to you after a while." 
</P>
<P>
No problem here. The lanes are oiled beyond the standard 24 feet. Sill put 
herself in position to win her first tournament since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Short oil, Sill said, throws the break of her shot off. When she adjusts for 
it, she can't bowl the way that is most natural to her. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Soutar, a 29-year veteran of the tour who made the cut finishing 14th, 
said long oil tends to keep scores low. Long oil was common until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Davenport of Shreveport, La., is in third place entering today's final 
round with 3,674. 
</P>
<P>
First-round leader Wendy Macpherson of San Diego finished fifth at 3,624. 
</P>
<P>
There are two divisions for today's top-24 match play, starting at 9 a.m. and 3 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament concludes Wednesday night with the stepladder finals, beginning 
at 7.

<P>
Under the playoff system used two years ago in San Diego Section high school 
boys' basketball, El Capitan and Mission Bay would not have met in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
Going into Monday's Division II first round, Mission Bay (16-7, 7-3 in the City 
Western League) would have competed in the Class 2-A playoffs. El Capitan 
(9-17, 2-6 in the Grossmont 3-A League) would have had its season over by now. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, like last season, every team is eligible for the playoffs, where 
60 games over a two-week period will determine five champions. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay's winning percentage was 32% higher than El Capitan's. And, for 
three quarters Monday, it looked as if the Buccaneers would win handily. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay led by 25 points early in the fourth quarter, but held on for a 
67-59 victory at home to advance to the second round Thursday against 
eighth-seeded Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little late and a little short with the comeback," said Jim Gleboff, 
El Capitan's coach. 
</P>
<P>
But the effort was valiant. Jeremy McGarity scored 12 of his game-high 25 
points and Eagle LaChappa (nine points) made three three-pointers in the fourth 
quarter as El Capitan outscored Mission Bay, 23-6, over the final 7 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
With runs of five and 11 points, El Capitan pulled to within, 63-52, with 3 
minutes left. After Peter Wilson made two free throws and Brett Grebing one, El 
Capitan scored seven in a row to pull within, 66-59. But only 14 seconds 
remained. A Ken North free throw ended the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
For three quarters, Mission Bay dominated behind the shooting and passing of 
Wilson. The 5-foot-8 point guard had 19 points (only two in the fourth quarter) 
and 11 assists. Six-foot-six center Brett Grebing added 14 points and 11 
rebounds. Keith Berkley and Jim Thomas had 10 each. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, known more for his passing and ballhandling skills than his scoring 
ability, has a season-high of 20 points against Kearny. But come playoff time, 
Wilson, a senior, seems to shine. Last season, in a 61-51 first-round playoff 
victory over San Pasqual, Wilson had 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's crunch time. That's where I get my motivation," said Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mission Bay Coach Mike Seaman, "He goes unnoticed for the contributions 
that he makes. But tonight, he had a great game." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay won seven of its last eight league games to finish in a first-place 
tie with La Jolla.

RANCHO SANTA FE BANK, GROSSMONT MAY MERGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Santa Fe National Bank has begun negotiations toward a merger with La 
Mesa-based Grossmont Bank, officials said Monday. If completed, the proposed 
deal would create a bank with $412 million in assets and 11 branch offices in 
San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary negotiations are subject to the execution of a definitive 
agreement, as well as approval by both banks' shareholders, the California 
State Banking Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal 
Reserve Board. Grossmont would become the surviving bank, according to terms of 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santa Fe National, which is headquartered in Rancho Santa Fe, operates 
two branch offices. On Dec. 31, the bank reported $110 million in assets and 
$835,000 in net income. Grossmont reported $302 million in assets and $4.1 
million in net assets. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santa Fe National last year failed to complete a proposed $12-million 
sale to Costa Mesa-based Citizens Holdings for $12 million. Rancho Santa Fe 
National's shareholders would have received $21.70 per share had that deal been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens, which had signed a letter of intent to acquire Rancho Santa Fe 
National, blamed new federal banking policies when it abandoned the deal in 
late October. 
</P>
<P>
That deal marked the third time in recent years that Rancho Santa Fe National 
failed to complete a proposed merger or acquisition. In 1985, it abandoned a 
previously announced acquisition of Hidden Valley National Bank of Escondido. A 
year later, it opened its branch office in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Rancho Santa Fe National backed away from a planned merger involving 
three other San Diego County banks. First National Corp., National Bank of 
Fairbanks Ranch and National Bankshares of La Jolla eventually completed that 
merger in 1987.

 Maxwell Laboratories reported that second-quarter net income fell to $505,000 
for the second quarter ended Jan. 31, down from $661,000 the previous second 
quarter. Revenue fell to $13.7 million, down from $14.9 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Net income fell to $1.3 million for the six-month period ended Jan. 31, down 
from $1.5 million during the like quarter a year ago. Revenue fell to $29.3 
million, down from $31.1 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell linked the drop in profit and revenue to "protests by unsuccessful 
bidders (that) delayed the start of several large programs." Maxwell's backlog 
on Jan. 31 reached an all-time high of $109 million.

WOODLAND HILLS PRINTER MAKER IS LOOKING FOR RIGHT SUITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dataproducts Corp. is being shopped around to prospective buyers. And analysts 
and major shareholders of the Woodland Hills computer printer maker believe its 
next owner could well be Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Dataproducts said "qualified prospective strategic buyers" 
are being sought by the company's New York investment banker, Goldman, Sachs 
&amp; Co. The move came following the disclosure by an investment group led by 
Wall Street veteran John K. Castle that the group owns 1.4 million Dataproducts 
shares, or about 7% of its stock, and wants to gain control. Last Tuesday, the 
group said it retained Chase Manhattan Bank to help arrange financing to buy 
Dataproducts. 
</P>
<P>
Dataproducts won't say how its search for potential buyers is going. Chairman 
Jack C. Davis said Friday that he and other directors have given Goldman, Sachs 
no deadline to find prospective buyers and added that the company is trying to 
keep its business running normally. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to operate as efficiently and as effectively as we can," Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and shareholders familiar with Dataproducts said the most interest in 
buying the company will probably come from Japan, most likely from such 
technology conglomerates as Toshiba, Hitachi, Fujitsu and Tokyo Juki. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies, they said, would be interested for two reasons: First, 
Dataproducts has a wide range of customers. As the nation's biggest independent 
maker of computer printers, its products are bought by such firms as Unisys, 
Digital Equipment, Wang and Data General, which in turn sell them as part of 
their office systems. For the nine months that ended Dec. 24, the company 
posted sales of $268.1 million, earning a profit of $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The second reason is that Dataproducts owns the rights to a new technology the 
Japanese don't have in which machines print by spraying ink that comes from a 
heated, crayon-like bar. 
</P>
<P>
The machine, called a solid ink-jet printer, has been slow to sell since being 
introduced in 1987. Technology analysts believe buyers have resisted because of 
the printer's high price, now nearly $3,000. Dataproducts does not release 
figures on sales for the printer or its development costs. Securities analysts 
estimate that the company has annual sales of about $5 million and that it 
spent between $50 million and $100 million over the years to develop and launch 
the new printer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the slow sales, the printer's technology has been widely praised 
because it is quiet, prints cleanly without being messy and eventually will 
print high-quality color. Should the price come down, some analysts speculate, 
it could become the printer of choice in offices in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"The crown jewel of Dataproducts is the solid-ink jet printer," said William D. 
Easterbrook, a computer equipment analyst in San Francisco for Kidder Peabody 
&amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies, securities analysts say, may want to buy the rights to the 
Dataproducts technology before it threatens their laser printer business. Laser 
printers use a laser beam to produce sharp images. 
</P>
<P>
Another attraction of Dataproducts is that the company has some valuable 
assets. Robert Anderson, an analyst with Brean Murray Foster Securities in New 
York, estimates that the company has about $100 million worth of cash and land 
in the Warner Center section of Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
It is less likely that the buyer for Dataproducts would be European, analysts 
said. But Dataproducts has a close relationship with some companies there, 
supplying West Germany's Siemens AG and Italy's Olivetti. Another name 
mentioned as a possible buyer is Memorex Telex from The Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
The least likely buyer, they say, would be an American company or a 
management-led group. U.S. companies that might be interested, such as Genicom 
Corp., a computer printer company in Waynesboro, Va., are probably too small to 
buy Dataproducts, they said. And a management buyout, which would require large 
amounts of borrowed money, is considered risky because the technology business 
is so volatile. 
</P>
<P>
One likely bidder will be the New York investment group led by Castle, who was 
a key figure on Wall Street in the early 1980s, when he was chief executive of 
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
Castle said last week that his group, which surfaced as a potential buyer in 
December, is eager to review any information Dataproducts provides potential 
buyers. The group has previously said it might consider bidding $15 a share for 
the company, which would put the company's value at $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts said they believe Castle, who left Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; 
Jenrette in 1986 to form his own firm, is eager to make a major acquisition 
such as Dataproducts, especially after hinting for two months that his group 
may bid for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Castle's reputation is on the line," Easterbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
Dataproducts' stock closed Friday at $17.125 a share in trading on the American 
Stock Exchange, up 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KEY DATES: 
</P>
<P>
April 10, 1988: Dataproducts, led by Jack C. Davis, announces loss of $14.9 
million for year ended March 26, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 23, 1988: New York investment group, led by John K. Castle, discloses it 
owns 5.2% of Dataproducts and may seek control. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 2, 1989: Group is joined by other investors, raising stake to about 7%. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 10, 1989: Dataproducts says it will search for potential buyers for the 
company.

VALLEY EARNINGS: VALENCIA'S HUNTWAY PARTNERS LOSES $441,000 IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntway Partners, a Valencia producer of liquid asphalt and other oil-based 
products, said it lost $441,000 in the fourth quarter compared with a 
year-earlier profit of $1.58 million. 
</P>
<P>
The loss came on a 27% drop in revenue to $17.9 million from $24.5 million, 
Huntway said. The company is organized as a master limited partnership whose 
ownership units, which are similar to shares of stock, began trading publicly 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
Huntway blamed the loss on a sharp drop in prices of crude oil products during 
the quarter, which shaved the company's profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1988, however, Huntway's profit rose 40% to $3.16 million from $2.25 
million, despite a drop in revenue to $82.8 million from $97.5 million.

PROTOCOL CHIEFS PUT CITY'S BEST FOOT FORWARD 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Icelandic ambassador to the United States visited Los Angeles during a 
recent round-the-world sojourn, he was greeted by a barrage of county protocol 
officials who did their best to make his brief stay more enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador lunched with a member of the County Board of Supervisors at the 
exclusive California Club downtown. Then the protocol staff drove him and his 
wife to see the La Brea Tar Pits, where anthropologists are still excavating 
ancient fossils. At the end of the afternoon, they presented him with a book 
about Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing fancy, but cordial. 
</P>
<P>
His visit to San Diego was slightly different. The ambassador bought a map, 
rented a car and got lost trying to find Sea World. No city officials 
acknowledged him. He didn't receive a key to the city. There wasn't even a 
basket of fruit in his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a perfect example of why we need an office of protocol in San 
Diego," said Jeanne K. Lawrence, one of two prominent San Diegans tapped by 
Mayor Maureen O'Connor to serve as the city's first chiefs of protocol. 
"Dignitaries come here all the time, but no one knows it because there's no 
office here to do the advance work." 
</P>
<P>
The Icelander spent part of his stay at the Hotel del Coronado, the historic 
inn that Lawrence once helped operate. Ironically, the new protocol chief 
didn't even know the ambassador was staying there. 
</P>
<P>
"At least I could have sent flowers to his room," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence's partner is Anne L. Evans, owner and operator of the successful Bahia 
and Catamaran hotels on Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor selected the high-profile women to serve in her stead when foreign 
dignitaries, national political figures, state officials and other VIPs come to 
town. Lawrence and Evans, both unpaid volunteers, work under the direction of 
Cheryl Ayers, who earns $50,000 a year as the mayor's new director of protocol. 
Until she began working for O'Connor last fall, Ayers was public relations 
director for Neiman Marcus in Mission Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Their goal is not only to showcase the city, but to respond to visitors' needs, 
Ayers said, whether that visitor is the President of the United States or the 
mayor of Sedona, Ariz. For example, when the wife of a Lodi city councilman was 
attacked 
</P>
<P>
recently and had to be hospitalized during her stay, Ayers and her office 
arranged for a place where the councilman could stay until his wife was well 
enough to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Protocol is making people feel good," she said. "It's not just receiving heads 
of state. This is not just an office we've opened up to spend a lot of money 
and entertain people."

The trio's biggest fear is that the public might believe the latter. They 
cringe to think they might be perceived as froufrou socialites with nothing 
better to do than throw gala bashes. They see themselves as accomplished 
businesswomen willing to work hard to make the city shine in the eyes of 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason San Diego can't have the same patina of glamour as San 
Francisco or London," said Evans, who was born and raised here. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see why the three women are concerned that their office might be 
seen as little more than the party arm of O'Connor's administration. Lawrence 
has traveled throughout the world with her now-estranged husband, Larry 
Lawrence, owner of the Hotel Del. The petite blonde is often pictured on the 
society pages, most recently linked arm-in-arm with San Francisco Chronicle 
columnist Herb Caen during a New Year's Eve party in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Evans is among the city's premier hoteliers and boasts a bevy of political and 
civic involvements on her resume. In 1984, she co-chaired the county's 
Reagan-Bush Committee and served as a delegate to the Republican National 
Convention that year. 
</P>
<P>
Both women attended President Bush's inauguration last month in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Ayers worked in media relations with Neiman Marcus for almost eight years, and 
for Robinson's for three years before that. Her high-profile position included 
appearances on local television shows to discuss high fashion, as well as 
planning elaborate, black-tie fund-raisers with the store's wealthy patrons. 
Her name also appears often in San Diego's society news. 
</P>
<P>
But their lives aren't as tony as they appear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Runs the Family Business 
</P>
<P>
Evans, with her late husband, William, helped turn their Mission Bay hotels 
into a thriving and lucrative enterprise while raising their five children. She 
now runs the family business with their help and maintains her civic 
involvements. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence holds a master's in business administration from George Washington 
University and recently received her doctorate in that discipline from United 
States International University in San Diego. She taught computer science at 
College of San Mateo before joining the Hotel Del, worked as a consultant in 
Silicon Valley and once produced and hosted a television series about cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Ayers, a longtime single mother of two, worked her way up from a job in a local 
advertising agency before Neiman Marcus wooed her away from her publicist's 
position at Robinson's. One of her most time-consuming jobs as director of 
protocol is to write congratulation letters to San Diegans who celebrate their 
50th wedding anniversaries and to young winners of spelling bees. 
</P>
<P>
"Protocol is not all fluff," Ayers said. "Dotting the I's and crossing the T's, 
making sure we don't make any glaring errors or faux pas, and that we always 
put our best foot forward. . . . That's what protocol is about." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Take Some Finesse 
</P>
<P>
Convincing San Diegans that the protocol office is necessary for a growing city 
with burgeoning foreign interests may take all the finesse these women can 
muster. Especially when taxpayers are spending $50,000 plus benefits on Ayers' 
salary, and about $20,000 on her assistant. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Bob Filner said he has received queries from constituents 
asking the same question Evans acknowledges she has heard privately: "Some 
people say, 'Well, we need a new sewer, why do we need an office of protocol?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it's an area we can no longer afford to ignore, from a 
dollar-and-cents standpoint and from an image standpoint," mayoral press 
secretary Paul Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
There's a direct correlation, he said, between good protocol and the financial 
interests of the city. Businesses interested in locating here are among those 
the protocol office hopes to woo with information and support slathered with 
plain old San Diego hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
"That's kind of been a missing component in the mayor's office for years," 
Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
As an emerging power along the Pacific Rim, San Diego needs to maintain an 
office that can coordinate international visits from dignitaries and 
businessmen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handled Sporadically 
</P>
<P>
Before Ayers came on board, Downey handled protocol efforts sporadically. 
During past administrations, the duties usually fell to whoever was available. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all six American cities larger than San Diego -- New York, Los 
Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and Detroit -- have protocol offices, 
as do many cities in the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller metropolitan areas along the Pacific Rim, including Seattle and 
Portland, do not have protocol offices. But they do maintain 
international-relations departments to handle continuing involvement with 
foreign -- mostly Asian -- countries. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, the mayor asked Lawrence and Evans to investigate offices of 
protocol in other cities and to create goals and guidelines for a similar 
office here. She told them, "I want a first-class way to receive people in this 
city," Lawrence recalled. "She's had a chance to see how things in other cities 
are done and she said, 'Hey, we can do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
"And at very little expense," Evans added. 
</P>
<P>
On their own time and with their own money, the pair met with protocol officers 
in San Francisco and Los Angeles and attended a conference in New York to get 
ideas on how to form a similar office in San Diego. Both Lawrence and Evans 
think of their jobs as professional positions, and perhaps take it even more 
seriously than a job because they consider themselves ambassadors for San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goals Sent to Mayor 
</P>
<P>
The goals they have outlined in a concise, two-page proposal now on the mayor's 
desk include: 
</P>
<P>
* Showcasing San Diego as a preeminent American city with physical, cultural, 
educational and commercial assets worthy of attention and interest. 
</P>
<P>
* Bringing the benefits of international exchange to the people of San Diego, 
and participating in activities that develop an understanding among San Diegans 
of other cultures and people. 
</P>
<P>
* Reflecting the diversity of local interests, including those involving 
culture, education, the military, tourism and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The new protocol chiefs plan to continue their exploration with a visit to 
Boston. That city recently hosted a Russian festival, and Lawrence and Evans 
hope to pick up tips that will help them when the Russians come to San Diego 
next fall for the Soviet Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
They have contributed in other ways as well. Evans welcomed Princess Christina 
of Sweden to San Diego with a party at the Bahia, which she hosted and paid 
for. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be made clear we are not competing for funds. . . . This is a 
separate and privately run office," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
According to other cities, it's not unusual for wealthy, socially prominent 
business executives to start a city's initial protocol efforts. In San 
Francisco, apparel magnate Cyril Magnin, founder of I. Magnin and the 
now-defunct Joseph Magnin clothing stores, opened that city's Office of 
Protocol using his own money. It is now run by the city, but several prominent 
business people still volunteer their time. 
</P>
<P>
Said Evans: "This city is evolving. . . . We have a destiny. And to share in 
that, well, I just couldn't wait."

THE EXCITEMENT RAN DEEP IN CAMERAMAN'S LATEST FILM PROJECT

<P>
As one of the country's most respected underwater cameramen, Chuck Nicklin has 
swum with sharks, spent long days and nights in the Bahamas with Nick Nolte and 
Jacqueline Bisset and shared air, compressed air, with Bond, James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
But he has never had an experience quite like falling into "The Abyss," his 
latest Hollywood film project. 
</P>
<P>
"We did things on 'Abyss' that I didn't believe," said Nicklin, 61, a veteran 
of almost every conceivable type of underwater photography. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to be one of the hottest movies of this summer, "The Abyss" is an 
action-adventure extravaganza under the direction of James Cameron ("Aliens," 
"The Terminator") with a price tag already in the $40-million range. Nicklin 
recently spent three months on location in South Carolina working on the film's 
complex underwater sequences. 
</P>
<P>
For 12 weeks, he spent an average of 12 hours a day working in huge water tanks 
built in an abandoned atomic reactor. Armies of divers were choreographed with 
submarines, missiles and a dozen other technical props. Nicklin would often 
spend five hours at a time underwater, driven by a director who "knows what he 
wants and is always right." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of time we would be tired . . . but he would work harder than anybody," 
Nicklin said of Cameron. 
</P>
<P>
There was no escape in South Carolina for the crews, who were housed in a 
"truck stop" hotel. Nicklin describes it as the toughest film project he has 
ever worked on. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, when it comes out, I know I can be proud to say I was part of that 
thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The sensationalism and supposed glamour of working on location for a Hollywood 
film seems far removed from Nicklin's small La Jolla house, where he spends 
much of his time. In San Diego, he is best known as one of the co-founders and 
majority owner of the Diving Locker chain of stores, which celebrates its 30th 
anniversary this year. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklin is a familiar figure in La Jolla, a regular in the local eating and 
drinking establishments and an active trustee of the La Jolla Town Council. 
</P>
<P>
Six to eight months out of each year, however, Nicklin is usually busy on some 
type of underwater film project. He has supplied still photos for every major 
nature magazine in the world, and, when he's not filming sharks off Australia 
or whales in Alaska for documentary projects, he is usually working on some 
type of Hollywood film. 
</P>
<P>
Until "The Abyss," his biggest film project was working as a lead cameraman for 
"The Deep," the popular 1977 movie of underwater intrigue starring Nolte and 
Bisset. For Nicklin, it was a far more enjoyable experience than "The Abyss." 
</P>
<P>
The crew stayed in nice hotels in the Bahamas, and, after each day's filming, 
when the principals met to discuss the next day's shooting, Nicklin would put 
on a jacket and go to dinner with the actors. He purposely removes himself from 
the pressures and rigors of the film business. He's a cameraman first and 
foremost, with no desire to become a producer or director. 
</P>
<P>
"He really prefers not to get involved in the ulcers," said Al Giddings, 
Nicklin's friend for 25 years. "He likes to leave that to me. As I leave for 
some insane meeting, he always says to me, 'Be sure to drink your milk.' " 
</P>
<P>
Giddings -- the director of photography for "The Deep" and the head of the San 
Francisco-based Ocean Images, a firm specializing in underwater photography -- 
met Nicklin at a spearfishing competition in La Jolla in 1963. They've traveled 
the world together since then, shooting in the waters off the Galapagos 
Islands, Papua New Guinea, the Red Sea and a dozen other exotic spots. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck is one of the most steady, most capable guys in the world," said 
Giddings, who often serves as Nicklin's link to the Hollywood community. "He's 
not one to get excited easily; he thinks things through." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is typical of Nicklin that he doesn't have an agent. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had an agent, he would always want me to do funky jobs that I don't want 
to do," Nicklin said as he lounged in the back room of the Diving Locker in 
Pacific Beach. "I'm not excited about going to Los Angeles and jumping into a 
swimming pool." 
</P>
<P>
Nicklin prefers to mix documentary work, which might put him on a boat floating 
in the middle of the Pacific for two months, with the occasional Hollywood 
project. He has yet to decide on a preference. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working out on some damn rubber boat for a month thinking how nice 
it would be to do a feature and stay in a hotel," Nicklin said. "Then I'll do a 
feature and ask what I'm doing working with all these crazy people." 
</P>
<P>
One of his favorite jobs was the short-lived "Ocean Quest" series, a collection 
of five one-hour shows that aired on NBC a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The story line was a little corny, but we shot some of the best natural 
footage and we spent 10 months traveling all over the world," Nicklin said. 
</P>
<P>
Working on film projects has allowed him access to diving spots unseen by most 
Americans. He's dived off of Cuba and under the ice in Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
On many of the Hollywood projects, Nicklin serves as something of a baby sitter 
for actors unaccustommed to the water. 
</P>
<P>
"Young guys take a diving course and they think they're Mike Nelson," Nicklin 
said, referring to the lead character in the quintessential underwater 
adventure series, "Sea Hunt." 
</P>
<P>
During filming of "The Abyss" -- in which Nicklin was a "second line" 
cameraman, which means he photographed the filming process for a special on the 
making of "The Abyss" -- an actor suddenly found his helmet filling with water. 
</P>
<P>
"I just grabbed him and gave him my extra regulator," Nicklin said. "It usually 
doesn't take something like that to happen for them to realize we know what 
we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
In the water with actors and dozens of technical people, Nicklin is "a very 
calming factor," Giddings said, noting that he has never heard Nicklin raise 
his voice. "His experience is evident." 
</P>
<P>
During the filming of "The Deep," Nicklin worked closely with Nolte. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a crazy guy, a real character," Nicklin said. "He wanted to dive and he 
did all his own stunts." 
</P>
<P>
Working with Nolte on "The Deep" was a sharp contrast to Nicklin's work on the 
James Bond movie "For Your Eyes Only." 
</P>
<P>
"I spent four months on 'For Your Eyes' and never met Roger Moore," Nicklin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He had a more immediate experience working with another James Bond, Sean 
Connery, on "Never Say Never Again." In one scene, Connery was in an underwater 
cave when his mask wouldn't clear. Nicklin came to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, it would have seem far-fetched to picture Nicklin cavorting 
with movie stars and diving in the world's most exotic spots. In 1959, he was 
the owner of Chuck's Market, a corner grocery on 38th Street. 
</P>
<P>
The graduate of Point Loma High School and San Diego State University had 
started diving as a hobby. Urged by friends, he helped open the first Diving 
Locker store, eventually buying out his partners as it expanded. 
</P>
<P>
When Nicklin's friend Conrad Limbaugh, the diving officer for the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, drowned off the coast of France in 1960, Nicklin 
inherited his camera equipment. He started selling a few still pictures, and 
soon his reputation grew in the fledgling field of underwater photography. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklin's first Hollywood project was the forgettable 1968 Warners Brothers 
drama "Chubasco," starring Richard Egan and Susan Strasberg. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked me if I could shoot 70 millimeter Panavision," Nicklin recalled. "I 
didn't even know what it was." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has worked in just about every visual format, including the 
big-screen IMAX. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great practitioner of his craft," said Joe Thompson, a San Diego-based 
producer/cameraman who has worked with Nicklin for 25 years. "He takes a lot of 
pictures. Even when he goes out with a class he shoots video. He never stops 
learning." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson and Nicklin have worked together on a variety of projects, including 
the "In Search of . . . " and "Man from Atlantis" television series. He 
describes Nicklin as "happy-go-lucky" and "down to earth," with a natural 
ability to get along with Hollywood people. 
</P>
<P>
"He always manages to stay in touch with them," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
In his travels throughout the world, diving in often exotic and dangerous 
locales, Nicklin has never been injured. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklin's home life is far more subdued. He has turned day-to-day control of 
the Diving Locker stores over to his son Terry. (His other son, Flip, is also a 
well known underwater cameraman, a regular contributor to National Geographic.) 
</P>
<P>
When he's in town, Nicklin spends most of his time at home, where he raises 
orchids. The focus of his work with the La Jolla Town Council is to preserve 
the community's "village ambiance." Known for his quick smile and willingness 
to participate in a friendly gathering, Nicklin said he will always be happy 
with what he has in La Jolla, as long as he can walk to his favorite watering 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't know where he will go next. He gets calls about projects all the 
time, but most fall through -- one of the quirks of dealing with Hollywood. He 
will take a Diving Locker group to Costa Rica in the spring, where he will get 
a chance to photograph sharks and manta rays. 
</P>
<P>
He's pretty much done it all in diving circles. Other than a trip to dive off 
the coast of Japan, he has few goals or dreams beyond the challenges and 
expected sights of his next trip. Certainly, his thoughts are far away from 
work on a Hollywood set. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never gotten really beautiful stuff on manta rays," he said, his voice 
trailing.

CZECH CELLIST LEARNS THE TUNE IS DIFFERENT IN WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In Milan Kundera's novel "The Unbearable Lightness of Being," the surgeon 
protagonist finds himself demoted to a common window washer because of his 
outspoken political views. This portrait of life in Czechoslovakia after the 
1968 Russian invasion nearly became the script for Czech cellist Zdenek Prouza. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, Prouza was a member of the Czechoslovak Chamber Orchestra, 
an ensemble that travelled and performed throughout Europe. Like Kundera's 
stubborn surgeon, the young cellist could not keep his politics to himself. 
</P>
<P>
"First the authorities asked me to join the Communist party," said Prouza. 
"When I told them that as a musician I had nothing to contribute to their 
politics, they said that if I did not join, I would not be allowed to finish my 
formal musical studies." 
</P>
<P>
Since Prouza did not relish becoming a routine laborer, the certain fate of any 
Czech who does not complete his educational requirements, he quietly defected 
when his chamber orchestra was on tour in West Germany. He had no relatives in 
the West, and all of his family is still in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
After playing six years with German and Austrian chamber orchestras, he moved 
to New York to pursue a solo career in America. He will make his West Coast 
debut in a solo recital at San Diego State University Feb. 26, at 2:30 p.m. in 
Smith Recital Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"It has taken me a full year to adjust to the American system," explained 
Prouza. "I knew the two systems were different, but you don't know how cold the 
water is until you jump in." 
</P>
<P>
Prouza had been accustomed to Germany's predictable, bureaucratic musical 
establishment, where government exams qualify musicians for orchestra positions 
and solo engagements. In America, he has learned that the informal 
recommendations of colleagues are more likely to land him an engagement. 
Fortunately, he had the foresight to marry an American whose profession is arts 
management. 
</P>
<P>
He has also learned the desirable American trait of adaptability. He has 
performed several concerts, including two gigs at Carnegie Hall, with popular 
vocalist Judy Collins. And how does a serious, European cellist mesh with the 
four-piece rock group that backs up Collins? 
</P>
<P>
"Just fine. My cello was amplified, of course, and I did not have lengthy 
solos. But Collins is a classically-trained musician. She heard me play and 
invited me to perform with her." 
</P>
<P>
The Friends of Czechoslovak Music, a local organization which regularly offers 
musical programs at SDSU, is presenting Prouza. Not surprisingly, half of his 
program is devoted to music by Czech composers Joseph Suk, Leos Janacek, and 
Bohuslav Martinu. 
</P>
<P>
Atherton's Hong Kong connection. Former San Diego Symphony music director David 
Atherton has been appointed music director and principal conductor of the Hong 
Kong Philharmonic. According to Nancy Laturno, manager of Atherton's 
soon-to-be-launched Mainly Mozart Festival at the Old Globe Theatre, Atherton's 
three-year contract with the Hong Kong orchestra will commence September, 1989, 
and will require the 45-year-old British maestro to spend 15 weeks yearly on 
the Hong Kong podium. 
</P>
<P>
As Atherton noted at a press conference earlier this month, he maintains three 
residences around the globe. The Hong Kong appointment justifies his digs in 
that Asian city. In addition to his local abode -- Atherton claims he spends 
more time in San Diego than anywhere else -- he also hangs his hat in London, 
where he remains guest conductor with the BBC Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Happy reunion. Way back in 1969 at the tender age of 17, violinist Zina Schiff 
made her solo orchestral debut playing Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto with the 
San Diego Symphony under the baton of then music director Zoltan Rozsnyai. The 
Heifetz pupil went on to a solid solo career, returning to San Diego several 
times. On her last musical visit in 1984, Schiff played Ernst Bloch's Violin 
Concerto with the San Diego Symphony under David Atherton. 
</P>
<P>
This week Schiff is back in town for a reunion of sorts. Tonight at Sherwood 
Hall she will again essay the Mendelssohn concerto with Rozsnyai, only this 
time with the United States International University Orchestra, the maestro's 
current orchestra. No doubt Eileen Wingard, San Diego Symphony section 
violinist and Schiff's sister, will be among the virtuosa's fans in the La 
Jolla audience. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, the viola magnet. For the last two days, the San Diego Symphony has 
been auditioning violists for both principal and section positions. According 
to the symphony, these posts have attracted applications from 110 candidates 
from 34 states, Canada, and Holland. 
</P>
<P>
So long, Silver Gate. For two years, Betty McManus and Lynn Schubert presented 
chamber music in historically and architecturally significant locations around 
the county. From the stately residences designed by Irving Gill to the ornate 
downtown office of San Diego Trust and Savings Bank, Silver Gate Concerts found 
the right musicians for each location. While the series was successful on many 
fronts -- they turned a modest surplus over to Save Our Heritage Organization, 
their sponsoring organization -- Silver Gate Concert series has been disbanded. 
Schubert and McManus cited personal reasons for not continuing.

OFFICIALS SAY LEAGUE TO SKIP SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
ARENA FOOTBALL WILL SUSPEND PLAY IN 1989, PLANS TO RESUME IN '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Arena Football League will suspend operations in 1989 in an attempt to 
restructure, officials of the defending league champion Detroit Drive said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, however, came as a surprise to officials of the league's 
local franchise, the Los Angeles Cobras. 
</P>
<P>
After several months of bitter negotiations between the owners and league 
founder and commissioner Jim Foster, the parties reached an impasse and decided 
to disband this year but said they expect to resume play in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"The limited partnership has lost confidence in the present management 
structure," Detroit General Manager Gary Vitto said in a statement. "We will 
use the time to restructure the league to everyone's benefit and move forward 
with the 1990 season." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hope, general manager of the Cobras, said the owners have negotiated with 
Foster for the last four months. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had several deadline dates set with him but he has broken off every 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Vitto's announcement was unexpected but since Foster did not agree to meet 
with us this upcoming weekend, our given choice is to sit out this domestic 
season and give the league a year to prepare instead of rush it in the next two 
months." 
</P>
<P>
The league, which moved offices last month, will spend more time negotiating 
with Foster, who could not be reached Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for ESPN, which televised league games the past two seasons, said 
he also was surprised by the owners' move. 
</P>
<P>
"It's news to me," Chris LaPlaca told Associated Press. "As of last week, we 
thought they were going forward with six teams this season." 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil began last season over owner fees collected by Foster. The fees 
were to cover all players' salaries and other operating costs, although the 
teams were responsible for obtaining playing sites. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem surfaced when the revenue Foster predicted the league would 
gain fell short, and owners had to invest more than their initial $750,000 
payments. Foster blamed the increase on operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
"The investors had to put forth more money than originally planned," said 
Foster in an interview in late last month. "They did lose more money than 
predicted, but Detroit did break even. You have to realize that every new start 
up suffers through growing pains and loses money at the start." 
</P>
<P>
However, after the season, the owners thought they should play more of a part 
in league operations. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Foster controlled the league from his Chicago office, with a small 
group of original investors working under him. As commissioner, he viewed 
owners as general partners who held contracts to manage a team. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we felt that in order for the league to grow, we 
needed to have Foster come down and become a general partner with everyone 
else," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
The owners believed that any expansion was hurt by Foster's control because 
Foster owns the rights as founder of Arena Football. And without expansion, the 
owners would not be able to collect any fees from any new prospective owners. 
</P>
<P>
To resolve the situation, the owners offered several solutions, including 
giving Foster a free franchise in his native state of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
"We made several fair deals to Foster," Hope said. "We were just trying to make 
a solid foundation for the league. We felt that it did not make any sense to 
invest more money until there was a clarified value of that investment." 
</P>
<P>
While the discussions were in progress, league officials planned to bypass last 
season's April 29 opening day to start the season in June with a shortened 
season. 
</P>
<P>
However, the owners found it difficult to reach an agreement with Foster to the 
point of Vitto's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hope: "It would be financially foolish for us to continue with the 1989 
season. We wanted to reach an agreement but we were given no choice. There just 
was not enough time for us to generate revenue.

THE NBA / SAM MCMANIS; 
</P>
<P>
SCHULER HAD UPS AND DOWNS IN PORTLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam McManis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His appointment as Portland Trail Blazers coach had just been announced to the 
gathered media, so Mike Schuler quickly slid one chair over to the microphone. 
The only problem was that Schuler missed the intended seat and wound up on the 
floor, unhurt but red-faced. 
</P>
<P>
That night, May 28, 1986, television stations across the nation replayed the 
videotape of such an embarrassing start. Welcome to the National Basketball 
Assn., Mike. 
</P>
<P>
You could say that Schuler's tenure ended the same way Saturday, with an 
inauspicious pratfall in which the Trail Blazers have fallen to fifth place in 
the Pacific Division despite possessing the talent to contend. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, some television stations exhumed the videotape of Schuler's 
introductory press conference, then cut to Saturday's press conference 
announcing former assistant Rick Adelman's ascent to head coach. 
</P>
<P>
In between, however, there were moments when Schuler and the Trail Blazers had 
a good thing going. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler won the NBA's coach of the year award in 1986-87, guiding Portland to 
the franchise's second best record ever. His team won 53 games last season, 
making Schuler only the ninth coach in league history to win 100 games in his 
first two seasons. He even signed a long-term contract extension last season. 
</P>
<P>
This season, however, the Trail Blazers fell as swiftly as Schuler did that 
first day. The Trail Blazers were 25-22 and in fifth place in the Pacific 
Division at the time of Schuler's firing, living down to their reputation as 
underachievers. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts except his own, Schuler was to blame. Less than three years 
after taking control, he had: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feuded for two years with Clyde Drexler, the Trail Blazers' best player. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feuded this season with Kiki Vandeweghe, arguably the team's second best 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bickered with reserve forward Steve Johnson, upset with his role after 
being a starter most of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Angered many on the team by practicing on Thanksgiving Day, the only NBA 
team to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Systematically lost respect of nearly every other member of the team, to 
the point that even forward Jerome Kersey, once a staunch pro-Schuler 
supporter, said his firing was needed. 
</P>
<P>
Proof, perhaps, that Schuler lost control of the situation could come from his 
comments after the firing. In speaking with a reporter from the Portland 
Oregonian, Schuler talked as if he said he was not aware of the problems that 
were so obvious to everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"They just didn't like the direction the team was going," Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
Privately -- and, occasionally, publicly -- players complained that Schuler was 
too strident, had too many practices, called too many meetings, was too 
structured and basically just took himself and his job entirely too seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end, even Trail Blazer front-office employees reportedly referred to 
Schuler as "His Royal Tightness." 
</P>
<P>
After the firing, no one on the Trail Blazers criticized Schuler. But no one 
defended him, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I was definitely surprised," Kersey said. "I don't think we were playing as 
well as we can. But I don't think just because they fire the coach, we'll be a 
totally different team." 
</P>
<P>
Added Drexler: "We had philosophical differences, but it never leaked out on 
the court." 
</P>
<P>
It finally got to the point, sources in the organization said, that either 
Schuler or Drexler had to go. Drexler, among the league's scoring leaders, won 
out, as did other players who feuded with Schuler. 
</P>
<P>
Trail Blazer management had to swallow hard and eat Schuler's lucrative 
multi-year contract. They must pay Schuler for the remainder of this season, 
plus his salary for the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But on a team with four players boasting seven-figure contracts, and two others 
in high six-figures, it was obvious where the club's financial interests lie. 
</P>
<P>
With Schuler gone from everywhere but the payroll, and Vandeweghe's trade 
imminent, the Trail Blazers can concentrate on trying to resurrect their season 
under Adelman, a former NBA player who is well-liked by the players, especially 
Drexler. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first things Adelman did was confirm Drexler's star status and 
announce that Drexler will be the focus of the offense, something Schuler never 
did. 
</P>
<P>
"I like that kind of talk," Drexler said. 
</P>
<P>
It will not be easy for Adelman. Drexler is out for five games with a broken 
nose suffered against the Lakers. And, after losing to Seattle by one point in 
Adelman's debut on Saturday night, the Trail Blazers are in the midst of a 
grueling trip. 
</P>
<P>
They lost at Chicago Monday, 102-98, play at Detroit on Wednesday night and at 
Cleveland on Friday night. Portland's first practice under Adelman will be 
today in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman is signed only until the end of this season, but Laker forward Mychal 
Thompson, a former Trail Blazer, said he has long been impressed with Adelman's 
knowledge and personality. "Rick is great player's coach," Thompson said. "If 
they can't play well and be happy under this guy, they should trade Clyde and 
whole team." 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers' handling of the Vandeweghe trade situation can only be 
described as bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
After the All-Star break, Portland vice president Bucky Buckwalter told 
Vandeweghe not to rejoin the team because a trade was imminent. So, Vandeweghe 
stayed at his parents' home in Los Angeles and watched last Thursday's 
Laker-Trail Blazer game on television. 
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, Portland was near a three-way trade that would send Vandeweghe to 
Indiana. The Atlanta Hawks would get forward Herb Williams, and the Trail 
Blazers would receive Atlanta's first-round draft choice in June. 
</P>
<P>
Pacer General Manager Donnie Walsh would then try to trade Vandeweghe to the 
New York Knicks for rookie guard Rod Strickland. The Knicks have coveted 
Vandeweghe, but may not be willing to part with Strickland. 
</P>
<P>
The three teams apparently agreed to the trade last week, but the holdup 
apparently has been the Hawks' desire to fit in Williams under the salary cap 
without having to give up a player. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Stan Kasten was waiting on permission from the league to 
combine the salaries of injured Kevin Willis and Chris Washburn, suspended for 
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
About $350,000 of Williams' money is deferred, so the Hawks would have to 
creatively rework Williams' contract. 
</P>
<P>
"Herb wants to go to a contender," George Andrews, Williams' agent, said. "He's 
willing to do what he has to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks can't be too happy by the Vandeweghe developments. General Manager 
Al Bianchi went into the All-Star break believing he had a verbal agreement on 
a deal that would secure Vandeweghe for a conditional first-round draft pick in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
But Buckwalter started negotiating with the San Antonio Spurs, who eventually 
dropped out before the three-way trade blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
If the Pacers keep Vandeweghe, it's going to cost them another $500,000. A 
clause in Vandeweghe's contract states that if Portland trades him to any team 
other than the Lakers, the Clippers, New York, Denver or Dallas, an additional 
$500,000 must be guaranteed on the final season of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the fallout from last week's Mark Aguirre-for-Adrian Dantley trade is 
falling on Pistons' guard Isiah Thomas, who has been accused of engineering the 
deal so that he could be teammed with Aguirre, his close friend. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Dantley, Adrian's mother and agent, on Friday called Thomas a 
"con-artist." 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, who was criticized in 1986 for reportedly trying to engineer an 
Aguirre-for-James Worthy trade, said Thomas expected the backlash. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that was going to happen to (Thomas), if the trade went through," 
Johnson said. "It was because of the friend's thing. I think Isiah knew that, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said bitterly: "They didn't give me credit for the trades that got us 
Bill Laimbeer for Paul Mokeski or even Adrian Dantley for Kelly Tripucka, so 
they shouldn't give me credit for this one, either." 
</P>
<P>
Add Aguirre trade: Opinions drastically differ on which team had the better of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Said Indiana Coach Dick Versace, formerly a Pistons assistant: "They just won 
the title." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Denver Coach Doug Moe: "I think Dallas will benefit now, because 
they'll be more cohesive. From our standpoint, we don't like the trade. If 
there was turmoil there (in Dallas), we wanted to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth, reader polls in both the Detroit News and Free Press 
showed that fans are 20-to-1 against the trading of Dantley. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that the media back home doesn't think it's a good trade, but 
I'll stand by it," Piston Coach Chuck Daly said. "Maybe we're taking a risk, 
sure, but we're not afraid of dramatic moves."

MONEY DOESN'T CHANGE HERSHISER

Above Orel Hershiser's locker in Dodgertown, someone has transformed his No. 55 
into matching dollar signs. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like something (John) Tudor would do," said the Dodgers' $7.9-million 
man, who interrupted his first day in camp with a mid-afternoon news 
conference, although it was beyond him why anyone would want to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm old news," he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Right. Using that logic, George Bush became old news, too, the day he was 
elected President. 
</P>
<P>
The World's Wealthiest Baseball Player better get used to the fanfare, because 
it is as guaranteed as all the zeroes in the contract he signed that he will be 
under constant scrutiny, right down to his BVD's -- the brand of underwear, 
incidentally, that he is endorsing. 
</P>
<P>
You know how Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda refers to the mound as the hill of 
thrills? On Monday, Hershiser ran down his hill of shills -- all the products 
that signed him to do endorsements last winter. There's a soft drink tie-in 
with a pizza company, and there's a baby shampoo, and athletic shoes, and 
baseball gloves, and watches, and import cars, and import copiers. There's also 
a computer deal in the works, as well as one for contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll make more money in endorsements than I made last year on the field," said 
Hershiser, who made $1.1 million in 1988 en route to winning the National 
League's Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a relief, he said, to return to the field Monday, where he threw 
lightly for 12 minutes, after enduring a winter of nonstop fawning over his 
considerable achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really embarrassing, it really is," he said. "Not what you've 
accomplished, but the way people treat you and what happens after you do it. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I really know, deep down, that I'm not as good as they say I am. They 
talk about me as an American hero, the down-to-earth, All-American kid. I cut 
myself down internally so I don't start believing it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a false world. Everybody is complimentary and appreciative, but 
when you go through a whole day with everybody complimenting you, it's fun, but 
it's not real." 
</P>
<P>
Neither, he said, are the numbers he signed for. "I'm really alienated from the 
numbers as far as their worth," he said. "You get over that hump at about a 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"All I saw were numbers on a piece of paper, and what other players were 
getting." 
</P>
<P>
How to determine the value of a player? 
</P>
<P>
"You're only worth," Hershiser said, "as much as they'll pay you." 
</P>
<P>
And if anyone out there is concerned that his windfall will change him, rest 
assured: Hershiser said he doesn't plan to alter his life style. He even claims 
to change the diapers of his infant son, Jordan. Skeptical? 
</P>
<P>
"If you wonder if they smell," Hershiser told reporters, "come on over and I'll 
give you an exclusive." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph, the Dodgers' new second baseman, checked into camp Monday 
after a harrowing automobile ride. Randolph, who was driving his wife and four 
children here from New Jersey, had his car sideswiped in North Carolina 
Saturday during a freak snowstorm there. No one was hurt, Randolph said, 
although his car was dented and scratched. . . . The rest of the big-league 
roster is scheduled to arrive today, but the club announced that Kirk Gibson 
won't get in until late Wednesday night and begin workouts the next day. 
Technically, players have until March 1 to report.

BLYLEVEN, ANGELS AGREE TO $1.1-MILLION DEAL FOR 1989 
</P>

<P>
The final minutes of Bert Blyleven's contractual limbo found Angel Vice 
President Mike Port bouncing from one practice field to another Monday morning, 
searching for a tall, bearded right-hander wearing No. 28 on his back. 
</P>
<P>
"Now when you want to sign him, you can't find him," Port quipped as he hustled 
to yet another diamond on the Angels' training complex. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Port found his man. Then they found common ground. Moments later, 
putting grievances and counter-grievances behind them, Blyleven and the Angels 
agreed to a contract that will pay Blyleven about $1.1 million in 1989, while 
giving the club the option of re-signing him for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the quiet controversy of the Angels' off-season reached resolution. 
Overshadowed by the defection of Bob Boone, the pursuit of Nolan Ryan and Bruce 
Hurst, and the appeasement of Wally Joyner, Blyleven and the Angels remained at 
odds over salary since his Nov. 3 trade from the Minnesota Twins, each side 
going as far as filing a grievance against the other. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute evolved once Port attempted to cut Blyleven's salary 20% from 1988 
-- the maximum allowed under baseball's collective bargaining agreement -- and 
involved two different interpretations of what that final sum might be. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Blyleven signed a two-year contract extension with the Twins, calling 
for $2.95 million in addition to the $650,000 he earned in 1986. That's a 
three-year package of $3.6 million, or an average of $1.2 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels wanted to cut Blyleven 20% of $1.2 million, tendering him a 1989 
contract of $960,000. Blyleven and his agent, Dick Moss, argued instead for a 
20% cut of the two-year extension -- an average of $1.475 million per season -- 
which would translate into a $1.18 million salary for Blyleven in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
So, Blyleven and Moss filed a grievance. Port countered by tendering Blyleven a 
second contract worth $1.18 million, but accompanied the offer with a 
counter-grievance. The intent: Let an arbitrator study both grievances and 
choose his own figure. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the worst-case scenario," Port said. "Bert would be pitching for us 
on a one-year contract, at whichever amount was decided upon by an arbitrator." 
</P>
<P>
Arbitration was averted Monday when Blyleven settled for $1.1 million. That's 
more than the $1 million he netted in 1988, when he finished 10-17 with a 5.43 
earned-run average, but less than the $1.2 million he averaged during his final 
three years with Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I got a raise," Blyleven said. "I'm very happy with it." 
</P>
<P>
And about those grievances? 
</P>
<P>
Grievances, what grievances? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we ever had that much difficulty or that much space between the 
us," Port said. "All along, we knew Bert would pitch in Anaheim and be happy to 
do so, and the club would be happy to have him on our staff. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some questions, but there was never really any (major obstacle). It 
was something about nothing, in hindsight. 
</P>
<P>
Said Blyleven: "We really didn't have too many discussions with Mike Port 
during the winter. My agent, Dick Moss, was involved in a lot of arbitration 
cases, so there wasn't much communication. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think there was a problem. I'd like to end my career in Anaheim and 
this contract is a step in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Four days into spring camp and already the Angels are down two pitchers. After 
the loss of Joe Johnson with an Achilles' tendon injury, non-roster invitee 
Mark Clear left camp Monday complaining of pain in his right elbow, the same 
condition that sidelined him for most of 1988 with Milwaukee. He will receive 
treatment at home, but will not likely return to the Angels this spring. 
"That's very doubtful," Mike Port said. "It's the same symptomology he had 
before. There were no secrets; we knew the risks. He had it in Milwaukee and it 
started up again right now. He just didn't feel he could keep throwing through 
it." To fill Clear's vacancy, the Angels will invite minor-league pitcher Gary 
Buckles to camp. Buckles was 14-3 with a 2.94 earned-run average at Class-A 
Quad Cities last season. . . . Technicalities, technicalities: Although rules 
prohibit position players from working out before Wednesday, third baseman Jack 
Howell and outfielder Marcus Lawton were in uniform along with pitchers and 
catchers Monday. Deadpanned Port: "They can't be here, so I think we're going 
to have to release Jack Howell." Actually, position players can report early, 
providing they are rehabilitating an injury, such as second baseman Mark 
McLemore. Thinking on his feet, Angel publicity director Tim Mead came up with 
this rationale for Howell's presence: "He's here for medical reasons, too. 
Hemorrhoids." . . . Along with Bert Blyleven, relief pitcher Vance Lovelace 
also agreed to terms with the Angels, bringing the club's number of unsigned 
players to 14.

MEXICO TRIES TO PROVE POINT IN TOURNAMENT OF TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This week's four-nation Los Angeles Soccer Cup is being called El Torneo de la 
Verdad -- The Tournament of Truth. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that it has Mexico, which has been barred from trying to qualify 
for the 1990 World Cup in Italy, against Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala, 
each of whom has a good chance of qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mexican national sentiment, Mexico's team is better than any of 
the other three, just as it is better than the other two countries left in the 
regional qualifying chase: the United States and Trinidad and Tobago. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Mexico has the opportunity of partially proving that contention. It 
plays Guatemala at 9 p.m. at the Coliseum in the nightcap of an international 
soccer doubleheader that also has Costa Rica and El Salvador meeting at 7:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's winners will meet at 9 p.m. Thursday in the championship match, with 
the losers playing for third place at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Mexico is correct. Perhaps it is the strongest soccer power in the 
Central and North American and Caribbean (CONCACAF) region. But because it 
chose to disregard the rules and fielded overage players during qualifying for 
the World Youth Championship currently under way in Saudi Arabia, it is paying 
the price. 
</P>
<P>
Tossed out of the Seoul Olympics (and replaced, incidentally, by Guatemala, 
which should provide an added edge to tonight's match), Mexico also has been 
barred from any world championships for two years. It next will resurface 
during qualifying for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
By then, a new regional power might have emerged, if the United States' recent 
run of success means anything. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the United States scored a surprising, 2-0 win over East Germany in 
Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, during first-round play in the fifth World Youth 
Championship. The victory, combined with a 1-1 tie against Mali last Friday, 
vastly improves the Americans' chances of reaching the next round. 
</P>
<P>
A stronger-than-expected showing in South Korea during the Olympics last 
summer, an astonishing third-place finish in the first World Indoor 
Championship in the Netherlands in January and a strong chance of qualifying 
for next year's World Cup, jointly indicate that U.S. soccer fortunes are 
definitely on the upswing. 
</P>
<P>
Just how difficult the road to Italy will be might be shown in this week's 
matches at the Coliseum. It was Costa Rica, for example, that ended U.S. hopes 
of qualifying for the 1986 World Cup with a 1-0 victory in Los Angeles four 
years ago. The United States, which elected not to take part in the Los Angeles 
Cup, meets Costa Rica April 21 in San Jose, Costa Rica in its first match of 
the final qualifying round. 
</P>
<P>
Guatemala will not be a pushover, either, and already has eliminated 1986 
finalist Canada. El Salvador reached the 1982 World Cup in Spain, and Trinidad 
and Tobago is an unknown factor. Two of the five countries will advance to 
Italy. 
</P>

Soccer Notes 
</P>
<P>
The United States' win over East Germany Monday came on the strength of goals 
by Troy Dayak of Livermore, Calif., in the 47th minute and a penalty kick by 
Steve Snow of Schaumburg, Ill., in the 89th minute. Goalkeeper Kasey Keller of 
Lacey, Wash., was in excellent form in the nets. The victory gives the United 
States. three points from two games, with a match against unbeaten Brazil on 
Wednesday. Mali, in contention with the United States for second place in Group 
C, plays East Germany the same day.

Arturo Angeles of Arcadia, a civil engineer for the city of Los Angeles, is the 
lone American among 24 referees officiating the tournament in Saudi Arabia. 
Another local referee, Majid Jay of Los Alamitos, has been named by the United 
States Soccer Federation as one of seven FIFA referees for 1989. All seven are 
eligible to referee matches at the international level.

FAIRCHILD FALSIFIED TESTS ON AIRCRAFT PARTS, SUIT CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH and RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fairchild Industries is being sued for more than $200 million by three former 
employees who allege that the firm's Voi-Shan unit in Chatsworth falsified test 
results on nuts, bolts and rivets used in military and commercial aircraft, The 
Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The civil suit, which is under seal in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, was 
the impetus for a separate criminal investigation of Voi-Shan that led two 
weeks ago to a 48-hour search of the company's Chatsworth facility by federal 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
Both the civil suit and federal investigators allege that workers at Voi-Shan 
falsified the results of required safety tests, including those measuring the 
stress durability and fatigue of fasteners such as nuts and bolts. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Fairchild said it has sent its own team of investigators to 
Chatsworth to look into the charges. The company employs more than 400 people 
in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Fairchild's annual report claims its fasteners "are installed on almost every 
military and commercial aircraft. Eighty percent of the products are used in 
the airframe and 20% in engines. Sixty percent of the volume is on commercial 
aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
The civil case brought against Voi-Shan was filed May 19 under the False Claims 
Act, which allows individuals to sue on behalf of the federal government and 
share in the recovery of any damages. The law also provides that the Justice 
Department can join a False Claims suit as a plaintiff. So far, the government 
has not decided what position it will take in the Voi-Shan case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Material Amount' 
</P>
<P>
False Claims actions are sealed temporarily to give the government time to 
decide whether to join a case. At that point, the suits usually are unsealed, 
and defendants usually then learn about it for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Fairchild spokeswoman Deborah Tucker said officials at the Chantilly, Va., 
company have not seen the civil suit or "been served any notice" of it. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that even if the plaintiffs win their suit, it is highly unlikely 
that they will win the $200 million in damages being sought. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, $200 million would be a very material amount," said Wolfgang 
Demisch, an analyst with UBS Securities in New York. "That would exceed the 
current market value of all of Fairchild common stock." 
</P>
<P>
Carlyle Group, an investment group based in Washington that has a pending 
$230-million bid for Fairchild, said last week that it was reconsidering the 
merger attempt because of the criminal investigation into Voi-Shan. 
</P>
<P>
Those seeking damages from Fairchild are Tom Runion, a Voi-Shan laboratory 
technician from April, 1981, to June, 1988, and two unidentified former 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators were told that large quantities of parts passing through 
Voi-Shan's facility were sold to various aerospace manufacturers, including 
Boeing, Pratt &amp; Whitney, General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, General 
Electric and Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Investigative Teams 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered Boeing and McDonnell Douglas to 
check whether they used allegedly untested fasteners. The parts may have been 
sold as early as 1980, according to an affidavit the FBI filed in early 
February. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit was filed so the FBI and other agencies could go through the 
Chatsworth plant. The investigation is being run out of the U.S. attorney's 
office in Seattle and is being conducted by agents of the FBI, Internal Revenue 
Service and the investigative arms of the Defense Department, Navy and Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say there is no safety problem here," said Mitch Barker, an FAA 
spokesman. "That is what we are trying to find out right now." 
</P>
<P>
At least one unidentified aerospace company has quietly launched a recall, 
according to the affidavit. "A major supplier of aircraft to the Department of 
Defense has had to recall delivered aircraft in a safety alert," the affidavit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing said late last week that it believes that some allegedly untested 
Voi-Shan parts are on its planes but that there is no evidence they are faulty. 
It also said the company has not launched a recall in connection with Voi-Shan 
parts. "Boeing does not believe that either the safety or performance of its 
products has been compromised," said Paul Binder, a Boeing spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Times reported on Sunday that Boeing, in a cost-cutting move, may 
have curtailed its own testing of Voi-Shan nuts and bolts just as federal 
investigators began looking into fraud in the aerospace industry. The newspaper 
said the nuts are bolts were destined for the new Air Force B-2 stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
At least one Voi-Shan employee told federal investigators that faulty parts 
were sent to aerospace manufacturers. For instance, parts failing saltwater 
tests were "sometimes shipped for use on the F-18 military aircraft," the 
employee told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Among the things seized by the FBI in its search of Voi-Shan's facility was a 
letter dated March 18, 1983, from McDonnell Douglas that complained about rusty 
bolts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Inspector 11' 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, employees at Voi-Shan used an approval stamp by an 
allegedly nonexistent "Inspector 11" to falsify test results. "It is kind of 
like the tag you get in a pair of new pants that says it was inspected by No. 
11. Well, in this case, there was no No. 11," an FBI agent said. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit also said that employees would recycle test forms, white out old 
numbers and then write in new, phony ones. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, according to both federal investigators and the civil suit, Voi-Shan 
employees were told to approve bad parts. For instance, if a sample of bolts 
failed to pass a test, workers would test other samples until they could pass 
the entire batch, the suit and investigators allege. Ordinarily, a company 
would destroy the entire batch of bolts if the first sample failed the tests. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged falsifications were written because "necessary testing equipment 
was inoperative, the tests could not be accomplished in the available time due 
to backlogs or because parts from a particular lot failed a test and it was 
decided by management to approve the parts anyway," according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
The $200-million damage figure was arrived at by assuming that 10% to 20% of 
the cost of the fasteners results from testing requirements, Ramsey said. Since 
Voi-Shan sells $40 million to $60 million of fasteners to the government 
annually and the law allows damage claims to go back seven years, actual 
damages amount to roughly $35 million to $70 million, Ramsey said. Under the 
law, those can be tripled. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the False Claims Act provides that each false certification can 
result in a $5,000 to $10,000 penalty. Ramsey said there are "tens of thousands 
of false statements" at issue. 
</P>
<P>
Voi-Shan said in a sales brochure given to customers that it is the world's 
largest manufacturer of fasteners. "We're making fasteners to hold the world 
together, and we make sure they're the best," the brochure said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. PROBES OF VALLEY PARTS COMPANIES 
</P>
<P>
Voi-Shan of Chatsworth is the latest San Fernando Valley area firm to be 
investigated by federal authorities for allegedly selling bogus aerospace parts 
or falsifying testing documents for parts installed in planes and space 
equipment. Here is a list of the others: 
</P>
<P>
A.O. Sammons: The one-man Canoga Park firm headed by Arthur O. Sammons pleaded 
guilty in December to federal charges of falsifying documents showing that nuts 
and bolts installed in a space laboratory had passed required safety tests. 
</P>
<P>
Sammons was given six months to get out of the aerospace fastener business and 
fined $62,150. NASA has spent more than $1 million to dismantle the space lab 
so it can remove Sammons fasteners. 
</P>
<P>
Alliance Bearing Industries: The Van Nuys company was raided last October by 
the FBI as part of a criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office. The 
company sold more than 2,000 allegedly counterfeit ball bearings installed in 
Boeing-made commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Aerospace: The Simi Valley company is currently under investigation by the 
Inspector General's office of NASA for selling allegedly defective bolts 
installed in the space shuttle Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Engineering &amp; Supply: The Defense Department's Defense Criminal 
Investigative Service is investigating the Burbank company for allegedly 
falsifying documents that said its bolts met government safety standards. NASA 
had to replace 357 potentially substandard bolts in the space shuttle Discovery 
prior to its successful launch last September. 
</P>
<P>
New Hampshire Ball Bearings: The U.S. Customs Service in Los Angeles seized 
more than 4 million ball bearings made by the Chatsworth firm to investigate 
whether the parts are counterfeit or defective. New Hampshire Ball Bearings 
says the agency's action was "a mistake."

MINORCO SWEETENS BID FOR MINING FIRM TO $5.7 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minorco SA, making the largest offer ever for a British company, on Monday 
renewed its hostile bid for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC and sweetened the 
proposed buyout to $5.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated Gold Fields, a British gold mining group, immediately rejected the 
long-awaited, renewed offer from Minorco, the investment arm of the South 
African Oppenheimer family's mining empire. 
</P>
<P>
"The board intends to resist the bid strongly," said Consolidated Gold Fields 
Chairman Rudolph Agnew, who advised shareholders to take no action in response 
to the offer. 
</P>
<P>
"This renewed bid, which is of questionable value, bears no relation to the 
underlying worth of the company and is clearly not meant to be taken seriously 
by shareholders," Agnew said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Major Hurdle Remains 
</P>
<P>
Under British takeover rules, Minorco needed to renew its bid by Thursday or 
risk having to wait till next fall to bid again. By announcing its offer now, 
Minorco gets nearly three months to proceed with its takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The renewed bid follows approval Friday by the European Community Commission, 
which conducted an informal inquiry into whether the proposed acquisition would 
result in a monopoly of platinum markets. 
</P>
<P>
It also follows clearance by Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission 
earlier this month. Minorco's original bid automatically lapsed when the matter 
was referred to the commission in October. 
</P>
<P>
Minorco faces at least one more major legal hurdle. The offer is conditional on 
Minorco winning its appeal against a U.S. court injunction that blocked it from 
acquiring more than 30% of Consolidated Gold Fields' shares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Bid Expected by Some 
</P>
<P>
Minorco's offer would top Nestle SA's 2.6-billion-pound, or $4.6-billion, 
purchase of British confectioner Rowntree PLC last year. 
</P>
<P>
The latest bid is worth 14 pounds, or $24.78, a share in cash and stock at 
current exchange rates, for a total of $5.7 billion. Minorco's previous offer 
was equivalent to $23.12 a share in cash and stock, for a total of $5.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated Gold Fields' shares rose 8 pence to 14.43 pounds on London's Stock 
Exchange on Monday, suggesting that investors believed Minorco eventually might 
make an even sweeter bid. 
</P>
<P>
Minorco's shares rose 10 pence to 7.66 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts were surprised by the latest bid, having expected Minorco to 
offer between 15 and 16 pounds a share. 
</P>
<P>
By putting forward a bid on the low side, Minorco might be buying time while it 
overcomes obstacles to the takeover, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Minorco's latest offer "isn't the end of the game," said Christopher Spreckley, 
a mining analyst at CL-Alexanders Laing &amp; Cruickshank. "There might be 
another pound (per share) in it." 
</P>
<P>
Minorco also might be hoping to force Consolidated Gold Fields to disclose the 
price at which it values itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
South African Link 
</P>
<P>
This is a "sighting shot," Consolidated Gold Fields' Agnew said. "They don't 
know what to pay and they want to get our defenses open." 
</P>
<P>
Based in Luxembourg, Minorco is 60% owned by the Oppenheimers' Anglo American 
Corp. gold mining giant and the diamond mining group De Beers Consolidated 
Mines Ltd. It already owns 29.6% of Consolidated Gold Fields' shares. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Consolidated Gold Fields' defense in the past five months has been to 
raise objections to Minorco's South African connections. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Michael Edwardes, Minorco's chief executive, said: "We have now cleared all 
the U.K. and European regulatory hurdles put in Minorco's way by the Gold 
Fields board." 
</P>
<P>
"Minorco believes that the owners of Gold Fields should now be given the 
opportunity to consider the new offer on its merits and to determine the issues 
which affect them as shareholders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Minorco told the European Commission it would sell all Consolidated Gold Fields 
platinum interests should a takeover succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Minorco also has said it intends to sell other minority stakes held by 
Consolidated Gold Fields, including a 49% stake in Newmont Mining Corp. of the 
United States, 48% in Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd. of Australia and 38% 
in Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
This would leave Minorco with Consolidated Gold Fields' ARC construction 
materials businesses in Britain and the United States, and with Gold Fields 
Mining Corp. in North America.

Hundreds of New York callers who thought that they could get premium credit 
"gold cards" actually got nothing more than hefty phone bills by dialing a 
"540" telephone number. Unsuspecting customers lured by the promise of the 
credit cards dialed the number and were slapped with a $49.95 charge for the 
call, said New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams. The company that ran the come-on, 
International Shoppers Spree Inc., Baltimore, may be forced to dole out refunds 
to as many as 450 people.

Fourteen state companies were formally charged in connection with a scandal at 
the Bank of Crete that has battered Greece's socialist government in recent 
months. Among the companies that have been charged are the national airline, 
power, phone and mail companies, which allegedly received higher than legal 
interest on deposits at the bank. The scandal's central figure, Greek-American 
banker George Koskotas, fled last year after being charged with fraud and 
embezzlement at the private bank, which he owned. He is under arrest in the 
United States.

China is banning cigarette and liquor imports this year to save foreign 
currency and end abuses in its foreign trade system, official reports said. 
China Daily quoted Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Minister Zheng Tuobin 
as also announcing a ban on reselling export licenses and tightening controls 
on imports of all products that can be made in China. The newspaper did not say 
when the restrictions will take effect. A ban last year on sales of foreign 
cigarettes did little to slow their widespread smuggling into China.

2,000 MORRELL WORKERS GET PAY CUTS UNDER NEW PACT 
</P>

<P>
John Morrell &amp; Co. on Monday imposed a contract cutting the wages of 2,000 
workers by up to 18% at its strife-torn meatpacking plant. 
</P>
<P>
The union said it would not strike despite a near-unanimous vote against the 
contract, which one leader said destroyed 50 years of bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
The plant has long been a focus of discord, with violent strikes, lawsuits 
filed by management and the union and huge fines for safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
The old contract expired Nov. 20, and the company had renewed it on a daily 
basis. But on Thursday, Morrell declared that talks with the union had reached 
an impasse, allowing it to impose its own contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strike 'Not in Best Interest' 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Food &amp; Commercial Workers union met on Sunday, and "over 
99%" of those voting rejected the contract, said Jim Lyons, local president. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said a strike would not be in the best interest of the union because it 
could negate back pay awards or unfair labor practice complaints. More than 
half the plant's workers are replacements hired during a 1987 strike. 
</P>
<P>
The union said it would file a complaint of unfair labor practices against 
Morrell. On Friday, company officials said they had filed a National Labor 
Relations Board complaint charging the union with bad-faith bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
The contract cut wages at the plant from $9.75 an hour to $8 an hour. Benefits 
and seniority also were cut. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year contract "virtually destroys 50 years of bargaining" and will 
ruin the standard of living for Morrell workers, Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the worst contract that's ever been put forward," said Bob 
Stuerman, a Morrell employee. "We were at the top of the heap, and that brings 
us down to the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
The contract is not out of line with the meatpacking industry, said Raoul 
Baxter, Morrell executive vice president. "If we really wanted to punish them, 
we would have taken them down to $6, which is the real thing out there," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We would hope they would recognize our need to be competitive and make a 
recommendation to help us get there," company negotiator Brad Johnson said 
Sunday night. "But I see no reason for optimism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Award Challenged 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 of the plant's workers are union members who crossed picket lines 
thrown up in 1987 by striking workers from Morrell's plant at Sioux City, Iowa. 
About 600 union members were called back to work after the strike, and more 
than 1,100 replacement workers hired during the strike are on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
The replacements were making $9.25 an hour before Monday's cut. 
</P>
<P>
In November, an arbitrator ruled that the sympathy strike was legal, that all 
strikers should be returned to work and that Morrell owed more than $40 million 
in back pay. Morrell has challenged the award in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Also last year, a federal jury awarded the company $24.6 million in damages for 
what the panel decided were three illegal sympathy strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Morrell also is fighting a $4.3-million fine, the largest ever against a single 
employer by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The fine involved hundreds of serious injuries to hand and arm joints caused by 
the repetitive motion of the meatpacking line.

OPEC STICKS TO PRODUCTION QUOTAS TO TRY TO LIFT PRICES; 
</P>
<P>
CRUDE OIL EXPECTED TO REACH $18 A BARREL LATER THIS YEAR

<P>
OPEC members are complying with a production accord designed to lift crude oil 
prices, a top official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"OPEC has more or less found its form right now," said Subroto, 
secretary-general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Subroto 
said crude oil prices would definitely reach the cartel's target of $18 a 
barrel in the second half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
That price will be reached "sooner rather than later" if members hold to their 
OPEC-set production quotas and if independent exporting nations reduce their 
output, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC was $16.02 a barrel 
on Monday, up $4 to $5 from late November, when the cartel's oil ministers 
struck a deal to curb production. 
</P>
<P>
The accord set an overall ceiling, or quota, of 18.5 million barrels a day for 
the 13 member nations in the first six months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures released Monday by OPEC, 12 of the countries supplied a 
total of 17.42 million barrels a day in January, slightly less than the quota 
of 17.51 million barrels set for them. 
</P>
<P>
The cartel said in a news release that figures from the United Arab Emirates 
had not yet been received. The UAE, however, has persistently exceeded its 
target in the past, according to private analysts. Its current quota is 988,000 
barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Topped Limits in January 
</P>
<P>
Subroto, Indonesia's former oil minister, said the supply figures provide "a 
sign that we are abiding (by) our quota." 
</P>
<P>
Private analysts estimated that OPEC surpassed its ceiling in January by about 
a million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC, however, said it measures the quota by adding crude production and the 
amount of oil put into, or taken out of, stock. Production, which it defines as 
the amount of crude measured at storage facilities, was 18.13 million barrels a 
day in January for the 12 reporting nations. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the cartel had released such monthly figures. 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere in OPEC and among the ministers is much better," Subroto said. 
He attributed a major part of the improvement to an August cease-fire that 
ended eight years of fighting between Iran and Iraq, key OPEC members. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he sensed oil market participants felt "more comfortable toward 
OPEC behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Subroto predicted that non-OPEC nations would agree in the coming months to 
trim their output. Representatives of these nations meet today in London to 
discuss the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely a positive sign that . . . they will do something in 
reducing the supply," he said.

JACK SMITH: THE NO-SEX, NO-POLITICS READING LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been under siege for writing that I couldn't think of any good American 
novels that weren't heavy on sex or politics. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Lerner of Pacific Palisades had asked me to name 10 such books for her 
son, who is sojourning in China. He had asked her to send him works of American 
fiction, but none that might be confiscated by the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously my answer was ironic. I was saying that it is hard to find a 
contemporary novel that isn't saturated with sex, politics or both. 
</P>
<P>
I have been bombarded with dozens of titles of American fiction from "Moby 
Dick" and "The Scarlet Letter" to "Slaughterhouse Five" and "Catcher in the 
Rye." 
</P>
<P>
One man, J. L. Jonsson of Long Beach, names no fewer than 46 novels, and 
suggests that I should have passed Mrs. Lerner's request on to "someone who 
reads at least a book a month." 
</P>
<P>
Jonsson's suggestions range from Hawthorne's "Scarlet Letter" to "Gone With the 
Wind," neither of which, it seems to me, is quite free of sex and politics. 
</P>
<P>
His list poses another problem. If I had named 10 of his selections, he might 
have accused me of leaving out the other 36. Also, I wonder how long it's been 
since he read "Call of the Wild." 
</P>
<P>
Lester E. Sansome of Rosemead notes that the Horatio Alger stories, which, 
along with the Rover Boys, was the only selection I could come up with, are in 
fact testaments to the American free enterprise system, and might be anathema 
to the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Burkey of Signal Hill points out that in observing that "The Wizard of Oz" 
reeks of abnormal sex I failed to note that it is also a last hurrah for the 
waning Populist movement of the 1890s. Certainly a no-no on two counts. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Kupperman, a teacher of English at Granada Hills High School, sends a list 
of 16 novels, several of which are English, not American, including "Lord of 
the Flies," "Jane Eyre," "Pride and Prejudice," and "Picture of Dorian Gray." 
She also suggests "Little Women" and "Little Men," both of which I would 
hesitate to recommend to a young man today. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph William Bentlege writes that as "a mere youth" in the Navy on Guam, he 
read, among others, "Anthony Adverse," "Captain Hornblower," "Great 
Expectations" (English) "Pilgrim's Progress" (also English) and various books 
by Erle Stanley Gardner (Perry Mason), and Raymond Chandler (Philip Marlowe). I 
can't believe that anyone but a literary or theological scholar could read 
"Pilgrim's Progress" today, and I certainly wouldn't foist it on a young man 
who might already be feeling isolated and disoriented in China. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Gardner concedes the difficulty of finding readable books that are not 
saturated with sex and politics, but she recommends anything by Dick Francis 
and Agatha Christie, both English. She explains: "Maybe Mrs. Lerner should 
stick with some of the Brits, who know the art of insinuation better than the 
U.S. writers." 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Pearson of Pasadena follows the British trend, recommending "Lucky Jim" 
by Kingsley Amis as "the funniest book I've read and re-read." I agree that 
"Lucky Jim" is a delightful book, but it is quintessentially English, and 
doesn't qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Palmer of Beverly Hills recommends several good novels, including "A 
Woman of Independent Means" by Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey, "The Heart Is a 
Lonely Hunter" and "Member of the Wedding" by Carson McCullers, any 87th 
Precinct novel by Ed McBain, any Nero Wolfe novel by Rex Stout, "Giant" by Edna 
Ferber, "Gone With the Wind" by Margaret Mitchell, and "The Great Gatsby" by F. 
Scott Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer also concedes that few "modern" American novels meet Mrs. Lerner's 
restrictions, but she insists that the books of Herbert Gold and Joseph 
Wambaugh are "worth risking jail to read." 
</P>
<P>
She says: "If, as has been said, an age is defined by its fiction, then I fear 
for our age." 
</P>
<P>
Fred A. Glienna and Gary Nordell both recommend the novels of Zane Grey. "You 
won't find prurience in Grey's 'Riders of the Purple Sage' or 'Union Pacific,' 
" says Glienna. He also recommends Owen Wister's "The Virginian." ("When you 
call me that, smile.") 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. J. Ford Johnston of Sunland wonders how I feel about the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
Well, for one thing, it is definitely not American. Also, it has a lot of 
begetting in it.

DEPRESSION AS SOURCE OF CREATIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Churchill's Black Dog, Kafka's Mice and Other Phenomena of the Human Mind by 
Anthony Storr (Grove Press: $19.95; 288 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The connection between creativity and madness has long been observed and 
brooded about. It's probably a matter of degree. People who are a little bit 
different from the mainstream are considered creative. People who are a lot 
different are considered crazy. 
</P>
<P>
But that explanation doesn't reach the heart of the matter. It simply describes 
the phenomenon without getting inside it. Many questions can still profitably 
be asked: Where do these differences come from? What accounts for their 
intensity? Why do some people use them as assets while for others they are 
great liabilities? 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Storr, a British psychiatrist, addresses these questions and many 
related to them in three remarkably lucid and revealing profiles -- of Winston 
Churchill, Franz Kafka and Isaac Newton, all of whom suffered severe and 
debilitating depressions throughout their lives but had great achievements 
nonetheless. The profiles are the first three chapters of his collection of 
essays, "Churchill's Black Dog, Kafka's Mice and Other Phenomena of the Human 
Mind," and they are worth the price of the book. 
</P>
<P>
Storr argues that the sources of the depression of Churchill, Kafka and Newton 
were the same as the sources of their achievements: an extremely unhappy 
childhood that haunted each all of his life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bottomless Hole Inside a Man 
</P>
<P>
The profile of Churchill is especially compelling. He was an unloved child who 
developed inside of himself a bottomless hole that he spent his life trying to 
fill with accomplishments and the roar of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
As long as he was achieving, he could hold his demons at bay, though the 
formula always demanded more and more accomplishments to overcome the terrible 
self-image within. 
</P>
<P>
When the achievements were interrupted or stopped altogether, Churchill had no 
internal resources to draw on and fell into despair. "I have achieved a great 
deal to achieve nothing in the end," he said and spent the last years of his 
long life in his sitting room, staring into the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"One salient characteristic of adults who suffer from depression is their 
dependence on external sources to maintain self-esteem," Storr writes. 
Churchill "remained hungry -- hungry for fame, for adulation, for success and 
for power; and although he gained all these in full measure, the end of his 
life showed that he never assimilated them into himself, but remained 
unsatisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Storr writes, if Churchill had been a happier man, less driven to 
achieve, less driven to overcome despair with fantasy, he probably would not 
have been there in 1940 to rouse England to defend itself against the German 
onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
"In that dark time," he says, "what England needed was not a shrewd, equable, 
balanced leader. She needed a prophet, a visionary, a man who could dream 
dreams of victory when all seemed lost." 
</P>
<P>
It was a happy coincidence of the product of Churchill's inner turmoil and the 
needs of the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ruled by Tyrannical Father 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in the case of Franz Kafka, the world benefited (this time in 
literature) from his personal unhappiness. "Kafka's writing is so bound up with 
the more pathological parts of his personality that, if he had become happier, 
his drive to write might have been greatly diminished." 
</P>
<P>
The pathological parts of Kafka's personality were caused by an irrational and 
tyrannical father, which gave young Franz a view of the world as a hostile, 
uncontrollable place, a vision familiar to everyone who has read his work. 
</P>
<P>
Kafka, Storr says, "described in his novels and short stories what it is like 
to feel oneself helplessly at the mercy of people who are not only powerful but 
also remote, inaccessible and entirely arbitrary in their actions." 
</P>
<P>
Haven't we all had bosses like that? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exploring Mind of a Genius 
</P>
<P>
Like Churchill and Kafka, Isaac Newton also had a difficult childhood: He was 
abandoned by his mother (his father having died before he was born) and grew up 
emotionally isolated. 
</P>
<P>
In another book, "Solitude" (Free Press) -- a wonderful book in its own right 
-- Storr argues that isolation is frequently associated with supreme abstract 
mental achievement, and here he offers Newton as a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
"Newton shared his absence of close personal ties with Descartes, Locke, 
Hobbes, Hume, Pascal, Spinoza, Kant, Leibniz, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, 
Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein -- in short, with many of the world's greatest 
thinkers," Storr says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Odd People 
</P>
<P>
Geniuses tend to be odd people, and Newton was both a great genius and very, 
very odd. Though Storr's explanation of Newton is less successful than his 
explanations of Churchill and Kafka, his exploration of Newton's mind is 
revealing as far as it goes. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining essays in the book are less broad-based than the first three, but 
no matter. There's enough thought-provoking material at the beginning to make 
up for the paucity at the end. 
</P>
<P>
The sources of creativity and their relationship to genius and madness remain 
enigmatic, but Storr has lifted one of the veils.

ART BUCHWALD: FROM THE DOUBLE-CROSS TO THE HOT CROSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The revolving door turns and where it stops nobody knows. Ever since President 
Reagan moved out and President Bush came in, the game of musical chairs has 
continued. Reagan appointees are now working the other side of the street 
representing private clients seeking assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular profession for ex-Administration appointees seems to be public 
relations. "Public relations" has a nice ring to it and, like "consultant," you 
can make it mean anything you want it to. 
</P>
<P>
It's interesting to note that these people, who are now charged with buttering 
up the media, were not too friendly to us when they were doing Reagan's 
bidding. Some are having a hard time persuading my colleagues and myself that 
they were really good guys when they worked for the government. 
</P>
<P>
One such person is Sanford Probe, who came into the office to sell me a story 
on tax breaks for the hot cross bun industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I talk to you, Sanford?" I asked. "When you were in the White 
House, you never returned my calls." 
</P>
<P>
Sanford replied, "It wasn't my fault. How did I know that I'd be representing 
the hot cross bun industry when I left the government?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a good enough excuse. Remember when I saw you at the Salute to 
Nofziger ball? You wouldn't even say hello to me. You walked by as if I wasn't 
there." 
</P>
<P>
"I had no choice. I was with Don Regan and he would have become suspicious if I 
had spoken to you. He might have thought I was returning your calls." 
</P>
<P>
"All you guys in the revolving door are the same. You treat us like dirt when 
you're on the inside and lick our boots when you're on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
"You're making that up. Remember the time when I called and told you that the 
Contras had just won $30 million in the New Jersey lottery?" 
</P>
<P>
"It was a phony story. The Contras won the money from Ollie North who sold U.S. 
arms to Tehran." 
</P>
<P>
"So I was slightly inaccurate. Does that make me an unreliable source?" 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't say that you were unreliable. I just felt that you were suffering 
from a bad case of disinformation. You thought you would be running things 
forever. Well, it doesn't work that way in America. You dump on people for two 
terms and then it's their chance to dump on you." 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I've learned a lot since I have been working in the private sector. I 
now understand that everyone has a job to do whether they're in the Oval Office 
or stuck in a traffic jam on the Beltway. If I don't get a story on a tax break 
for hot cross buns into the newspaper, I could lose the account." 
</P>
<P>
"Why should the hot cross bun industry get a tax break?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because the Japanese are flooding the country with hot cross buns and killing 
our markets." 
</P>
<P>
"How are they flooding America?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"They're bringing them in in the glove compartments of their automobiles." 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't sound like much of a story." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't think so? I'm new at this game. I know I could have gotten away with 
it in the White House." 
</P>
<P>
"You can get away with anything in the White House, but when you re-enter the 
real world, your veracity is at stake. Remember this, Sanford. Nobody in the 
private sector ever lies." 
</P>
<P>
"I wish someone had warned me about that when I took this job."

GETTING THE PROPER HELP FOR DEPRESSIVE CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY JO KOCHAKIAN, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents bring children plagued by headaches to Joel Herskowitz, a pediatric 
neurologist, fearing the diagnosis will be a brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
Among those hundreds of kids, "for every one who had a brain tumor, 30 were 
depressed," he says. 
</P>
<P>
It is now recognized that children do have major depressive episodes, not just 
the transitory blues. 
</P>
<P>
Although mental health professionals may be knowledgeable about the condition, 
many children are suffering because their parents and family physicians are not 
adequately informed, says Herskowitz, who practices in Boston and Framingham, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
It is often apparent that something is not right with a child, but neither 
parents nor pediatricians may be able to recognize the symptoms of depression, 
he says. So he wrote "Is Your Child Depressed?" (Pharos Books). 
</P>
<P>
Depression can manifest itself quite differently in children than in adults, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The 'Right Questions' 
</P>
<P>
"A child doesn't have to be sad to be depressed. You have to look and see what 
is the child's prevailing mood," he says. It could be anger or irritability. 
"There don't have to be tears. When children are depressed, you just have to 
ask the right questions." 
</P>
<P>
Often, pediatricians -- who typically do not get much exposure to psychiatry in 
their training -- are too busy or uninformed to be of help, he says, and some 
may actually be reluctant to find the true diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of pediatricians are not comfortable" diagnosing depression," he adds. 
"They don't consider it a real disease." 
</P>
<P>
"Childhood," Herskowitz writes, "is supposed to be a time of exuberance and 
joy. What I was seeing was children whose lives were drained of energy and 
enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
And the situation is often more tragic; depression often figures in suicide. 
</P>
<P>
In many depressed children, there is a genetic predisposition toward the 
condition, which is brought on by stressful circumstances. Medication is often 
the answer, in conjunction with psychotherapy. While it may seem daunting to 
parents unfamiliar with psychiatry, treatment is effective. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Herskowitz's checklist for symptoms indicating depression in childhood: 
marked loss of interest or pleasure in most activities; significant changes in 
appetite, weight or activity level; sleep disturbances; increased or decreased 
fatigue or frequent loss of energy; excessive or inappropriate guilt; low 
self-esteem; problems in concentrating or thinking in general; suicidal 
thoughts or actions; and physical complaints, such as headaches or stomach 
aches. 
</P>
<P>
These behaviors may indicate depression specifically in preschoolers: Looking 
bored, angry or sad; crying for no apparent reason; needing to rest or seeming 
tired or listless; being rejected by or rejecting others; seeming cranky or 
irritable; being moody, changeable, constantly on the move or fidgety; fighting 
with others; talking often. 
</P>
<P>
A combination of behavior changes and mood disturbance strongly suggests a 
depressive disorder, he writes. 
</P>
<P>
Parents should be aware that certain situations are "set-ups for depression," 
Herskowitz says. Whether it is separation or divorce in the family, the death 
of a loved one (person or pet), a move, academic failure or physical illness, 
the common denominator is loss.

DAYTIME SOAPS BRUSH UP ON COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Near-death experiences as depicted on television are usually serious affairs, 
with beckoning white lights and comforting welcomes by previously deceased 
relatives. But on today's episode of the NBC soap opera "Santa Barbara," in 
which gunshot victim Mason Capwell (actor Lane Davies) unexpectedly finds 
himself in heaven, he is greeted by none other than Joan Crawford, now toiling 
as God's receptionist -- and who is played here by the show's cross-dresser 
character Bunny, in full drag. 
</P>
<P>
God's office looks remarkably like that of a network executive's, with 
television wall monitors and a copy of Celestial Variety. Indeed, heaven turns 
out to be the GBC network -- 20 owned-and-operated clouds, 250 affiliates, a 
peacock-like logo with halo and a three-note chimed theme song. God Himself, 
tall and dapper in white suit and hat, briskly tells Mason that his untimely 
demise was due to fallen popularity -- that is, low ratings -- but tries to 
comfort him that his fate could have been a lot worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Worse than death?" asks an incredulous Mason. 
</P>
<P>
Replies God -- played by real-life NBC daytime program vice president Brian 
Frons -- "You could have been sent to cable." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, times have changed for daytime soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
Once awash in melodramatic tales of illicit sex, unrequited love, murder, 
kidnaping and other assorted doom and gloom, the shows have added increasing 
doses of humor to their story lines. The plot staples may remain, but most 
soaps now regularly offer the same kind of tongue-in-cheek material once seen 
on the popular prime-time series "Soap," which was itself a parody of the 
genre. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, daytime characters have become locked in gorilla cages and 
trapped in muddy pig pens; they've appeared on "Wheel of Fortune" with Pat and 
Vanna, and they've staged a wedding for a pregnant pet dog, complete with 
bridal gown. Shows have spoofed films ranging from the beloved "It's a 
Wonderful Life" and "Casablanca" to "The Bride of Frankenstein," plus 
television's own "Life-styles of the Rich and Famous," with a guest appearance 
by Robin Leach. 
</P>
<P>
And while "Santa Barbara's" Bunny may be daytime's first bona fide 
cross-dresser, other shows make comical use of drag disguises. On NBC's 
"Another World," for instance, the character Cass once dressed up as his 
girlfriend's aunt so he could keep an eye on her. 
</P>
<P>
Why this proliferation of daytime drollery? 
</P>
<P>
"Because a couple of characters did it and the people of America embraced it. 
They identified with it," says actress Linda Dano, "Another World's" flamboyant 
Felicia Gallant, whose numerous capers have included being trapped in the 
aforementioned gorilla cage and landing in a vat of wine after blowing up a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots and lots of people in America are funny," she says. "If you're in a sea 
of strife, with work problems and the kids driving you crazy, you need to 
laugh. So if you're going to mirror life, as the soaps do, you have to have 
humor." 
</P>
<P>
Comedy also provides an emotional balance, according to "Guiding Light" head 
writer Pam Long, whose staff includes two former writers for Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
"I never say, 'This is going to be a ha-ha day,' " she explains. "But if we see 
that a day is one of heavy, heavy emotion, where you know you've got scenes 
that will make viewers cry, we say, 'What can we do across town to make things 
lighter?' " 
</P>
<P>
The early days of soap humor may be traced to 1965, when Agnes Nixon, who would 
later come to be considered daytime's grande dame for her creation of "One Life 
to Live" and "All My Children," was asked by Procter &amp; Gamble to take over 
its then-floundering "Another World." 
</P>
<P>
"Up till then, television thought you had to be heavy," Nixon recalls. "But I 
brought humor to the show, with characters like Lahoma Vane, whose biggest 
claim to fame was that she had been Miss Black-Eyed Pea of 1960, and Danny 
Fargo, who was a baddie but was so outrageous people couldn't wait to see what 
he'd do next. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays," she adds, "we even dare to end an act with humor, which we wouldn't 
have done 20 years ago, because it doesn't have 'stay-tuned' suspense. But if 
('All My Children's') Palmer Courtland suddenly gets his comeuppance, and it's 
at the end of an act and it's humorous, we do it. Humor makes a show 
three-dimensional and gives characters more appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Numerous characters have long brought comic touches to their roles, but the 
first genuine daytime "kook" is generally regarded to be "All My Children's" 
Opal Gardner, as played by Dorothy Lyman from 1981 to 1983. Loud and brassy, 
bedecked in spandex pants and oversized, mismatched jewelry, Opal was given to 
fantasies that reduced the wealthy, pompous Phoebe Tyler Wallingford to maid 
status; Lyman won an Emmy for her portrayal. 
</P>
<P>
A worthy successor in daytime ditziness is the character of Calliope Jones 
Bradford on NBC's "Days of Our Lives," played by Arleen Sorkin. Initially hired 
only for a few days, Sorkin has parlayed her antic flair to a five-year run, 
four Soap Opera Digest awards for best comic actress, and her own soap-opera 
spinoff, which probably will premiere later this year. 
</P>
<P>
A somewhat eccentric fashion designer whose dress code was patterned after rock 
singer Cyndi Lauper, Calliope has become noted for her outlandishly themed 
hats, which depict everything from tennis matches to the Statue of Liberty. 
Sorkin sees her character as a means of bringing honesty to a show that by its 
nature depends on plot misunderstandings and duplicities. 
</P>
<P>
"Calliope cuts through to reality," Sorkin says. "When she fought with her 
husband Eugene, it was about his picking his toes in bed, not over whether or 
not he should do espionage work." 
</P>
<P>
If Opal and Calliope were trend-setting individuals, then the show that as a 
whole has broken new ground is "Santa Barbara." It debuted in 1984 and last 
year won the Emmy for outstanding daytime drama series. Much of its comedy came 
from the villainous duo of Gina DeMott Capwell (Robin Mattson) and Keith 
Timmons (Justin Deas), who spent a lot of time literally slinging mud, spoofing 
films and generally making a mockery of the traditional soap romantic couple, 
before Deas took off last year for greener prime-time pastures. 
</P>
<P>
Mattson, whose character was conceived as a Joan Collins-type villain until she 
and Deas clicked, won this year's Soap Opera Digest award as best comic 
actress. She now plays opposite Joe Marinelli's Bunny, a heterosexual gangster 
who initially donned women's clothing to hide from the mob and discovered he 
liked wearing dresses and panty hose. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Barbara's" humor can best be described as irreverent, according to 
executive producer Jill Farren Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that we set out to be funny, but I think we just all are, across 
the board -- writers, producers and actors. I don't revere the art form of soap 
opera, so I'm not afraid to be different, to take chances," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Neither is Marinelli. As he waited in his Joan Crawford garb to tape the scenes 
for today's episode, the actor was asked whether the "Santa Barbara" writers, 
in their quest for humor, had ever come up with anything so outrageous that he 
refused to play it. 
</P>
<P>
"No," the one-time Olympic wrestling hopeful responded, as if the answer were 
obvious. "Look at me."

CRITIC AT LARGE: SEARCHING FOR A PATTERN TO THE OSCAR BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the relentless campaigning for the Oscars begins, it is tempting to decipher 
what the 4,600-plus voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences were saying in their nominations. But finding any kind of a pattern is 
about as easy as matching snowflakes. 
</P>
<P>
The real tip-offs are not in who and what got nominated but who and what 
didn't. The one hard lesson this time is that it is dangerous and near-fatal to 
open a good film early in the year if you have hopes of an Oscar nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"Dominick and Eugene," a fine and sensitive drama about a pair of brothers, one 
mentally retarded, was an early-year release. The performances by Ray Liotto, 
Jamie Lee Curtis and, most especially, by Tom Hulce as the brain-damaged 
brother, were Oscar quality, and some reviewers found the film superior to 
"Rain Man." 
</P>
<P>
But "Dominick and Eugene" was not a commercial success, despite its glowing 
reviews, and it was evidently not seen by many academy voters. 
</P>
<P>
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being" was one of the year's most ambitious films, 
a severe challenge to the creators because it was based on a Milan Kundera 
novel that is part story, part philosophical speculation. It rightly earned 
nominations for Sven Nykvist's images and for the script by director Philip 
Kaufman and Jean-Claude Carriere. But the larger nominations, as for best 
picture and direction, were elusive. It, too, opened early in the year, had a 
relatively brief run and did not reappear until year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Landau got a deserved and much-predicted nomination as best supporting 
actor in "Tucker" -- and such predictions almost certainly have an influence on 
voters. But the film, its early summer opening overshadowed by the furor over 
"The Last Temptation of Christ," seems otherwise not so much to have been 
rejected as ignored. 
</P>
<P>
It has been the industry's conventional wisdom to save the big ones for the 
last quarter and preferably the last month of the year, thus to cash in on the 
heightened Academy Award interest as well as the Thanksgiving to New Year's 
holiday trade. 
</P>
<P>
The big winners in the nominations this year were all late-year openers, and 
the industry's wisdom looks wise as well as conventional. It is not inevitably 
so. For example, two Oscar winners from earlier years, "The Godfather" and 
"Annie Hall" both opened in early spring, were major hits and played throughout 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Any detectable pattern in the academy voting admits exceptions. Yet the largest 
pattern is that the Oscars are more democratic, freer of studio bloc voting, 
more international and less Hollywood-centered and more a popularity contest 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
The voting membership, now close to 4,700, is the highest in modern times, 
double what it was only a few years ago. Beginning in the '60s, under Gregory 
Peck, Dan Taradash and a succession of other presidents, the academy purged its 
voting rolls of long-inactive members and encouraged new, younger members. Like 
any professional organization, the academy is still weighted toward seniority, 
but it probably reflects the industry at large more closely than it used to. 
</P>
<P>
The choices for best picture, with all the academy voters participating, and 
the picks in the four acting categories, with the more than 2,000 actors 
voting, are democratic elections -- pure if not so simple. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to disagree with the choices -- it is almost impossible not to. 
The sadness, always, is contemplating the pictures and the talent that didn't 
make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
Did anyone, for example, see a more powerfully affecting scene in 1988 than the 
confrontation between Christine Lahti and Steven Hill as her father in a 
Manhattan restaurant in "Running on Empty"? How many performances lent more 
support to the impact of a film than Hill's? You are grateful for the work that 
didn't get away, the felicitous awards, as for Frances McDormand in 
"Mississippi Burning" and Max von Sydow in "Pelle the Conqueror." 
</P>
<P>
It's just that it's depressing to perceive that the box office and the calendar 
loom so large in choices that are presumably based on excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Popularity is a definition of excellence in the counting room, and popularity 
and excellence aren't necessarily self-canceling items. 
</P>
<P>
But excellence comes not only in blockbusters but in modest packages for 
limited runs as well. One measure of excellence -- honored more often in the 
technical branches than in the larger categories -- is how difficult something 
was to do. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, what the academy has never discovered, except in the 
foreign-language category, is a way to be sure the voters have seen everything 
they're voting for -- or against. 
</P>
<P>
There's probably no solution, so the making of choices will continue to be 
tinted by sentiment, hearsay, past performances and sheer popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Weighted against drought or an inexplicable rash, none of it really matters, of 
course. But the honors do exist, and until they are unarguably perfect, let us 
have a tip of the hat to the honorable ones who missed the honors.

SEAL BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
SEARCH CONTINUES FOR SLAIN BROKER RIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Monday continued their search for Vicente Lapid OCampo, a real estate 
broker wanted for questioning in last week's slaying of a Seal Beach woman who 
was shot and found dead in a truck of a car. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Police Detective William MacLyman said OCampo may have left the Los 
Angeles area. Speculation centered on the possibility that OCampo had returned 
to the Philippines, where he was born. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't know," MacLyman said. "We can't find him." 
</P>
<P>
MacLyman said he would seek an arrest warrant for OCampo today in connection 
with last Wednesday's shooting death of Arlene Chee, a 46-year-old real estate 
broker. 
</P>
<P>
Chee, owner of Century 21 Fortune in Long Beach , was last seen Wednesday 
morning heading to a noon appointment with OCampo, who owns a rival realty firm 
in Long Beach. Police said the two had been arguing over a real estate agent 
who left OCampo's firm to join Chee's more successful business. 
</P>
<P>
Chee's late model Mercedes-Benz was found by members of her family last 
Thursday night. A Long Beach patrolman opened the trunk and found the woman's 
body. She had been shot once in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Chee, the victim's brother-in-law, said a memorial service was planned for 
1 p.m. Saturday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
A short service will be held at the park in the Church of Our Fathers chapel, 
with burial to follow, he said.

VALLEY EARNINGS: ELECTRONICS MAKER HCC REVERSES YEAR-AGO LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HCC Industries, an Encino maker of airtight electronic components, said it 
earned $726,000 in its fiscal third quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss 
of $599,000. 
</P>
<P>
HCC recorded the profit in the quarter that ended Dec. 31 despite a dip in 
revenue to $6.5 million from $6.69 million a year earlier. However, the profit 
included a $440,000 gain from the termination of a benefits plan, and tax 
benefits totaling $258,000. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of its fiscal year, HCC reported net income of 
$958,000 compared with a $1.09 million loss a year earlier. The company's 
nine-month revenue fell to $19.4 million from $22.6 million.

A SUNNY HOLIDAY DRAWS CROWDS TO BEACHES AND PARKS 
</P>

Orange County residents greeted the President's Day holiday with delight Monday 
as thousands filled the county's parks and beaches, firing up barbecues, 
organizing pick-up softball games and generally enjoying the sunny, breezy 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
While the sun made a gallant showing, gentle but persistent winds kept 
temperatures in the low- to mid-60s, sweaters on and the sun tan oil back on 
the shelf. Still, the sunshine offered many the chance to get outdoors after 
Sunday's intermittent rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
At Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley, about 2,000 people came through the 
park's gates to enjoy the huge recreation area's picnic, sports and hobby 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a pretty good crowd for a winter day. It was sunny, but it was cool 
enough for most people to keep their sweaters on," park ranger Jeff Bukshapan 
said. According to Bukshapan, the park's model airplane and rocket-launching 
hobby areas were packed most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
At Irvine Park, about 700 people gathered to barbecue steaks, hamburgers and 
hotdogs. Riding horses, playing pick-up games of touch football and softball 
were also popular activities, park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sun and Surf 
</P>
<P>
"It was an excellent turnout," park official Scott Pritchard said. "I think 
with the weather we have been having lately people were really looking forward 
to the holiday. It was sunny, but many kept their coats on in order to be 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Tarpley, a Seal Beach lifeguard, said that about 5,000 people came out for 
the sun and surf. A few people, braving chilly 55-degree waters, went swimming 
or belly-boarding, Tarpley said. A handful of the swimmers received stingray 
bites for their efforts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty good sized crowd, easily the biggest of this year. While we 
had a few swimmers, I think that most of the people who came just wanted to 
enjoy the sun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gordon Reed, Newport Beach marine safety captain, about 8,000 
people ventured onto the beaches at Newport and Balboa during the day. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of people out today. All seemed to be in a great mood and were 
having a lot of fun. We had a gentle but steady westerly breeze for most of the 
day, and it was just enough to keep things cool," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Terry and Jayne Brenna, along with their children Erin, 4, and Ryan, 2, were 
lured to Laguna Beach for a sunny, three-day Southern California weekend from 
their home in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great. We're having a lot of fun. We even have the required Disneyland 
balloon in the back of the car," Terry said as the family enjoyed a fried 
chicken lunch on the sand. 
</P>
<P>
For state social worker Thomas Novak, 34, of Arcadia, the sunny weather meant a 
chance to relax and do some people-watching on the Laguna Beach boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Great People Wtaching 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get out and get some fresh air. I work indoors all week and I 
really wanted to get out in the sun. Besides, the people-watching is great," 
Novak said. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday for Golden West College students Theresa Arroyo, 21, and Keith 
Minnie, 24, meant a day off from lectures and exams, and a chance to sample the 
shops and eateries of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had a chance to get away for a while. Being here is like a small 
escape, you might say," Minnie said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's high in Orange County was 69 degrees in Santa Ana, with El Toro and 
San Juan Capistrano both reporting highs of 63, according to the National 
Weather Service. Newport Beach posted the coolest daytime temperature with 57 
degrees, up from an overnight low of 50.

SAN CLEMENTE SEEKS WAY TO HANDLE GOLF COURSE CROWDS; 
</P>
<P>
LOCAL PLAYERS ASK TEE TIME BY RESERVATION ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
San Clemente's Municipal Golf Course is a big source of local pride. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean is visible from nearly every green. The fairways are so wide that 
even rank amateurs seldom lose golf balls. Best of all, the greens fee for city 
residents is a mere $5 -- less than half the going rate at most public golf 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
But the very charm of this golf course -- where former President Richard M. 
Nixon played during sojourns at his Western White House -- is also a big source 
of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente course has become so popular that it is now ranked by the 
Southern California Golf Assn. as second-busiest among both public and private 
courses throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the crowds and increasingly long waits, some local players have 
asked the city to impose a strict new policy that would allocate almost all the 
prime starting times to those making reservations in advance, effectively 
locking out non-residents, who pay $9 a round, and even local working 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The current policy allows three walk-on groups of golfers for every five groups 
who make reservations. The course is able to start an average of eight groups 
per hour. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan proposed by the San Clemente Golf Committee -- a five-member panel 
appointed by the City Council -- only one walk-on group would be allowed per 
hour and the remaining seven starting times would be set aside for those with 
reservations. This policy would be in effect from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m., the prime 
golfing hours. 
</P>
<P>
The committee submitted the plan to the City Council on behalf of at least 200 
members of the San Clemente Golf Course Men's Club, said Joe Crispino, 68, a 
men's club board member. The club has 900 members, many of whom oppose any 
change. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council considered the plan at its Jan. 18 meeting. After several 
golfers protested the plan, the council delayed a final vote until March 15. In 
the meantime, the council adopted an interim compromise allowing six 
reservations per hour and two walk-ons. 
</P>
<P>
Following the January meeting, golfers opposed to a starting-time change formed 
a group called Golfers for Fairway Fairness, and came up with a counterproposal 
that would make the walk-on policy even more lenient than it is now. 
</P>
<P>
They claim that since reservations have to be made a week in advance, local 
retirees who already dominate the reservation-making process would lock up the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel it's fair to lock up all reserved times when there are people 
who have to work and cannot get up early to get a tee time," said Brian Ruff, 
an insurance agent who helped form the committee. "This is a public golf course 
and the only way to be fair is to keep it open to the public." 
</P>
<P>
Walt Kallenberger, 69, who was playing 18 holes last Friday agreed: "I'm a 
senior citizen, but I really think they're trying to make a private country 
club for seniors." 
</P>
<P>
However, Crispino, who played just ahead of Kallenberger on the course, 
complained that he and other golfers have to get up as early as 3 a.m. to put 
their names on the reservation list, then often must wait for people who 
saunter onto the course during a walk-on time. 
</P>
<P>
"The real trouble is (that) the course is full, (and) the prime consideration 
ought to be given people who make true efforts to get a starting time," 
Crispino said. 
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Golf Course opened in 1929 after San Clemente's founder, Ole 
Hanson, deeded the land to the city for $10. Under terms of the land 
transaction, the course was to be operated as a nonprofit facility. 
</P>
<P>
Walk-on times became an issue only in recent years, as the population of both 
San Clemente and surrounding south Orange County communities has soared. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, the number of golfers using the course has more than 
doubled, said Golf Committee member Tom Dunn. In the same period, the city has 
grown from about 15,000 residents to more than 35,000. 
</P>
<P>
And the Southland's overall population growth has far outpaced the number of 
golf courses, putting the squeeze on every golfing facility in the region, said 
Bob Thomas, spokesman for the Southern California Golf Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said that Southern California ranks as second worst in the country, 
behind New Jersey, in terms of golf courses per capita. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, courses like San Clemente's, which is popular because of its low 
green fees, are drawing golfers from as far away as 50 miles, Thomas said. San 
Clemente has only one municipal golf course, although there are two other 
privately owned courses in the city that are open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deed Says San Clemente' 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 2 years ago, some members of the San Clemente Golf Course Men's 
Club feared they were being squeezed out of their own golf course and began 
signing petitions seeking to restrict walk-on times, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of San Clemente want to play on their own course," said Dunn, 70, a 
retired fire captain. "We're not trying to restrict people from outside, but 
the deed for this course says a golf course for San Clemente." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said the golf committee came up with its reservation proposal after 
analyzing the starting time policies at 20 golf courses in Orange, Los Angeles 
and San Diego counties. The committee concluded that almost all the courses 
limited starting times largely to those who made reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Golf Assn. spokesman Thomas concurred that most golf 
courses try to operate on a reservation-only basis. 
</P>
<P>
"Most places take as many reservations as they can," Thomas said. "Walk-ons 
generally don't have any priority." 
</P>
<P>
Although he conceded that San Clemente's walk-on policy has worked very well 
for many years, Crispino said it has become too cumbersome because of the 
growing number of golfers there. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons there are so many walk-ons here is that there are no 
walk-ons anywhere else," Crispino said. 
</P>
<P>
Crispino and members of the "fivesome" he plays with every week take turns 
getting in line as early as 3 a.m. for a place on San Clemente's reservation 
list, with tee times starting at 6 a.m. Reservations are also taken over the 
telephone at that time, but Crispino said the line almost always is too busy to 
get through. 
</P>
<P>
After going to so much trouble to get a starting time, Crispino and other 
golfers who make reservations say, it rankles them to see someone allowed to 
walk on ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them also feel that the course's starters -- employees who determine 
when golfers can begin their game -- show favoritism toward their friends who 
show up without a reservation and let them on before anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Starter Backs Fairness Group 
</P>
<P>
But Sal Russo, the course's head starter, denies it. Russo said that he has few 
problems accommodating all golfers, local and non-local, under the current 
walk-on policy, and that he sides with the Golfers for Fairway Fairness. 
</P>
<P>
"We sure should not have a policy that caters to only a small segment of the 
population of San Clemente," Russo said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Poncino, a National League baseball umpire who lives in San Clemente, 
explained the problem he would experience if the city adopts the proposed 
reservation system. 
</P>
<P>
"How am I going to get a starting time a week in advance when I'm in some place 
like Houston, Tex., for a game?" asked Poncino, 32, who has played at the San 
Clemente course since he was 10. 
</P>
<P>
"The prior system has worked fine all these years," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Velasco, 60, an actor and musician who said he has played the San 
Clemente course for 24 years, also supported keeping the walk-on policy the way 
it is. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great place to play golf. It's scenic. And the prices are best in 
Southern California," Velasco said as he practiced his putt. "And naturally 
some people would like to keep this to themselves."

BODY OF MAN FOUND IN MOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The body of a man in his early 20s was found Monday in an El Toro motel, but a 
cause of death was not immediately determined pending an autopsy today, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A Sheriff's Department spokesman said the victim appeared to have suffered a 
head wound, but it was not known if that had caused his death. The case is 
being treated as a possible murder pending further investigation and an 
autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Larry Abbott said the body was found about 9 a.m. Monday in a 
room at the Quality Suites Inn in the 23000 block of Lake Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott said the man has been tentatively identified, but that a name would not 
be released pending positive identification and notification of next of kin. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we're treating this as a homicide investigation, but we always treat 
situations like this as possible homicides until our investigations are 
complete," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Sheriff's Department had no other details of the case it could make 
public Monday night.

CANYON, SANTA ANA HOPE TO KEEP ROLLING

<P>
When it comes to high school soccer playoffs, most coaches agree it takes 
talent and some luck to make it to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon and Santa Ana high schools had lady luck on their side last week. After 
first-round victories in the Southern Section 3-A boys' soccer playoffs, the 
teams won coin tosses to play at home at 3 p.m. today in second-round action. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, Santa Ana, top-seeded Mission Viejo and El Toro are the four Orange 
County teams to advance to the 3-A second round. Foothill and Dana Hills were 
eliminated in first-round action. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (16-3-5) plays host to Cerritos (18-6-2). 
</P>
<P>
"(Coin tosses) can just wreak havoc with you," Canyon Coach Walt Bowman said. 
"As long as you win 'em, it's OK, but at some point in time, it makes the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon has excellent scoring balance. Junior left wing Fred Veloz leads the 
team with eight goals, and four of his teammates have scored seven goals. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Santa Ana (18-1-5) plays El Toro (12-6-3), the second-place team 
from the South Coast League, at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo (22-3) travels to Bellflower to play St. John Bosco (16-5-2). If 
both Canyon and Mission Viejo win, they will face each other in the 
quarterfinals with the home site to be determined by a coin toss. 
</P>
<P>
Of the seven county teams that started the 1-A playoffs, only Saddleback and 
Troy remain. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are on the road. Saddleback (11-6-3) travels to El Monte to meet 
Arroyo (12-5-1) at Mountain View High School. 
</P>
<P>
Last season Saddleback defeated Arroyo, 2-0, in a 2-A first-round playoff match 
at Saddleback. The Roadrunners are led by freshman Jose Escudero with 16 goals. 
</P>
<P>
Troy (12-3-3) travels to North (16-4-3) in Riverside. Paul McDonell is Troy's 
leading scorer with 17 goals.

TWO SIDES OF COIN ON INTEREST RATES; 
</P>
<P>
STEADY INCREASES MADE 1988 A HEADY YEAR FOR BANKS, A TOSS-UP FOR THRIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Major banks in the San Fernando Valley will remember 1988 as a banner year that 
enriched them with sharply higher profits. But for most of the area's big 
savings and loans institutions, last year was hardly memorable. 
</P>
<P>
Of the six biggest commercial banks with headquarters between Glendale and 
Camarillo, all but one posted double-digit profit gains for the fourth quarter 
and for all of 1988, compared with year-earlier periods. 
</P>
<P>
The exception, Valley National Bank in Glendale, reported earnings gains of 
only 5% and 6% for the quarter and the year, respectively. Nonetheless, Valley 
National had one of the highest return-on-assets ratios, meaning it was one of 
the most effective banks in wringing profits from the assets at its disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings came a lot harder to the region's thrifts. Three of the four biggest 
savings institutions suffered double-digit profit declines in 1988, and the 
fourth, Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan in Van Nuys, had a $3-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
The divergent showings of the banks and S&amp;Ls stemmed largely from the same 
source: interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steady Increase 
</P>
<P>
Rates rose steadily during 1988, increasing the cost that banks and S&amp;Ls 
had to pay to acquire the money that they lend out again to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the rate on federal funds, which are reserves that banks borrow 
from one another overnight, climbed to 9% from 7% during 1988. Rates paid on 
3-month certificates of deposit rose to about 8.5% from 6.3%. 
</P>
<P>
But the banks were able to absorb the rise in interest rates much better than 
the S&amp;Ls, and even benefited from higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the banks' loans are to businesses and carry lending charges that are 
priced at a fixed level above market rates. For example, a dry-cleaning store 
might borrow money at 1.5 points above the prime rate; if the prime rate goes 
up, the store's rate automatically goes up. 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened last year. Market rates rose, lifting the banks' interest 
income and fattening profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mortgage Specialists 
</P>
<P>
No so at the savings and loans. They specialize in residential mortgage loans, 
and nearly all of the mortgages written today are adjustable-rate loans, which 
feature below-market interest rates for the first few months or years of the 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively low introductory rates help home buyers qualify for mortgage 
loans and generate new business for S&amp;Ls. But last year, rates on 
adjustable mortgages did not rise as quickly as market rates, so the S&amp;Ls' 
interest income did not keep pace with their higher cost of obtaining funds. 
Result: profits narrowed. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage rates overall "didn't rise nearly as fast as the actual cost of 
funds," said Norman M. Coulson, president of Glenfed, the holding company for 
Glendale Federal Savings &amp; Loan. Glenfed is by far the area's biggest 
thrift, with $25 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter that ended Dec. 31, which is the second quarter of Glenfed's 
fiscal year, its net interest income -- the amount of interest it collects 
minus the interest it pays on deposits -- fell 11% to $109.9 million from 
$123.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Glenfed's profit fell 27% in the quarter, to $35.2 million from $48.2 
million a year earlier, when Glenfed's results included $15.6 million in 
one-time gains. For the first half of its current fiscal year, Glenfed's profit 
dropped 28% to $66.6 million from $92.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The lower earnings also left Glenfed's return on average assets at 0.55% for 
1988, well below the 1% ratio that is considered an excellent performance. 
Indeed, none of the area's big S&amp;Ls managed a return of 1% or more for the 
fourth quarter or the full year, but several of the banks did. 
</P>
<P>
The return on average assets is a key gauge of performance because it indicates 
how profitably a bank or S&amp;L is employing its assets. The ratio is 
calculated by dividing an institution's profit by its average assets during the 
quarter, then multiplying that figure by four to produced an annualized rate of 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Citadel Holding Corp., the Glendale parent of Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan, also blamed the rise in interest rates last year for lower profits. In 
the fourth quarter, Citadel's net income fell 44% to $4.88 million from $8.77 
million, and for the year its profit dropped 15% to $24.1 million from $28.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Sears Savings Bank, also in Glendale, ended a roller-coaster 1988 on an 
upswing. The company, a unit of giant retailer Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., has 
two separate operations. One, also called Sears Savings Bank, accepts savers' 
deposits and manages a portfolio of loans it has bought from other lenders, but 
does not make loans itself. 
</P>
<P>
The other division, called Sears Mortgage Corp., is a mortgage banker that 
makes loans and resells most of them to other financial institutions -- while 
keeping the rights to collect the borrowers' monthly payments and otherwise 
service the loans for a fee. Sears Mortgage also can sell those rights to 
generate additional income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sears Soared 
</P>
<P>
That's what it did in the fourth quarter, which helped Sears Savings' net 
income soar to $9.1 million from $1.7 million, said Sears Savings President 
Ronald F. Danner. But losses earlier in the year left its profit for all of 
1988 at $3.6 million, down 92% from $46.9 million in 1987, when the company 
recorded big gains from selling all but one of its 51 Sears Savings branch 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Sears Savings has continued streamlining this year. Recently it moved some of 
its accounting and treasury functions to Riverwoods, Ill., where Sears Mortgage 
is headquartered, Danner said. The move resulted in the layoff of about 80 
people in Glendale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The other major S&amp;L, Valley Federal, eked out a $116,000 profit in the 
fourth quarter, compared with a $2.4-million loss a year earlier. For the year, 
Valley Federal lost $3 million compared with a $16.5-million profit in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal, which fought off a takeover threat from Citadel Holding early 
in 1988, blamed its poor showing last year on several factors, including a 
pre-tax operating loss of $11.5 million by its All Valley Acceptance Co. unit, 
which provides financing for manufactured housing. Valley Federal Chairman Dan 
E. Nelms also cited the rise in interest rates, which cut the thrift's profit 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
The picture was much brighter among the banks. 
</P>
<P>
Independence Bank in Encino, the area's biggest, reported a 16% rise in 
fourth-quarter profit to $2.43 million from $2.10 million, and full-year 
earnings nearly doubled to $4.90 million from $2.52 million. Privately held 
Independence also had the highest return on average assets, 1.62%, in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Valley National Bank's fourth-quarter profit edged up to $1.04 million from 
$993,000, and its full-year net income rose to $4.08 million from $3.86 
million. Valley National's return on average assets of 1.63% was the highest 
among the local banks for all of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Bancorp, the Encino parent of Lincoln National Bank, continued its 
recent string of solid earnings gains. Lincoln's fourth-quarter net income rose 
78% to $1.44 million from $807,496, and its full-year earnings nearly doubled 
to $4.19 million from $2.12 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
28% Gain Posted 
</P>
<P>
In Valencia, Santa Clarita National Bank posted a 28% gain in fourth-quarter 
earnings, to $778,000 from $606,000, and its 1988 profit rose 36% to $3.18 
million from $2.34 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Oaks-based TransWorld Bancorp, the parent of TransWorld Bank, reported 
a 67% surge in fourth-quarter profit to $491,000 from $294,000, while its 
full-year earnings rose 42% to $1.50 million from $1.06 million. 
</P>
<P>
APSB Bancorp, the North Hollywood parent of American Pacific State Bank, said 
fourth-quarter profit rose 34% to $396,539 from $296,179, and its earnings for 
1988 totaled $1.34 million, up 32% from $1.02 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Three smaller banks also reported results for last year: 
</P>
<P>
Charter Pacific Bank in Agoura Hills, with assets of $54.5 million as of Dec. 
31, said its profit in 1988 rose to $686,000 from $420,000. 
</P>

Bank of Granada Hills' net income for last year surged to $415,341 from $17,943 
the previous year. The bank's assets at the end of 1988 totaled $34.1 million.

$37,473 last year, an improvement from its $112,840 loss in 1987. The company's

<P>
A man who helped plan the 1985 revenge slaying of a Los Angeles police 
detective was convicted today of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, but 
was acquitted of the actual murder charge by a Van Nuys Superior Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
Voltaire Williams, 25, of Los Angeles was scheduled to be sentenced in Van Nuys 
Municipal Court March 27 and faces up to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted of helping plan the Halloween, 1985, revenge-murder of Los 
Angeles Police Detective Thomas C. Williams, who was killed in a volley of 
gunfire as he picked up his 6-year-old son from a Canoga Park day-care center. 
The child escaped injury. Voltaire Williams is no relation to the slain 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The jury is continuing to deliberate the fate of co-defendants Duane Moody, 31, 
and Reecy Clem Cooper, 34, who face both conspiracy and murder counts. 
</P>
<P>
Two other defendants, Daniel Jenkins, 33, and Ruben Antonio Moss, 26, have been 
convicted in the ambush killing. Jenkins was sentenced to die in the gas 
chamber and Moss received life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Voltaire Williams said he initially agreed to assist Jenkins in planning the 
officer's killing but then backed out of the conspiracy.

GREENSPAN SAYS HE'LL KEEP PUSHING INTEREST RATES UP;

<P>
DIFFERS WITH BUSH OVER INFLATION

<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today said that inflationary pressures 
are unacceptable and that the central bank would continue fighting higher 
prices by driving up interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's remarks could spell bad news for the Bush Administration, which is 
counting on robust economic growth to reduce the federal budget deficit without 
increased taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan released an economic forecast prepared by the central bank that 
showed growth significantly lower than the Bush Administration's estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's comments were made in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee as 
part of the requirement that the central bank reveal its economic assumptions 
and monetary policy targets twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank has been pushing interest rates higher in an effort to 
restrain domestic demand since March of last year, an effort that has sent a 
variety of short-term interest rates climbing by about 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Restraint' Cited 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Greenspan discussed this effort and said the central bank 
"remains more inclined to act in the direction of restraint" on the supply of 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two years, consumer prices have increased 4.4% annually, a rate of 
increase that Greenspan said is worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
"The wage and price process may have developed some momentum," Greenspan said, 
citing reports showing that wage increases are rising at a faster clip because 
of the tight labor markets. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me stress that the current rate of inflation, let alone an increase, is 
not acceptable, and our policies are designed to reduce inflation in coming 
years," he said. "This restraint will involve containing pressures on our 
productive resources and, thus, some slowing in the underlying rate of growth" 
of the overall economy. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking office, President Bush has on several occasions said he believes 
that the Fed's worries about inflation are misplaced, saying he sees no need to 
push interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank has so far ignored those comments, however, launching its 
latest credit tightening effort just last week after a report on prices at the 
wholesale level that showed an unexpectedly sharp 1% increase in January. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Forecasts 
</P>
<P>
In his report to Congress, Greenspan said the Fed is predicting that the 
overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, will expand by 
between 2.5% and 3% in 1989. The Administration, however, is basing its budget 
on a forecast that expects growth to be a more robust 3.5% this year. 
</P>
<P>
To support its move to restrain inflationary pressures, Greenspan said the 
central bank policy makers reaffirmed a decision made last summer to lower 
money growth targets for 1989. For M-2, the measure of the money supply that 
includes currency in circulation and interest-bearing checking accounts, the 
Fed said it would aim for an increase of between 3% and 7%, down a percentage 
point from the 1988 growth target. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said he understands that moves toward tightening the availability of 
money and driving up interest rates could have an adverse effect on the savings 
and loan crisis, the Third World debt situation and the debt problems of some 
American businesses.

An international art dealer suspected in the theft of millions of dollars worth 
of oil paintings was found dead in his apartment in an apparent murder-suicide, 
police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Building superintendent Don Andrews said the bodies of Peter Nixon, 58, and his 
wife, Evelyn, 55, were found Monday in the bedroom of their London apartment, 
in the province of Ontario, and were believed to have been dead about a week. A 
handgun was also found. Andrews said Peter Nixon was at the center of an 
international investigation into the theft of 20 oil paintings. Andrews 
speculated that the art dealer, originally from Britain, and his wife may have 
felt cornered by the police. Twelve of the 20 paintings, some of which date 
back several centuries and are valued at more the $10 million, have been 
recovered in Europe, the United States and Canada.

<P>
A U.S. Navy captain, his voice choking with emotion, said today that he would 
have rescued Vietnamese boat people his ship found in the South China Sea if he 
had been correctly informed of their desperate plight. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Alexander G. Balian, 48, of Los Angeles accused critics of unfairly 
judging him in hindsight. 
</P>
<P>
He has been before a Navy court-martial since Feb. 10 on charges of failing to 
adequately assist the more than 80 Vietnamese refugees his ship, the amphibious 
transport Dubuque, encountered June 9 as it sailed for the Persian Gulf. 
Thirty-one of the refugees died, and survivors resorted to cannibalism before 
they were rescued by Philippine fishermen June 27 after 37 days at sea, United 
Nations officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Balian said that if he had known the desperate conditions aboard the Vietnamese 
craft, "there is no doubt in my mind I would tow them to my side and embark 
them. That's what I did on two previous occasions." 
</P>
<P>
He said he ordered his executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. Stanley Halter, to 
determine if the refugee boat was seaworthy. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, the report came back 'no engine,' and I surmised they had a good 
sail," Balian said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he was told that "they could make it on their own if we gave them 
food and water," which were provided. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination, Balian insisted he was not responsible for the 
refugees' resorting to cannibalism. 
</P>
<P>
"I am being charged with giving insufficient assistance," he said. "What is 
sufficient assistance? You're saying I should have embarked them. I should have 
embarked them -- on hindsight." 
</P>
<P>
Balian was relieved of command of the Dubuque in August.

The President's warning came hours after Iran recalled its ambassadors from 
Common Market countries today, a day after the 12 European countries decided to 
withdraw their envoys from Tehran to protest the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 
order that Rushdie be killed. Rushdie is the author of "The Satanic Verses," a 
novel that many Muslims consider blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he strongly supports the decision of European governments to recall 
their ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
News Conference Called 
</P>
<P>
The President made his comments at a hurriedly called news conference at the 
White House on the eve of his departure for a five-day Asian trip. 
</P>
<P>
Until today, Bush had been silent on the worldwide controversy over the 
ayatollah's death threat against Rushdie, an Indian-born British citizen who 
now is hiding under police protection. 
</P>
<P>
Many Muslims say Rushdie's book portrays the prophet Mohammed's wives as 
prostitutes and suggests that he -- rather than God -- wrote the Koran, Islam's 
holy book. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that "however offensive that book may be, inciting murder and 
offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the norm of 
civilized behavior. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In the light of Iran's incitement, should any action be taken against American 
interests, the government of Iran can expect to be held accountable," the 
President added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he hoped European nations impose economic sanctions against Iran, as 
the United States did years ago, "They will be discussing that, I'm sure, but I 
don't know where we go from there." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Iranian Parliamentary Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said the 
Europeans' decision to withdraw their diplomats because of Iranian death 
threats against author Rushdie was a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The decision Monday proved that Rushdie's book "The Satanic Verses" was indeed 
a Western plot against Islam, the Iranian news agency IRNA quoted Rafsanjani as 
telling Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Iranian Statement 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that Iranian diplomats 
would be withdrawn from the Common Market for consultations in response. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, it was announced today that some of America's best-known writers 
will read excerpts from "The Satanic Verses" Wednesday at a public 
demonstration of their solidarity with Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
The noon reading was organized by the Freedom-to-Write Program of PEN American 
Center, which represents 2,200 novelists, poets, playwrights, essayists and 
editors. Among those who will take part in the Lower Manhattan reading at the 
Columns auditorium are Susan Sontag, president of the PEN center, Norman 
Mailer, E. L. Doctorow, Joan Didion, Gay Talese, Robert Stone, Larry McMurtry 
and Edward Said, a Palestinian Christian.

The Detroit Symphony Orchestra, facing an effort to block its funding on the 
basis of racism, said today that it hired its second black musician, a bass 
player. 
</P>
<P>
The symphony said Richard Robinson, who has been a part-time musician with the 
orchestra, will join it full-time this fall. Robinson's hiring came after two 
Detroit legislators threatened to block the symphony's annual allocation of 
$1.2 million in state funds. The officials charged that the orchestra, based in 
a predominantly black city, was racist because it has employed only one black 
player for the last 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra had contended that its system of choosing members through "blind" 
auditions, in which players' identities are not revealed, was the fairest way 
to choose musicians. Members of the orchestra agreed to waive the selection 
process so that Robinson, 25, could be hired. State funding has been released 
to the orchestra.

The government freed 50 more detainees today after hunger strikes were halted 
at two prisons, but scores of detainees continued to fast elsewhere and police 
said 20 were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told Parliament he had signed release 
warrants for 50 detainees. About 225 detainees still are refusing food at 
prisons in the southern cities of Durban, Pietermaritzburg and East London, 
their lawyers said. The first wave of hunger strikes began Jan. 23 and involved 
nearly 300 detainees who broke their fast after Vlok promised to review their 
cases and release "a substantial number."

Two-term Florida Democratic Rep. Bill Grant delivered a political gift to 
President Bush at the White House today by joining the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to bring Congressman Grant in here to say how pleased I am that 
he is switching over to become a Republican," Bush said in opening a White 
House news conference with Grant at his side. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, despite Bush's landslide win over Michael S. Dukakis on Nov. 8, 
lost congressional seats to Democrats, who maintain large majorities in the 
House and Senate. With the change, Democrats will hold a 258-to-175 majority in 
the House. There are two vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong Democrat, Grant, 45, had no opposition in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Grant, who is rated a moderate Democrat by the American Conservative Union, 
said he was switching because he can better serve his district "in a working 
partnership, with this President, with this Administration and with this 
party." 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), asked about Grant's defection from the 
majority party, said: "It took me by surprise, but that's everyone's choice. I 
hope he's happy." 
</P>
<P>
His conversion reverses the division of Florida's delegation to Congress, 
giving the state 10 Republicans and nine Democrats.

Hundreds of Central Americans waited quietly in long lines today on the first 
day a new immigration policy was implemented to permit rapid processing of 
requests for political asylum and the immediate detention of those who are 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
A small group of protesters standing nearby decried what they labeled a 
"concentration camp" answer by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to 
the flood of people illegally crossing the Texas-Mexico border to ask the 
federal agency for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the same situation as Germany when Hitler started persecuting the 
Jews," said Laura Sanchez, one of the 16 protesters. 
</P>
<P>
They were gathered outside the barbed-wire fence of the Port Isabel Processing 
Service Center, located in a remote area about 25 miles from Brownsville in 
southernmost Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The INS has set aside 1,100 bed spaces inside the center to jail rejected 
applicants for political asylum pending their appeals or voluntary departure 
for their home countries. Tents will be set up if the numbers exceed the 
available bed spaces in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 extra INS employees were brought to South Texas for 30-day duty to 
help in the new program, which became effective after midnight Monday.

NORTH'S TRIAL OPENS AFTER MANY DELAYS;

Oliver L. North's criminal trial opened today with the prosecutor calling him a 
liar who "places himself above the law" and with North's lawyer defending him 
as a patriotic Marine who obeyed the orders of the nation's highest officials. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor John Keker told the jury that North had lied time and again to his 
President and to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
North's chief defense lawyer countered that the defendant, a former top 
National Security Council aide, worked in a secret world where "he always acted 
with the approval of his superiors; he acted always with the best interests of 
his country." 
</P>
<P>
Thus the two sides squared off for the oft-delayed first trial to come out of 
the Iran-Contra affair, a trial that may take as long as five months to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intense Interest 
</P>
<P>
Nine women and three men chosen as jurors in the case were sworn in by U.S. 
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell at 9:38 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
North followed the opening statements of Keker and chief defense lawyer Brendan 
Sullivan with intense interest. He sat upright during both presentations, 
sometimes looking toward his wife, Betsy, who was in the front row of 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
North is charged with 12 criminal counts, nine of them having to do with 
deceiving Congress and President Ronald Reagan. The three others involve 
charges that he personally profited from the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
A year after it passed the 1984 Boland Amendment banning U.S. military 
assistance to the Contras, Congress received news reports that North was 
secretly raising money for the rebels from foreign countries and private donors 
and providing tactical military advice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Committee Meeting 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Keker said, a House committee met with North in the White House 
seeking the truth about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee looked Oliver North right in the eye and North looked them right 
in the eye and he lied," Keker said. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan countered that North never broke the law, that "he followed the 
instructions of the highest-ranking officials of the United States of America. 
. . . He followed his orders as any Marine Corps officer would."

The Environmental Protection Agency proposed fines of more than $1 million 
against 109 muffler and car repair shops today for installing improper 
emission-control devices on automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said the shops installed cheaper, less effective "two-way" catalytic 
converters on automobiles rather than the "three-way" converters required under 
federal laws to reduce air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The three-way converters control nitrogen oxide emissions in addition to 
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in car exhaust. The two-way converters do not 
adequately control nitrogen oxides, the EPA said.

Zenith Electronics Corp., which announced last week that it was adding workers 
in its troubled television manufacturing division, said today that it earned 
$20.4 million in the fourth quarter and posted its first annual profit since 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter profit, equal to 78 cents a share, was sharply higher than 
the $4.7 million, or 18 cents a share, in the same period in 1987. For the 
year, Zenith earned $11.7 million, rebounding from a three-year losing streak 
that included a $19.1-million loss in 1987. "Although our consumer electronics 
continues to get better, it is still not operating at a satisfactory level," 
Chairman and President Jerry Pearlman told a news conference. The company is 
still seeking a buyer for the entire consumer electronics group.

The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading stock index today plunged from Monday's 
record high, and the dollar gained sharply against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 197.00 points, or 0.61%, closing at 
31,980.08. That was its first closing below the 32,000-yen level since Feb. 14, 
when it ended at 31,982.89. It had set a record high closing of 32,177.08 on 
Monday. The plunge in the index resulted mainly from the dollar's quick rise on 
the foreign exchange market, said an analyst with Nomura Securities, Japan's 
largest brokerage. He also said prospects for a tighter economic policy in the 
United States, possibly leading to higher interest rates, discouraged investors 
from buying stock while awaiting congressional testimony by U.S. Federal 
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan later today.

In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 127.15 yen, up 1.40 yen from

Appalachian State coach Sparky Woods was named the new head football coach at 
South Carolina today, ending a search that began just over two weeks ago after 
the sudden death of Joe Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
"If your goal is to be the best and reach the top, then I think it's here," 
Woods said after being introduced as the school's new head coach at a news 
conference today. 
</P>
<P>
Woods, who was told late Monday afternoon by Athletic Director King Dixon that 
he was the choice to replace Morrison, said he plans to meet with the Gamecock 
players and the assistant coaches left on the staff as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled to be the head coach at the University of South Carolina. I'm 
very sorry that it occurred because of the death of coach Morrison. But I'm 
excited about carrying on with the tradition of winning that he has established 
here," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
University President James B. Holderman said he was impressed with Woods. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's got a fire in his stomach. He's got a lot of enthusiasm," 
Holderman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said the terms of Woods' contract have not been decided but the athletic 
director said he expects it to be a five-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
While Woods was officially introduced at the news conference, his hiring was 
less than a well-kept secret. Several news organizations, including the 
Associated Press and the state's largest newspapers, had already reported that 
Woods would be hired. 
</P>
<P>
Woods guided the I-AA Mountaineers to Southern Conference titles in 1986 and 
1987 and was named the league's coach of the year an unprecedented three 
straight times, beginning in 1985.

The Streak is over. 
</P>
<P>
The Brooklyn College women's basketball team finally won Monday night, ending 
the longest losing streak in NCAA history at 58 games. 
</P>
<P>
"We never believed it was our lot to just lose and lose and lose," coach Molly 
Perdue said after a 60-54 victory at Concordia College. "But we needed to know 
that we could win one." 
</P>
<P>
Brooklyn had not won since Feb. 15, 1987, when it beat Molloy 60-59. The 
Division I Lady Knights were 0-25 last season and are 1-24 this season with two 
games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
None of Brooklyn's players had ever won a game. The Lady Knights have seven 
freshmen, two sophomores and a junior transfer. The drought was the longest in 
any sport in any division of NCAA competition. The University of Dallas, an 
NAIA school, lost 86 consecutive games in men's basketball. Brooklyn's record 
may not last long, however.

CHANCE TO BUY COTO DE CAZA PARCEL DOESN'T PROMPT A LOT OF INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coto de Caza residents have a rare opportunity today as the first to be offered 
a chance to purchase vacant lots in the exclusive development. But so far, the 
occasion has not attracted much of a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Coto de Caza Development Co. officials expected a throng of would-be buyers to 
camp out at its sales office over the weekend for the chance to pay up to 
$435,000 for one of 10 lots alongside the community's golf course. These lots 
are being made available first to existing Coto de Caza homeowners. Later, the 
company will offer 20 others, along with any of the 10 that might remain, to 
the general public. 
</P>
<P>
A line of 10 prospects Friday had dwindled to 5 by Monday. It appeared -- 
unless a crowd assembled overnight -- that a buyer could have skipped the 
camp-out and picked up one of the lots after normal business hours began 
Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what to expect," said Rod Gilliland, a Coto de Caza vice 
president. "If 200 people had been waiting on the lots, we might wonder whether 
we priced it fairly." 
</P>
<P>
The 10 lots to be sold today are priced from $365,000 to $435,000. The highest 
priced is No. 36, a 10,408-square-foot lot near the No. 3 green. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliland, who said the sale of lots to individuals is part of the master plan 
for the up-scale community, said the company had little history to go by in 
trying to determine buyer interest. 
</P>
<P>
Lot sales to individuals are a rarity in Orange County, especially small 
parcels of prime golf-course frontage in an area such as Coto de Caza, which 
includes some of the most expensive homes in the county. Orange County 
developers almost always sell land to builders, who then sell a house and its 
land together. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors and real estate observers said Coto de Caza probably included the sale 
in the master plan to increase interest in its development. "If you're selling 
one lot to an individual you can also get a higher price than if you're selling 
several lots to a developer," said John Karevoll, a spokesman for TRW Real 
Estate Information Services in Colton. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliland and several real estate observers said they could not recall another 
sale of individual parcels of land adjoining a golf course in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
As attractive as owning land next to a golf course might be, the prices 
probably kept many people from taking a second look, Gilliland said. And the 
cost to build a custom house on it means that the total expense would be 
prohibitive for all but a few. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to have any log cabins out there," Gilliland said. "They'll 
spend at least $500,000 to build some very fine houses." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Alderette, a real estate agent and former builder of custom houses, said 
lot owners usually build houses that cost twice as much as the land. "But 
10,000 square feet is too small to build an $800,000 house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The five prospects, who would have to make $25,000 deposits today to secure 
their lots, could not be reached for comment on their plans for the land. Each 
of the prospects had paid surrogates up to $500 to stay over the weekend to 
keep a place in line. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't expect one of them to come out here and spend a cold weekend in the 
rain waiting," said Ken Gilbert, a Honeybaked Ham Co. employee who took time 
off from his job to borrow a friend's Winnebago and wait it out for one of the 
prospective buyers.

TEMPERS IGNITED AS CONFEREES CLAIM HOLOCAUST A HOAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
The Institute for Historical Review, a group that claims the Nazi Holocaust was 
a hoax, ended its 3-day meeting Monday by stirring outrage among residents of 
Huntington Beach's Old World Village, including one Jewish woman who was told 
by a conference participant, "You need the gas chamber!" 
</P>
<P>
Six members of the militant Jewish Defense League showed up with signs to 
picket later in the day when conference participants were holding an impromptu 
news conference at the end of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no physical violence, several conference participants 
shouted racial epithets at the protesters. Witnesses said police took away one 
man in handcuffs after he tried to strike Irv Rubin, national JDL chairman. A 
Huntington Beach police spokesman said late Monday that he could not confirm 
that an arrest was made. 
</P>
<P>
"We were there to make a point," Rubin said. "We want to expose these people to 
the light of the day." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, conference participants exchanged angry words with several 
residents of Old World Village, who said they had no idea the group was meeting 
there until they read about it in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Three plainclothes police officers were keeping an eye on things during the 
meeting, and several conference participants acting as security guards were 
stationed outside the basement of the German Community Church, where the 
meeting was held. 
</P>
<P>
Old World Village is a condominium and commercial development built to resemble 
a Bavarian village where shopkeepers live on the grounds and a homeowners' 
association owns and manages the common grounds. Since 1982, however, the 
development has been embroiled in legal disputes, and it has been in 
receivership for the last 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the animosity generated Monday by the Historical Review conference 
appeared intertwined with the legal disputes, which essentially have pitted the 
owner of the building where the meeting took place against the rest of the 
shopkeepers and homeowners. The building owner agreed to allow the conferees to 
meet without consulting the other village owners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expressions of Anger 
</P>
<P>
But the mere presence of an estimated 200 people attending the Ninth 
International Revisionist Conference, which was forced to move from two Costa 
Mesa hotels after protests from the JDL, also sparked expressions of anger, 
outrage and hurt from many of the village residents. 
</P>
<P>
Lony Hauff, owner of the Rathskeller restaurant, said conference participants 
had insulted his customers, calling them "Jews and traitors." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like this," Hauff said. "We don't need these kind of people here." 
</P>
<P>
"I never was a Nazi, or a Jew," said Gene Pilz, a customer at the restaurant. 
"I never was a traitor." 
</P>
<P>
In one conversation witnessed by a reporter, Georges Theil, a conference 
participant from France, told bridal shop owner Pat Weiss that the Holocaust 
did not happen. 
</P>
<P>
When Weiss told Theil that several of her relatives were killed in Nazi 
concentration camps, he responded that there were no gas chambers and that 
perhaps Weiss' relatives did not disappear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Are a Liar' 
</P>
<P>
"You are a liar!" Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no gas chambers!" Theil shot back. "You need the gas chamber! You 
need the gas chamber!" 
</P>
<P>
Weiss, unable to control her anger, spat on Theil, who then turned to a 
reporter and said, "They are hysterical people here." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Marcellus, director of the Costa Mesa-based Institute for Historical 
Review, said the presence of the conference at the village represented a 
victory for free speech and a defeat for the JDL. 
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the JDL's efforts to stop the meeting, which was attended 
by delegates from South Africa, Sweden, Germany, Japan, France, England, 
Switzerland, Canada and the United States, the group had managed to have a full 
conference "by hopscotching around." 
</P>
<P>
After both the Red Lion Inn and the Holiday Inn in Costa Mesa refused to allow 
the group to meet there, Marcellus said the conference moved to the Huntington 
Beach Inn and, finally, to the village. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why he agreed to rent to the Historical Review, Joseph Bischof, a 
native of Germany who designed the village, said, "Why shouldn't I?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Want to Correct History' 
</P>
<P>
"I know that there is a lot of truth to what they say," Bischof said. "They 
want to correct history. I know that they didn't even have 6 million Jews in 
Europe. How could they have killed that many?" 
</P>
<P>
As for the complaints of the other shop owners, Bischof dismissed them by 
saying, "Some of the store owners are sick." 
</P>
<P>
But Cris Cris, owner of B.M.A. Financial Services in the village, said the 
presence of such a group sends a bad message to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a bad place to have a meeting," he said, "especially the 
connotation with the German village and the Holocaust being a predominately 
German thing. It is in very poor taste." 
</P>
<P>
"If they would have brought (the matter) to the homeowners, it wouldn't be 
here," added his wife, Cathy Cris. "They shouldn't be allowed anywhere, 
particularly here." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss, who was trembling after her encounter with Theil, said that a customer 
who read about the conference in a newspaper called her Monday to cancel a 
wedding gown she was planning to buy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I resent This' 
</P>
<P>
"She said that under no circumstances would she ever set foot in the village 
again," Weiss said. "It makes my skin have goose bumps, having these people 
here. I'm a Jew, and I resent this very, very much." 
</P>
<P>
Village employee Cecelia Baca, her eyes brimming with tears, said that nearly 
all of the relatives of her Polish grandmother, who was Catholic, were killed 
in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't approve of prejudice in the first place," she said. "The fact that 
these people are here, my grandmother is probably turning in her grave." 
</P>
<P>
But such sentiments did not appear to trouble the conference participants, who 
said that anybody opposed to their meeting was guilty of prejudice themselves 
or was ill-informed. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were more fully informed, they would, perhaps, be less upset," said 
Michael Laurence, 38, a technician who had come to the conference from Atlanta, 
Ga. 
</P>
<P>
"The point of this conference is to educate people, and our belief is that if 
people are educated, they will believe as we do and all upset will be 
eliminated," Laurence said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Silly Story' 
</P>
<P>
Conference participant Gerald Domitrovic, an attorney from Wichita, Kan., said 
the "real story" was that people were trying to silence the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The Holocaust is a silly story," he said. "It is silly on its face." 
</P>
<P>
Jurgen Bless, a German Lutheran pastor who was opening up the German Community 
Church as the conference continued in the basement below, said he was not 
bothered by the presence of those who believe the Holocaust did not occur. 
</P>
<P>
"The Holocaust is being taken too far," he said. "And these people are trying 
to set the record straight. And if it is wrong, then the truth will come out. 
What it looks like to me is that someone is afraid of what they have to say. . 
. . I feel everybody should have the right to say what they think." 
</P>
<P>
But Frank Emma, vice president of the homeowners' association and owner of a 
frame shop in the village, said that he and other residents were offended by 
the message that the conference participants bring. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us are hard-working, sincere people," he said. "We don't like Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Michele Weiss, daughter of Pat Weiss, returned to her home above the 
bridal shop and hung the American and the Israeli flag, which pictures the Star 
of David, off the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
"We put it out there because I am not afraid of being Jewish," Pat Weiss said. 
"We are proud to be Jewish. . . . You just can't argue with these people."
