PATRICK HENRY MCMAHON; SAILOR SAVED BY J.F.K. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrick Henry McMahon, 84, the wounded sailor whom John F. Kennedy towed three 
miles to safety after a Japanese warship crushed their patrol-torpedo boat 
during World War II. McMahon was a Machinist Mate 1st Class on PT-109, and 
served under Kennedy, then a 26-year-old lieutenant junior grade and skipper of 
the craft. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 2, 1943, when the crew was patrolling Blackett Strait in the Solomon 
Islands, a Japanese destroyer burst out of the darkness and smashed through 
their boat, slicing it in two and instantly killing two of the 13 crewmen. 
McMahon suffered burns on his face, chest, arms and legs and couldn't swim 
because of the pain. Kennedy put him across his back and kept him there by 
clenching McMahon's life-jacket strap in his teeth. In Encinitas, Calif., on 
Sunday of complications of pneumonia.

BUYING RAILROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I applaud Zane for his position of resurrecting old railroad rights-of-way to 
be used for light-rail transit. There is no better time for the County 
Transportation Commission to purchase these rail lines than now, especially 
when Los Angeles' mounting transportation problems are so obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to buy the offered rail lines now might mean that the city would have 
to purchase land in the future -- and for a much higher price. Los Angeles made 
one of its biggest transportation mistakes by letting go of the Pacific 
Electric Red Cars lines back in the '50s and early '60s. I hope that the County 
Transportation Commission learns from the past so our transportation system 
will be better in the future.

<P>
President Bush's overture toward education in the form of additional funds for 
the Head Start program is indeed appreciated. But what happens when those Head 
Start kids enter a regular classroom that has 36 or 37 other bodies in it? 
</P>
<P>
When 37 Period 5 ninth graders enter my English classroom after lunch, I often 
ponder how much better I could address the students' needs had I 8 or 10 fewer 
of them. The President seeks a 90% graduation rate by the year 2000, a 
first-place finish for American students in the subjects of math and science, 
overall literacy for all Americans and a disciplined learning environment in 
each school. What teacher or citizen would not wish to see those goals 
fulfilled? 
</P>
<P>
But with the total number of elementary and secondary California students 
rising by 140,000 per year and the number of truly qualified teachers on the 
decline, how long will it be before teachers are facing 42 or 44 students each 
period? And what quality of education will these kids be receiving? 
</P>
<P>
Class size is a critical component of the learning environment and the only way 
to reduce class size is with money, be it federal or state, to build more 
classrooms and to hire more teachers. Will the proposed $2 billion be 
well-spent if the products of Head Start end up trampled in a classroom cattle 
herd?

WATER SUPPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reading letters (Jan. 11) from Carl Boronkay of the Metropolitan Water 
District and others on the water shortages in Southern California, it is 
obvious that some of the Great Lakes region's bountiful fresh water should be 
piped to the upper basin states. 
</P>
<P>
This could soften the competition between that area and California for Colorado 
River water. 
</P>
<P>
For decades the Southwest has sold affordable gas and vegetables to the 
Midwest. It has also been a refuge for weaklings who cannot hack the frigid 
winters and muggy summers which cause our verdant landscape. This emigration 
has kept our area from becoming overcrowded. So, watching the Saint Joseph 
River flow past my home, towards Notre Dame du Lac in South Bend, on its way to 
Lake Michigan, I feel that sharing this fresh water is a fair part of the 
solution to the Sunbelt's thirst. 
</P>
<P>
Where steel mills once stood in southeast Chicago could be the wellhead for 
some aqueducts fanning out towards Dallas, Denver and Phoenix. The steel to 
make these aqueducts, from the carcinogenic-plagued Pacific Rim, would keep 
California ports busy. This could be the public works project for the 1990s, 
rivaling the interstate highway system in magnitude, lessening the Sunbelt's 
dependence upon snowfalls in the Rockies and the Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
After all, we are one nation and you should be welcome to some of the water as 
long as you don't forget where you got it.

BUYING RAILROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three cheers for Santa Monica's Mayor Dennis Zane! His commentary on reclaiming 
vital railroad rights-of-way ("A Rare Chance to Right a Wrong of Our Youth," 
California Commentary, Feb. 5) should be required reading for anyone who thinks 
nothing can be done about congestion, noise, and overdevelopment in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Light rail is the quietest, most efficient means of getting around in areas 
where space is scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic through neighborhoods would decrease and the noise that usually 
accompanies it would drop. 
</P>
<P>
To reactivate this right-of-way for transit would not only be a vindication for 
the Red Cars but a crucial link to our fledgling light-rail system. Just think 
of it: You could travel from downtown Los Angeles, or Long Beach, to the 
Coliseum, Sports Arena, USC, Santa Monica, etc., and not have to worry about 
parking! It would be a pleasure riding a smooth, quiet train instead of a 
noisy, bumpy, brake-squealing bus. 
</P>
<P>
We could spend the rest of our lives blaming someone else for taking away our 
beloved streetcars. But it was our parents' responsibility then as it is our 
duty now to make this place liveable through planning and executing an 
efficient transit system.

TAKE BACK LEADERSHIP ROLE ON RIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: CONGRESS MUST ENACT LEGISLATION TO UNDO DAMAGE DONE BY THE SUPREME 
COURT AND REVITALIZE AMERICA'S CIVIL-RIGHTS MOVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE E. LOMAX, Melanie F. Lomax is a civil-rights lawyer and managing 
partner of Lomax &amp; Associates in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The startling political changes that have occurred in East Germany, Eastern 
Europe, the Soviet Union and, now, in long-despaired-of South Africa, represent 
to my mind the greatest simultaneous civil-rights movement the world has ever 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson to be learned is that human beings, regardless of where they are, 
will ultimately demand freedom and other basic rights. It is hoped that these 
tremendous political, social and economic changes will spur our own lagging 
democratic movement and domestic revolution. 
</P>
<P>
It is too easy to be smug and look upon this country as a peerless example of 
democracy in action. However, poverty and injustice are not the hallmarks of 
democracy. Statistics on minorities at all levels of life point to the need for 
continuation of our own civil-rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
America has not successfully addressed the growing gap between the haves and 
the have-nots. We have yet to confront the remaining areas of discrimination in 
our society. To continue to lead the democratic world, we must re-double our 
efforts and commit our resources. 
</P>
<P>
An aggressive Congress is a major component of America's rededication to this 
goal. As the first item on its agenda, Congress must commit itself to undo the 
damage done to the cause of equality by the U.S. Supreme Court in its last 
term. Bipartisan congressional leadership has undertaken to do that with a 
major new civil-rights bill. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Rights Act of 1990 seeks to remove the tremendous obstacles and 
burdens that several Supreme Court decisions imposed on the laws related to job 
discrimination. The bill places the burden of proof on the employer, provides 
greater protection against racial harassment on the job and protects against 
retroactive changes to court-approved affirmative-action plans. It would go a 
long way toward restoring the commitments regarding job discrimination made to 
minorities and women in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and in a 1966 
amendment.. 
</P>
<P>
Both congressional and civil-rights leaders across the country recognize that 
the Supreme Court, with its new conservative majority, is a tremendous threat 
to women, minorities and the poor. This majority has served notice that it has 
little or no regard for the clear, unmistakable discrimination that many 
continue to face. It is equally clear that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor will not 
be a voice for women's rights or any other minority position. She is an "old 
boy" in the truest meaning of the phrase. 
</P>
<P>
The 1960s in this country served as the historical precedent for Congress 
acting to address injustice. It is only when the people insist on change, as 
they did then and as they have done in other countries recently, that it comes 
about. 
</P>
<P>
I was an early prodder and beneficiary of an activist Congress. When I was 10, 
my mother announced that we were going to join the civil rights movement. As a 
writer, she felt she must witness and record the greatest social movement of 
her lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
We traveled by automobile, my five brothers and sisters, mother and I. There 
were to be six trips between 1960 and 1965. For all but the last, we had to 
reroute our trips to include those cities that had Negro motels and restaurants 
because we could not stay, or be served, at any other facility. Only in 1964, 
after Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, did unrestricted and fully 
accessible public accommodations become the law of the land, and we would map a 
trip without regard to the four or five black motels and restaurants between 
California and Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990s show every indication of being a startling decade. Among the most 
important ways Congress can provide justice in America is to pass the Civil 
Rights Act of 1990, and insist on the recognition of the new global realities 
by making huge cuts in the defense budget, particularly in the acquisition of 
weapons systems. These funds can then be invested in human beings; laws 
designed to provide for the rights and betterment of our citizens mean little 
without resources. 
</P>
<P>
Congress must help establish the national consensus necessary to divert our 
economic resources from weapons and armies to job training, shelter, education, 
health and child care. The lesson for America in all we have observed lately is 
that we must get in line with the worldwide democratic movement and provide 
maximum freedom and opportunity for its own.

PUBLIC HOUSING: ASSIGNING SOCIAL WORKERS TO 'THE PROJECTS' MAY GO A LONG WAY 
TOWARD PROVIDING SERVICES TO THOSE WHO NEED MORE THAN JUST A ROOF OVER THEIR 
HEADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MADELEINE R. STONER, Madeleine R. Stoner is an associate professor at the 
USC School of Social Work. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As city planners and architects across the United States focus on how to 
provide more low-income housing, they repeatedly confront the specter of large 
public housing projects that never fulfilled their purpose or promise. All too 
often, what seemed like perfectly good buildings on the outside had become 
walled ghettos for gangs, drugs and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is about to implement some pioneering measures to remedy that sort 
of thing and, perhaps, to see that it is not repeated here anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Los Angeles City Housing Authority announced plans to locate 
social services and social workers in public housing projects. This proposal 
merits careful attention and support from all who are concerned about some of 
today's most pressing social problems. 
</P>
<P>
One of the bitter ironies of our time is that a significant portion of homeless 
people are alumni, as it were, of public housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Housing Act of 1949 enunciated the goal of a decent home and 
suitable environment for every American family. But it has taken all these 
years to drive home the lesson that achieving that goal involves more than 
simply handing people four walls, flooring and a roof and leaving them to fend 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates for public housing are, by definition, people lacking some of the 
resources necessary to cope with the rough-and-tumble of the market system. And 
this nearly always involves more than just rent money. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants for public housing, most often women on public assistance, usually 
carry some baggage of woe, past or present -- teen-age pregnancy, domestic 
violence and abuse, divorce and desertion, drug and alcohol addiction. The 
growing number of homeless families come from among these women. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to roofs over their heads, families in public housing need day-care 
facilities, job counseling, guidance in financial planning and assistance in 
transportation. These are necessary adjuncts if such families are to stabilize 
their lives and eventually leave the welfare rolls. Both adults and children 
need recreation programs. There need to be services or arrangements for 
excluding gang violence, drug trafficking and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of the whole problem is a longstanding lack of coordination 
between the Department of Housing and Urban Development and federal welfare 
programs. Public housing projects have been treated as a substitute for 
adequate welfare payments. The result has been a shortfall on both ends -- 
inadequate public housing and insufficient outlays to cover both shelter and 
the support services necessary to get people off welfare. 
</P>
<P>
In some communities across the country, public housing tenants, by remarkable 
bootstrap efforts, have brought about the needed social services. The National 
Council of Neighborhood Women in Brooklyn is an example of such effort. But 
self-help know-how is not universally on tap. In too many projects, the housing 
has ended up as squalid, unlivable magnets of disorder and crime, suitable only 
for tearing down. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers assigned to public housing projects should not be seen as 
vigilantes on a mission of ferreting out anti-social elements. They should be 
there to provide counseling and referrals to a range of health and mental 
health agencies, to help parents care for and educate their children 
effectively, to organize after-school activities for children and adolescents 
and to start support groups for young and old. Their presence among the most 
"high-risk" people in our city offers a singular opportunity for early 
intervention and possible prevention of destructive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
If the social worker's role is seen as primarily guiding and assisting 
residents in improving their lives and cultivating a constructive environment, 
the Los Angeles plan can serve as a model for an important, much-needed advance 
toward reversing the decline in low-income housing.

ESTONIA: ON THE VERGE OF FREE ELECTIONS UNSANCTIONED BY MOSCOW, THIS BALTIC 
STATE IS FAST MAKING ITSELF INDEPENDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REIN TAAGEPERA, Rein Taagepera is a professor of social science at UC Irvine 
and a member of the general committee of the Citizens' Committees of the 
Republic of Estonia. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the many odd happenings in Eastern Europe, the nearing elections of the 
Estonian Congress rank with the strangest. Here's a country that Moscow still 
considers a part of the Soviet Union, yet its brash Citizens' Committees are 
preparing for non-Soviet elections Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
These will be full-fledged general elections that bypass the entire Soviet 
administrative structure and affirm the continued existence of the Republic of 
Estonia that Josef Stalin occupied and annexed 49 years ago. And Moscow, with 
150,000 troops stationed in Estonia, has let these open preparations proceed 
unhindered. The goal of the Estonian Congress will be to start talks with 
Moscow for withdrawal of Soviet occupation forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizens' Committees were started a year ago by the Estonian Heritage 
Society, the National Independence Party and the Christian Union. The parties 
insisted that the committees be formed locally and not by emissaries from the 
capital. One is reminded of the "committees of correspondence" that prepared 
the ground for independence in the American colonies. 
</P>
<P>
The Estonian committees spread their message person-to-person, circumventing an 
information blockade by the official Soviet media in Estonia. They weathered 
doubts and criticism by the much better-organized but more cautiously reformist 
Popular Front. The ruling Communist Party of Estonia first tried silence, then 
blistering attacks, but both failed. In November, the local committees formed a 
nationwide general committee led by Tunne Kelam, ideological leader of the 
Independence Party, with Heritage Society leader Trivimi Velliste as vice 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
By January the committees had registered more than half of the 1 million people 
who qualify as citizens of the Republic of Estonia. There are also half a 
million post-occupation settlers, mainly Russians, who are illegal immigrants 
in the eyes of the Republic of Estonia. The Citizens' Committees are 
registering them, too, but only as applicants for citizenship, eligible to 
elect non-voting delegates to the Estonian Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Prewar Russian residents of Estonia and their descendants qualify as citizens, 
while later immigrants do not, even if they are ethnically Estonian. Having 
left Estonia as a child in 1944, I qualified. When visiting Estonia in August, 
I registered at a booth set up in front of what used to be my kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
Setting up the practical machinery for nationwide elections is a demanding task 
even for a government. To do so while braving an administration in complete 
command of communication, transport and finances might look hopeless. Yet the 
structure is now in place. About 1,200 candidates are running for 464 seats in 
110 multi-seat districts. Estonian exile organizations in the West will select 
35 more delegates. 
</P>
<P>
As election plans took shape, the previously hesitant popular mood shifted 
decisively, and the Popular Front jumped on the candidate bandwagon. The 
Communist Party of Estonia is considering doing the same, and several Soviet 
Estonian government leaders are poised to jump. Soviet Estonia's head of state, 
Arnold Ruutel, has declared that "the Estonian Congress is a fact of political 
life" and represents a "unique citizens' initiative reflecting the will of the 
Estonian people." 
</P>
<P>
Elections for the Estonian Supreme Soviet are scheduled for March 18. This new 
Supreme Soviet may never come to be, once the Estonian Congress is in place, 
but if it materializes, it will also be independence-minded. That leaves Moscow 
with two options (apart from a disastrous military suppression): agree that the 
Republic of Estonia is occupied territory from which Soviet troops should be 
withdrawn, or face a declaration of secession by "Soviet Estonia" (which would 
set a precedent for all other Soviet republics). It will be in Moscow's 
interest to deal with the Estonian Congress, blaming Stalin for the occupation 
and illegal annexation. 
</P>
<P>
The groundwork for such an approach was laid when the Moscow Supreme Soviet 
voided the Hitler-Stalin pact that, among other things, gave Estonia to Stalin. 
Mikhail Gorbachev may even have already decided to let the Baltic states go, 
which would explain why he has not acted against Estonia's do-it-yourself 
elections.

NICARAGUA: SUNDAY'S VOTE WILL BE HISTORIC, BUT THE ECONOMIC DISASTER WON'T 
CHANGE. ONE REAL NEED IS SPEEDY NORMALIZATION OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH THE 
VICTOR.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday's election is of historic importance for the future of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Whether opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro is elected or President Daniel 
Ortega reconfirmed, the new government will enjoy the legitimacy conferred by 
the vote and by international recognition. 
</P>
<P>
The winner, however, will face two central problems: lingering civil conflict 
and economic chaos. Neither the Sandinistas nor the United Nicaraguan 
Opposition (UNO) has exhibited the vision necessary to successfully resolve 
these problems. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's economy has been reduced to subsistance levels. Exports have 
dropped to 20% of 1978 levels, unemployment has reached 30% of the working-age 
population and inflation is unmeasurable. These indicators are a formidable 
source of political dissatisfaction. But the opposition's message has been lost 
in symbolism and it has not been able to to develop an appealing electoral 
platform. Its campaign has suffered from divisions and a lack of leadership and 
organizational capacity. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, UNO has resembled the opposition in South Korea during its 
last election, in which divisions in the opposition facilitated the victory of 
the governing party. Persistent factionalism in the opposition is making it 
probable that Ortega will be reconfirmed, but not because Nicaraguans are 
better off after 10 years of revolution or because Sandinism is the most 
popular movement. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, dissatisfaction and the search for an alternative have turned out 
large crowds for opposition rallies, united in the chant "This time they go." 
The spontaneous support of the people seems less the result of the appeal of 
UNO's campaign and electoral program than a referendum against Sandinista rule. 
If economic issues and the urgency for change carry the election, Chamorro 
could win. If nationalism and party organization are the key, Ortega benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's primary goal is to remain in power. The Sandinista's ideological 
project has stalled, and the foreign subsidies that financed their 
revolutionary experiments are no longer forthcoming. If he is defeated, 
invalidating the election is not a realistic option. Such an act could easily 
engender a crisis similar to those that ended the regimes of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning the task of reconstruction will require a national accord. If UNO 
wins, its 14 constituent parties must form a coherent coalition without 
interference from the United States. If the Sandinista front wins, it cannot 
continue to treat the opposition as a means of legitimizing its power or 
presume that it has been handed a mandate to continue promoting Sandinista 
political projects. 
</P>
<P>
My country is exhausted by conflict, and international expectations awakened by 
the revolution against Anastasio Somoza in 1979 have been frittered away. 
Nicaragua needs political openness, a climate of confidence, management skills 
and foreign assistance. 
</P>
<P>
During the long campaign, the Bush Administration acts like an accountant, 
letting others take the risks while being content with recording profits and 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
Its policy has been to hope for a UNO victory, which would be a cheap solution 
to the Nicaragua problem. Now, if the opposition does not win, what are the 
alternatives for U.S. policy? Continuation of the war is not a real 
possibility, despite the fact that several thousand resistance combatants are 
inside Nicaragua. No country in the region is willing to risk getting involved, 
given the unreliability of U.S. policy. And given the United States' new 
relationship to the Soviet Union, there is simply no political will to re-start 
the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of who wins this election, the United States has the possibility of 
entering a new phase of relations with Nicaragua. Normalization is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy must be clearly defined to avoid polarization of domestic debate 
and enhance the democratic process in Nicaragua. Resolving the trade embargo 
would help economic recovery, and providing economic aid for the safe return 
and relocation of Nicaraguans would help national reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's foreign policy has been one of impeccable pragmatism. 
In the case of Nicaragua, its reluctance to define its policy seems the result 
of internal political calculations. Until now, the silence of the 
Administration has been justified for reasons of political prudence. Tomorrow 
that silence may be a lost opportunity.

PEOPLE: NAMING OF BECHTEL EXEC EASES CRISIS FOR 'CHUNNEL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Neerhout, executive vice president of Bechtel, the giant construction firm 
based in San Francisco, was appointed liaison between feuding developers and 
builders of the rail tunnel that will link Britain and France under the Channel 
-- a mammoth project threatened by cash disputes and personality clashes. 
</P>
<P>
It will be Neerhout's job to act as a buffer between the developers' abrasive 
chief executive, Alastair Morton of Eurotunnel, and manage their contract with 
the builders, Transmanche Link (TML), Reuters reported from London. 
</P>
<P>
His appointment broke a deadlock in which Eurotunnel's bankers refused to 
advance more money until the two sides settled their differences. 
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel said Neerhout's appointment cleared the way now for fresh bank 
lending to keep diggers working on the 30-mile twin-track project, which is 
supposed to be completed in mid-1993.

SOCIETY: USO RECEIVES HEARTFELT APPRECIATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Some may regard the new San Diego Convention Center as solid proof that the 
city has outgrown its reputation as a sleepy Navy town, but the long line of 
white sedans with Navy plates and enlisted drivers that waited outside the 
center Saturday night made it clear that, wide awake or not, this city remains 
very much a Navy town. 
</P>
<P>
An even dozen admirals, a pair of Marine Corps major generals and sufficient 
Navy captains to command a convoy across the seven seas joined more than 300 
civilian supporters in the center's ballroom for "Give Your Heart to the USO." 
The event celebrated the 50th anniversary of United Service Organizations, the 
civilian-operated outfit known simply as the USO to several generations of 
servicemen and servicewomen. The organization invited a number of active 
enlisted personnel to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Adm. Jack Fetterman, commander of naval air forces in the Pacific and the 
ranking naval officer in San Diego, and Adm. Leon Edney, vice chief of naval 
operations, headed a list of active and retired brass that also included Marine 
Major Gen. John Mahoney, Marine Major Gen. Don Fulham and San Diego's 
astronaut-in-residence, retired Capt. Wally Schirra. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Rear Adm. Herbert Stoecklein, president of the local USO Council and 
gala co-chairman, said that "Give Your Heart to the USO" was the first of what 
the organization intends to be an annual fund-raiser. Proceeds from the 
inaugural benefit, 
</P>
<P>
expected to reach about $40,000, are earmarked for the $60,000 cost of opening 
and staffing the new USO facility at Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The event came a few days late to qualify for Valentine's Day status, and the 
decor, which consisted of red and white carnation centerpieces and a few lacy 
hearts floating above the bandstand, was suitably restrained. In the immense 
and cavernous spaces offered by the convention center, most decor quickly 
becomes lost anyway, although the giant red, white and blue USO banner, 
borrowed from the head office in Washington, made a powerful statement. 
</P>
<P>
Several guests who remembered some of the big, military-themed parties given 
during World War II said that the mood somehow captured the brisk and 
efficiently hopeful tone of that era's entertainments. 
</P>
<P>
When the Dick Braun Orchestra played "Anchors Aweigh" the gala seemed almost a 
revival of an earlier age in San Diego, and this impression was highlighted by 
the party's location in the city's newest public building. But event organizers 
said they chose the center simply because it is a neighbor of the USO on Harbor 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"After putting up with the years of construction it took to put up this 
building, we had to come party here," said one USO staffer. 
</P>
<P>
Servicemen make about 200,000 visits a year to the Harbor Drive USO, which in 
addition to offering a social setting provides such services as finding free 
housing for families relocated by emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The military, perhaps because it likes a good parade, seems very fond of 
dancing, and most guests took the floor repeatedly between the several courses 
of a dinner that featured chilled shellfish remoulade, tournedos Bordelaise and 
pastry swans. After the meal, the band briefly retired while KSDO radio 
announcer Ron Reina conducted a live auction that contributed several thousand 
dollars to the event's proceeds; among the items were a "Love Boat" cruise to 
Mexico and a pair of wooden duck decoys hand-carved by Rear Adm. Jack Adams. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included retired Rear Adm. Bruce Boland, Eleanor and Art 
Herzman, Morris Wax, Rachel and Judson Grosvenor, Sharon and Tim Considine, 
Cathy and Nicholas Monroe, Fern and Robert Murphy, Carol and retired Vice Adm. 
Harry Schrader, Jan and Mike Madigan, Martha Carpenter, Jane Stoecklein, Betty 
and Cushman Dow, Shirley and retired Rear Adm. David Rubel, and Loretta 
Bonvouloir. 
</P>
<P>
The carefully plotted geometry of the annual Women of Dedication luncheon 
encompasses, within its generous angles, just about every charitable and social 
service organization in the county, and was symbolized at Thursday's "Silver 
Jubilee" luncheon at the San Diego Marriott by the silver boxes that centered 
every table. 
</P>
<P>
The day saw 15 women added to the roster of Women of Dedication, which in its 
25 years has developed into a reliable "Who's Who" of the county's volunteers. 
More than 300 women now claim membership in this group. 
</P>
<P>
The event ranks as the major annual fund-raiser given by the Women's Auxiliary 
to the Salvation Army Door of Hope and benefits maternity care, scholarship, 
and drug- and child-abuse prevention programs. But more than that, it has 
become a February tradition at which volunteers turn out to congratulate their 
own. As a result, a sold-out attendance of 940 jammed the ballroom Thursday, a 
turnout that Chairwoman Betty Hubbard described as "thrilling and exciting." 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to see women who have given so much to the community acknowledged," 
said Maj. Richard Love, county coordinator for the Salvation Army. "The Women 
of Dedication deserve their name, because they do a spectacular job." 
</P>
<P>
The Silver Jubilee proceeded according to the pattern established over the 
years, with the lunch of dilled salmon and chocolate tulips preceding the 
formal march of the honorees. A fashion presentation by La Jolla's Capriccio 
concluded the event. 
</P>
<P>
The women walked in turn down the long runway while Channel 10 news anchor 
Carol LeBeau read each one's civic resume. These walks can be amusing when, as 
frequently happens, the male escorts -- husbands, sons or family friends -- 
attempt to gallop down the ramp. A pre-event pep talk obviated that difficulty 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Letha H. Brown, president of the board of trustees of the San Diego Center for 
Children, led the procession. Following were Betty Byrnes, immediate past 
chairwoman of the National Coucil of Business and Professional Women; Mary-Lynn 
Deddeh, board chairwoman of the Lamb's Players Theater; Ruth Gonsalves, past 
president of the Social Service Auxiliary; Zee Griffith, president of Women 
Incorporated; Mary-Em Howard, vice president of Alpha Phi Sorority; Betty 
McElfresh, past president of the San Diego Optometric Auxiliary, and Mary 
McGregor, vice president of the Friends of the Library Board at the University 
of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Virginia McMonagle, director of Constituent Relations at USD and a board 
member of an orphanage in Haiti, was followed by Helen Monroe, the executive 
director of the San Diego Community Foundation; Sandra Pay, past board 
president of the San Diego Opera; Mitch Pflugh, past president of the Junior 
League of San Diego.

ARCHITECTURE: S.D. FOCUS TURNS GREENER UNDER LANDSCAPE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The greening of San Diego is about to pick up speed. 
</P>
<P>
For too long in San Diego, landscaping has been an afterthought, if a thought 
at all. After Kate Sessions, the mother of San Diego horticulture, died in 
1940, no one stepped in to push for landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Ed Malone once remarked, quite rightly, that landscaping has a 
greater overall impact than architecture. When plants mature, they screen and 
soften the impact of buildings. For pedestrians and motorists, plants modulate 
the experience of moving along city sidewalks and streets. 
</P>
<P>
Now, through the efforts of city officials and concerned San Diegans, 
landscaping is once again getting the attention it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
The city is gearing up to better carry out a 1986 ordinance and an accompanying 
manual spelling out how new projects must be landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Broughton was hired in December as principal landscape architect, 
replacing Tom Story, a guiding force in drafting and implementing the 
ordinance. (Story is now deputy director of city planning.) 
</P>
<P>
Soon, nine new landscape experts will be added to the current staff of five, 
augmenting Broughton's ability to see that landscaping on new commercial and 
multifamily residential projects gets as much attention as architecture. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, San Diego created a position of principal landscape architect to 
oversee the new landscape ordinance passed earlier that year. 
</P>
<P>
The private sector is also lending a hand. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of single-family homes, which are not covered by the ordinance, are 
being enlightened by such private groups as People for Trees. Formed early last 
year, the organization has already helped several neighborhoods plant trees 
along streets. 
</P>
<P>
Sessions, who for years operated a huge nursery at Sixth Avenue and Upas Street 
on the edge of Balboa Park, was single-handedly responsible for many of the 
trees (especially palms) that are such a large part of San Diego's character. 
She was the city's first proponent of palms, planting hundreds and hundreds, 
including the Cocos plumosas along 6th venue, between Upas and Date streets, 
and at Horton Plaza park downtown. 
</P>
<P>
But as San Diego rapidly grew in the '70s and '80s, and as city funds for 
landscaping public rights-of-way dwindled, neighborhoods suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some streets are lined with large old trees, which add a kind of 
friendliness and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
Far more, however, are lined with concrete sidewalks, driveways and other cold, 
harsh elements. Entire neighborhoods, on the edge of Point Loma, for example, 
have coaxed gravel or painted concrete front yards into an art form. 
</P>
<P>
One trend that prompted the new law was the tendency for large, desolate 
apartment complexes to replace small, single-family homes -- and their 
accompanying front gardens -- in many neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Already, according to Story, the ordinance has led to improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"What was happening in the Mid-City area (including Normal Heights, Kensington 
and portions of East San Diego) was that homes were being bought up, leveled 
and replaced with a six- or eight-plex," Story said. "They were filling the 
entire lot, except for the required setbacks, and putting all the parking right 
up front by the streets. Front yards became garages and concrete driveways for 
two- or three-story buildings. If there was enough density, they also put 
parking on the back sides of the buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Under the landscaping ordinance, such "street yards" must now be 80% 
landscaped, precluding the parking lot syndrome. Builders have had to tuck the 
rest of their parking behind or beneath buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also requires a minimum of landscaping in front of commercial 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the ordinance and manual have improved new projects. 
</P>
<P>
On Sports Arena Boulevard across from the Sports Arena in San Diego, a shopping 
complex changed owners two years ago and was remodeled, adding a new Home Depot 
store and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Home Depot opened, existing landscaping was kept, but we had them add 
a lot more trees," Story said. "People have mentioned how good the quality of 
the development is now." 
</P>
<P>
In front of the mall, Sports Arena Boulevard is now lined with carrotwood 
trees. Peppermint eucalyptus and evergreen pear trees break up the monotony of 
the parking lots. Median strips are planted with such low water-use shrubs as 
India hawthorn and natal plum. Grass, known for its thirst, is used sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
Besides specifying both the quality and quantity of landscaping for a variety 
of projects, the ordinance details plant materials that conserve water and 
resist fire. One goal is to encourage the use of drought-tolerant ground covers 
in lieu of lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Native vegetation is to be retained where possible. Irrigation systems must 
meet strict standards, including the use of moisture sensors to minimize water 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
But city rules alone won't make for a more beautiful San Diego, especially in 
older residential neighborhoods, where new development governed by the 
ordinance is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing this, and knowing that there's no city money available for landscaping 
these streets, a group of San Diegans led by John and Ann Richards of Ocean 
Beach has banded together, calling itself People for Trees. 
</P>
<P>
Story has been a member from the beginning. The organization tries to join 
needy neighborhoods with corporate donors, with advice on tree selection 
available through the city's Planning and Park and Recreation departments. 
</P>
<P>
People for Trees coordinated the planting last spring of 50 fern pines on 
Waring Road, just north of Interstate 8 near Mission Valley, where several 
large ash trees had been removed after their roots began to destroy sidewalks. 
The trees were donated by Kaiser Permanente. 
</P>
<P>
All told, People for Trees has supervised the planting of 2,000 trees along 
streets, and at schools and other public places. This year, the organization 
will plant at least 1,400 more trees, with the help of a $42,000 state grant 
for street trees awarded last fall. 
</P>
<P>
In Southeast San Diego, Project First Class, started five years ago by 
then-City Councilman William Jones, is aimed at neighborhood improvements, 
including the installation of street trees purchased with federal money 
channeled through the city of San Diego. So far, 65 trees have been planted in 
and around Memorial Park, and five at Martin Luther King Jr. Park. 
</P>
<P>
The city is encouraging these efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Led by People for Trees, the city is adopting a citywide tree-planting goal 
and policy statement," Broughton said. 
</P>
<P>
With state Arbor Day coming March 7, and national Arbor Day on April 28, it's a 
good time to think about trees. You can contact People for Trees at 231-3713

ADDRESSING PROBLEMS IN KINDERGARTEN; 
</P>
<P>
BEHAVIOR: STUDIES SHOW EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS CAN START EARLY. A VOLUNTEER PROGRAM 
REACHES OUT TO CHILDREN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING SPECIAL NEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
They are small problems now, the kinds that often get chalked up to being "just 
a stage." 
</P>
<P>
But to an increasing number of counselors, teachers and psychologists, some 
common behavioral characteristics in kindergarten-age children -- including 
aggression, tearfulness or reluctance to play with other children -- can be 
warning signals of problems to come. 
</P>
<P>
Many recent studies have looked at reasons children drop out of school, "and 
one of the things they found is that a lot of problems could be traced back to 
kindergarten," said Alison McAlpine, director of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's Kindergarten Intervention Program (KIP). 
</P>
<P>
"The thinking until now has been that kids would eventually outgrow certain 
adjustment difficulties," McAlpine said. "Now we're seeing that it isn't 
necessarily so." 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago KIP was begun in a handful of elementary schools to reach out 
to children identified by teachers as needing special attention, but who have 
not yet reached a point where counseling has become necessary. Under the 
program, volunteers with the district's school mental health office go into 
classrooms and work with at-risk students in small groups or one-on-one. The 
goal, McAlpine said, has been to help children with adjustment problems feel 
good about themselves, and thus their ability to succeed in school. 
</P>

"When you have 33 children in your class, even if you gave 120% of yourself, it 
still wouldn't be enough to reach the children who need that extra bit of 
attention," said Tobi Rosen, a kindergarten teacher at Erwin Street School in 
Van Nuys for the last 20 years who was one of the first teachers in the San 
Fernando Valley to implement the program. "The children get that extra bit of 
confidence from the volunteers, and the feeling that someone really cares." 
</P>
<P>
Although only a few schools took advantage of the program a few years ago, 
McAlpine said, 44 elementary schools in the Valley now have volunteers who work 
in kindergarten classrooms. Since receiving a federal grant two years ago, 
McAlpine said, the KIP program, which is affiliated with a similar program at 
UCLA, is being expanded into first-grade classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been able to follow some of the kids into about fifth grade, and there 
have been good results," she said, adding that UCLA is doing follow-up studies 
to determine the program's effectiveness. "Although it's difficult to say now 
what would have happened if there had been no intervention, many of those 
children who are identified as being at-risk in kindergarten are doing well." 
</P>
<P>
KIP, which McAlpine said was modeled after a similar program in New York, has 
been praised by psychologists. Florence Bienenfeld, a former kindergarten and 
educational consultant in Pacific Palisades who holds a doctorate in marriage 
and family counseling, said, "It's so good to see that schools are willing to 
put money into a preventive program like this, instead of into a mop-up program 
for dropouts after the fact. Prevention really is the key for these kids." 
</P>
<P>
The program, however, actually costs schools nothing and is an inexpensive 
solution for the district, McAlpine said, since it relies solely on trained 
volunteers. Many college students and senior citizens are KIP volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one senior citizen volunteer who was in a wheelchair," Rosen said. "He 
loved the children, but they also really loved him." 
</P>
<P>
Children, though, aren't the only ones who receive assistance from the program. 
Parenting workshops, which are held two times at the onset at each elementary 
school involved with the program, give parents the chance to talk about 
problems they are encountering, as well as to receive advice from the school 
mental health staff. Interpreters are provided for Spanish-speaking parents. 
</P>
<P>
At El Oro Way Elementary School in Granada Hills, 16 mothers recently pulled 
their chairs into a circle in the school's auditorium to talk about what many 
describe as daily battles with their kids. Topics range from aggressive 
behavior and sibling rivalry, to getting children into bed at night or up in 
the morning. 
</P>
<P>
For most parents, the mere mention of aggression hit a nerve. Each had a story 
to tell about angry or hostile behavior and how they had dealt with it. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Moreno, the mother of four children and also an assistant third-grade 
teacher, told the group that she was hospitalized two years ago for several 
days after undergoing emergency surgery. Frightened and unable to understand 
why his mother had left so suddenly, Moreno's son, now 6, began taking out his 
feelings of anger on his baby sister. 
</P>
<P>
"He was blaming the baby for my health problems," Moreno said. "I kept telling 
him I didn't like the behavior with his sister and that I wouldn't tolerate it, 
but it wasn't working." 
</P>
<P>
She began to see a positive effect, Moreno told the group, after she set aside 
a specific amount of "special time" each day with her son. During the 10 or 15 
minutes they spent together after dinner, she said, "He knew that he didn't 
need to compete at all for my attention and that it was our time together. It 
took him two years, but I think he knows now that I'm not going away." 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the group shared similar experiences with aggressive behavior 
in their children, as well as the benefits of giving children -- especially 
ones with siblings -- individualized attention each day. 
</P>
<P>
McAlpine, who lead the group along with two other staff members from KIP, 
pointed out another positive aspect. 
</P>
<P>
"As every mother knows, there are some times when you simply are too busy to 
stop everything and give your full attention to what a child is saying," she 
said. "Instead of saying, 'Not now,' though, you can say, 'I want to hear this, 
but I'm very busy right now. Can you hang onto it and share it with me at our 
special time?' " 
</P>
<P>
But, as most parents at the meeting attested, competition with siblings isn't 
the only source of aggression with young children. Several parents voiced their 
concerns over the effects of too much television and the difficulties they 
encountered when they attempted to control what shows their children watched. 
</P>
<P>
"My son has been punching a lot, and so he's no longer allowed to watch 
'America's Most Wanted' or other violent shows," one mother said. "I don't know 
whether that will help, though." 
</P>
<P>
In typical support-group fashion, several mothers offered other suggestions for 
helping the boy deal with pent-up anger or frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe you should try putting a punching bag in the garage," said another 
mother. "Let him get it all out." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Fischette, on-site coordinator with KIP, said she gave her son karate 
lessons when he began acting aggressively. Instead of becoming more violent, 
she said, the aggression actually stopped. "I asked him why he stopped, and he 
said, 'Because now I know I don't have to fight. I know that I could.' It 
helped him channel energy." 
</P>
<P>
The parenting workshops, though, are meant to be more than just an emotional 
swap meet. With the help of school mental health professionals who interject 
advice frequently during the sessions, parents learn about the developmental 
characteristics of children and ways to promote positive social adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
McAlpine and other staff members encourage parents to use behavior modification 
techniques with their children, instead of putting themselves in what they say 
often amounts to exhausting, repetitive power struggles. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we get stuck by thinking, 'By God, I'm going to hang in there and 
keep punishing him when the undesirable behavior comes up,' " McAlpine said to 
the mothers, when the issue of consistency arose. "If something isn't working, 
try something else," she advised. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best ways to change unwanted behavior with young children is with a 
technique called charting, according to Bobbie Ozar, a kindergarten consultant 
with KIP who attended the meeting. Parents sit down with a child and define in 
clear terms what behavior they want to eliminate -- whether it is "yelling" or 
"hitting your brother." They then tell the child that, for each day the 
behavior stops, the child will receive a star on a chart. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of one or two weeks -- any longer, Ozar said, and the child loses 
interest -- a reward is given to the child. 
</P>
<P>
"Does that work with getting a kid to wake up in the morning?" one parent 
asked, eliciting immediate groans of familiarity from the group. "No matter 
what I do, it's always, 'Five more minutes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Moreno said she had success trying a somewhat more creative approach than 
nagging. At the suggestion of a friend, Moreno said she went about her morning 
routine after her son insisted on "just another few minutes" in bed. When he 
finally woke up and realized how late he was for school, Moreno said she told 
him to keep his pajamas on all day and stay in bed. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the last time he did it," she said. "Now when I say to get up, he's 
up." 
</P>
<P>
McAlpine said she applauds such creative approaches. She recalled one mother at 
another group who hadn't been able to stop her young children from fighting in 
front of the television. After two warnings the mother sent her children into 
their rooms and then proceeded to sit on the couch and watch cartoons with the 
volume turned up high. 
</P>
<P>
"She sat there and laughed and laughed for them to hear her, just as though she 
was having the greatest time," McAlpine said. "Instead of just being sent to 
their rooms, they realized what they were missing out on because of their 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's that kind of approach that can do wonders to change behavior," she said. 
"Parents just need to learn that they have more tools available to them than 
they may know."

<P>
OUT OF WORK: AS THE STROH BREWERY CLOSES, THREE LAID-OFF EMPLOYEES SHARE THEIR 
PLANS AND HOPES FOR A MORE STABLE FUTURE.

Tomorrow, the last 670,000 bottles of beer will pass rapidly through the 
assembly line. They will be capped and labeled, ready for shipment to 
wholesalers from Oregon to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the last employees at the Stroh Brewery Co. plant in Van Nuys will 
prepare for their own departure. Tomorrow is the final day of work for most of 
the facility's 390 hourly and salaried workers. After 36 years, the plant, on 
Woodman Avenue, several blocks north of Sherman Way, is shutting down. 
</P>
<P>
George Kuehn, a Stroh senior vice president in Detroit, said the company blames 
the closing on its declining market share -- Anheuser-Busch and Miller dominate 
the industry. "The beer industry is relatively flat in terms of volume growth," 
Kuehn said. "Not everyone can grow." 
</P>
<P>
Of the company's seven plants, Kuehn said, the Van Nuys facility proved to be 
most expendable because it was producing at only half its capacity. 
</P>
<P>
For employees, both union and management, the new life many never expected will 
now begin. Some have worked at the plant since it opened in 1954, when it 
belonged to Jos. Schlitz Co. Some got hired last fall, just before the closing 
was announced in December. 
</P>
<P>
At left and below are three workers -- a bottler, machinist and electrician -- 
who, facing unemployment, are revising their plans for the future.

SINCE BEGINNING LIMITED SCHEDULE RUNS LAST SEPTEMBER, THE WINE TRAIN HAS 
BROUGHT TOURISTS AND CONTROVERSY TO THE NAPA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the waitress poured the Champagne into the glass, she proudly noted that it 
was from Paul Masson. To many residents of the Napa Valley, serving a non-local 
sparkling wine, as much as anything, seems to sum up what the Napa Valley Wine 
Train is all about. 
</P>
<P>
The excursion train that runs through the famed wine country is a handsome 
throwback to an earlier, more relaxed time, when travel meant relaxation, 
excellent food and a break from the pressures of the world. 
</P>
<P>
But since it began running last September, the Wine Train has been under siege 
from just about every entity in the area. The reasons are many, but most 
opponents say the train interferes with the way of life. 
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, the Napa Valley has wrestled with the question of 
exactly what a winery is. Residents compare excessive traffic with the desire 
for tourist dollars, and conflict between the Mammon of development with the 
desire to keep the county agriculture-rural. 
</P>
<P>
Into that charged atmosphere roars the Wine Train, representing to many locals 
the worst of evils: development, tourism, noise and hype. Not to mention higher 
taxes. And thus the decision of the Wine Train to serve a non-Napa Valley 
sparkling wine at brunch smacks of arrogance, said one Napa Valley winery 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
"In a nutshell, that sums them up," said the executive, who asked for 
anonymity. "They claim they're here to help the Napa Valley preserve 
agricultural integrity and yet when it comes time to pour a wine of their 
choice, it's something cheap from another wine-growing region. They have no 
one's best interests at heart except their own." 
</P>
<P>
"They've just come in here and thrown salt in our wounds," said Norm Manzer, 
head of a group trying to legally derail the Wine Train. "To threaten someone 
with the type of project like they have is bad enough, but then they did it 
without so much as talking with us. From day one it was full steam ahead, 
'catch us if you can.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manzer, a State Farm Insurance agent whose office is "within spitting distance" 
of the train tracks in St. Helena, and many others are sure they can catch the 
train and stop it dead in its tracks. They feel an Environmental Impact Report 
will show that the train would destroy the way of life in the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Wine Train started Sept. 16 on a temporary schedule, running the 21 miles 
from the city of Napa to St. Helena, in the heart of the valley, then back 
again. The original idea was to permit visitors to see the vines and wineries 
without clogging the roads with cars. Visitors would be able to disembark en 
route to visit wineries. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of an idyllic, turn-of-the-century excursion immediately met 
resistence from residents in a rare show of unity. It's been said that no two 
wine makers can ever agree on so much as the time of day, so the Wine Train is 
being seen as unique: the first subject on which almost everyone agrees. 
</P>
<P>
Protesting the smoke from the 1954 Diesel engines, the clatter of the steel 
wheels on rails, the whine of the engine's mournful horns, the danger at dozens 
of track crossings, the cost to taxpayers and other irritants, locals rebelled. 
</P>
<P>
The winery executive said matters were exacerbated when Wine Train officials 
"never talked to us. They just decided to ram this down our throats, whether we 
liked it or not." He said Wine Train officials have been arrogant and distant. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone ever wanted to write a book on how to do bad community relations, 
these guys already wrote the book," said one winery owner, who asked for 
anonymity because he didn't want to create animosity with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
John C. (Jack) McCormack, president and chief executive of the Wine Train, 
acknowledges the opposition by groups such as Manzer's Friends of the Napa 
Valley, which was formed expressly to oppose him. He says the company's timing 
was simply wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the wineries took opposition to the Wine Train to take the heat off 
the winery definition question," said McCormack, noting that when the Wine 
Train project began in 1985, the winery definition issue was just heating up. 
"If we had started a couple of years earlier . . . ," said McCormack, implying 
that the train would have been widely accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"Even now you don't find as much opposition (to the train) when you talk to 
wine makers individually as when you talk to them as a group," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no guarantee the Wine Train will ever run a full schedule, and faces 
the possibility its present limited schedule will also be terminated. Local and 
state groups are challenging Wine Train's existence in both the State Supreme 
Court and in a federal court in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In a case already extremely complex, the State Supreme Court is to rule soon 
over whether the state has the authority to require an environmental review of 
the train. And the Interstate Commerce Commission is reconsidering its original 
ruling that it has jurisdiction over the train. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key issues is whether the train must submit to the California 
Environmental Quality Act. Wine Train officials say that if Southern Pacific, 
which owned the right-of-way before 1987, had wanted to expand service here, it 
would have been able to do so without scrutiny of an EIR. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, the ICC ruled that it had jurisdiction over the Wine Train. 
This would have given Wine Train the right to operate without restrictions from 
the California Public Utilities Commission. Under ICC jurisdiction, trains are 
subject to virtually no controls, operating under regulations established in 
the past century. 
</P>
<P>
Among the rules that Wine Train officials relish is the one that would not 
require the filing of an EIR. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Napa Valley and the PUC appealed the ICC ruling to the U.S. District 
Court of Appeals in Washington. Before that appeal could be heard, the court 
last summer ruled in a case involving a small rail spur in Illinois. The court 
reversed the ICC decision and gave jurisdiction over the spur to the Illinois 
Commerce Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The ICC then requested that it be allowed to review its decision in the Wine 
Train case, leading to speculation it will reverse itself. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Kitay, an attorney with the office of the general counsel of the ICC, 
said the Illinois case is unrelated to the Napa case, but "we issued an order 
to reopen the Napa decision in light of the Illinois case," she said, adding 
that there "might be a reversal" of ICC's earlier decision. Or ICC could rule 
the same way based on new grounds. 
</P>
<P>
A critical question for the Wine Train, Kitay said, is: "Is there a nexus to 
interstate commerce?" If not, federal control may not be warranted, she 
indicated. 
</P>
<P>
McCormack argues that Wine Train is a carrier of goods in interstate commerce 
as well as a feeder line for Amtrak passenger service, and thus it should be 
ruled by ICC -- which would free it from having to file the EIR. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents fire back that there is no rail service from the Wine Train terminus 
to the nearest Amtrak station at Martinez, some 20 miles south; passengers must 
take a bus between the lines. And that there hasn't been a passenger train in 
the Napa Valley since the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Manzer's group feels that the EIR will show that the train would make a 
negative impact on the valley. "If ICC gives jurisdiction back to the PUC, we 
will kill the train," said Manzer. "We know that the things that will be found 
in the EIR will be unmitigateable." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the crucial nature of the EIR, a group was formed 18 months ago at 
the suggestion of the St. Helena City Council called ALERT -- Alliance for the 
Environmental Report on the Train. ALERT includes the city of St. Helena, the 
town of Yountville, Napa County and five local trade groups -- Napa County Farm 
Bureau, Napa County Grape Growers Assn., Napa Valley Vintners Assn., United 
Napa Valley Associates and Friends of the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
ALERT attorney Michael Riback said the thrust of the ALERT argument is simply 
that Wine Train is not a means of transportation as much as it is a tourist 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"In the eyes of ALERT, the Wine Train is not a transportation or commuter 
operation," said Riback, "it is a tourist operation akin to the monorail at 
Disneyland, where you're taking the ride for the ride's sake, not to get to a 
particular destination." 
</P>
<P>
Manzer calls the Wine Train "nothing more than a bar and restaurant on wheels, 
plowing its way through the agricultural preserve of the Napa Valley." And he 
pointed out that in the local Yellow Pages, Wine Train is listed under 
"restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
The EIR, which is being done for Wine Train by a San Mateo company, is due by 
August. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a series of public meetings has been scheduled to hear 
questions about Wine Train's impact on residents, municipalities, businesses, 
the tax structure and the agriculture of the region. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting last Thursday night at the Yountville Town Hall, about 40 persons 
showed up to hear Earth Metrics, a San Mateo company doing the environmental 
report on the train, discuss its Proponent's Environmental Assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Then representatives from Napa County, the town of Yountville and the city of 
St. Helena all made inquiries of Earth Metrics, asking the company to address 
concerns not mentioned in the PEA report. Further meetings were scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key problems as far as Manzer and others are concerned is the cost 
of the train to taxpayers. Friends of the Valley says taxpayers will foot a $6 
million bill to pay for improvements to the line, including gate crossings and 
a rerouting of traffic along State Highway 29 at Trancas Street in Napa, a 
particularly knotty intersection at the north end of Napa. 
</P>
<P>
McCormack, aware of all the arguments against his train, says his organization 
will make every effort to keep the valley exactly as it is. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not in our best interests to see the valley turn into a bedroom 
community of San Francisco," he says. "We have as much of a stake in keeping 
the region agrarian as they do."

They loved Willard. And why not? Willard Scott, NBC's ebullient weatherman was 
the man of the hour early Tuesday for the 99 finalists in the 34th Pillsbury 
Bake-Off held Monday at the Pointe on South Mountain resort in Phoenix. Willard 
was the man handing out the prize money. 
</P>
<P>
Sweets and chocolate dominated among the winners. And California cooks 
dominated also, taking six of the 24 prizes awarded, including the grand prize 
of $40,000, two of the $10,000 category prizes and three of the $2,000 prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Rahman, a Petaluma tax accountant, took the top prize money for an 
elegant, yet simple, Blueberry-Poppy Seed Brunch Cake, which was not too sweet 
and was loaded with blueberries and poppy seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Woodside of Sonora, a three-time finalist in the contest, won $10,000 in 
the Canned Vegetable and Mashed Potato Flake category for an unusual Chocolate 
Fudge Snack Cake made with potato flakes. It's a rich, moist brownie-like cake 
that is topped with a sprinkling of walnuts. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Scott Wolf, 21, from Salem, Ore., and one of 12 men finalists, won the $10,000 
prize in the Frozen Vegetable category for a non-chocolatey, non-sweet chicken 
dish called garden rice-stuffed chicken breasts. His sister, 20, Debra Wolf, 
also a finalist this year, won $2,000 in the Refrigerated Crescent Dinner Roll 
category. Debra, who won $15,000 at the 1986 Bake-Off was returning as a 
contestant for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
Californians who won $2,000 this year were Ellen Nishimura, a medical 
technologist from Fair Oaks, who entered a trendy Mediterranean Corn Salad in 
the Canned Vegetable and Mashed Potato Flake category. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lou Cook of Fallbrook won $2,000 in the same division for a quick and easy 
soup, Creamy Chicken-Vegetable Chowder.

INTEREST IN BAKE-OFF INCREASING; 
</P>
<P>
CONTEST: PILLSBURY HAS NO PLANS TO DROP THE POPULAR COOKING CONTEST.

Rumors that Monday's contest was to be the last of the long-lived Pillsbury 
Bake-Offs were flying wildly as members of the press, contestants and others 
attending the 34th chapter of this venerable culinary competition arrived here 
over the weekend. But Paul Walsh, chief operating officer of Pillsbury, Inc., 
speaking at a seminar preceding the Bake-Off, quickly put them to rest. 
</P>
<P>
Pillsbury has no plans to drop the popular cooking contest so long as there is 
interest in it on the part of consumers, he assured his questioners. In fact, 
plans are already well under way to hold the next of the biannual events at 
Disney World in Orlando, Fla., in 1992. The first Bake-Off was held in 1949 in 
New York City. It was held annually in various cities around the country until 
1976 when it became a biannual event. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal of the Bake-Off is legendary, largely because the value of the cash 
and other prizes is sizable. Cash prizes amount to $126,000, including a grand 
prize of $40,000, five $10,000 prizes and 18 $2,000 prizes. In addition, 
Pillsbury's co-sponsor, Sears, provides the grand prize winner with a $10,000 
kitchen make-over. They also give the $10,000 winners a choice of a Sears 
Kenmore gas or electric range, and the $2,000 prize winners receive Kenmore 
food processors. Each finalist also receives a free trip to the Bake-Off site 
to compete in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the lure of the Bake-Off prizes, many finalists are repeat 
contestants, entering the contest year after year. This year was no exception. 
Of the 99 cooks who made it to this year's finals, (one California contestant 
had to drop out at the last minute) six were back for the third time and 16 
were competing for the second time. Fourteen Californians, several of whom were 
repeaters, competed this year. 
</P>
<P>
The 34th Bake-Off offered entrants a greatly expanded list of products that 
could be used in the recipes they entered. Besides the usual Pillsbury brand 
products such as flour, cake mixes, biscuits, rolls and pie and pizza dough, 
contestants could also use Pillsbury's Green Giant brand canned and frozen 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
As food trends and cooking techniques change throughout the years, so do the 
entries in the Bake-Off. This year was no exception. Contestants entered 
recipes classed as ethnic specialties, quick meals, indulgent treats or 
healthful alternatives in any of six basic categories based on Pillsbury 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern and Mexican flavorings and ingredients were popular with both 
those who made it to the finals and those who didn't. Low fat, high fiber foods 
appeared often, however, the healthful trend took a back seat to good flavor in 
many cases, particularly in the indulgent treat category. Chocolate remains the 
number one flavor in sweets and liquor and liquers were much in evidence as 
ingredients in the dessert entries. 
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of canned and frozen vegetables as products acceptable for use 
under contest rules brought about a wide array of soup, pizza and casserole 
entries. Spinach was by far the favorite vegetable of the finalists and many 
commented that their recipes helped them persuade their children to eat the 
"dreaded green." 
</P>
<P>
One major change in the way we eat was noted by Pillsbury. At the first 
Bake-Off, only nine spices and herbs were called for by the finalists. Monday's 
competition sent company shoppers on the search for 34 different flavorings. 
And if there is any doubt that pizzas are popular, walking up and down the 
aisles among the ranges in use during the Bake-Off, one found that seven 
competitors were preparing everything from chicken fajita pizza to a hearty 
Reuben pizza. 
</P>
<P>
Flour is still the most popular ingredient in the Bake-Off although Pillsbury 
home economists noted that in numerous entries baking mixes are being used the 
way flour was 20 years ago. Chocolate cake mix and brownie mix are becoming 
"chocolate flour" in recipes that often call for additional chocolate as well. 
It took 23 different kinds of chocolate to fill the needs of the finalists. 
</P>
<P>
Nuts also were popular ingredients in this year's finals. However macadamias, 
pine nuts and almonds seem to have replaced walnuts in both sweet and savory 
foods. The Bake-Off finalists required 480 bags, cans and jars of nuts. The 
contestants also required 44 springform pans, in place of more conventional 
pans, and 56 muffin pans, ranging in size from miniature to "Texas-size." 
</P>
<P>
Oat bran was used with a heavy hand in many recipes that were entered. 
Pillsbury home economists found, however, that oat bran was often added in such 
huge amounts that the results were so unpalatable the recipes didn't make the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side in their search for healthful recipes, many contestants and 
would-be contestants utilized low fat and low sodium ingredients such as egg 
substitutes and low-fat or nonfat yogurts in place of sour cream quite 
successfully.

TRYING TO MAKE TRACKS IN NAPA'S WINE COUNTRY; 
</P>
<P>
EXCURSIONS: TRAVELERS ON THE NAPA VALLEY WINE TRAIN ARE TREATED TO A HOST OF 
LUXURIES. BUT THE DRAWBACKS INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THE TRAIN STARTS AND STOPS IN 
THE SAME PLACE.

<P>
The gorgeously outfitted interiors, calming music and black-tie service aboard 
the dining car of the Napa Valley Wine Train give no clue to the hurricane of 
controversy swirling outside over its very existence. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of its controversial image among locals, the Wine Train has already 
succeeded in terms of ambience. Travelers step into a time gone by, an idyllic 
setting of elegance and style, good manners and taste. 
</P>
<P>
In the leisurely excursion from the city of Napa north to St. Helena and back 
again, travelers are treated to well-prepared food, fine service, elegant 
dinnerware and luxurious furniture. 
</P>
<P>
As a dining experience, the train is unique. Meals are creatively conceived by 
chef Ken Schloss, a protege of Jeremiah Tower of San Francisco. Menus include 
cannelloni in buckwheat crepes, duck terrine, Norwegian salmon, filet mignon 
and espresso flan for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
A wide selection of wines from top Napa Valley wineries are offered, by the 
glass or bottle, at reasonable prices. 
</P>
<P>
The trappings include china, silver and crystal glassware atop white 
tablecloths. A warm towel is presented as you sit down, to refresh the face 
before dining. 
</P>
<P>
The 1915-era cars, refurbished with new interiors, include mahogany woodwork, 
brightly colored fabric on newly designed chairs and couches, velvet draperies, 
wool beige carpeting, brass fixtures, oval glass partitions etched with grapes 
and marble countertops in the restrooms. The colors are cream, green and 
Burgundy. 
</P>
<P>
There are even small heaters at foot level for cold days. 
</P>
<P>
After meals are completed, dessert is served in the lounge car as diners sit in 
plush, oversized swivel chairs or at tables for four. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are drawbacks, including the fact that you go nowhere. You start 
and end in the same place, and until a legal squabble over the train is 
settled, that's not going to change. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some passengers never see the sights of the Napa Valley. During late fall 
and winter, the dinner train runs in darkness, after the sun has set. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, passengers float past some of the most famous vineyards in the world, 
but have no clue as to which is what. They sail past the famed Napanook 
Vineyard that produces Dominus, past the road leading to Martha's Vineyard, 
past the vineyard that produces the BV Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, and 
there's no one to tell what's here. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, although this attraction should appeal to wine collectors, Wine 
Train prohibits patrons from bringing a bottle of wine on board and consuming 
it -- not even for a corkage charge. That means that if you buy an older 
vintage of a great Napa Valley wine at one of the tasting rooms, you'll have to 
sip it elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
And if a party of five or more wants to enjoy the train together, they'll have 
to dine at separate tables. The maximum number that can fit at a table is four. 
</P>
<P>
Napa Valley Wine Train Inc. was formed in 1984 as a limited partnership of 
seven investors. Today the company has 13 shareholders headed by Vincent 
DeDominico, former chairman of Golden Grain Macaroni Products, the Rice-a-Roni 
folks. Jack McCormack was hired as president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership bought the right-of-way on the 21 1/4-mile line from Southern 
Pacific Railroad in April of 1987. Included in the deal was about 125 acres of 
land, including a parking area in downtown St. Helena. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the company says, it has spent $14 million on acquiring and 
refurbishing 20 Pullman coaches used to haul passengers, including installation 
of a modern kitchen and serving facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Wine Train depot in north Napa has two gift shops, one of which carries 
wine and, ironically, aprons and T-shirts -- items that were among the disputes 
in the winery definition controversy that erupted passions throughout the 
valley in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Wine Train now runs three times a day on a Preliminary Limited Service 
agreement with local groups that prohibits passengers from getting on or off 
the train except at the depot. And all riders on most runs now must purchase 
lunch or dinner tickets, making the round trip a $45 to $57.50 excursion. 
</P>
<P>
If Wine Train is permitted to run six round-trip trains per day, as McCormack's 
wall chart shows, the company would also run shuttle buses to various wineries 
from stops at Yountville, Rutherford, and St. Helena. Buses also would run as 
far east as the Silverado Trail. The train's current lunch/dinner requirement 
would be waived. 
</P>
<P>
"We could operate and make money on our present (temporary) schedule," said 
McCormack. "We can make a profit, though not as much. We're booked through 
April right now." 
</P>
<P>
The train winds north through the north end of Napa with vistas as grand and 
glorious as laundry on a line in a back yard, garbage bins and an industrial 
park's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The train crosses to the west of State Highway 29 at Trancas Street, then 
slowly chugs north past Newlan, Trefethen and Lakespring wineries before it 
gets to Yountville, where Domaine Chandon is located. 
</P>
<P>
The train continues north through Oakville, past the entrance to the Robert 
Mondavi Winery, and continues past Beaulieu and Inglenook in Rutherford. Just 
after it passes Franciscan, it crosses the highway once again, moving to the 
east of Highway 29. 
</P>
<P>
A few hundred yards before it enters downtown St. Helena, the train passes a 
huge sign atop a truck. The sign has the international red-circle symbol and 
the words "Wine Train" with a red slash through it. The complete round trip 
takes about 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
If full service is ever approved, Wine Train personnel say, the plan is to 
extend the tracks north of St. Helena, possibly wind up eventually in 
Calistoga. 
</P>
<P>
Few wineries in the valley support the Wine Train, but opponents say only four 
wineries publicly support the train -- Sunny St. Helena, Grgich Hills, DeMoor 
and Sequoia Grove. All four have taken ads out in the Wine Train's newspaper, 
the Napa Valley Traveler. 
</P>
<P>
Wine maker Mike Grgich, an acknowledged supporter of the train, said he felt 
the possibility of freight and commuter service would make the train valuable 
to the valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I came from Europe, where the train was very friendly," said Grgich, a native 
of Croatia. "We used the train all the time, it was an alternative to 
automobiles. I'm used to the train." 
</P>
<P>
Grgich said the train could be used for shipping wine, "instead of those trucks 
coming up and down the road; if we shipped by railroad, those trucks would be 
eliminated. And I believe Wine Train should establish commuter service, which 
would be very helpful to the traffic on the highway." (McCormack says commuter 
service is under consideration.)

However, some wine makers are irritated at having their names connected to the 
train. 
</P>
<P>
A Wine Train waiter, asked which wine makers had ridden the train, said Bob 
Mondavi and Jack Cakebread both have taken the trip and were supporters. 
However, both men, contacted at their wineries, denied they supported the train 
and were bothered that their names were mentioned in that context. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents have been vocal. Dick Grace, who makes one of the most prestigious 
Cabernets in the Napa Valley, said, "The wine train could conceivably be the 
most damaging contributor toward the demise of the Napa Valley's life style as 
well as the quality of its most important product, world class wines."

FOOD PROJECT'S FUNDING TO GO FOR VOUCHERS; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: ON THE HEELS OF BEING OUSTED FROM PLUMMER PARK, THE GREATER WEST 
HOLLYWOOD FOOD COALITION HAS NOW LOST ITS CITY FINANCING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition, the group that for two years has fed 
scores of homeless people in Plummer Park, received another setback this week 
when the City Council voted to accept a task force recommendation to transfer 
funds from the coalition to a food voucher program. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision, which came after midnight at Tuesday's meeting, means 
that the coalition will no longer receive an annual payment of $30,000 from the 
city. It is one of several setbacks the group has experienced recently. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the city ordered the coalition to leave Plummer Park by 
March 6 after neighborhood complaints that the nightly feeding program was 
attracting crime and creating sanitation problems. 
</P>
<P>
And last week, a major food source of the coalition's dried up when Drexel 
Burnham Lambert closed its doors for good. The leftovers from Drexel's 
lunchtime meals for its employees made up the bulk of the food that the 
coalition fed the up to 150 homeless people each night at Plummer Park. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a good time," said Mike Dean, the coalition's president. "But we 
are not going to let this get us down; we are going to continue to do the best 
we can to feed the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's 5-0 decision sets up a voucher system that will provide 
meals in fast-food restaurants, as suggested by a 17-member task force composed 
of residents around Plummer Park, advocates for the homeless and members of the 
food coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the Gay and Lesbian Community Service Center will receive a 
six-month allotment of $15,000, enough money to give roughly 23 people a day a 
$3.50 meal at a local fast-food restaurant. Vouchers will be issued only to 
people who are already taking part in another social service program. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't feed every homeless person in the county," City Councilman Paul 
Koretz said. "The (coalition's) program hasn't worked for the city of West 
Hollywood. There were too many hustlers and drug addicts who were maintaining 
their habits on free meals. They were not being encouraged to change their 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Koretz added, the city does more than most communities in combatting 
homelessness. Every night, the West Hollywood Park Auditorium becomes a shelter 
for about two dozen homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the council's vote in favor of the voucher system, several council 
members expressed concern that the program may leave many people hungry. 
Another question expressed was about the willingness of restaurants to 
participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Heilman said he wondered whether giving the contract to the gay 
and lesbian center would give the wrong impression that only gays and lesbians 
were being served. The council agreed to reevaluate the program after six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The city's action against the coalition's feeding program came after residents 
complained that they were afraid to use the park because it had become a 
hangout for criminals. The program was shut down briefly last fall, but the 
coalition mounted a successful campaign, led by celebrities and advocates for 
the homeless, to keep it open. 
</P>
<P>
"The program has generated more support from stars and junk bond kings than it 
has from the community," said Tad Bright, co-chairman of the Eastend Community 
Action Committee. "The park should be for everybody, but people are afraid to 
go there. Needles have been found in the sandbox. Seniors lock their doors at 
night and are afraid to come out." 
</P>
<P>
Community residents and city officials had asked the coalition to screen those 
who are served in its food lines, but the group refused. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way to screen people. Our philosophy has always been to feed all 
those in the line," said Ted Landreth, a spokesman for the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Landreth said the group plans to temporarily relocate its feeding operation to 
a closed restaurant owned by hotelier Severyn Ashkenazy after the March 6 
evacuation deadline. Residents in the neighborhoods surrounding the London Club 
restaurant at Beverly Place and La Cienega Boulevard have vowed to fight that 
move. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Landreth said, the group plans to raise $111,000 to operate a 
mobile food van that would distribute food to the poor at several locations 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that everyone want to help the homeless, but no one wants them 
near their house," Landreth said.

PAINTING 2 PICTURES OF GANG THREAT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE CHIEF OF POLICE AND SOME OFFICIALS SAY NO, BUT OTHERS SAY THEY 
IGNORE THE GROWING MENACE OF TEEN GANGS IN THE AREA.

After a group of Oxnard teen-agers drove to Ventura's Buenaventura Mall and 
fired shots at Ventura gang members last May, county prosecutors identified one 
of the gunmen as a member of a Filipino gang in Oxnard called the Kanto Gang 
Boys, also known as the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Oxnard gang members allegedly struck again, opening fire with a 
shotgun and wounding five people outside a Round Table Pizza restaurant in 
Moorpark, where about 40 teen-agers had gathered after a football game. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County prosecutors say the Oxnard youth suspected of driving the car in 
that shooting wore a black baseball cap with the letters RSGC, signifying 
membership in the predominantly black and Latino Oxnard gang called the Rolling 
Sixties Gangster Crips. 
</P>
<P>
The violence took a fatal turn Nov. 22 in Oxnard when Manuel Rodriguez, a 
member of a Latino gang called the Lemonwood Chiques, was shot in the head and 
left to die in front of Channel Islands High School. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the shooting occurred after Rodriguez yelled gang slogans at 
Arnel Salagubang, 19, a member of a Filipino gang called the Santanas or STS 
who has been charged with the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
To some Ventura County officials, the pattern of violence suggests that Oxnard 
has a growing gang problem that has spread from the city to surrounding 
communities throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always been violence in barrios," Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Peter E. Brown said. "Now, we're seeing Oxnard gangs in Santa Barbara, we're 
seeing them in Moorpark, we're seeing them in the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"They go in groups, they wear their colors and they go armed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some law enforcement officials say privately that they think many Oxnard 
officials -- among them Oxnard Police Chief Robert Owens -- have deliberately 
downplayed the extent of the problem, at least in their public comments about 
gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard one local chief say that Owens won't admit there are gangs in Oxnard 
until one of them shoots him," one top official, speaking anonymously, told The 
Times last week. 
</P>
<P>
Owens, who has been Oxnard police chief for 20 years, responded to that comment 
this week by saying that he thinks he has irritated some law enforcement 
officials in the county with his policy of avoiding giving gangs unnecessary 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an ongoing battle among some people who have been maximizing gang 
activities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Owens said he expressed annoyance recently after another official made what he 
believed to be exaggerated statements about an influx of Los Angeles gang 
members into Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"I accused some of my fellow law enforcement officials of grandstanding and 
giving gangs what they want -- attention -- and using the announcement for the 
drama of the moment and more funding from their city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the views of others, Owens maintained, Oxnard's gang problem has not 
reached serious proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"Merely because kids identify themselves as gang members doesn't mean we have a 
gang problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Owens conceded that gangs do exist in the city. He stressed, however, that they 
are not comparable to the hard-core street gangs that have become notorious in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"My position has been and will continue to be, until the situation changes, 
that we have not had the classical gang confrontations -- drive-by shootings, 
mini-wars and battles over turf," Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I can remember, there have been areas of the city, barrios, where 
they affiliate and associate," Owens said. "Once in a while they will have a 
donnybrook with people in other areas." 
</P>
<P>
Owens said at least part of his policy of downplaying gang activity stems from 
a desire to deny publicity to gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to be very objective and accurate," he said. "It may appear that we're 
minimizing it. We don't think we're doing anybody any favors by giving gangs 
the publicity that they want." 
</P>
<P>
That public policy contrasts with an official Oxnard police assesment of the 
gang situation that was made in a recent application for a $391,000 grant from 
the U.S. Department of Justice for increased narcotics patrols. 
</P>
<P>
In that application, the Oxnard Police Department said one of the reasons it 
needs the extra money is because "gang activity in the city is increasing 
rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
The application, approved by Owens, lists the Chiques as the "oldest and 
largest gang in the city." It also mentions the Crips, which have "direct 
linkage with the Los Angeles Crips," the Santanas and "a large number of 
smaller neighborhood gangs." 
</P>
<P>
The application included a newspaper article that quotes a 17-year-old ex-Crips 
member: "Being on the streets of Oxnard, I'd say more of the gangs are coming 
from Oxnard than anyplace else in Ventura County. A new gang rises up about 
once a month." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the discrepancy between his public comments and the language 
used in Oxnard's request for federal funds, Owens said the funding request 
contained "dated information" compiled before two gangs became "virtually 
inoperative." 
</P>
<P>
The chief's views on the gang situation were echoed in recent weeks by Oxnard 
patrol officers, who said they agree that the gang problem has been 
exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
They described Oxnard youths involved in gangs as "wanna-bes" or "fragmented 
groups of kids" or "little punks" or "misguided youth" -- not a major problem. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few, very few gangs," Officer Dennis McMasters said during a 
recent patrol. "If we had hard-core gang members here, you'd have some 
homicides." 
</P>
<P>
Even as McMasters minimized gang activity, he was told several times about gang 
activity by Oxnard citizens and even a fellow officer. 
</P>
<P>
McMasters responded at one point to a call from workers at a warehouse who 
dubbed the vandals who had broken into their facility and left only a bat 
behind as "members of that gang, the Lemonwood Chiques." 
</P>
<P>
About an hour later, as McMasters cruised the south end of Oxnard, a motorist 
honked insistently at him to stop. As McMasters slowed and rolled down his 
window, the middle-aged driver pointed toward Oxnard Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"'Just over the overpass, there's a hell of a gang fight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"How does he know it was a gang?" McMasters grumbled before heading to the 
overpass for a look that revealed no activity. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, McMasters was told over the radio by another officer that 
a similar confrontation had occurred earlier that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
And toward the end of his shift, when McMasters stopped for a quick chat with a 
former partner, the officer said: 
</P>
<P>
"Did you hear about the ICC's big gang fight in Port Hueneme tomorrow?" 
</P>
<P>
According to the Ventura County district attorney's office, the two largest 
gangs in Oxnard are the Oxnard Chiques and the Colonia Chiques. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the Colonia are the Loma Flats, who claim to be associated with the Los 
Angeles Bloods. 
</P>
<P>
At the south end of town are the Rolling Sixties Gangster Crips and the Inner 
City Crips, a Latino gang. 
</P>
<P>
Other gangs in the city, according to county officials, are the Lemonwood 
Chiques, the Kanto Gang Boys, the Santanas and a predominantly white skinhead 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the gangs exist, Owens maintained this week that they 
are a relatively insignificant factor in Oxnard crime. 
</P>
<P>
Owens called the Colonia Chiques "an amorphous mess." He said the city's total 
gang population is about 100. 
</P>
<P>
In downplaying gang activity in Oxnard, Owens has the support of some Oxnard 
City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ann Johs said she saw gang activity during a recent ride-along 
with police. But she said the gangs should not be glamorized. 
</P>
<P>
"They're there," said Johs, a member of the public safety policy commission of 
the California League of Cities. "There was one section of town where I could 
physically see 12 gang members up to no good." 
</P>
<P>
But the tactic the city uses, she said, is to not admit that there are gangs. 
In that way, she said, gangs do not get publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't get any publicity, they're not as active," Johs said. "Our 
people know where they are and what they're doing and so far they're not out of 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard policy of trying to ignore gangs, while similar to the approach of 
many cities throughout the state, was questioned by several leading law 
enforcement experts, who termed the approach outdated and potentially 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal justice expert G. Albert Howenstein told The Times that any city 
policy of denying that gangs exist and are a problem "allows gangs to grow and 
take control of the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to get them before 'wanna-bes' become 'are-bes,' " said 
Howenstein, the director of the state office of criminal justice planning. 
"Whether they're 'wanna-bes' or have signed-up membership cards, the fact that 
they're 'wanna-bes' should be frightening enough." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, who addressed the issue of 
under-reporting of gang activity at an anti-gang conference, said last week 
that the downplaying of gang activity often results from pressure by 
politicians who do not want their cities to be viewed as having such problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the result of political influences is to downplay the negatives in a 
community, particularly as they concern gangs," Block said in an interview with 
The Times. "Gang violence in a community can impact house prices, commerce and 
tourism." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen McLaughlin, who serves as a 
department consultant on gang-related cases, called Oxnard's gang policies 
appropriate, but would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
However, he praised the public approach taken by the city of Ventura in dealing 
with gang problems as "proactive and progressive." 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Police Department and City Council held news conferences and issued 
press releases to publicize the city's gang problem last March, after a 
drive-by shooting in front of Ventura High School stunned the community. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department set up a six-officer suppression team that for the last 
six months has aggressively enforced ordinances against youths believed to be 
in gangs -- from breaking a 10 p.m. curfew to drinking in public. 
</P>
<P>
And the Ventura City Council approved $145,000 for an emergency graffiti 
removal program to paint over the gang slogans that mark different territories 
and established a 24-hour hot line for residents to report graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula also has taken a public stance about its admitted gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to acknowledge the problem without conferring status on the 
gangs," said Police Chief Walt Adair. "By the same token, you can't tell people 
you don't have a problem when you do." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the opinions of some officials outside Oxnard, however, other experts 
and many community leaders sided with Owens in portraying Oxnard's problems as 
relatively minor. Some, in fact, accused the Oxnard police of exaggerating the 
gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Morales, a UCLA professor, studied youth criminal activity in Oxnard 
two years ago in a study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
Morales concluded that many youths belonged to groups characterized as gangs, 
but that the gangs were nonviolent. 
</P>
<P>
"What I've found in that area was that by and large there are a few gangs in 
the community, but they are not the violent type," Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
At the northeast end of Oxnard, residents of the Colonia, the county's largest 
barrio, staunchly defended the Colonia Chiques, one of the city's largest 
gangs, as nonviolent. 
</P>
<P>
They said Oxnard youths are unfairly singled out as gang members simply because 
they may wear the same attire, listen to the same music and paint the same 
graffiti as authentic gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe we have a serious problem in Ventura County," said Luzmaria 
Espinosa, a youth counselor at El Concilio del Condado de Ventura. "We have 
kids who get together, who are friends and who dress a certain way, and because 
they are, they're considered gangs."

ANTICIPATED SHORTFALL MAY FORCE COUNTY TO CUT SERVICES; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: OFFICIALS HOPE THE SITUATION ISN'T AS BAD AS IT LOOKS. BUT 
ACROSS-THE-BOARD REDUCTIONS ARE POSSIBLE. 
</P>

Ventura County residents could face cutbacks in health care, welfare and other 
county services next year because of a possible $8.4-million shortage in 
anticipated revenues, county officials warned this week. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said, however, that they hope the preliminary projections will prove 
to be too conservative when actual figures from the state budget and local 
property tax income due the county are available in May. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope we will make the entire shortfall," said Bert Bigler, manager of 
budget and administrative services. However, Bigler added, "If we still have a 
shortfall at that time, we would have to recommend reductions." 
</P>
<P>
Bigler said it is too early to be specific, but there probably would be a 
percentage cut in each department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
The county's mental health services may be the exception because of a 
$16-million, four-year state grant to upgrade services. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg reported the budgetary outlook 
to county supervisors on Tuesday. At his suggestion, the board approved 
measures to continue cost-savings plans implemented last year. 
</P>
<P>
Wittenberg said the possible shortfall is the kind of dilemma faced by county 
governments throughout the state. The state requires counties to provide 
programs such as welfare and health and hospital care for the poor but does not 
provide adequate funding to pay the bills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"County finances are essentially captive to the frequent federal and state 
mandates, political stalemates, allocations priorities and administrative 
whims," he told the board in his report. "Your board has very limited control 
of the county's future budget destiny." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Wittenberg cited the county's receipt of $6.7 million this year in 
new money from Proposition 99, the tobacco tax initiative. About half of that 
amount went to private doctors and hospitals. Another $2 million went to pay 
back the county's general fund for a loan made earlier to the county medical 
center. 
</P>
<P>
That loan, Wittenberg said, was for treatment for the poor because of a state 
decrease in its allocations for the medically indigent last year. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that the county's library system spent its entire reserve of 
$318,000 to fund 10 new positions last year, and that will leave this year's 
budget tight, Bigler said. The library system also wants to build two new 
facilities at a cost of about $20 million but has no money. 
</P>
<P>
The possible shortfall could also increase the chances that the county will be 
unable to build a proposed 800-bed jail. 
</P>
<P>
Officials already are having to scale back plans and will settle for a jail 
half that size to meet their budget constraints. The county now has $41 million 
in state money for the facility, but an 800-bed jail would cost nearly twice 
that. 
</P>
<P>
For the county to fund the balance with long-term debt, it would need a means 
to repay the loan, which it does not have, said Robert Hirtensteiner, assistant 
to the chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
He said the county is hoping to maintain the status quo with services. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to hold the line," he said. "We will try to maintain the 
current level of services, improve our inefficiencies and cost-effectiveness."

STATION TIES ORANGE GROVE TO GLOBE; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS: A SATELLITE FACILITY IN SANTA PAULA RELAYED MESSAGES BETWEEN 
SHIPS INVOLVED IN THE EXXON OIL SPILL CLEANUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After the massive oil spill from the tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska last March, 
a major role in the cleanup effort was played by a small satellite 
communications station in the hills of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
The same satellite center -- a vital communications link for almost all 
shipping in the Pacific -- funneled emergency messages across the world after 
the San Francisco-area earthquake in October. 
</P>
<P>
The Communications Satellite Corp. (COMSAT) station, which opened in 1976, is 
an unassuming facility dwarfed by an array of 42-foot-diameter white antennas 
in the middle of a Santa Paula orange grove. 
</P>
<P>
"The county wanted us to maintain the agricultural aesthetics," said Dan Geer, 
station manager. "When we picked the site, we were looking for a place close to 
Los Angeles and also permission to use the radio frequencies we want. 
</P>
<P>
"There just happened to be an orange grove there," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-member crew of operators and technicians works 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week to maintain COMSAT satellites and take care of communications among 
ships in the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the satellites functioning may be routine, but dealing with passenger 
liners, oil tankers and fishing boats provides the element of unpredictability 
and variety at the station. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Operator Supervisor Debbie Schneider recalled that the station was "very 
hectic" last March when the tanker Exxon Valdez spilled tons of oil in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
COMSAT helped by setting up a special 24-hour communications link among the 
ships involved in the cleanup. A framed certificate of commendation from Exxon 
hangs in the COMSAT station now, along with pictures and posters of cruise 
ships, oil drilling rigs and fishing boats. 
</P>
<P>
A natural disaster such as an earthquake will also increase the station's 
activity, Schneider said. After ships received news that the big quake had 
struck the Bay Area, operators had to deal with frantic customers trying to 
call home. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't get through for a day and a half," she said. "There is no 
satellite station in San Francisco. If there was, there wouldn't have been a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Emergency calls are routed to the Coast Guard by one of COMSAT's eight 
operators who give personal assistance if customers need help dialing 
ship-to-shore, shore-to-ship or ship-to-ship. They also assist with telex and 
facsimile calls, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, however, workdays at the COMSAT station are routine, Geer said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50% of the work schedule involves maintaining the satellites, about 40% 
is devoted to telephone, telex and data services for ships and the remaining 
10% is spent transmitting Armed Forces radio news broadcasts to Pacific ships 
and sending British and domestic television programs to Australia, Geer said. 
</P>
<P>
Regular satellite maintenance and television transmission is routinely done by 
computers -- huge, gray machines that constantly hum and that occupy most of 
the station space. A satellite alarm and a minimum of two technicians on duty 
ensure that the satellite stays in orbit and functions correctly. "We've got a 
backup for almost everything you can think of," Geer said. 
</P>
<P>
According to COMSAT, nearly half of all worldwide telecommunications traffic 
begins and ends in the United States. COMSAT has a sister station in Southbury, 
Conn., that services the Atlantic Ocean. More than 10,000 ships use satellite 
service, and nearly half use COMSAT on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
That translates into more than 2,000 calls a day during a peak period, 
Schneider said. The busiest time of year is from April to October, when "Alaska 
opens up," she said. COMSAT receives a lot of business from the cruise ships, 
fishing vessels and oil tankers in that area. 
</P>
<P>
The advantage of using satellites for phone calls is privacy, high quality 
transmissions and fast connections, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
But satellite service is not cheap. A phone call costs $10 per minute, with a 
three-minute minimum, and a telex is $4 per minute. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the high rates, business is growing, Geer said. A large expansion is 
planned for next year. The COMSAT station owns 10 acres but is now only using 
four. 
</P>
<P>
The Communications Satellite Corp. is a Washington company that owns and 
operates seven domestic satellites plus a satellite-based television 
distribution network. 
</P>
<P>
Customers include the U.S. Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, 
Voice of America and the governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, 
Turkey, Japan, Korea and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The company was formed in 1963 by an act of Congress to pioneer the development 
of a commercial international communications satellite system, and launched its 
first satellite in 1976. President John F. Kennedy picked its first board of 
directors, but COMSAT received no government funds and has always been listed 
on the New York Stock Exchange, said COMSAT spokeswoman Pat Whalen. 
</P>
<P>
The company employs more than 1,500 people worldwide and revenues are about 
$400 million.

RESOLUTION ON MALATHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all five members indicating support, the City Council has instructed its 
legal staff to draw up a resolution calling for a halt to all malathion 
spraying until authorities can answer questions concerning possible health 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
"Agricultural interests are important, but cannot supersede the interests of 
human health," said Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert Tanenbaum agreed. "There are too many unknown potential 
health hazards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion, an insecticide, is being sprayed in parts of Los Angeles County by 
the state Food and Agriculture Department in an effort to eradicate an 
infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies. So far, Beverly Hills has been 
outside the spraying zone, although some parts of the city were sprayed during 
a 1984 infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Once the resolution is passed, it will be sent to the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors and the California Legislature.

The Culver City Redevelopment Agency on Monday unanimously selected 
Wolff/Lang/Christopher Architects Inc. to design the replacement for downtown 
Fire Station No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Agency staff cited the firm's experience, cost estimate and willingness to 
complete its drawings within nine months in supporting its selection, according 
to a staff report. The firm will be paid $252,000 for its design. 
</P>
<P>
The old station, at 9760 Culver Blvd. next to City Hall, is considered

FREEZE LOSS FOR GROWERS MAY REACH $24 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County farming officials estimate that millions of dollars in damage 
occurred to the area's strawberry and citrus crops as the result of freezing 
temperatures last week. 
</P>
<P>
The county agricultural commissioner's office this week began assessing damage 
and inspecting fruit in the fields and packinghouses. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the damage will be severe," said Tom McGrath, who grows strawberries 
on 100 acres on the Oxnard Plain. "We'll have a pretty good idea in two to 
three weeks as the berries mature how bad it is." 
</P>
<P>
Because strawberry plants, which were hit hardest by the freeze a week ago, 
continue to produce from January through July, the agricultural commissioner's 
office set early loss estimates at 5% to 10% of the total berry crop, or about 
$24 million. 
</P>
<P>
If oranges and lemons were hurt, the damage will not show until the fruit is 
cut open, said David Buettner, chief deputy agriculture commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The damage occurred in the last hour before dawn on Feb. 15 as temperatures 
dipped to 21 degrees, said Terry Schaeffer, agricultural meteorologist for the 
National Weather Service. While growers feared the potential damage of the 
freeze, they cheered the rain that began Friday and lasted through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if there were potential damage to the crops from rain we wouldn't care 
because we need the rain so badly," McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
The rain, while substantial, was enough to bring the county up to only 48% of 
its normal rainfall total for this time of year, said Dolores Taylor, county 
hydrologist. 
</P>
<P>
The storm dropped nearly four inches of rain at Matilija Dam above Ojai, 
typically the wettest spot in the county, and more than an inch in Ventura, 
Taylor said. It was the second large storm of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It still brought less than we needed," Taylor said. "We've still got a long 
way to go yet." Ideally, Taylor said, the county would receive three more 
storms bringing two inches each. 
</P>
<P>
"But if we got it all at once, as long as there was no death or destruction, 
that would be OK too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's fourth year of drought could be eased somewhat next week if a new 
storm arrives as predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer predicts that warmer temperatures in the 60s on the coast and 70s 
inland late this week will give way to cooler weather and more rain by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Growers welcome rain as both an end to drought conditions that plague the 
county and as protection against frost. Moisture, either falling or in the 
ground, keeps ground temperatures up and lessens the chance of a hard freeze, 
Schaeffer said. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks leading up to last week's freeze, the ground was dry and the sky 
was clear, Schaeffer said. There was no cloud cover to hold in warm air. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad frost," McGrath said. "It was the kind where we had no ceiling, 
so that any type of protection from heaters or wind machines was ineffective."

JONES FINDS THE FAST LANE; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: SPEEDY FRESHMAN SPRINTER TRANSFERS TO RIO MESA HIGH TO BECOME ANGELA 
BURNHAM'S HEIR APPARENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Angela Burnham graduated last June and took her talents to UCLA, Rio Mesa 
High track Coach Brian FitzGerald figured that another athlete of her caliber 
would not come along soon. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Burnham had won five state titles in her four years at Rio Mesa, 
including 100- and 200-meter titles in her junior and senior years. 
</P>
<P>
She had also run in the Olympic Trials and twice was honored as Track &amp; 
Field News magazine's female high school athlete of the year. 
</P>
<P>
No, Burnham was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime kind of talent for a high 
school coach. 
</P>
<P>
But a telephone call FitzGerald received only eight weeks later caused him to 
reevaluate his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
On the phone was Marion Jones, who informed FitzGerald that her daughter, also 
Marion, would be moving to Camarillo from Sherman Oaks to attend Rio Mesa in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
This was the same Marion Jones who had smashed Burnham's national age-13 record 
in the 200 meters (24.90 seconds) with a 24.30 clocking during the summer -- a 
time which would have placed second behind only Burnham in the Southern Section 
3-A Division finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
This was the same Marion Jones who had run personal bests of 12.01 in the 100 
and 56.98 at 400 meters as an eighth grader. 
</P>
<P>
"I had read about her and I knew who she was," FitzGerald said. "I said to 
myself, 'Boy, it would sure be great to have her,' and the next thing I knew 
she was coming here." 
</P>
<P>
Comparisons with Burnham are likely to arise as the season progresses, but 
Jones, 14, would prefer to focus on herself. 
</P>
<P>
"(The state meet) is a long way off," she said. "I just want to try my best and 
see what happens. Angela is a very fast runner and her records will be tough to 
beat." 
</P>
<P>
While the two are certain to be compared by their performances on the track, 
they are very different off it. 
</P>
<P>
"Angela is Angela, and Marion is Marion," FitzGerald said. "The only similarity 
is that they run very fast. Their personalities are complete opposites. Marion 
is a real aggressive and gregarious kid. Angela was very shy and quiet as a 
freshman." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham's younger sister, Alycia, a junior at Rio Mesa who also competes on the 
track team, also notices a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Marion is real outgoing and likes to joke around," Alycia said. "She's real 
nice, but if she doesn't like something, she's not afraid to let people know. 
</P>
<P>
"Angela is real quiet and likes to keep things to herself even when she's happy 
or does well." 
</P>
<P>
Jones would have originally attended either Montclair Prep or Notre Dame, but a 
neighbor, whom Jones calls a "a great track fan," suggested that she should 
attend Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"People will talk about recruiting," FitzGerald said, "but the fact is I think 
her mom was just shopping around to find the best place for her daughter to 
develop. I'm not trying toot my own horn, but I think our results speak for 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa has has won seven league titles in the past eight years, tied for the 
state title in the girls' division in 1988 and finished second last year. 
</P>
<P>
The outdoor season has yet to begin, but Jones put herself into the record 
books indoors at last month's Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Running on the boards for the first time, Jones won the girls' 50-yard dash 
(6.53), ran the opening leg on the Spartans' winning 640-yard relay team and 
anchored Rio Mesa's winning mile relay team with a 57.7-second split. 
</P>
<P>
Her time in the 50 was the fastest ever by a ninth grader and ranks sixth on 
the all-time high school performance list. 
</P>
<P>
FitzGerald was especially impressed with Jones' 440-yard leg in the mile relay. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a big girl to be running on such a small track . . . and hasn't really 
been training for the quarter," FitzGerald said of Jones, who stands 5 foot 9 
and weighs 130 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Jones hasn't had much time to train for track at all: She has been 
playing on Rio Mesa's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Jones led the team in scoring (21.2) and rebounding (14.4) and helped Rio Mesa 
(9-15) win a Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"She jumps so quickly and explosively it's hard to describe," said Rio Mesa 
girls' basketball Coach Al Walker of Jones, who is able to touch a 10-foot rim. 
"She's very confident and just dominates the defensive backboard and 
offensively at the post. She's very competitive and aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
That competitiveness was apparent even during the first week of track practice 
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just doing some repeats up a hill with the cross-country team," Alycia 
said. "Nothing fast, just trying to get into shape and on the first one, Marion 
took off and just starts to run full speed up the hill. We just said 'Marion, 
Marion, relax! We have to do more.' She just looked at Fitz and gave him the 
strangest look and said 'What? Aw man.' ". 
</P>
<P>
But Jones speaks in a very serious tone when she discusses another sport she 
would like to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to give football a try, just on the high school level, not in 
college," Jones said. "It's been done before. Hueneme had one girl and Channel 
Islands had two girls that have played. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can play wide receiver, just like Jerry Rice (of the San Francisco 
49ers). I can catch the ball and I'm fast enough to run with it. " 
</P>
<P>
Worried about injury? 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like any sport," Jones said. "You don't go looking to get hurt. It 
it does, it's just an accident. It's a risk you have to take." 
</P>
<P>
FitzGerald, apparently unaware of Jones' ambitions, shook his head in disbelief 
to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"She actually told you that?" he said. "She's really talented, but that idea is 
really kind of far-fetched." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Marion is Marion and Angela is Angela. 
</P>
<P>
They both run fast. 
</P>
<P>
That's where the similarity ends.

LAUT: AFRICAN TOUR NOT BLACK, WHITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN McALPINE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the day he entered a national record book, Oxnard real estate salesman Dave 
Laut wasn't even sure he should have been competing. 
</P>
<P>
Laut, a shot putter, was at Pilditch Stadium on the outskirts of Pretoria, 
South Africa, on that October day in 1988, part of a contingent of 14 track and 
field athletes from the United States who had chosen to ignore an international 
ban on competition in South Africa. They were risking their eligibility by 
competing in a country where apartheid in sanctioned by law. 
</P>
<P>
Laut admitted he had mixed emotions as he stepped into the shot-put ring at 
Pilditch, with 16 pounds of metal tucked between shoulder and chin. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean here I was, about to throw the shot in South Africa, and I'm thinking, 
'Are you sure you want to do this?' " recalled Laut, who swallowed his emotions 
long enough to launch a 66-foot put -- the longest ever on South African soil. 
"I really had the adrenaline going on that one." 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics Congress, the governing body for track and field in the United 
States, recognized Laut's record by handing him a four-year ban from 
competition. However Laut, an Olympian in 1984, is far from repentant -- 
recently he returned from his third trip to South Africa, a decision he fully 
expects will earn him yet another ban, this time for life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm guessing, but they'll probably give us a lifetime (ban) now because we 
went back," said Laut of the five-meet tour in which he and 13 teammates 
participated in November. "I'm waiting to get the letter any day." 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the U. S. athletes who participated in the original October, 1988, tour 
received TAC suspensions ranging from two to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Laut, 33, said there is no simple reason for his decision to risk punishment by 
competing in South Africa, although money was an important factor. 
</P>
<P>
A standout shot putter at Santa Clara High, Moorpark College, San Jose City 
College and UCLA, Laut earned a bronze medal at the Los Angeles Olympics. The 
following year he won the TAC outdoor championships and, buoyed by those 
performances, drew a bead on the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a job that would provide him with both the cash and the time to 
train, Laut tried out in the summer of 1986 for a position with the Oxnard Fire 
Department. While running with a fire hose, he felt a sharp pain in both knees. 
Ruptured tendons sent him sprawling to the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, which Laut should have spent in training for the Olympics, 
was consumed instead with rehabilitation. His few performances were poor and he 
lost both his momentum and valuable financial support from Nike. 
</P>
<P>
When he took a part-time time as a realtor, his training suffered. At the 1988 
Olympic Trials in Indianapolis, Laut, who needed to finish in the top three to 
win a spot on the team, placed fifth. 
</P>
<P>
When Skip Robinson, the track coach at Pasadena City College, approached Laut 
at the trials and proposed a possible tour of South Africa, Laut was 
apprehensive. Robinson was straightforward -- he told Laut this would be the 
first such tour since 1962 and the first since the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation banned South Africa from international track and field 
competition in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Any athlete who went likely would face repercussions. Laut, however, was ready 
to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like a pretty serious commitment, but I'd lost my contract (with 
Nike) and things were looking pretty bad, so I thought, 'Well, why not take a 
chance and see?' " said Laut. 
</P>
<P>
According to published reports, the U.S. athletes were paid a minimum of 
$10,000 per meet during the 1988 tour and, with performance bonuses, could earn 
much more. Miler Jim Spivey claimed he was offered $200,000 to compete in the 
meets. 
</P>
<P>
Spivey declined the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Though Laut refused to discuss specifics, he said he was paid somewhere between 
$10,000 and $30,000. Whatever the sum, said Laut, money was the only way to get 
athletes to take the risk. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to ask an athlete to risk his eligibility and his whole 
sports career without paying them for it," Laut said. 
</P>
<P>
Though money spurred Laut to take his first trip to South Africa in the fall of 
1988, subsequent trips in April and November were taken for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is the only place in the world I can compete now," Laut said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that everyone who's gone over there has a goal and we're committed to 
seeing it through," added Laut, whose tour teammates have included Olympians 
John Powell, Ruth Wysocki, Tom Petranoff and Gregg Tafralis. "Hopefully through 
our efforts and what we're doing we'll maybe make a dent on this ban on sports 
over there." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. When plans for the first tour were announced, many decried 
the idea, saying it would lend legitimacy to a political system that allows 
South Africa's 27 million blacks no vote and little voice. Critics say the 
tours have fostered no change, and many accuse the athletes who participated of 
ignoring moral concerns for financial benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"The people that went there, they know its wrong," said George Mehale, a South 
African who coaches track and field at Cal State Long Beach. "Nothing changed 
because they went." 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, people are telling me informally that in a way they hurt the 
cause -- not major injury, but they certainly did set things back," said TAC 
President Frank Greenberg, one of several TAC officials who voted to ban the 
athletes who participated in the 1988 tour. "I think it's counterproductive 
when individuals go. Global reaction against South Africa is getting stronger, 
that pressure has already produced some changes." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of sanctions against South Africa say the sanctions contributed to 
President Frederik De Klerk's recent decisions to release political prisoners 
such as Walter Sisulu and Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk also lifted a decades-old ban on the African National Congress and 
more than a dozen other groups dedicated to the abolition of apartheid; eased 
government censorship of the media; and asked his justice department to reserve 
capital penalties for the most severe crimes. 
</P>
<P>
But De Klerk, whose Nationalist Party has ruled South Africa since 1948 and is 
thus responsible for instituting the most repulsive separatist laws, left most 
of the pillars of apartheid intact. The pass laws, which require blacks to 
carry legal documents when traveling outside their townships, are still 
enforced and the nation's black citizens are still not entitled to participate 
in the government or in national elections. 
</P>
<P>
Laut prefers to steer clear of debate. Others, however, vehemently defend the 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent time doing clinics, promoting goodwill and helping people of all 
colors," said tour organizer and coach Dick Tomlinson. "Ours is a purely 
humanitarian effort. We're trying to bring understanding and turn the lights on 
the South African situation so people will realize that there are millions of 
black South Africans who are being deprived of international sport." 
</P>
<P>
Laut said he has seen few signs of segregation during his trips to South 
Africa. Critics argue that Laut and his fellow athletes were sheltered from 
apartheid's worst. Although they were free to travel as they wished -- 
including visits to the volatile black townships of Soweto and Crossroads -- 
one team member admitted there was "a strong possibility" she and her fellow 
athletes were sheltered during their visit. 
</P>
<P>
"We did go different places, but they had an itinerary set up with where they 
were going to take us and what we were going to do," said Pamela Page, a 
hurdler who participated in the most recent tour. Page, who is black, also said 
that despite outward appearances of normalcy, something was amiss. 
</P>
<P>
"People were nice and they kept saying, 'We're trying to change, we're trying 
to change,' but it was still strange," Page said. "I'd be shopping and they 
(white South Africans) would just kind of stop and look at me like, 'Wait a 
minute.' It kind of caught them off guard." 
</P>
<P>
But while Laut admits he knows little about South Africa's politics, he does 
know something of sport and he sees in South Africa a potential track 
powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just an unbelievable amount of talent over there, it's just amazing," 
Laut said. "If they could become a part of the world, they would be a major 
power in track and field in 10 years. That's my sincere belief." 
</P>
<P>
During the November tour, Laut and the rest of the U. S. contingent met briefly 
with De Klerk. According to Laut, the president lent his support to the tour 
and expressed hope that the South African athletes would soon be able to 
compete internationally. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a lot of national pride and I think they would really like to see 
their country get back into international competition," Laut said. 
</P>
<P>
Laut also expresses admiration for the South African athletes who continue to 
train and compete in the face of an international ban that keeps them at home, 
leaving them to compete against the same faces in the same places. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in high school and college I always had that Olympic medal as my 
dream. That was my focus, the driving force that kept me going . . . ," Laut 
said. "The South African athlete doesn't have that dream, but he keeps working 
as hard as we do, maybe harder. To me that determination is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
For Laut, training and competition have also taken on a slightly different 
slant from his college days. He has pared his training substantially -- 
slipping away from work in the afternoon to put the shot at Hueneme High or 
lift weights in the garage of his home. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm lucky, I can get in two hours of training a day," Laut said. "It's not 
what I need, but I know what to do now and I can eliminate a lot of the 
nonsense stuff that I used to do. I just do the exercises that will help me 
throw the shot, which is basically the whole name of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Laut will return to South Africa, possibly as early as April for the South 
African national championships. According to Laut, a full team will probably 
return to South Africa again this fall and there is talk of a contract with 
sponsors and the South African Athletic Union that would guarantee such visits 
for the next three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
Laut's ultimate goal, however, is to compete in South Africa as a member of an 
official U. S. team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to be able to represent the United States, have USA colors, raise the 
flag and compete for the United States," Laut said.

VAUGHAN EARNS 350TH VICTORY, BUT BUENA COACH WANTS A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a 72-37 win over Pasadena on Friday, Buena High girls' basketball team 
gave its Coach Joe Vaughan his 350th coaching victory. 
</P>
<P>
But Vaughan, who turned 46 years old Wednesday, remained his soft-spoken self 
when he recalled his milestone victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather win the Southern Section title than my 350th game," said Vaughan, 
whose team played Orange on Wednesday night. "It's a nice accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a blue-chipper, just a lot of hard-working players. And they 
made it happen." 
</P>
<P>
In 15 seasons as coach, Vaughan has guided the Bulldogs to 12 Channel League 
titles, 10 appearances in the semifinals, five in the semifinals and two 
Southern Section titles. In the state playoffs, Buena has won two regionals and 
two state titles. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball pairings announced: The Ventura, Oxnard and Moorpark college men's 
basketball teams each earned berths in the Southern California Regional of the 
state junior college tournament, which begins this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (25-9), the Northern Division champion of the Western State Conference, 
is the eighth seed and will host Palmar (11-18), the No. 25 seed, in 
first-round action Saturday night. Palmar competes in the Pacific Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard (16-14) is an at-large entrant from the WSC and the No. 15 seed. It will 
host Mt. San Jacinto (20-12) of the Foothill Conference, the No. 18 seed, 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (21-10) was second in the Northern Division, and is the 13th-seeded 
team in the 27-team regionals. The men will be at home for a first-round game 
against Orange Coast (14-13) on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are coming off a 104-89 loss to Ventura in the regular season 
finale, but point guard Sam Crawford scored a school-record 49 points. 
</P>
<P>
The second round of the regionals will be held Wednesday. The final eight teams 
will advance to the state tournament, March 8-10 at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura won the Northern Division last year, and lost to Cerritos in the 
regional finals. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament-bound: The Moorpark and Ventura college women's basketball teams 
began play in the state tournament Wednesday. The Lady Raiders (20-9) won the 
WSC Northern Division for the third consecutive season and traveled to El 
Camino (21-7) in the first round of the 16-team Southern California Regional. 
Ventura (23-9), the 11th-seeded team, traveled to Orange Coast (21-5). 
</P>
<P>
Fine career: The early departure of Buena also signals the end of Jeff Oliver's 
impressive high school career. 
</P>
<P>
In three years, the senior guard set school records for most points in a game 
(52 against Loyola), most points in a season (757), most points in a career 
(1,595), most three-pointers in a season (118) and most three-pointers in a 
career (268). 
</P>
<P>
Oliver also helped Buena set school team marks for most points in a game (120) 
and highest point average (80.2). 
</P>
<P>
Oliver has signed to play for Cal Poly San Luis Obispo next season. 
</P>
<P>
Pauley honors Silky: Jamaal Wilkes, who played for Ventura and Santa Barbara in 
high school, was honored Sunday as a member of UCLA's 1971-72 NCAA championship 
team. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins went 30-0 that season and won their sixth consecutive title and 
eighth overall under legendary coach John Wooden. Wilkes, a sophomore forward, 
started alongside junior Larry Farmer, sophomore center Bill Walton, and senior 
guard Henry Bibby and sophomore Greg Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkes, formerly known as Keith Wilkes in high school and college, continued 
his career with the Golden State Warriors where he was selected Rookie of the 
Year in 1974-75 and the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Wilkes, nicknamed Silk, played his junior year at Ventura 
before transfering to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Although his teams failed to reach the finals, Wilkes was selected the Southern 
Section (Major Division) Player of the Year in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipation: The name Lisa Leslie would strike fear into most opposing high 
school girls' basketball coaches. After all, the 6-foot-5 Morningside senior 
scored 101 points in one half two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Channel Islands Coach Ryle Lynch-Cole wanted the opportunity to play 
Morningside, the defending Southern Section Division 5-AA champion and see how 
the Raiders' 6-0 junior center Sal Tauau matches up against Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been one of our goals all season to play Morningside," Lynch-Cole said. 
"We wanted Sal to get a shot at playing against her before (Leslie) graduates." 
</P>
<P>
And with a 44-42 win over Alhambra on Saturday night in a second round playoff 
game, Lynch-Cole had his wish fulfilled. Channel Islands played top-seeded 
Morningside in a 5-AA quarterfinal game at Channel Islands Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Add Channel Islands: When leading scorers Candis Carper and Tauau sat out the 
second quarter in foul trouble in its win against Alhambra, Lynch-Cole went to 
his bench to find another shooter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a total team effort," Lynch-Cole said. "We needed our bench and they 
came through." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Virgie Juarez, a 5-7 guard promoted from the junior varsity, scored 
nine points, including two three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bonaventure's misfortunes: St. Bonaventure played without 6-5 center Frank 
Huber (flu) and point guard Kevin Zoll (knee injury) and lost last week to 
Paraclete, 66-59, in the 2-A Division playoffs, a team it had earlier defeated. 
</P>
<P>
"The season ended pretty much the way it started," Coach Marc Groff said. "We 
had too many players on the sidelines than in the game and not enough depth to 
counter balance it." 
</P>
<P>
Tired of being stepped on: Santa Paula reached two goals this season under 
first-year Coach Chuck Yuncker. The Cardinals (3-20) won a Frontier League game 
for the first time in four years and finished out of the cellar for the first 
time in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good crop of kids coming up that will be juniors," Yuncker said. 
"People will no longer be able to come here and walk all over us."

DRUGS, POLICE CUTBACKS LINKED TO RISE IN CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard Police Officer Dennis McMasters pointed the flashlight's high beam into 
the suspect's face and scrutinized the man's pupils -- tiny black dots swimming 
in large, brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"You've been using, haven't you?" McMasters said. "You're afraid I'm going to 
arrest you, aren't you?" 
</P>
<P>
McMasters examined the 35-year-old's arms, beginning at the wrist and following 
the blue-green vein to the inside of the elbow, where it bulged uncomfortably 
in a knot. 
</P>
<P>
He checked the backs of both hands and arms, ignoring the tattoo of the woman 
with flowing hair in his search for needle marks. 
</P>
<P>
The man chattered nervously about the drug rehabilitation program he had 
completed and insisted he was clean before McMasters let him go toward the 
orange and blue room doors that dismally offset the beige pallor of the nearby 
motel. 
</P>
<P>
"He's on heroin," McMasters said. "He's been like that forever." 
</P>
<P>
It was the middle of a typical police swing shift in Oxnard -- where everyone 
from the police chief to the patrol officer cites drugs as the city's biggest 
crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not hard to go out and find people under the influence of heroin," said 
McMasters, who was patrolling city neighborhoods south of Woolley Road and east 
of Saviers Road during a recent 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard -- with its memories of bar shoot-outs, riots against police and barrio 
warfare, according to Owens -- long ago assumed the mantle of the crime capital 
of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI crime statistics for 1988 showed Oxnard's crime rate to be twice the 
county average, with 7,816 crimes per 100,000 citizens, double the rate of 
3,875.6 for the county and higher than the national average of 5,664.2. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing drug problem and the FBI statistics, Police Chief Robert 
Owens said, the city's reputation for crime is unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the parochialism of people in Ventura and Camarillo that they enjoy 
looking down their noses at Oxnard," Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
People who think Oxnard is violent are carrying old perceptions from the days 
when the Colonia, the largest barrio in Ventura County, was dangerous, Owens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to get people to forget legends," Owens said. "There was a time 
when the Colonia used to strike fear into people, when you couldn't walk down 
the street without getting beaten up or stabbed or shot or robbed at least." 
</P>
<P>
Owens said crime has been on a downward trend since 1978. However, he said, 
that trend has reversed itself -- with crime rising by 17% since city budget 
problems forced cuts in field personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The city restored about $115,000 to the department budget this fall, but Owens 
is still short on officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying the cuts resulted directly in increased crime, but you can't 
ignore them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The time it takes police cars to respond to a call has risen from 4.57 minutes 
during the 1987-88 fiscal year to 5.47 minutes since the budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't augur well for public safety," Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
Owens' description of the level of crime in Oxnard was supported by two 
relatively tranquil ride-alongs with police in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The officers fielded a variety of calls -- checking dead bodies for foul play, 
calming parents involved in custody disputes and quieting noisy parties. 
</P>
<P>
When not answering calls, McMasters cruised his beat -- circling neighborhood 
trouble spots, heading down back alleys and gracefully maneuvering his car 
around wooden barriers to drive through deserted parks. 
</P>
<P>
McMasters suspiciously watched everything from two boys walking down a sidewalk 
to a bright blue Pontiac that he thought waited too long at a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the city's crime is found along the central corridor of Saviers Road 
and Oxnard Boulevard. But there are pockets of crime in neighborhoods that 
typify suburbia and areas of palatial homes. 
</P>
<P>
More and more crime is found in the Southwinds area in south Oxnard. In the 
Colonia, patrol cars still carry two officers. And a location described by 
police as the most infamous Oxnard crime spot -- the condemned Lemon Tree Hotel 
-- stands on Meta Street just a few blocks from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
And everywhere, the officers contend with the city's drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, officers made 947 drug-related arrests. In 1989, they made 2,972 such 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Owens is applying to the U.S. Department of Justice for a $391,000 grant to 
create a "Street Sales Enforcement Team," four officers who would deal 
specifically with narcotics crimes and field calls from a drug hot line. 
</P>
<P>
He attributes the Oxnard drug problem in part to demographics, postulating that 
Oxnard may have a greater number of the 20- to-30-year-olds who use drugs than 
other county cities. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Oxnard was the place to come for heroin. Its airport and harbor 
provided good access for bringing it into the city, police say. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, heroin was the drug of choice for most Oxnard users. 
</P>
<P>
Now officers say that popularity has been conferred on crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"You can find kids all the time smoking that crack," McMasters said. "It's 
unbelievable. It really is."

BACK TO BASICS: NEWS FOR AFICIONADOS: HEART OF ARTICHOKE SEASON IS LONGER THIS 
YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to "Fresh Facts," the weekly newsletter published by the Fresh 
Produce Council, a locally based trade group, "The 1989-90 artichoke season may 
go down in history as one of the longest on record. Mild temperatures in the 
Castroville area have given artichoke growers an unusually long stretch of 
frost-free weather. 
</P>
<P>
It looks like artichokes will be available right through the spring, without 
the usual break in supply." 
</P>
<P>
To cook artichokes whole, wash each under cold running water, spreading the 
leaves slightly to give a thorough cleaning. Drain and place the artichoke on 
its side on a cutting board. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the stem off near the base (Step 1) so the artichoke stands upright evenly. 
Next, turn the artichoke around and cut off one-fourth to one-third of the top 
(Step 2). 
</P>
<P>
Snap or cut off any small coarse leaves close to the stem, then snip the thorny 
tips of the remaining leaves (Step 3) with kitchen shears. To prevent 
discoloration, rub all the exposed surfaces with a cut lemon (Step 4) or place 
the artichoke in a bowl of cold water that has a few tablespoons of lemon juice 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The center of the artichoke may be removed either before or after cooking by 
spreading the leaves apart (Step 5) until you reach the center cone. Carefully 
pull out the purple-tipped, prickly leaves, exposing the fuzzy choke. 
</P>
<P>
Scrape out the choke with a serrated spoon (Step 6), then squeeze a little 
lemon juice over the surface or dip again in the acidified water. Drain, then 
press the remaining leaves back into shape and cook.

WINTER TOURISM DECLINES SHARPLY IN BAJA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TIJUANA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican tourism officials are dumbfounded about the drop in the number of 
tourists in Baja California this winter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the worst (winter tourism) seasons suffered by Tijuana and 
Rosarito in many years," said William Yu Cong, president of the Tijuana 
Convention and Tourism Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same story in the seaside city of Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
"Tourism has decreased a lot in Ensenada this winter," said Alejandro 
Rodriguez, spokesman for the Ensenada Tourism Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel occupancy rates in Ensenada are down 30% from last year. Business in 
Tijuana's restaurants is down 35% and room occupancy rates are down 60%. 
</P>
<P>
Business at gift and curio shops in Rosarito, just south of Tijuana, is down 
30% and some restaurants are closing, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Some tourism officials blame the state government's lack of tourism promotion 
for its woes. Other say it is the recent increase in toll fees along the scenic 
65-mile Tijuana-Ensenada coastal road. Fees recently tripled to $2.25 for each 
of the three toll stations between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
Others blame the troubles on the 2 1/2-month-old strike at Caliente Racetrack, 
while others say long lines at the border crossings also discourage tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"Visitors come to Rosarito for a few hours to eat and shop and have a good 
time," said Hugo Torres Chabert, owner of the Rosarito Beach Hotel and an 
adviser to the town's tourism bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, when they want to return home, what awaits them at the border? A 
two-hour wait. They become discouraged and will think twice before making the 
trip down here again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tijuana tourism officials say their economy also is being affected 
by local residents crossing to San Diego. The tourism bureau says Tijuana 
residents spent $1.5 billion in San Diego stores last year. 
</P>
<P>
Max Schetter, senior vice president of the Greater San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce, said that although the chamber has no current statistics on Mexicans' 
financial effect on San Diego, Tijuana's figures were "probably in the 
ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Both Torres and Schetter say a third border crossing is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"Those long waits do deter trade and do deter a healthy transportation flow," 
Schetter said. "It acts as a restraint to free flow of traffic between two good 
neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials say that the wait at border crossings is usually about 45 
minutes, but that the number of daily crossings continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Mexican tourism officials will try to overcome the current 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize that the pie is not that big anymore, that the competition from San 
Diego and our own backyard is growing larger," Yu said. "We need to create a 
better tourism infrastructure that will attract a steady influx of visitors on 
a year-round basis." 
</P>
<P>
But some tourism officials say the decrease in tourists is normal for the 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's winter. It's cold and people in California are worried about paying their 
taxes, about sending their children to school, about work," said Fortino

"For us, it's time to retreat a bit and work on mending our fences, on 
remodeling and fixing our businesses, on taking inventory," he said. "We'll 
bounce back. We have been going through these 'crises' for decades and we 
always come out of it fine."

Congressional investigators issued subpoenas Wednesday for three former housing 
officials accused of receiving improper salaries, including one who was paid 
for four jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The House subcommittee that has been investigating scandals at the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development voted to subpoena Paul A. Marguglio, who was 
suspended as executive director of the Passaic, N.J., Public Housing Authority 
following a HUD audit. 
</P>
<P>
Also subpoenaed were his wife, Louise Marguglio, and the Passaic authority's 
suspended deputy executive director, Donald V. Pieri. Both were accused by 
auditors of receiving excessive pay. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Paul Marguglio received more than $245,000 during 1988 for four 
authority jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Marguglio, according to the subcommittee, was paid more than $95,000 as 
the authority's director of administration between January, 1986, and April, 
1988 -- but worked only one day. 
</P>
<P>
Pieri, auditors said, also held more than one job and received more than 
$106,000 in salary. His job as deputy executive director was budgeted to 
receive $57,970 in annual salary.

2 ALIENS TESTIFY TO MISHANDLING BY CITY OFFICERS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ONE MIGRANT TESTIFIES DURING PRELIMINARY HEARING IN MUNICIPAL COURT THAT 
HE WAS BEATEN, ROBBED OF $25 AND PUSHED INTO POOL OF WATER.

Two illegal aliens testified Wednesday that they were kidnaped and robbed by 
two San Diego police officers in separate incidents last August. 
</P>
<P>
The men -- both of whom admitted on the stand that they had violated drug laws 
-- said the officers, Lloyd J. Hoff and Richard P. Schaaf, picked them up on 
street corners downtown, stole cash from their wallets, then dumped them in an 
isolated area near some railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
One of the undocumented workers, Rolando Carrera Reyes, added that Hoff struck 
him several times with his police flashlight in the testicles, tossed his shoes 
in a dirty puddle of water and pushed him into the water. 
</P>
<P>
Hoff and Schaaf are charged with felony counts of kidnaping and robbery and, if 
convicted, could be sentenced to life in prison. Although police officials said 
the two officers were in the process of being fired once the charges were filed 
last month, defense attorney Everett Bobbitt said Wednesday that Hoff and 
Schaaf are still officers and continue to receive paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
They are charged with kidnaping three illegal aliens, but Craig Rooten, the 
deputy district attorney who is prosecuting the case, said one of the alleged 
victims, identified as Ramiro Rodriguez, has not been located. 
</P>
<P>
The other two men -- Carrera Reyes and Arturo Romero Garcia -- appeared in 
court Wednesday at the opening of a preliminary hearing before Municipal Judge 
Nicholas Kasimatis to determine whether there is enough evidence to justify 
them standing trial on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Both men, testifying through a Spanish-language interpreter, said they have 
used many aliases over the years and had come to this country illegally. A 
special videotape was made to preserve their testimony should they flee this 
country before the case goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the courthouse to testify, Carrera Reyes was arrested on 
half a dozen outstanding warrants, the most serious of which named him for 
possession of marijuana for sale. After stepping down from the stand, he was 
led off to jail. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, he said Officers Hoff and Schaaf stopped him after he left a 
downtown disco and drove him to a secluded and dark area near a set of railroad 
tracks. He said they took $25 from his wallet and tore up his identification 
and other papers. He said that they tossed the wallet onto the ground and that 
Hoff struck him with the flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
"He struck me again in the testicles, then he turned me around and hit me in 
the hand with his flashlight," Carrera Reyes said. "He told me to take my shoes 
off. I took them off. He looked at them, and then he threw them in the water, 
some dirty water that flows out of there. 
</P>
<P>
"They just threw me into the water then and left me there." 
</P>
<P>
Carrera Reyes also testified about an incident a year earlier in which, he 
said, the same two officers stopped him on the street, took his money and drove 
him and another illegal alien, identified only as Enrique, to National City. 
</P>
<P>
"They just took my money," Carrera Reyes said. "They took me to National City 
and dropped me off at a bridge. They just let me out." 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination, Carrera Reyes said he had just gotten out of jail when 
he was stopped in August and he lied to police detectives about whether he had 
a job at the time he was allegedly kidnaped and robbed. He admitted using 
marijuana, but said he does not use hard drugs or drink beer. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been caught for selling, but I was arrested once for having 51 
marijuana cigarettes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The second alleged victim, Garcia, testified in a jail uniform. Rooten said 
Garcia is serving time for auto burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia told the court he once was charged with killing a transient, after 
police found him with a lot of blood on his arm. But Garcia said the blood came 
from using a needle to inject heroin and said the murder charges against him 
were later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
On the witness stand, he often slouched and glared at the attorneys. When asked 
to spell his name, he indicated that he did not know how to. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said he and Rodriguez, the alleged victim who has not been located, were 
picked up near the trolley tracks on C Street and taken to the same isolated 
area. He said that they were not struck by Hoff or Schaaf, but that the 
officers did take about $35 from his wallet, along with other items from his 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
"They even took my comb," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing continues today.

SIERRA CLUB ASKS JUDGE TO BLOCK SEWAGE PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: CALLING EXPANSION OF PLANT A WASTE, GROUP WANTS THE CITY TO RETURN 
TO THE DRAWING BOARD FOR A BETTER SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Sierra Club attorney Wednesday asked a federal judge to throw out plans for a 
$2.6-billion upgrading of San Diego's sewage treatment system, arguing that the 
huge project is "not so much a waste water plant but a plant that wastes 
water." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Simmons, a University of San Diego law professor representing the Sierra 
Club, urged U.S. District Court Judge Rudi Brewster to block a proposed legal 
settlement between the city and the federal government and order mandatory 
water conservation measures to reduce sewage flows by 30 million gallons daily 
within eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons asserted in legal papers filed for Wednesday's hearing that Brewster 
could accomplish the same goal by "imposing a sewer hookup moratorium" that 
would effectively freeze city growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Send us back to the drawing board," Simmons asked Brewster. "We can design a 
better (system)." 
</P>
<P>
The arguments came on the opening day of what is expected to be a four-day 
hearing of the Sierra Club's challenge to an out-of-court settlement among four 
government agencies. The proposed settlement calls for the city to complete the 
largest public works project in its history by Dec. 31, 2003, in order to 
comply with federal Clean Water Act sewage treatment provisions. 
</P>
<P>
The upgrading to so-called "secondary" standards would improve the city's 
sewage treatment by 10% over the existing "advanced primary" system before the 
waste is dumped into the ocean. Under plans designed by the city and its 
consultant, as much as 135 million gallons of sewage daily would eventually be 
"reclaimed" for reuse in irrigation by further cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Justice Department and the 
Regional Water Quality Control Board sued the city in July, 1988, to force 
construction of the project and demand payment of fines for city sewage spills 
from 1983 to 1988. The fines have been set aside for future negotiations or a 
separate trial. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the hearing is whether the Sierra Club can persuade Brewster to 
bind the City Council to mandatory water conservation measures that include 
replacement of every toilet in the Metropolitan Sewerage System with ultra-low 
volume 1.6-gallon toilets. The district includes 1.7 million people in San 
Diego and 15 other cities and sewer districts. 
</P>
<P>
By ordering the toilet conversions and other plumbing changes, the system's 
current 190 million-gallon daily sewage flow can be reduced to 160 million 
gallons, even as the city grows over the next 13 years, the Sierra Club claims. 
The proposed sewage system could be substantially smaller, according to the 
environmental organization, saving city taxpayers $200 million to $1 billion 
off the $2.6-billion to $2.8-billion estimated price tag. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, which Tuesday took its first look at planning for a less 
ambitious, 12-point water conservation plan being developed by city staffers, 
opposes inclusion of water conservation measures in the legal settlement, 
preferring to develop the conservation measures separately. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the three other government agencies -- longtime adversaries -- are 
now allied against the Sierra Club and co-intervenor Emily Durbin as a result 
of their agreement last month to settle their differences. 
</P>
<P>
In legal papers and oral arguments Wednesday, city and Justice Department 
attorneys said nothing in the Clean Water Act requires inclusion of water 
conservation measures in a legal settlement that covers treatment of waste. In 
addition, they argued, the Sierra Club's estimates of conservation benefits are 
an unproven, risky foundation on which to base design of an expensive sewage 
treatment system that will serve the city until 2050. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorney Gerald George also asserted that Brewster lacks the 
authority to add the provisions to the legal settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to argue that what the Sierra Club is asking for is required 
by law when, 20 years after the Clean Water Act was passed, they can point to 
no case where it was ordered," George said. 
</P>
<P>
James Dragna, a private attorney representing the city, said after the hearing 
that the Sierra Club demands -- and the sewer hookup moratorium in particular 
-- are a covert attempt to use design of the sewage treatment system to slow or 
stop growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sierra Club attempts to litigate this radical anti-growth program by 
cloaking it in the guise of objections" to provisions of the legal settlement, 
Dragna's legal papers said. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons also objected to elements of the settlement that would allow the city 
to gradually raise a 210 million-gallon daily cap on sewage treated at the 
city's Point Loma plant as the plant's capacity is expanded. 
</P>
<P>
He also wants Brewster to reject the plan's water reclamation provisions 
because the city would be required to reuse only 50% of the 89 million gallons 
that would be reclaimed each day by 2010.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA MOVING TO PHASE OUT USE OF CFCS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica City Council this week directed the city attorney to draft an 
ordinance that would phase out the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, 
or CFCs, over two years. The ordinance is expected to come up for a formal 
council vote next month. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the measure would affect 44 businesses, mostly auto repair 
shops, which use CFCs to recharge auto air-conditioning units, and appliance 
repair shops, which use CFCs to recharge refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would require auto shops to install CFC recycling equipment by 
Jan. 1, 1991. It would require appliance repair shops and home air-conditioning 
maintainance businesses to use recycling equipment by Jan. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also would prohibit the sale of Freon, an air-conditioning 
recharger that can be purchased at auto-parts shops, after Jan. 1, 1991. Fire 
extinguishers containing halon, another ozone-depleting chemical, could not be 
tested under the ordinance.

A Marine Corps pilot ejected safely before his Harrier II fighter crashed into 
the Pacific, and a Marine helicopter was damaged in a hard landing at a 
mountain practice site in separate accidents Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The vertical-takeoff-and-landing jet crashed at sea during what the Marine 
Corps said was a routine carrier landing-qualification exercise near San 
Clemente Island. 
</P>
<P>
Staff Sgt. Tina Foglesong of the Marine Corps Air Station at Yuma, Ariz., said 
the pilot, whose name was not released, was not injured. He was picked up by a 
helicopter and returned to the aircraft carrier New Orleans, from which he was 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
"The crash occurred when the pilot had difficulty during the takeoff phase," 
Foglesong said. The carrier was not damaged in the 2 p.m. accident. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot and plane were assigned to Marine Attack Squadron 311, stationed at 
the Yuma base. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter was coming down about 10:20 a.m. on a mountain landing site in 
Modjeska Canyon at the edge of the Cleveland National Forest, but no injuries 
were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of damage to the CH-53 Sea Stallion, flying out of the Marine Air 
Station in Tustin, had not been determined, Lt. Gene Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials were investigating both accidents.

LAWYER SAYS SILBERMAN NEEDS PROFESSIONAL HELP; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE PROMINENT SAN DIEGO BUSINESSMAN, WHO APPARENTLY TOOK AN OVERDOSE 
OF SLEEPING PILLS, IS SAID TO BE WORRIED HE WON'T GET A FAIR TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Richard T. Silberman's lawyer repeated his contention Wednesday that the 
prominent San Diego businessman's right to a fair trial has been jeopardized 
and said he would oppose prosecutors' request to revoke Silberman's $500,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyer James Brosnahan said the "first priority" is to make sure that 
Silberman, who disappeared for two days last week just two months before he was 
due to stand trial on federal money-laundering charges, gets appropriate 
professional care. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the world sometimes likes to be cynical," Brosnahan said in a phone 
call from his San Francisco office. "But the first priority is to make sure 
that Mr. Silberman is supported professionally and taken care of, as those 
needs exist." 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan did not elaborate on what sorts of professional attention -- medical 
or psychiatric -- might benefit Silberman, or where Silberman has been since 
leaving a Las Vegas hospital Monday. "Under the circumstances, he's getting 
along OK," Brosnahan said. "And he's, I think, he's improving. That's good." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer declined to comment on any non-legal issue relating to the 
disappearance, saying Silberman's family would release a statement today 
detailing "more information about what the situation is and so forth." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who was a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was found 
unconscious in a Las Vegas hotel room Saturday -- two days after he abruptly 
vanished from San Diego -- in what prosecutors have called an apparent suicide 
attempt. Silberman, due to stand trial April 10, had swallowed an unknown 
number of prescription pills, Brosnahan has said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, reputed mobster Chris Petti and three others are accused of 
laundering $300,000 given them by an undercover FBI agent who had characterized 
it as proceeds from a Colombian drug dealer. An FBI report released Friday, the 
day after Silberman was reported missing, alleges that Silberman confessed to 
the money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
In legal papers filed Tuesday, prosecutors claimed Silberman's disappearance 
raised the possibility that he would vanish again, this time to evade trial. 
But Brosnahan said Wednesday that he would contend in a legal brief he planned 
to file today that there is "no basis" to revoke Silberman's bail. 
</P>
<P>
Though Silberman did go to Las Vegas after telling his family he was heading to 
Orange County for a meeting, he "was entitled to travel in the United States" 
and the request to revoke bail is "not a serious" one, Brosnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also said Silberman's departure raised so many questions about 
Silberman's mental state that he should be forced to see a psychiatrist to 
learn if he is still mentally competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
But Brosnahan said Wednesday that might not be necessary. The papers he planned 
to file today would make it clear that "we'll be able to deal with that in such 
a way that won't become a big problem for anybody." He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. also said Tuesday that it was 
"outrageous" for Brosnahan to have contended from Las Vegas over the weekend 
that Silberman could not receive a fair trial before U.S. District Judge J. 
Lawrence Irving, who is presiding over the money-laundering case. 
</P>
<P>
In an opinion issued last week rejecting a defense request to block the 
introduction at the trial of FBI testimony about comments Silberman made to 
several agents upon arrest last April, Irving characterized those comments as 
"self-incriminating." 
</P>
<P>
"My only position with regard to that, and it's one I'm not going to change, is 
that reference should not be made," Brosnahan said. "And, in fact, it should be 
stricken from his opinion. Whether (Irving) will do that or not, I don't know. 
An accurate contention would describe it as the contention of FBI agents. 
That's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
Irving's comment convinced Silberman that the judge had overstepped his 
authority and could not be fair, prompting Silberman's disappearance, Brosnahan 
said Sunday in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Irving also ordered the release of the FBI report detailing the alleged 
confession after finding that disclosure would not jeopardize Silberman's 
ability to receive a fair trial. A federal appellate court affirmed that 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
However, Brosnahan said, the subsequent "barrage of released information is not 
conducive to a fair trial. Various materials have come out in connection with 
various rulings and all that, but the effect of all that is it threatens a fair 
trial. It makes a fair trial difficult." 
</P>
<P>
"There should be jurors who are willing to say to themselves, 'Richard 
Silberman might well be innocent.' And you know why they ought to do it in this 
case? Because he is innocent," Brosnahan said.

LANDFILL FIRM HELPED FUND CITY, COUNTY CAMPAIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Browning-Ferris Industries, which is seeking approval to expand its Sunshine 
Canyon Landfill above Granada Hills to allow dumping there for another 50 
years, has contributed more than $100,000 since 1985 to campaign committees of 
the Los Angeles County supervisors, City Council and mayor, a Times review of 
campaign records shows. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $106,212 donated by the waste disposal company, law firms, 
lobbyists and consultants working for BFI gave an additional $193,610 to the 
elected officials -- for a total of $299,822 from 1985 through 1989. 
</P>
<P>
BFI's lawyers and consultants have other clients with business before the city 
and county, so their donations aren't connected solely with the Sunshine Canyon 
expansion. Even so, the nearly $300,000 given by BFI and the others represents 
literally hundreds of separate contributions by more than a dozen firms 
promoting expansion of the Sunshine dump. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, during 1989, BFI consultants organized small, private fund-raising 
breakfasts and dinners for four City Council members, each of whom received 
campaign contributions from seven to 10 members of the BFI team. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been throwing a lot of money around," said Mary Edwards of the North 
Valley Coalition, a homeowner group that has fought expansion of the dump. "It 
seems every place we go" at City Hall, BFI has "been there first with money," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
BFI has a vast stake in the proposed expansion, which could generate billions 
of dollars in revenue for the firm over the next half-century. The expansion 
has been opposed by neighborhood groups, because it would destroy thousands of 
trees and extend the life of a dump they say has created dust and blowing 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
The landfill operates within the city, but county and city approval are needed 
because BFI's property straddles the city-county boundary and the firm wants to 
expand on both sides of the line. Some elected officials have said they support 
the expansion because of dwindling space in existing landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The county expansion is to be considered today by the Los Angeles County 
Regional Planning Commission and will be taken up later by the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The leading recipient of BFI contributions has been County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich, whose district encompasses the landfill. Antonovich received 
$21,250 from BFI, or one-fifth of all contributions from the waste disposal 
firm and its officials. An aide said Antonovich's contributors "are buying his 
program and philosophy of government, he is not buying theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, whose district includes BFI's other big Los Angeles 
County dump, the Azusa Western Landfill, was the second leading beneficiary, 
receiving $15,650 in contributions from BFI. Schabarum, whose district gets the 
bulk of the county's trash, has opposed expansion of the Azusa dump due to 
concern about ground water pollution, while supporting landfill expansions in 
other areas, including Sunshine Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign contributions have "nothing to do with how he . . . votes," said 
Schabarum senior deputy Judy Hammond. She said Schabarum has been a "driving 
force . . . to establish new landfills throughout L.A. County." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana got $12,500 from BFI, and Mayor Tom Bradley, $6,262. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, City Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents Granada Hills and has 
opposed expansion of the dump, received no money from BFI. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of contributions on specific decisions is a matter of debate. At a 
minimum, critics say, campaign giving builds good will, giving well-heeled 
contributors a political advantage over ordinary citizens. Contributors and 
officeholders generally say the impact is minimal, since a large contributor 
still accounts for a tiny percentage of campaign receipts. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only so many spots on an elected official's calendar," and campaign 
giving merely assures access to decision-makers, said Mark Ryavec of Delphi 
Associates, a BFI consultant. 
</P>
<P>
And with the existing dump at Sunshine Canyon "hanging on by its fingernails," 
Ryavec said, it is "just ludicrous to suggest that Browning-Ferris . . . has 
any impact on what's occurred in the decision-making process." 
</P>
<P>
BFI has taken its lumps from neighborhood activists and Bernson, and its 
treatment by the City Council has been mixed. Still, BFI won two key political 
victories in 1989, a year of stepped-up campaign giving in which more than a 
dozen firms involved in the proposed expansion made campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the City Council granted BFI relief from a previous decision by 
zoning officials that would have virtually closed the dump at the end of 1989 
because of zoning violations. The council instead gave BFI the right to 
continue using the current disposal area through June, 1990, by which time the 
firm is supposed to be dumping in an area farther from nearby homes. The action 
followed a sophisticated phone bank and direct mail campaign in support of the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
And of greater long-term importance for BFI, the supervisors and City Council 
endorsed the expansion in principle through language inserted in a "memorandum 
of cooperation" on development of a city-county landfill at nearby Elsmere 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
In the memorandum, the city and county agreed not only to develop Elsmere but 
to work toward permitting expansion of Sunshine on both sides of the 
city-county line that divides the BFI property. At the county's insistence, the 
city agreed to a clause that could temporarily bar city trucks from the new 
county area of the dump if the city failed to approve expansion on its side of 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsement raised eyebrows among opponents because officials usually avoid 
endorsing controversial projects before public hearings and environmental 
review. In the case of Sunshine Canyon, a public hearing on the proposed county 
expansion had not been held, and the application for city-side expansion had 
not even been filed. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews since, county and city officials have said they are trying to 
head off a "trash crisis," rather than help BFI. 
</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do with running interference for BFI," said Dennis 
Morefield, an aide to Dana. "It has strictly to do with the . . . need for 
adequate landfill capacity to serve Los Angeles County throughout for the next 
several decades." 
</P>
<P>
The 230-acre landfill takes about 6,000 tons of trash per day, or nearly 
one-seventh of the solid waste in Los Angeles County. Space is expected to be 
exhausted by September, 1991. If county and city expansions are approved, BFI 
will be able to fill additional canyon areas with an additional 215 million 
tons of trash. 
</P>
<P>
Dump fees are almost certain to rise, but if BFI continued to charge its 
disposal rates of between $24 and $31 per ton, the 215 million tons translates 
into more than $5 billion in revenue over the life of the dump. BFI has 
declined to provide a revenue estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $106,212 contributed by BFI alone, $63,400 went to the five supervisors, 
and $42,812 to Mayor Tom Bradley and members of the City Council. Donations to 
city officeholders included $7,500 to Citizens for a Livable Los Angeles, a 
committee controlled by Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Marvin Braude that 
fought Occidental Petroleum's plan to drill for oil in the Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
The BFI team includes an array of influential law firms, lobbyists and land-use 
consultants. The lawyers and law firms -- led by Latham &amp; Watkins; Jones, 
Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue; and Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker -- gave 
$135,002 to city and county officials from 1985 through 1989, with half of that 
coming from Latham &amp; Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
The land-use and community relations consulting firm of Handelman &amp; 
Katherman and its partners Ira Handelman and Rob Katherman gave $21,391. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Kindel, former president of the city Board of Public Works and a key 
Bradley fund-raiser, is one of BFI's lobbyists. Kindel and others at her firm, 
Rose &amp; Kindel Inc., contributed $14,125. 
</P>
<P>
Other contributors included Ryavec and Delphi Associates, $6,722, and political 
consultant Lynn Wessell, $4,600. 
</P>
<P>
These firms have been political fixtures, with long-standing relationships with 
supervisors and council members that predate the proposed dump expansion. 
</P>
<P>
But other contributors in the BFI group got into the act last year as the 
project approached a critical stage. 
</P>
<P>
BFI's geotechnical consultant, Purcell, Rhoades &amp; Associates, which is 
based in Hayward in Northern California, had not contributed before last year 
to Los Angeles officeholders, a review of campaign records shows. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1989, Purcell, Rhoades made seven contributions totaling $3,500. 
Antonovich and Supervisor Deane Dana each got $1,000, and five council members 
got $500 apiece -- the most a single contributor can give in county and city 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Irvine-based Ultrasystems Engineers, which prepared the 
environmental impact report on the proposed dump expansion, before last year 
had made a single contribution of $200 to a council member, campaign reports 
show. But in 1989, Ultrasystems donated $2,500 -- $1,000 to Dana, $500 to 
Antonovich, $500 to Supervisor Ed Edelman, and $500 to Councilman Michael Woo. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it affects the outcome of what happens in any respect," said H. 
Randall Stoke of Latham &amp; Watkins, a lobbyist for BFI, referring to 
campaign giving. 
</P>
<P>
Stoke said he did not know if it would hurt not to give, but added, "I'm scared 
to find out." 
</P>
<P>
One BFI consultant, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said 
campaign giving "is the only way you can do business in this town." Another 
said council members all "have their hand out at one time or another . . . , so 
you give . . . and remain their friend, it's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
But the BFI team last year did more than just respond to appeals for money. It 
also put together small fund-raisers for council members. 
</P>
<P>
Last Feb. 24, for example, Ryavec organized a fund-raising breakfast for Woo at 
which Woo raised $3,250 from seven contributors involved with the Sunshine 
Canyon project. Six separate contributors -- BFI; BFI Vice President Michael 
Lawlor; Delphi Associates; Ultrasystems; Purcell, Rhoades; and Paul, Hastings 
-- gave the legal maximum of $500, and Stoke of Latham &amp; Watkins gave $250. 
Maureen Kindel also gave Woo $500 three days earlier, according to campaign 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Last March 23, Handelman &amp; Katherman organized a fund-raising breakfast for 
Yaroslavsky that brought eight contributions totaling $4,000 from BFI; 
Handelman &amp; Katherman; Delphi Associates; Jones, Day; Purcell, Rhoades; and 
Paul, Hastings. Later last spring was when BFI donated the $7,500 to Citizens 
for a Livable Los Angeles, the Yaroslavsky-Braude committee fighting oil 
development in the Pacific Palisades. A BFI official said the contribution was 
made at the suggestion of Ryavec, who was active in the anti-oil fight. 
</P>
<P>
Last April 4, Ryavec organized a dinner for Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores that 
brought nine contributions totaling $4,000 from BFI; Ryavec; Rose &amp; Kindel; 
Handelman &amp; Katherman; Paul, Hastings; Jones, Day; and Purcell, Rhoades. 
</P>
<P>
And on Dec. 20, Kindel put together a fund-raising breakfast for Councilman 
Richard Alatorre that brought in $5,000 -- 10 donations of $500 each from the 
BFI team. Even BFI's consulting forester, Ralph Osterling Consultants Inc. of 
San Mateo, chipped in $500. And Ryavec made a small donation to Alatorre's 
"Feliz Navidad" program of Christmas parties in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Ryavec said these events were organized largely as alternatives to big 
fund-raisers to which some of the contributors were invited. "I would much 
rather sit down in a small group setting as opposed to being part of some big 
cattle herd," Ryavec said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to give a donation, you might as well get something out of it 
besides a bad piece of chicken," another BFI consultant said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores and Alatorre said through aides that they decide issues on their merits 
and not because of campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Woo told The Times: "I was running for reelection. They offered to put on this 
breakfast, and I am aware of that fact, . . . but that's only one of the facts 
that I have to consider." The other facts are "the position of the councilman 
of the district and the position of the neighbors who live near the landfill 
and the pressing need" to deal with "the garbage created by the city." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said BFI has "known pretty much from the start that my views have 
been for neighborhood and community protection, not for the expansion of that 
dump. And that's where I stand, whether or not they host a breakfast for me." 
</P>
<P>
Political contributions "do not always achieve the desired result," but 
"citizens have to ask why is this being done," said Tony Cosby-Rossmann, 
attorney for the anti-dump North Valley Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly feel uncomfortable knowing that the three law firms opposing me 
and their client are contributing so much." 
</P>
<P>
Times researchers Cecilia Rasmussen and Laine Courtney contributed to this 
report.

LEUKEMIA VICTIM BEATS ODDS TO FIND DONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tarzana attorney Marc Smith, suffering from a deadly form of leukemia, searched 
across the country, hoping to beat odds of 15,000-to-1 against finding a donor 
with compatible bone marrow for a transplant that doctors said could be all 
that might save him. 
</P>
<P>
But no donor had been found by the end of January, when doctors feared he might 
have less than a month to live. So Smith agreed to undergo a riskier procedure, 
known as an autologous transplant, using his own marrow. 
</P>
<P>
But just hours before he was scheduled to begin preparatory chemotherapy 
treatment, Smith said, his doctors informed him that a potential donor had been 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's doctors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle were reluctant 
to postpone the scheduled transplant. It would take weeks to complete the tests 
to confirm that the donor was a perfect match. By that time, it might be too 
late to perform the autologous transplant if the donor's marrow was 
incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith opted to take the risk. Wednesday, he learned the gamble had paid 
off: the potential donor is indeed a match and Smith is scheduled to have a 
transplant next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked them into it," Smith said by phone from a sterile, enclosed hospital 
room where he awaits the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt I didn't have the time to wait, but I thought that if there is a 
donor out there, after all we have done to find one, I wanted to have the 
transplant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After learning in November that Smith needed a bone marrow transplant, his 
relatives in Los Angeles and New York launched major drives to find a donor. He 
said they raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay for more than 2,000 
people to be tested, and held more than a dozen testing sessions on both 
coasts. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 18, Smith appeared on a nationally televised talk show and appealed to 
viewers to take the test to become bone marrow donors. Thousands responded, and 
matches were found for several other leukemia patients. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's family members said they were thrilled Sunday, but Smith said he still 
has a hard battle ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
The donor -- who remains unknown to Smith and his family -- cannot undergo the 
30-minute marrow extraction procedure until next week. Smith said that he does 
not know the reason for the delay -- and under the rules of the medical 
exchange, he is not allowed to contact the donor -- but his condition is 
deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said his doctors estimate he has about a 75% chance of recovery if he 
survives the transplant. The odds of that, he said, are about 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, he has beaten the odds once -- finding a donor -- and he is 
determined to prevail over the cancer threatening him. 
</P>
<P>
"I have three little boys and I want to make it," he said. The last-minute 
match, he said, has bolstered his hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"My chances have been increased tremendously by really what is a miracle," he 
said. "If I had come here one day earlier, I would have already started the 
chemotherapy for the autologous transplant and that would have been it." 
</P>
<P>
"It is almost like it is meant to be that I pull this one out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am scared to death, but the bottom line is that I am still here and still 
fighting."

MAIL CARRIER CONVICTED OF KILLING DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacoima postman was convicted Wednesday of cruelty to animals for shooting a 
dog to death while delivering mail on his Arleta route in December, saying the 
dog had bitten him earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Bertran Sterling, 34, pleaded no contest to the felony charge in San 
Fernando Municipal Court after the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office agreed to drop felony charges of carrying a concealed weapon and using a 
firearm in a grossly negligent manner, Deputy Dist. Atty. David R. Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling had pleaded not guilty in January to all three charges. He could have 
been sentenced to three years in state prison if convicted of all counts, Lopez 
said. He now faces a maximum sentence of one year in county jail, 36 months 
probation and a $20,000 fine, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was scheduled for March 29. 
</P>
<P>
"Our office felt the crux of the matter was felony cruelty to animals," Lopez 
said. "It's a good disposition." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling was arrested Dec. 26 after he shot Skippy, a German shepherd mixed 
breed, just as the dog's owner, Tammie Brody, emerged from her house to give 
him a bottle of vodka for Christmas. Brody said Sterling "freaked out" and 
fired a .22-caliber revolver at the dog, which she said was not menacing him. 
</P>
<P>
But Sterling's attorney, Salvatore P. Ciulla, said the dog attacked him, and 
Sterling told police after his arrest that the dog had bitten him on previous 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
An examination by a private veterinarian, at the family's request, concluded 
that Skippy had been hit by one bullet in the left side from the rear, 
indicating that he was facing away from the gun when hit. 
</P>
<P>
Brody, in an interview, expressed satisfaction with the plea arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just very pleased with the Postal Service and the Foothill Division of the 
Los Angeles Police Department for the support I've gotten, and I think it's 
because of that that he was convicted," she said. "I just wanted justice done, 
not blood." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said felony charges were brought against Sterling because he was on 
probation for carrying a loaded firearm in a public place and because he had 
been convicted of misdemeanor spousal abuse in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Skippy was buried Jan. 3 at a Calabasas pet cemetery in an elaborate $685 
ceremony. The Postal Service picked up the tab.

FUNDS FOR GROUP FEEDING HOMELESS CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Greater West Hollywood Food Coalition, the group that for two years has fed 
scores of homeless people in Plummer Park, received another setback this week 
when the City Council voted to accept a task force recommendation to transfer 
funds from the coalition to a food voucher program. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision, which came after midnight at Tuesday's meeting, means 
that the coalition will no longer receive an annual payment of $30,000 from the 
city. It is one of several setbacks the group has experienced recently. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the city ordered the coalition to leave Plummer Park by 
March 6 after neighborhood complaints that the nightly feeding program was 
attracting crime and creating sanitation problems. 
</P>
<P>
And last week, a major food source of the coalition's dried up when Drexel 
Burnham Lambert closed its doors for good. The leftovers from Drexel's 
lunchtime meals for its employees made up the bulk of the food that the 
coalition fed to about 150 homeless people each night at Plummer Park. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a good time," said Mike Dean, the coalition's president. "But we 
are not going to let this get us down; we are going to continue to do the best 
we can to feed the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's 5-0 decision sets up a voucher system that will provide 
meals in fast-food restaurants, as suggested by a 17-member task force made up 
of residents around Plummer Park, advocates for the homeless and members of the 
food coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the Gay and Lesbian Community Service Center will receive a 
six-month allotment of $15,000, enough money to give roughly 23 people a day a 
$3.50 meal at a local fast-food restaurant. Vouchers will be issued only to 
people who are already taking part in another social service program. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't feed every homeless person in the county," City Councilman Paul 
Koretz said. "The (coalition's) program hasn't worked for the city of West 
Hollywood. There were too many hustlers and drug addicts who were maintaining 
their habits on free meals. They were not being encouraged to change their 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Koretz added, the city does more than most communities in combating 
homelessness. Every night, the West Hollywood Park Auditorium becomes a shelter 
for about two dozen homeless people.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMMONIA SPILLS INTO NEWHALL NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An estimated 8,000 gallons of a weak mixture of ammonia and water spilled from 
an ARCO plant and through a neighborhood in Newhall before being capped 
Wednesday morning, but there were no evacuations or injuries, the Los Angeles 
County Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The leak was reported at 9 p.m. Tuesday at the ARCO steam and electrical 
cogeneration plant near the 20800 block of Placerita Canyon Road, Fire Capt. 
Lynn Mohr said. 
</P>
<P>
The liquid, which was estimated to be more than 96% water, leaked from an 
ammonia holding tank that had a water hose running inside it, Mohr said. The 
solution spilled over the tank and flowed down a canyon and along nearby Oak 
Orchard Road and Oakcreek Avenue into the dry bed of Placerita Creek, Mohr 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The leak was halted by ARCO employees about 1 a.m. Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mohr said county health authorities were notified to investigate possible 
environmental damage. Santa Clarita officials said soil samples were taken from 
the spill area but it had not been determined if contaminated soil would have 
to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
Though several residents called the Fire Department to report the odor of 
ammonia, Mohr said, no evacuations were considered. "It was fairly weak, 
probably weaker than a household cleaning solution," he said. "We chose to let 
the water flow with it and dilute it." 
</P>
<P>
Mohr said the ammonia is used in scrubbers that clean emissions from the plant.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-MORTICIAN GETS 23 YEARS FOR 18 ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former mortician convicted of robbing 18 small businesses and fast-food 
restaurants in the Antelope Valley was sentenced Wednesday in San Fernando 
Superior Court to more than 23 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Meredith C. Taylor sentenced Jimmy Thomas, 38, of Compton to 23 years and 
eight months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted in January of 18 counts of robbery, including special 
allegations that he used a firearm while committing the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
During the robberies, which occurred in the Lancaster and Palmdale areas 
between December, 1988, and February, 1989, Thomas approached store counters, 
showed a gun or simulated one and demanded money, prosecutors said. He usually 
ordered store clerks to retreat to back rooms, bathrooms or closets before 
making his getaway. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of cash taken in each robbery ranged from $35 to $475, authorities 
said. A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigator said he believed 
that Thomas used the money to support a cocaine habit. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who was arrested after one of his victims recognized him, denied 
committing the robberies. During court proceedings, a man claiming to be the 
real robber stood up and confessed, but authorities later determined that 
Thomas had offered the man $10,000 for the admission, court records show.

COLD IS BLAMED IN 8 ANIMAL DEATHS AT ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Colder than usual nighttime temperatures played a part in the deaths of eight 
animals during the past nine days at the San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park, 
zoo officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jouett, a zoo spokesman, said that, since Feb. 12, hypothermia has 
contributed to the deaths of five birds and one newborn antelope at the Wild 
Animal Park. Necropsies performed on two birds that died at the zoo during that 
time also indicate that cold was a factor, he said, adding that similar deaths 
are likely to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"If the weather holds as cold and wet, we'll expect more marginal animals to 
succumb," Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of deaths does not appear "abnormal" considering the below-average 
temperatures, he said. "Each one of them is a regrettable loss, but it's 
something that we take precautions for, and there's nothing we can do." 
</P>
<P>
During the past week and a half, as San Diegans have braced for cold weather 
and high winds by turning up their heaters, zoo staff members have given 
animals some extra warmth as well, Jouett said. As temperatures in San Diego 
and Escondido dipped into the 30s and below, heat lamps and other sources of 
warmth have been provided in most zoo and park enclosures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We take extra precautions," he said. "We put up plastic sheets where necessary 
to act as windbreaks, provide extra straw to floors and nest boxes, leave doors 
open to allow inside access if that's an option." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Jouett said, "sometimes the weather is the last straw for some of these 
animals that are sick or injured." 
</P>
<P>
The recent spate of deaths is not the first related to cold this year. Since 
the beginning of 1990, necropsy reports list hypothermia as a factor in 28 
animal deaths -- 18 in January and 10 so far in February, Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Feb. 12, pathologists have listed the weather as a factor in the deaths 
of a Costa Rican banded barbed-throat hummingbird, a lesser flamingo, an 
African sunbird, a painted stork, an African oriole, a pygmy goose, a bird of 
paradise and a Malayan sambar antelope. 
</P>
<P>
In most of the bird deaths, Jouett said, malnutrition or other ailments 
contributed. The newborn antelope died of maternal neglect complicated by the 
cold, he said. It was on exhibit in a field at the Wild Animal Park where there 
was no artificial heat source. The rest of the animals probably had access to 
"at least a heat lamp -- and some had nesting boxes," Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
Heat lamps, which consist of a bare bulb with a metal shade, have prompted 
criticism from some animal keepers at the zoo, who say animals often burn 
themselves as they attempt to get warm. 
</P>
<P>
Carmi G. Penny, curator of mammals at the zoo, acknowledged that some animals 
have been burned as they huddle near the lamps. 
</P>
<P>
"That has happened," he said in a recent interview. "That's why we prefer not 
to use heat lamps. I do not like heat lamps." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, he said, is that some keepers have placed heat lamps too 
close to the cages. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to know how to use them," he said. "You can burn yourself with an 
electric blanket if you're not careful." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, the lamps have been standard equipment at the zoo for so long 
that it will take time and money to replace them all.

TWO SMASH WINDOW, FLEE JUVENILE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two teen-agers used a cot as a battering ram to break a window pane and escape 
from San Diego County Juvenile Hall on Tuesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths -- a 15-year-old federal detainee and a 17-year-old accused of 
murder -- broke out five minutes after probation officers had routinely checked 
the room they shared, said Jim Poe, deputy chief probation officer of juvenile 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old is charged with smuggling people across the border, a U.S. 
marshal said. The 17-year-old was arrested in the Feb. 16 fatal shooting of a 
35-year-old man at a Logan Heights duplex, said Carlos Armour, chief of the 
juvenile division of the district attorney's office. Murder charges were filed 
against the 17-year-old Tuesday, and a detention hearing had been scheduled for 
Wednesday, Armour said. 
</P>
<P>
The hall, with a capacity of 219 beds, had 405 detainees Tuesday, Poe said. He 
said that police had asked that the 17-year-old be separated from another 
detainee who was also being held in connection with the killing and thus was 
placed in a "less secure room." The more secure area has an extra fence and 
reinforced windows. 
</P>
<P>
Poe said the escape comes at a time when the Probation Department is awaiting 
bids to build a new facility and to upgrade the existing one, which is usually 
filled beyond capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The officers checked the room at 7:55 p.m., Poe said, but were sent to quell a 
fight that had broken out in the day room a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
When they returned to their rounds -- about five minutes later -- they saw the 
broken window, looked out and saw the pair running east toward the fence that 
surrounds Juvenile Hall, Poe said. The boys scaled the fence and disappeared, 
he said, adding that behind the fence are a hill and Interstate 805. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department helicopters and canine units searched but found nothing, 
Poe said.

PRIVATE DETENTION OF CRIMINALS STILL AN OPTION, JUDICIAL PANEL RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite law-enforcement officials' objections to private work-furlough jails, 
San Diego judges will continue to consider placing criminals in the facilities 
on a case-by-case basis, a local judicial panel has decided. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent Tuesday to San Diego Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller Jr., Presiding 
Superior Court Judge Judith McConnell said that local judges will continue to 
use their discretion in deciding whether to place people convicted of a crime 
in a normal county jail or in a private work-furlough facility. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Miller had written to local judges opposing the commitment of 
any criminal defendants to private work-furlough facilities, which are seen by 
supporters as a cost-effective way of alleviating the County Jail crowding. 
Miller's letter stemmed from an opinion issued in January by Atty. Gen. John 
Van de Kamp stating that assigning a person convicted of a crime to any private 
jail operating without a county contract violates state penal codes. 
</P>
<P>
Some local judges, however, have said they believe that Van de Kamp's opinion 
leaves room for interpretation, a position apparent in McConnell's one-page 
letter to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"After additional research and full discussion, we have determined the issue of 
placement of a person convicted of a crime in a private work-furlough facility 
must be decided by each judge on a case-by-case basis," McConnell wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The judges' decision to retain private jails as a sentencing options was made 
by the Superior Court judges' Executive Committee, a panel that reviews issues 
relating to court operations. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates insist that private work-furlough facilities, which inmates can leave 
only to work and pay a daily fee, are suited for minor offenders, allowing the 
county's scarce jail space to be taken up by the hard-core criminal population. 
Based on county figures showing that it costs taxpayers $40 a day to house 
inmates in county jails, the nearly 250 local private work-furlough beds could 
save the county about $4 million annually, according to operators of the 
private detention facilities. 
</P>
<P>
But skeptics complain of inadequate supervision at some private facilities, 
citing past reports of drug use and of guards showing favoritism toward 
inmates. Some private facilities also occasionally failed to meet basic safety 
and sanitation standards. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by those concerns, the state Board of Corrections asked the attorney 
general's office to determine whether courts have the authority to direct 
people convicted of crimes to a private facility that operates without a county 
contract. In his opinion, Van de Kamp said the courts lack such authority. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have resisted awarding contracts to private work-furlough 
facilities on the grounds that such pacts would make the county liable for any 
improprieties that occur. 
</P>
<P>
Although Miller had not yet seen McConnell's letter Wednesday, district 
attorney's spokesman Steve Casey said that Miller is disappointed with the 
judges' decision "because he believes the attorney general's opinion is pretty 
clear." 
</P>
<P>
Some judges, however, have said that, although Van de Kamp's opinion appears to 
rule out sending individuals to private work-furlough centers in cases with a 
minimum mandatory period of custody, they believe that they can still choose to 
use the private jails in instances in which a judge has the discretion of 
either incarcerating or placing a defendant on probation. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see it that way and will continue to oppose committing (inmates) 
there," Casey said. "But, as to the disposition of each case, the judges will 
get to decide that. That's why they sit up higher than we do."

PLAN SINKS FOR HOMES AT RESERVOIR; 
</P>
<P>
CONTROVERSY: AN AIDE TO MAYOR BRADLEY SAYS THE PROPOSAL FOR TEACHERS' HOUSING 
APPEARS TO BE DEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A top aide to Mayor Tom Bradley who initiated the idea to develop faculty 
housing on city-owned Chatsworth Reservoir said Wednesday that he will meet 
tomorrow to clarify for Councilman Hal Bernson his concept for the 1,323-acre 
site. 
</P>
<P>
But Art Gastelum, director of the Mayor's Office of Economic Development, said 
he would not use the meeting to lobby Bernson to support the idea of faculty 
housing at the reservoir, a dry lake bed in the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson "has reached conclusions based on news reports that were not accurate," 
Gastelum said. "I owe him the courtesy of explaining to him what the concept 
really is -- what the concept really was." Such a courtesy explanation is what 
is intended with tomorrow's meeting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to revive this thing at the Chatsworth Reservoir," Gastelum 
said. "As far as I know it's dead." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson could not be reached for comment about the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson sharply opposed any plan to develop 5,000 housing units for faculty at 
the reservoir. Last Saturday, The Times reported that such a plan was being 
prepared for the site. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was described as moronic by Bernson, who called the reservoir "one of 
the most ecologically sensitive areas in the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
But Gastelum said Wednesday that his idea was to build 500 homes for faculty -- 
over 10 years -- on 156 acres of the reservoir, which is owned by the city's 
Department of Water and Power. "Ninety-five percent of the property would've 
been open space. The parcels I was looking at surrounded the reservoir," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to offer low- to moderate-priced housing for sale to teachers as 
an incentive for them to move to Los Angeles. The idea of using housing as a 
lure is still being explored by Gastelum. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum said the parcels he was reviewing for development lie outside the 
actual reservoir, which is bounded by a concrete embankment. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum, who also is Bradley's liaison to the DWP, said the reservoir is 
grossly under-utilized. "DWP has an asset there that's not doing anything. We 
shouldn't leave it the way it is," he said. "It's costing $100,000 a year just 
to cut the weeds there. It doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
The property now sits idle. Trespassing is forbidden. At the very least, hikers 
and naturalists should be able to trek through the area, Gastelum said. Very 
infrequently naturalist groups are permitted to enter the property, for 
example, to count the migrating Canada geese that use a pond at the north end 
of the property, DWP officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The reservoir, built in the 1930s primarily to provide irrigation water for 
orchards and farms in the West Valley, was drained in 1969 to prepare it for 
improvements. It has been empty ever since. In the early 1970s plans to restore 
the reservoir were dropped due to the high cost of complying with new state 
laws about the earthquake safety of dams, such as the one at the reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as March, 1988, DWP was exploring possible sale of portions of the 
property. In a March, 1988, letter DWP real estate executives objected to a 
proposal to zone the property for agricultural use on the grounds that such a 
restrictive designation would hurt the property's value, as DWP contemplated 
selling "substantial portions" of the reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
But DWP now has no plans to dispose of any part of the property, said Ted 
McGillis, DWP assistant chief real estate officer. Its current status will 
continue until the agency gets other directions from the district's councilman, 
the mayor and the DWP board, said Ed Freudenberg, DWP press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's office tried Tuesday to defuse the controversy stirred up by last 
weekend's accounts of the faculty housing plan. In a letter to Bernson, Bradley 
said that the plan was only in its infancy and that the threshold question of 
whether UCLA or the Los Angeles Unified School District were even interested in 
it had not been answered.

RELATIVES AGREE WITH CRASH VICTIM'S TRANSFUSION REFUSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Relatives of a teen-age Jehovah's Witness who died after a traffic collision 
with a freight train in Hawthorne said they support the girl's decision in 
refusing a transfusion that might have saved her. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Knight, 19, of Inglewood died Saturday at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew 
Medical Center after she told doctors not to give her transfusions so they 
could operate to repair several broken ribs and internal injuries, the girl's 
relatives said this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We all take our stand," said Gloria Stowers, Knight's aunt and guardian. "We 
know what God's laws require. She had faith in the standard God sent out in 
regard to blood." 
</P>
<P>
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that passages in the Old Testament and New 
Testament prohibit the ingestion of blood. 
</P>
<P>
Medical center officials and the doctor who treated Knight declined Wednesday 
to comment. An autopsy, scheduled for today, may show whether Knight's injuries 
would have been fatal even with a transfusion, said Bob Dambacher, a spokesman 
for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Stowers and other relatives say that Knight's rejection of a transfusion is 
less troubling to them than the official account of the 10:30 p.m. railway 
crossing accident, which fatally injured the teen-ager and killed her cousin, 
Demonte Stowers. 
</P>
<P>
The official account of the accident is based on statements from a Southern 
Pacific railroad conductor, who provided the only eyewitness account to the 
California Highway Patrol, said CHP spokesman Richard Richards. If the engineer 
was interviewed, his statements were not in the accident report, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives know that Knight had just finished getting her hair done Friday night 
when she agreed to drive Demonte Stowers, 20, to his home in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Knight was at the wheel of a new Chevrolet Spectrum and Stowers was in the 
passenger seat as the two rode south on Van Ness Avenue in a heavy rain, said 
Richards. 
</P>
<P>
The car crossed 120th Street traveling at 50 to 55 m.p.h., according to the 
conductor, as it approached an ungated Southern Pacific railroad crossing, 
Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
"For unknown reasons" Knight failed to heed flashing warning signals and 
attempted to cross the tracks in front of an eastbound railroad engine towing 
22 cars behind it, said Richards and Southern Pacific spokesman Andy Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
The train was going 15 m.p.h. -- less than the 20-m.p.h. speed limit -- when it 
broadsided Knight's car on the passenger side, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Stowers died at the scene of massive head injuries. Knight suffered a broken 
pelvis, broken ribs and cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"The reports make it sound like she was really in the wrong and that she could 
see the train and that she didn't stop," said Fred Stowers, cousin to Patricia 
and Demonte. "I refuse to believe that she was trying to outrun the train." 
</P>
<P>
Relatives said Knight drove carefully and always wore a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
Knight had graduated from Morningside High School in Inglewood. She lived with 
Gloria Stowers in Inglewood, where she had worked for the last year in a shoe 
store. She did not drink or take drugs, Stowers said. 
</P>
<P>
Demonte Stowers was a construction worker who had helped dig the Metro Rail 
tunnels in downtown Los Angeles, along with his father and brother, Fred 
Stowers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is so wide open right now," Fred Stowers said. "The bits and pieces 
we have conjured up are not enough to satisfy us and let us know what actually 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Relatives said Knight carried a card in her wallet that stated she should not 
receive blood transfusions under any circumstances. Knight was conscious after 
the accident and told her doctors not to treat her with someone else's blood, 
relatives said they were told. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of our church," Gloria Stowers said. "In order to be obedient to 
almighty God, to gain eternal life, we have to remain obedient to him in 
everything. She realized that."

LAWNDALE GROUP SEEKING CHANGE IN CONDO STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Lawndale residents has begun to circulate a referendum petition in 
an effort to revoke a set of condominium standards adopted by the City Council 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
The condominium standards, which were approved Feb. 15 on a 3-2 vote, are 
designed to give builders the option of putting condominiums on lots where the 
only alternatives are apartments or single-family homes. The standards 
eliminate a requirement that condominiums be built only on lots of at least 
10,000 square feet. Instead, condominiums must meet requirements for setbacks, 
open space and parking. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sarann Kruse and Councilwoman Carol Norman voted against the changes, 
saying they would increase density and parking problems. They suggested that 
voters be allowed to determine what the regulations should be. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Larry Rudolph, who proposed the new standards, has maintained that 
the changes would not increase density because city codes require more open 
space and off-street parking for condominiums than for apartments. He also said 
the standards would encourage replacement of the city's older apartments with 
new condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Marthens, one of 25 residents who began collecting signatures last week, 
said the group believes the new regulations will greatly affect residents and 
that voters should determine whether the standards will benefit or harm 
development in the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Neil Roth said that if the group collects 10% of the 9,751 voters in 
Lawndale, the City Council must either revoke the standards or place them on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The group has until March 17 to collect the signatures, he said. Roth said if 
he finds that at least 975 of the signatures are valid, the new standards will 
be suspended until voters decide the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said the deadline for placing a measure on the April 10 ballot has passed. 
The deadline for placing a measure on the ballot for the June 5 runoff 
elections is March 9, according to officials at the Los Angeles County 
registrar recorder's office. The deadline for getting a measure on the ballot 
for the Nov. 6 General Election will be Aug. 10, officials said.

ROCKWELL SAYS WELLS ONLY SHOW NORMAL RADIOACTIVITY; 
</P>
<P>
WATER: SAMPLES AT THE SANTA SUSANA LAB FIND NATURALLY OCCURRING RADIATION, THE 
COMPANY SAYS. EPA OFFICIALS ARE SKEPTICAL. 
</P>

<P>
Water samples taken from new monitoring wells at Rockwell International's Santa 
Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth show only naturally occurring levels 
of radioactivity, a company official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The data from the wells make up "the best report we've had" since controversy 
erupted last spring over environmental problems at Santa Susana, said Steve 
Lafflam, manager of environmental affairs for Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, 
which operates the research complex in the Simi Hills. "I think it really 
confirms everything that we've been trying to put out to the public all along." 
</P>
<P>
In a press release accompanying the data, Rockwell said the tests confirmed 
that nuclear operations at Santa Susana "have in no way impacted ground water." 
But an official with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said he was 
unsure the data support that conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The radioactivity measurements were the first taken of water from 18 monitoring 
wells that were drilled last summer in an area of the field lab where Rockwell 
has done nuclear work for the U.S. Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
The private lab retained by Rockwell noted that cobalt-60 and certain other 
man-made radioactive substances were not found in the well water. However, the 
lab reported that it did detect low levels of radioactive tritium in some wells 
at concentrations of up to 699 picocuries per liter. A picocurie is a unit of 
radiation measurement. 
</P>
<P>
Although such levels "aren't significant" in terms of health risk, according to 
Gregg Dempsey, chief of the field studies branch for the EPA's Office of 
Radiation Programs in Las Vegas, the levels appeared to be higher than the 
background radiation that is normal for the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey stressed that he had not yet received the report, but said that if the 
tritium numbers Rockwell cited are accurate it's "not quite the case" that they 
represent naturally occurring amounts. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell officials said they will continue sampling the wells on a quarterly 
basis to obtain additional radioactivity data. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical solvents were detected in separate tests of water from the 18 wells 
late last year. Based on direction of ground-water flow, state water quality 
officials said they believe some of the contamination may have seeped off the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell is working with environmental officials to devise a plan for drilling 
off-site wells to determine if contaminants have migrated off the property. 
Officials have said there are no drinking wells in the immediate area.

SLAYING OF PRIESTS INSPIRES TEACH-IN AT LOYOLA ON SALVADORAN CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time since the Vietnam war era, students and faculty at Loyola 
Marymount University on Wednesday held a daylong teach-in to reflect on the 
brutal murders of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador and the struggle for 
democracy throughout Central America. 
</P>
<P>
The assassination of the Jesuits last November in a predawn attack by 
Salvadoran army troops at the University of Central America in San Salvador 
provided the impetus for the teach-in at the Jesuit campus in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
"The leadership of that university, the administrative and academic leadership, 
was just slaughtered," Loyola Marymount University President James N. Loughran 
said in an interview. "They are martyrs." 
</P>
<P>
He said the killings touched the lives of many on his campus and led to the 
cancellation of all classes and an unusual day devoted to large assemblies and 
small discussion sessions on all aspects of the Central American conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big day," Loughran said in opening the teach-in. "May our minds and 
hearts open up." 
</P>
<P>
A spirited but civil discussion followed about the causes and potential 
solutions to the 10-year-old civil war in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Rivas-Gallont, former Salvadoran ambassador to the United States, told 
the audience of more than 800 students and faculty that deep political, social, 
economic, ideological and cultural conflicts that led to the civil war will not 
be solved without outside mediation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been 10 years now that the country has been bleeding to death," he said. 
"It's about time it stops." 
</P>
<P>
Rivas-Gallont and Father Cesar Jerez, president of the University of Central 
America campus in Managua, Nicaragua, differed on what needs to occur to bring 
peace to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas-Gallont said the United States is an "important player" and must continue 
to assist Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani in efforts to strengthen 
democracy by continuing to provide economic aid, including more financial 
assistance to labor unions in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The United States can do more by supporting the peace process than aiding the 
war, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jerez singled out the Bush Administration as part of the problem. "The 
small countries of Central America have been considered by Washington for years 
as the back yard of your country," he told the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Central America under the Bush Administration is part of a Cold War" that pits 
East against West. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the United Nations, the Organization of American States and 
the Catholic Church must mediate the battle between leftist and rightist forces 
in El Salvador and elsewhere in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Jerez said he has told members of Congress that the United States must stop 
military and economic aid to the government of El Salvador "if it is clear that 
they are violating human rights." 
</P>
<P>
If the United States does not stop aid to El Salvador, Jerez urged that it be 
conditioned on establishment of a dialogue between the warring factions -- the 
government, the army and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). 
</P>
<P>
Both agreed that the slayings of the Jesuits, their cook and her teen-age 
daughter were, as Rivas-Gallont put it, "abhorrent, heinous murders" and that 
the perpetrators must be brought to justice. 
</P>
<P>
The director of El Salvador's military academy and eight other members of the 
Salvadoran army have been charged with premeditated murder in the assassination 
of the priests. 
</P>
<P>
Among those killed was the university rector, Ignacio Ellacuria and Vice Rector 
Ignacio Martin-Baro. All the priests were leftist intellectuals and advocates 
of negotiations between the U.S.-backed government and the Marxist liberation 
front. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the deaths of the brothers will stop what is going on," Jerez said. But 
he urged the audience to consider the U.S. role in fabricating the "bullets 
that killed the Jesuits in El Salvador," in the invasion of Panama and support 
for the Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Loughran said in an interview later that it is hoped the death of the Jesuits 
will lead to democratic reforms in El Salvador. "If we can force an honest 
investigation and have a fair trial and bring people to justice, that would be 
a crack in a whole bad situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola student Martha Arevalo, who came to Los Angeles from El Salvador, 
praised the university for holding the teach-in, which she said was long 
overdue. "If people here in the U.S. can understand and be educated about the 
situation in El Salvador," she said, "something could be done to stop the 
thousands of people who are dying and the whole war itself." 
</P>
<P>
Sara Martinez, a panelist who fled the war in El Salvador, expressed the hope 
that events like the teach-in will increase American understanding of the 
problems in her native country and help end the civil war there. She said many 
members of Los Angeles' large Salvadoran community want to return home. "We 
really would like to go back under circumstances of peace and justice," 
Martinez said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN ALLEGEDLY SHOOTS DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Gardena woman will be arraigned today in South Bay Municipal Court for 
allegedly shooting her teen-age daughter in the chest with a shotgun Monday 
during an argument, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Mitchell, 36, allegedly called to her 17-year-old daughter, Tanya 
Copes, from outside the girl's bedroom window at 10:17 p.m. When Copes 
appeared, her mother fired at her with a 20-gauge shotgun, according to Gardena 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a loss of words as to why this occurred," Sgt. Garry Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Copes, a student at Washington Preparatory High School in Los Angeles, was in 
critical condition Wednesday after undergoing surgery at Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, Copes called 911 and said she was having trouble breathing. 
She then ran to a girlfriend's house a block away, where she collapsed, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The mother, who police said did not have an arrest record, is being held in 
Sybil Brand Institute for Women on suspicion of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors described Copes as "sweet" and "friendly" and said they had no 
indication that there were tensions between the mother and daughter. They said 
the mother had been depressed since her husband died late last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Tanya was a good kid," said one neighbor who asked not to be identified. "She 
was one of the most well-behaved kids on the block." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are investigating whether the mother had been despondent since 
her husband's death but said they do not know what led to Monday's shooting. 
Details of the incident are sketchy because Copes is unable to communicate and 
Mitchell has not cooperated with authorities, police said.

SIMI VALLEY SCHOOLS PREPARE TO CUT STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley Unified School District, claiming that it faces an $8-million 
budget deficit next year, has taken steps to cut labor costs by reducing the 
number of assistant principals and school psychologists, among other 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education voted late Tuesday to notify 34 administrators that they 
may be reassigned next year and 32 temporary teachers that they may not be 
rehired if the administrators fill their posts, Supt. John Duncan said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although staff reductions ultimately may not be necessary, the board acted 
because state law requires that most administrators be told of possible 
reassignments and salary reductions by March 15. 
</P>
<P>
The board is scheduled to meet again March 6 and will be asked to consider 
additional budget cuts, most probably in the area of clerical and maintenance 
employees and in some educational programs, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan and board President Helen Beebe said the rest of the district's 
approximately 800 teachers are not expected to receive layoff notices. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done what we had to to keep things as far away from the kids as 
possible," Beebe said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan discussed in closed session Tuesday night, an assistant 
principal's job would be eliminated in each of the district's two high schools 
and four junior high schools. High schools would be staffed with two assistant 
principals instead of three and junior highs with one assistant principal 
instead of two, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
Two elementary schools each currently staffed with a principal and an assistant 
principal would lose the assistant principal position, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of guidance counselors and psychologists would also be reduced, 
although the exact number was not available Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Also subject to elimination would be special-programs coordinators and 
student-activities directors, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, affected administrators would be reassigned to lower-level 
positions with reduced salaries, ultimately replacing temporary teachers. If 
implemented, it could save the district an estimated $1.5 million, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
The board also acted Tuesday to freeze hiring, purchases and travel expenses in 
the current fiscal year, and to reduce substitute teaching costs by 75% and 
instructional-material costs by 10% next year. 
</P>
<P>
Declining student enrollment and limited state funding combined with increased 
labor costs -- especially for medical insurance -- are largely to blame for the 
anticipated deficit, Duncan and his staff told the board. The projected 
$8-million shortfall is about 10.5% of the district's proposed $76-million 
spending plan for 1990-91. Labor costs make up 85% of the budget, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
In another attempt to cut costs, the district has asked the teachers union to 
sacrifice more than half of a salary increase due next year under the terms of 
a three-year-old contract.

HOW WEST WON: FLASH, DASH;

<P>
SOCCER: PREMIER OFFENSIVE PLAYERS CARRY WEST ALL-STARS TO 5-4 VICTORY. CROWD OF 
10,293 TURNS OUT.

<P>
Style and flash got the better of bruise and bash in the 11th Major Indoor 
Soccer League All-Star game Wednesday night in the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The gang from the West showed a lot of finesse and a little bump and grind of 
its own en route to a 5-4 victory before 10,293. 
</P>
<P>
What can you say? 
</P>
<P>
East Coach Kenny Cooper did his best to put together a team of muggers to 
combat the tricky feet of the West. He chose Bernie James and Mike Sweeney of 
the Cleveland Crunch, who, as Socker captain Brian Quinn might have said, will 
never be confused with finesse players. They like to push people around. 
</P>
<P>
But seriously, a team with an offense of Tatu, Preki and Branko Segota is hard 
to stop and even harder to top. 
</P>
<P>
So for Cooper it was just another loss to fellow Englishman Ron Newman, the 
coach of the West who brought Cooper to this country Feb. 19, 1970 to play for 
his Dallas Tornados. Cooper is now 0-3 against Newman in MISL All-Star games 
and 0-3 against him in MISL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't take credit for that," said Newman of his most-recent victory over 
Cooper. "That's the players. We had so much power." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, who says this team from the West can't play a little defense, too? 
Kevin Crow of the Sockers has been defender of the year for two seasons 
running. And Dallas' Doc Lawson isn't too bad. He made a bicycle kick in front 
of the West goal to prevent danger midway through the fourth quarter when the 
East was closing in. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most amazing was Krys Sobieski, the West's 39-year-old goalie, who 
picked up the victory. He made 10 saves, many of them while diving like a kid 
on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the East's four goals were on shootouts. When all was said and kicked, 
the West was just too good. 
</P>
<P>
A chronological look at how the West won: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 7:10 p.m. The players exit the field following warmups. Kids jam against 
the guard rails that separate players from fans and scream for autographs. Most 
players wave and run past. A few stop, sign a program or two and head for the 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 7:38. The lights dim. Limos carrying the players roll onto the carpet and 
the introductions begin. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 7:50. The introductions hit a snag as one of the limos has trouble exiting 
the carpet. After nearly hitting the wall twice and backing up, it finally 
makes it. The fans applaud. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 7:58. Kickoff. Front line for the West is Segota, Tatu and Preki, otherwise 
knows as a goalie's basic nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 8:02. Socker defender George Fernandez streaks down the left sidelines, 
takes a pass from Tatu and sends it whistling into the upper right corner with 
his left foot to put the West up 1-0 early in the first quarter. The shot 
looked like a carbon copy of his goal in the Sockers' 6-4 victory over Tacoma 
Sunday. Fernandez, making his first all-star appearance, was later chosen the 
game's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought about being the MVP of the All-Star game," Fernandez said. 
"Not in my wildest dreams. I just had a good game, just one of those things." 
</P>
<P>
 -- 8:09. West defender Fernando Clavijo, a former Socker who plays for the St. 
Louis Storm, sends a 30-footer into the upper right corner with his left foot. 
West 2, East 0. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 8:14. Handball is called on West. Shootout awarded. Wichita's Chico Borja 
takes it, swerves around West goalie Slobo Ilijevski and scores, making it 2-1. 
A few minutes later, Borja is called for tripping, giving the West a powerplay. 
Apparently, Borja didn't think much of the call. He made a diving gesture with 
his hands indicating he thought Clavijo took a dive. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 8:28. Early second quarter. Preki, who has already missed an open shot and 
muffed a pass, shows a dash of his usual magic, sending a 40-footer into the 
top left corner with his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 8:40. Socker midfielder Brian Quinn lets the referee know what he thinks of 
an illegal substitution call against the West. Hard to read lips, but it was 
something like "Bull Stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 -- 9:23. Early third quarter. East forward Dale Ervine (Wichita) knocks a pass 
off the boards with his heel. Defender Bruce Savage is waiting and heads it in. 
West 3, East 2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 9:44. Forward Gary Heale (St. Louis) gives the West a bit of breathing room 
late in the third quarter, sending in a right-footer at the goal mouth off a 
pass from Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 9:45. The West rolls on. Segota picks up his second point of the evening, 
taking a pass from fellow Yugoslavian and Socker teammate Zoran Karic and 
sending it in to the right corner. The fans go crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 9:51. Before the fourth quarter begins it is announced that Segota has won 
the Super Skills competition, which started Tuesday night and was completed at 
halftime. Segota is presented with a check for $2,500. That's a good chunk of 
change for an MISL player. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 10:01. Forward Dale Mitchell (Kansas City) scores the East's second 
shootout goal, cutting the West's lead to 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 10:19. East midfielder Carl Valentine (Baltimore) scores with 55 seconds 
remaining to give the West a scare. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 10:21. The scare and the game ends with East forward Jan Goossens (Kansas 
City) hitting the crossbar as time runs out. Another MISL All-Star Game come 
and gone. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Socker owner Ron Fowler said Wednesday that the Sockers have ended trade 
negotiations with the Tacoma Stars, who have been attempting to trade Dave 
Hoggan, a midfielder given a 30-day suspension earlier this month by Star Coach 
Keith Weller. "There were too many uncertainties in the proposal," Fowler said.

CHARGERS LOSE PICK TO RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three free-agent players arrived and kicker Chris Bahr left Wednesday as the 
Chargers continued to rebuild under new General Manager Bobby Beathard, but the 
major news was the future player the Chargers will never get. 
</P>
<P>
The club has been informed by the NFL office that it owes the Raiders a 
fourth-round draft choice as part of a complicated 1988 trade that sent 
offensive tackle Jim Lachey to the Raiders and brought the Chargers offensive 
tackle John Clay and running back Napoleon McCallum. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement is the latest bad twist for the Chargers in a trade that is 
one of the blackest marks on the three-year tenure of Beathard's predecessor, 
Steve Ortmayer. 
</P>
<P>
Clay's career as a Charger was ended by a neck injury early in the 1988 season. 
McCallum has never played a down for the Chargers and is on the team's 
military/reserve list while serving as a Naval recruiting officer in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers had sent a 1989 third- and a 1990 fourth-round choice to the 
Raiders when they acquired McCallum in October 1988. Those choices had been 
traded to the Chargers by the Raiders as part of the first half of the deal 
that sent Lachey to the Raiders and Clay to the Chargers in July 1988. Lachey 
was later traded by the Raiders to Washington for quarterback Jay Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
Now the league has informed Beathard the deal also included a provision that 
the Chargers would send their 1990 fourth-round pick to the Raiders if McCallum 
was with the team in 1989. The Chargers were told that although McCallum did 
not play in the regular season he reported for training camp and that was all 
that was required. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the fourth-round pick means the Chargers have 12 selections in the 
April 22-23 draft but only three in the first five rounds. The Chargers have 
the fifth pick of the first round and two choices in the third round, theirs 
and that of Indianapolis. The Indianapolis selection was acquired in the trade 
that sent linebacker Chip Banks to the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
That pick was upgraded from a fourth-round choice when the Colts included Banks 
on their 37-man protected list in the Plan B free-agent program. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also announced their first signing of a Plan B player and the 
decision to not invite one of their own back. It could signal the start of a 
busy final 5 1/2 weeks before the plan's April 1 signing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Plummer, a 6-foot-1, 203-pound safety from Indianapolis, signed a 
two-year contract, said his agent, Neil Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said the contract was for more than $600,000 and included a "high 
five-figure" signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Plummer, 25, came to the Colts from Miami last season in the first year of the 
Plan B program. He was used primarily on special teams by the Colts and played 
in all 16 games, starting two. He joined the NFL out of Mississippi State in 
1986 as a ninth-round draft pick by Denver. He played in 22 games for the 
Broncos before being claimed on waviers by Miami late in the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also said that Bahr would not return as their kicker. Bahr, 37, 
who was signed by the Chargers from the Raiders in last year's Plan B program, 
had been one of 17 players left unprotected by the team. 
</P>
<P>
Bahr made 17 of 25 field goal attempts, including a 45-yarder on the final play 
to defeat Denver, 19-16, in the season finale. The decision leaves the Chargers 
without a kicker on their roster. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also announced the signing of free agent cornerbacks Joe Fuller 
and Tim Jackson. Both were on developmental squads last season and were not 
part of the Plan B program. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller, 25, spent the first five weeks of last season on the Minnesota 
developmental squad before he was dropped because of a back injury. He was 
signed by the Vikings as a free agent in 1989 after three seasons (1986-88) 
with Saskatchewan of the Canadian Football League. Fuller, 5-11, 180, played 
his college football at Northern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 24, was a 1989 ninth-round draft pick by Dallas from Nebraska. 
Jackson, 5-11, 192, spent four weeks on the Dallas developmental squad before 
he was released and signed by Washington for its developmental squad for the 
final month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have an interest in several more Plan B players, according to the 
players' agents. Among those are Chicago running back Thomas Sanders, 
Washington running back Joe Mickles, Washington offensive guard Ralph Tamm and 
Miami offensive guard Tom Toth. . . . Charger players left unprotected in Plan 
B that have drawn the attention of other teams, according to their agents, 
include quarterback David Archer (New Orleans and San Francisco), linebacker 
Joe Campbell (Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City, the Raiders and Seattle) and 
offensive tackle Brett Miller (New York Jets).

The knights upset the Highlanders, the division's top-seeded team, in a girls 
4-A CIF quarterfinal game at La Habra on Wednesday night, 51-44. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery will face the winner of the Los Altos-West Torrance game in 
the semifinals.

The Knights (17-9) first scented victory after a 15-2 spurt that gave them a 
17-10 lead with 4:59 remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery shot just 22% (seven for 31) from the field in the first half 
but still led at intermission, 21-20, taking advantage of 13 Highlander 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra (21-4) held a decided height advantage over Bishop Montgomery but 
couldn't get the ball inside to its 6-5 center, Zrinka Kristic, and two 6-1 
forwards, Ana Kristic and Leslie Ferguson. The Knights' tallest player was 6-0 
Keisa Smith. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half La Habra started well but still had trouble going inside 
against the Knights' defense. Bishop Montgomery held off a fourth-quarter 
Highlander run that effectively ended when Ferguson, who had averaged 16.1 
points a game, fouled out with 6:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights clinched the victory with a 10-2 run in a 3 1/2-minute stretch 
midway through the fourth quarter. That gave them a 48-38 lead with 1:35 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Junior point guard Lily Cabaleiro led Bishop Montgomery with 25 points, 
including eight in the fourth quarter.

DORSEY BEATS CARSON AT BASKETBALL, TOO, 67-53 
</P>

<P>
Unable to exact revenge for a loss in the Los Angeles City Section 4-A football 
championship game, Carson High lost to visiting Dorsey, 67-53, in the 
basketball quarterfinals Wednesday night as guards Kareem Sconiers and Tim Cage 
each scored 16 points for the Dons. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts, who finished the season at 19-9, trailed by two points at the end of 
each of the first three quarters but made just three of 10 fourth-quarter 
field-goal attempts as Dorsey (20-6) pulled away. An 11-0 run by the Dons -- 
including six points by forward Tony Booten -- enabled them to put the game out 
of reach at 64-50 with 1:58 left. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a great team," Carson Coach Richard Masson said of Dorsey. "I think 
they have the best talent in the City. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played a heck of a game. It wasn't so much what we didn't do, it 
was what they did." 
</P>
<P>
Swingman Bobby Kelly led the Colts with 17 points but made just eight of 22 
shots. Teammate Michael Ross had an even tougher time, finishing with six 
points on three-of-15 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Carson led three times, but never by more than three points. Ross and Nkosi 
Littleton (10 points) had the first two baskets of the second half to give the 
Colts their last lead of the game, 32-30. 
</P>
<P>
Despite playing without injured starting center Chris Aaron, Carson was 
effective at controlling the Dons' inside game, Masson said. "But their guards 
took over with their penetration." 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-9 Sconiers, who attacked the basket with aggressive drives all 
night, said team play was a key. 
</P>
<P>
"We came together as a team, as a family, tonight," Sconiers said. "Earlier 
this year, we did have some problems in the fourth quarter, but tonight we got 
it done when it counted." 
</P>
<P>
In a regular-season meeting in Carson, the Colts beat the Dons, 61-56. 
</P>
<P>
"We were losing, but we knew we would win that game when got a comeback going," 
Sconiers recalled. "But we waited too long to get it going. This time we were 
more focused as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Masson said Dorsey's late explosion made the final score misleading. "This game 
just came down to a couple of key baskets," he said. "It could have gone either 
way, so I'm not displeased." 
</P>
<P>
Booten had all eight of his points in the decisive fourth quarter, while 
teammate Lamont Warren (the City 4-A football Player of the Year) added seven, 
including a dunk that capped the Dons' big late run.

LOYOLA WOMEN HAVE 2 TO PLAY, CHANCE AT TITLE 
</P>

<P>
The Loyola Marymount women's basketball team, with an outside chance to share 
in the West Coast Conference title, plays its final games on the road starting 
with a 7:30 p.m. contest today at the University of San Diego. The Lions 
complete the season Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the final games, San Francisco and St. Mary's are tied at 9-2 in 
conference play, followed by Loyola at 7-5. USF and St. Mary's also finish the 
season on the road, each playing at Portland and Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
To share the title, Loyola would need to win both games while both league 
leaders were being swept. However, the Lions, 14-12 overall, have not been a 
good road team, going 2-9 away from home. 
</P>
<P>
The first time these teams played, in Los Angeles, Loyola suffered one of its 
worst losses in its WCC opener against Santa Clara, 67-44, but came back the 
next night to beat San Diego, 78-70. 
</P>
<P>
Guards Kristen Bruich and Lynn Flanagan continue to lead the Lions' attack, 
averaging 14.5 and 12.4 points per game respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Junior center Tricia Gibson, who has a school-record 70 blocked shots, will 
miss the final games due to a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the Lions' forwards have played well. Sophomore Joelle Longobardi has 
led the team in scoring in two of the last five games and was the top rebounder 
in another. Senior Michelle Bettencourt was top scorer twice in the last eight 
games, and sophomore Nicole Taylor has led in scoring once and rebounding once 
in the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego (15-10, 5-7) has one of the conference's top young players in 
6-foot-4 freshman center Chris Enger, who has passed Loyola's Gibson for the 
WCC lead in blocked shots and recently tied a conference record with 24 
rebounds. ALAN DROOZ

La Quinta 60, North Torrance 49 -- They'll be teammates in the fall at UCLA, 
but La Quinta's Amy Jalewalia and North's Laura Collins got acquainted on the 
basketball court a few months early. 
</P>
<P>
So if you could call Wednesday night's 4-A quarterfinal a head-to-head matchup 
between Jalewalia and Collins, then Jalewalia got the best of it. 
</P>
<P>
She poured in 32 points -- one shy of her season average -- to lead La Quinta 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, North's 6-foot center, was frustrated by La Quinta's triangle-and-two 
defense and ended up with 16 points. Collins was double-teamed most of the 
night by Heather Brannan and Janet Kanno. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know how we'd stop Collins," La Quinta Coach Kevin Kiernan said. "But 
somehow we did." 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta (25-3) earned its first trip to the semifinals since 1985. North 
finished at 17-8. 
</P>
<P>
North's box-and-one defense held Jalewalia to only 10 points in the first half. 
Instead, La Quinta's guards went to work from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of set shots from the point by Kanno gave La Quinta an eight-point lead 
early in the second quarter, and the Lady Aztecs stretched the lead to 28-15 at 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
With more freedom in the open court, the 6-2 Jalewalia scored La Quinta's first 
12 points of the second half. She made 11 of her 22 shots on the night, 
including a pair of three-pointers, and added 19 rebounds and six steals. 
</P>
<P>
Collins finished 8-of-13 from the field and grabbed 16 rebounds. North also got 
10 points apiece from guards Carolyn Hiramoto and Faith Hirayama. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to go to the other side to get our shots tonight," North Coach Richard 
Rosato said. "We had a hard time tonight getting the shots we wanted. It was 
just one of those nights." STUART MATTHEWS

Morningside 66, Channel Islands 55 -- The top-seeded Lady Monarchs rallied from 
an 18-point deficit in the second quarter behind 6-foot-5 center Lisa Leslie, 
who scored 14 of her game-high 26 points in the fourth quarter at Channel 
Islands in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie was benched for most of the first half after picking up two fouls within 
the first two minutes of the 5-AA quarterfinal game. 
</P>
<P>
Without its top player, Morningside fell behind 34-16 and trailed 37-22 at the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
She returned in the second half to help the Lady Monarchs (26-3) pull within 
48-45 at the end of the third quarter. Morningside took the lead for good, 
51-49, with 5:44 left to play following back-to-back layups by Akiba Flanagan 
and Princess Murray. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Monarchs will play Chino (25-2), a 58-38 winner over Redlands, 
Saturday night in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance 48, Los Altos 35 -- The Warriors parlayed a tough defensive 
effort and a game-high 18 points from guard Rosa Olloque into a decisive 
victory in the quarterfinals of the 4-A playoffs at West. 
</P>
<P>
Although West Coach Kevin McManus said his team was "sluggish" on offense -- 
the Warriors scored 40 points less than they did in a second-round victory 
Saturday -- he was satisfied with the result. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense did the job," he said. "We did what we had to do to win. It's not 
that we didn't push the ball up the court. We just weren't as quick as we 
usually are." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors held Los Altos' top player, 5-10 center Jennifer Hovelson, to 
eight points. 
</P>
<P>
West (21-5) will play Bishop Montgomery (17-9) in the semifinals Saturday 
night. RUSSELL ANDREWS

THE COLLEGES; 
</P>
<P>
FANS PICK ON WRONG GUY -- REDLANDS PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Critics of college athletics often are quick to denounce college presidents for 
not taking a more active role in establishing policies for their schools' 
sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
That cannot be said of Dr. James Appleton of the University of Redlands, who 
got an unexpected dose of unruly fan behavior at Monday's basketball game 
between Redlands and Occidental -- and came away with a renewed sense of 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Appleton was seated behind the Redlands bench where a group of Occidental 
supporters apparently had dug in to cheer the home team and taunt Redlands 
players. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy wasn't unique. Occidental players had been victimized in much the 
same way by Redlands fans two weeks earlier at Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
Appleton said that while he didn't condone the behavior, he tolerated it until 
Occidental supporters began using what Appleton described as "a hammer" to make 
more noise. 
</P>
<P>
"I leaned over to ask them to please do whatever they wanted but not to use 
that (hammer) -- that I thought it was unsportsmanlike," Appleton recalled. 
"Well, that wasn't appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental fans, whose team went on to lose, 88-83, reportedly created an ugly 
scene by hammering Appleton with abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to lean on the Occidental men," Appleton said. "It was an 
escalation of some bad sportsmanship that has been building. 
</P>
<P>
"(Occidental President) John Slaughter and I talked the very next day and 
agreed that we both had some responsibility for taking a leadership role in 
stating what college athletics are all about. 
</P>
<P>
"At the next game between our teams, we need to make sure that both 
institutions are exemplary in how we treat each other." 
</P>
<P>
Best of the West?: Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist likes to think of the Western 
State Conference as California junior college basketball's equivalent of the 
Atlantic Coast Conference or the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
The comparison has some merit. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the WSC's 11 teams are in the 26-team Southern California regional of 
the state tournament, and three -- Valley, Ventura and Santa Monica -- are 
among the top 10 seeded teams. 
</P>
<P>
The respect the seeding committee had for the WSC is evident in the seeding of 
two teams with similar records. Glendale (22-11), a WSC school, was tabbed 
11th, but Mt. San Jacinto (20-10) of the Orange Empire Conference was 18th. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, probably only one other Southern California junior college conference 
could claim to be stronger -- the WSC women. 
</P>
<P>
The WSC women had the second-, fourth- and fifth-seeded teams, and a total of 
four in the 16-team field of the Southern California regional. 
</P>
<P>
Stepping forward: There are plenty of reasons for Cal State Northridge's 
monthlong slide in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. men's basketball 
standings, but Kendell McDaniels is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4 sophomore forward from Chatsworth High has been the Matadors' most 
consistent player during the past month, in which Northridge has lost six of 
eight games and fallen from first to fifth place in the CCAA standings. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniels has been Northridge's leading scorer four times and its top rebounder 
in three games. He has shot 57.5% from the field and has averaged 14 points and 
7.4 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been playing very well both offensively and defensively," said Pete 
Cassidy, CSUN's coach. "Not only is he scoring, but he's also doing a good job 
inside underneath the boards. We ask him to do a lot and he's responded very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Diminishing returns: For the first 17 games of the season, freshman guard Bill 
Mazurie was Northridge's sixth or seventh man. But he has played less and less 
during CSUN's slump, and his numbers have dropped accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
After averaging 8.2 points, 2.4 rebounds, 2.0 assists, and 18 1/2 minutes a 
game in the first 17 contests, Mazurie played a season-low seven minutes and 
did not score in an 80-77 loss at UC Riverside on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Including the Riverside contest, Mazurie has averaged 3.9 points, 0.9 rebounds, 
0.8 assists and 11 1/2 minutes in the past eight games, during which Northridge 
is 2-6. 
</P>
<P>
Victory needed: It won't count in the NAIA District 3 standings, but Master's 
regular-season finale at Grand Canyon College on Friday could determine whether 
the Mustangs host a first-round game in the District 3 playoffs, which start 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The pairings won't be official until Sunday, but it appears that the Mustangs 
will be the fourth- or fifth-seeded team in the seven-team playoffs, depending 
on how they and Southern California College fare in their final games. 
</P>
<P>
If they defeat highly regarded Grand Canyon, the Mustangs would stand a good 
chance of hosting SCC in a first-round game. But if they suffer a double-digit 
loss to the Antelopes, they probably would be seeded fifth and would play on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
A victory also would avenge an 82-81 loss to Grand Canyon in January and assure 
the Mustangs (19-14) of a 20-win season. 
</P>
<P>
Ratings game: The Cal Lutheran softball team is ranked ninth in the NAIA 
preseason poll, its highest preseason ranking ever. Seven starters return from 
a Cal Lutheran team that finished ninth in the country last season. The Regals 
will open Saturday at home against Cal State San Bernardino.

AGGRESSIVE VALLEY ROLLS TO WIN OVER PASADENA

<P>
The Valley College gym was unusually quiet during the Lady Monarchs' 
first-round state basketball playoff game against Pasadena City College on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But the Valley women made a lot of noise on the court in routing Pasadena, 
85-69, at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We were aggressive on defense and were able to cause turnovers," Valley Coach 
Doug Michelson said. "As a result, we were able to get high-percentage shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We played hard and ran our offense well." 
</P>
<P>
And executed in a dominating fashion from the opening tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
Valley, the No. 2-seeded team in the Southern California regional, sealed 
Pasadena's fate in the first half, racing to a 16-point lead with eight minutes 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The lead grew to 44-24 by the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman guard Sylvia Casteneda led Valley with 16 points, 12 in the first 
half. She also had five steals and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forward Sandrine Rocher pulled down 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We were kind of sluggish at the beginning," said Angela Smith, a sophomore 
from Reseda High who registered career-high totals of 13 points and 13 
rebounds. "But we played great defense and came out with a lot more intensity 
in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
And while Valley was warming up, Pasadena was cooling down. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (28-5), the Western State Conference co-champion, went on a 9-0 blitz to 
expand its lead to 59-29 with 14 minutes 32 seconds to play, and then coasted. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena made a brief run, scoring 10 unanswered points in a four-minute span 
to pull within 59-39, but never threatened again. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron Inouye and Cara Vergo each scored 19 points for Pasadena (17-11), which 
placed fourth in the South Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't surprised to win," Michelson said, "when you're the second seed, 
playing the No. 15 seed, you expect to win." 
</P>
<P>
Valley, the state runner-up last season, will meet Mt. San Antonio, a 61-48 
winner over Southwestern, on Saturday. KIRBY LEE

Golden West 115, Antelope Valley 61 -- Sophomore Shawna Armstrong scored a 
career-high 31 points to lead Golden West over Antelope Valley at Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong scored 23 points in the second half, including 18 on layups. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong scored nine consecutive points to help Golden West expanded a 57-33

Gondringer, who scored 21 points, had the other basket in the run. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth consecutive game in which Golden West has scored 100 or more

MILLENDER TAKES OVER FOR CANYONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Seldom does a basketball coach have to tell his leading scorer that she is 
being too unselfish, but that's what College of the Canyons Coach Jeff Dunlap 
told Tressie Millender. 
</P>
<P>
As the Canyons women prepared Monday for their first state tournament 
appearance, Dunlap told Millender that it was time she took control. 
</P>
<P>
Millender responded with 32 points, 22 in the second half, to lead fifth-seeded 
Canyons over visiting Fullerton, 71-66, Wednesday night in the first round of 
the Southern California regional of the women's state junior college 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God for Tressie Millender," Dunlap said. "She decided she wanted to take 
us into the second round." 
</P>
<P>
Canyons struggled in building a 33-31 first-half lead against 12th-seeded 
Fullerton, a perennial qualifier and a team Dunlap called the North Carolina of 
women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons trailed, 40-39, early in the second half when Millender took control. 
Millender, a 5-foot-10 sophomore forward, scored seven consecutive points on a 
rebound basket, a three-point shot and a layup. 
</P>

"We were shaky," said Millender, who grabbed a team-high 11 rebounds. "I just 
told everybody to calm down, relax, and we'd get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (16-14) refused to quit, though, and trailed, 60-56, with less than 
10 minutes left. However, Millender wasn't finished, either. 
</P>
<P>
She scored seven points in a 9-0 Canyons run that put the game out of reach, 
69-56. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a real learning experience for us," Dunlap said. "I feel more 
comfortable about the second-round game than I did about this game." 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (24-7) had defeated Fullerton by 30 points earlier in the season, but 
the Lady Hornets played the first game without point guard Candi Burnett and 
forward Kris Kelley.

CSUN TRIPS SANTA BARBARA IN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't so many years ago -- one, maybe? -- that Cal State Northridge looked 
forward to its home match against UC Santa Barbara for one reason only: a 
chance to salvage some respect by upsetting the perennially playoff-bound 
Gauchos. 
</P>
<P>
However, there was no such sentiment before Wednesday night's Western 
Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. match at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
If there was to be an upset on this night, the Matadors knew, Santa Barbara 
would be the team celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the balance of power in this rivalry appeared to have swung. There was 
just the formality of proving it. 
</P>
<P>
Which is exactly what Northridge did in four games, 15-3, 15-7, 8-15, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara, which was supposed to pose a major obstacle for CSUN, was 
instead a relatively small mogul on what now should be a downhill run for the 
Matadors, who are seeking their first postseason playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
The victory placed Northridge three full matches in front of Santa Barbara in 
the DeGroot Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors are 6-5 overall, 4-3 in WIVA play, and are in a second-place tie 
with Pepperdine, two games behind UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara dropped to 5-7, 1-6 in conference play -- which, since Brigham 
Young and UC Irvine are winless in WIVA matches, is good enough for fourth 
place in the division. The top three squads qualify for postseason action. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew this match was crucial for us in order to make the regionals," said 
CSUN's Neil Coffman, who had a match-high 29 kills. "This match could almost 
knock them out of it and put us in." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which plays front-running UCLA at the Wooden Center on Friday, had 
Santa Barbara reeling early with easy wins in the first two games. Then 
complacency seemed to set in. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't nearly as focused as we were in the first two games," said John 
Price, CSUN's coach. "You could tell just by watching Mark (Root) and Neil. 
Early on they were down in their stance early and tuned in. In the third game 
they relaxed a little." 
</P>
<P>
But after dropping the third game, Northridge went ahead, 8-0, and cruised the 
rest of the way in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge hit at a .496 clip against the Gauchos.

NEWMAN'S CHALLENGE DRAWS GUARDED RESPONSE

<P>
Werner Fricker, president of the United States Soccer Federation on Wednesday 
said he had not given a lot of thought to a challenge issued to the U.S. 
national team by Ron Newman, coach of the San Diego Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's media luncheon for the 11th Major Indoor Soccer League All-Star 
game, Newman proposed that a team of MISL American stars play the national team 
in a best-of-three series, the winner advancing to Italy for this summer's 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Fricker, in San Diego for the All-Star game, said, "I believe our schedule 
(leading to the Cup) is pretty well set at this time, but nothing's impossible 
and if we receive a formal request from the MISL we would consider it." 
</P>
<P>
National team Coach Bob Gansler made a similar statement on Tuesday when he 
first heard the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said he didn't think Gansler took him seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he understands," Newman said. "If they don't win (the series) 
they don't go to Italy. Let's put our chips down. If we lose, we lose. If they 
win, great, then they've got the experience of two highly competitive games 
before going to Italy. It's that type of do-or-die pressure they need before 
they go to Italy." 
</P>
<P>
Newman allowed that the MISL side would stand little chance of winning. Indoor 
players, he said, simply are not in outdoor shape. 
</P>
<P>
The national team is handicapped because there is no professional outdoor 
league from which to draw players. But Newman said he thinks it is also 
handicapped by the federation's unwillingness to use MISL players. 
</P>
<P>
Newman has never been asked to lend a player to the national team. 
</P>
<P>
"The USSF people just think the indoor game deteriorates outdoor players," 
Newman said when asked why there hasn't been cooperation between the two 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Fricker disagreed. "We're very cooperative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said he and other MISL coaches would allow their players to compete on 
the national team for a game or two. But the national team often competes in 
exhibitions around the country for up to two weeks at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"We would give them a Kevin Crow if they had a game coming up this weekend," he 
said. "But we wouldn't let our players go for two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Newman admitted that using players from an indoor league isn't ideal when 
preparing for a World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Conditioning wouldn't be a problem for players who knew they would be called 
upon for national team duties, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
"If players knew they were going to play outdoors they could train for it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Forman, MISL Commissioner, announced Wednesday that a four-man committee 
has been appointed to contact the USSF about Newman's challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The committee consists of Roy Turner, Wichita Wings president; Gordan Jago, 
Dallas sidekicks president; Kenny Cooper, Baltimore Blast coach; and Newman. 
</P>
<P>
Said Foreman, "We come in peace with an olive branch." 
</P>
<P>
Branko Segota scored one goal and assisted on another Wednesday to move past 
Stan Stamenkovic as the second all-time All-Star scoring leader in league 
history with 16 points (eight goals and eight assists). 
</P>
<P>
He also moved past Stamenkovic in assists (Stamenkovic has seven). 
</P>
<P>
Segota's goal came at 13:51 of the third quarter, only 21 seconds after St. 
Louis' Gary Heale had also scored for the West. They were the two quickest 
goals scored by one team in the game's history. 
</P>
<P>
Segota's San Diego teammate, Steve Zungul, is the All-Star game leader in 
points with 19. 
</P>
<P>
George Fernandez, a San Diego defender also had a goal and an assist in the 
game, his first All-Star performance. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's luncheon, East Coach Kenny Cooper asked why players had to be 
introduced amid fog and emerging from rocket ships. "Why not let the game stand 
on its own?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the introductions went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Arena went dark, a Frankie Goes to Hollywood tune blasted through 
the public address system, limousines drove out onto the carpet and coaches and 
players emerged into spotlights. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers might get some hate mail for breaking from tradition at the 
All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
When the team moved indoors in the early 1980s, then-owner Bob Bell replaced 
the national anthem with "God Bless America." Bell heard the Philadelphia 76ers 
had done just that and went on a long home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
When Ron Fowler took over before the 1987-88 season, however, he decided to go 
back to the national anthem. But fan complaints poured in and the new owner had 
to change his tune. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday night, Michelle Lovett, lead singer from Dr. Feelgood and the 
Interns of Love, sang the national anthem. It was the first time in more than 
two years the anthem was performed at an MISL game in San Diego.

CITY OFFICIALS HOPEFUL OF LANDING '93 SUPER BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: SAN DIEGO REPRESENTATIVES RETURN FROM MEETING WITH NFL OFFICIALS 
CONFIDENT. CALL BIDDING FOR 1993 GAME A TWO-CITY RACE.

<P>
San Diego officials have returned from a meeting with National Football League 
officials confident that bidding to host the 1993 Super Bowl will come down to 
a two-city contest between San Diego and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think it is going to be between the Rose Bowl and us," said Deputy 
City Manager Jack McGrory, who was part of a five-member San Diego delegation 
that attended the meeting in New York Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix is the other city still in the running for the game to be played Jan. 
31, 1993, but both McGrory and Bob Payne, chairman of the San Diego Super Bowl 
Task Force, said that because Phoenix has not staged a Super Bowl and the city 
has been in the NFL for only two seasons, its chances were lessened. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco had been in the running but withdrew its bid, Payne said, because 
of a disagreement over whether to stage the game at Stanford Stadium or 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
The site for the 1993 Super Bowl will be decided by a vote of the 28 NFL owners 
on March 13 at the league's annual meeting in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Payne said most of the questions from the NFL staff and the three-member NFL 
owners site selection committee concerned the size of San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. The stadium has a permanent capacity of 60,750 for football and the 
city plans to temporarily expand it to seat 73,477 for the 1993 game, as was 
done for the 1988 Super Bowl. Payne said that while the league said the 
expanded stadium is large enough for a Super Bowl, its capacity is well short 
of the Rose Bowl's 104,091. 
</P>
<P>
"As (Philadelphia owner and committee chairman) Norman Braman said, 'The only 
thing wrong with San Diego is about 25,000 seats,' " Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
Braman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Payne said the Rose Bowl's larger capacity could mean a $4 million difference 
in ticket revenue. He said San Diego was trying to counter the difference in 
potential ticket revenue by special fund-raising events and financial 
concessions that could could improve the competitiveness of San Diego's bid. He 
also said San Diego is emphasizing the advantages of the more compact nature of 
the city compared to the size of the greater Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego officials also expressed concern because the most recent of the 
four Super Bowls played at the Rose Bowl was in 1987 so NFL officials might 
want the game to return there before San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have another Super Bowl in San Diego," McGrory said. "The question is 
whether we have that Super Bowl in 1993." 
</P>
<P>
If the city fails to receive the 1993 game, its next opportunity to bid would 
be for the 1995 game. The 1994 game is scheduled to be played in an Eastern 
city.

Henry (22-4). Danny Kotnik added 13 points for the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
San Pasqual 69, Mission Bay 45 -- San Pasqual won despite playing without Erik 
Meek, the second-leading scorer in the county, and having its No. 2 scorer play 
just 14 minutes because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Meek sprained his ankle Friday against Ramona and won't know until today if he 
will be able to play Friday against Crawford in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, with an injury like that it's going to take a couple of weeks to 
heal," San Pasqual Coach Tom Buck said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Banner, the team's No. 2 scorer, got into foul trouble early and spent 
most of the game on the bench. Richard Stark (15 points) and John Koser (14) 
picked up the slack for San Pasqual (19-5).

points, three in overtime, to help lead the Colts at home. 
</P>
<P>
Halton was averaging 26.5 points a game before he suffered a knee injury and 
has been watching from the bench since December. One of his field goals 
traveled three-quarters of the length of the court, giving Crawford a five 
point halftime lead. 
</P>

Grossmont missed the second end of a one-and-one to send the game into 
overtime. 
</P>

<P>
La Jolla Country Day 98, Tri-City Christian 52 -- Damian Campbell and Larry 
Cheng each scored 21 points to lead La Jolla Country Day (18-7). Teammate Eric 
Vandenberg added 18 points. La Jolla Country Day, which led, 47-26, at halftime 
will play Christian Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Marian 61, Calvin Christian 49 -- Marian had three players scoring in double 
figures -- JaMarr Brown (19 points), Richard Carreon (13) and Joe Lagula (12). 
Marian (9-15) led, 34-22, at halftime.

<TEXT>
<P>
Served with soup or salad, this Sicilian-inspired dish is an ideal entree for a 
cool evening. 
</P>
<P>
MUSHROOM SCACCIE 
</P>
<P>
1 package dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
1 cup warm water 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon sugar or honey 
</P>
<P>
2 cups unbleached flour, about 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
2 cups whole wheat pastry flour 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons unsalted butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
2 cups mushrooms, cleaned and sliced 
</P>
<P>
8 ounces Gruyere cheese, sliced into paper thin slivers 
</P>
<P>
In large mixing bowl or work bowl of food processor, combine yeast, water, 
sugar and 1 cup unbleached flour. Let stand until bubbles form, about 5 
minutes. Add salt and whole-wheat flour. Stir or process into dough that is 
soft, but firm enough to handle, adding more unbleached flour as necessary to 
reach this consistency. 
</P>
<P>
Turn dough out onto floured board and knead 10 minutes, until smooth and 
elastic. Place in clean bowl, cover with towel and stand in warm, draft-free 
place until dough doubles, about 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
Punch dough down, turn out onto board and knead 5 minutes. Return to bowl, 
cover and let rise until doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter in large skillet over low heat. Saute onion until tender, about 10 
minutes. Add mushrooms and saute until tender and cooked through, about 10 
minutes more. Remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
Punch down dough and divide into 6 equal portions. Divide Gruyere slices into 6 
equal portions. For each scaccie, roll out section of dough into thin disc, 
about 8 inches in diameter and 1/4-inch thick. Place 1 portion of Gruyere 
slices over center of dough, then spread 1/6 mushroom filling on top. Roll 
dough up from bottom edge, tuck in and press dough along to seal. Place on 
baking sheet. Repeat until all dough and filling are used. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 400 degrees until brown, about 30 minutes. Makes 6 servings.

PROPOSALS TO INCREASE FOOD SAFETY; 
</P>
<P>
PESTICIDES: THE USDA PLANS TO SPEND AN ADDITIONAL $40 MILLION ON MONITORING 
CHEMICAL RESIDUES IN FOOD. THE INCREASED TESTING WILL HELP DETERMINE THE THREAT 
TO PUBLIC HEALTH. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Produce industry representatives meeting here were reassured that the federal 
government would expand its efforts to monitor food for pesticide residues in 
the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who delivered the message at United 
Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Assn.'s annual convention, said the increased 
expenditure was part of the Bush Administration's recent food safety 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will spend an additional $40 million 
beginning in July in order to expand its chemical residue monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
"The food safety issue is of major interest and importance to everyone in this 
room," Yeutter told an audience of about 8,000. "We (at USDA) are going to do 
more (to accumulate) pesticide residue data . . . We have to be credible with 
our data background (in order to set policy and regulations.)" 
</P>
<P>
The secretary's announcement comes almost a year to the date when the Alar in 
apples controversy ignited. The resulting fallout was devastating to apple 
producers, who lost an estimated $250 million in the following months as sales 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Produce merchants were also hit hard when the alleged Chilean grape poisoning 
occurred just days after the Alar scare. The discovery of cyanide in two 
berries caused importers to lose about $100 million when all Chilean fresh 
produce was banned from sale in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The increased USDA pesticide testing will be used to help determine the actual 
health threat to the public from these residues in food. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe the zero-risk standard has applicability in the real world," 
said Yeutter. "To suggest that the risk (from farm chemicals) should be zero is 
nonsensical. We will, however, insist on very low or minimal risk to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
The debate over allowable risk, or the permissible levels of chemical residues, 
is at the heart in the ongoing public and Congressional debate over pesticides. 
At present, there is no encompassing standard for all agricultural chemicals. 
Instead, each compound has different acceptable residues for fresh foods, 
particularly produce. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter said the Bush Administration is also proposing that the federal process 
for canceling the use of a chemical -- such as Alar -- needs to be shortened 
from the present several-year time frame. 
</P>
<P>
Another USDA proposal to cut pesticide usage comes in the form of encouraging 
farmers to rotate crops more frequently from one growing season to another. 
Currently, the federal farm program discourages such changes in the type of 
commodities that are grown. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be more flexible on crop rotations and maybe that will allow us to 
reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers," Yeutter said. 
</P>
<P>
However, some in the audience were not cheered by Yeutter's comments. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, one industry official said that the federal government has more 
than enough data on pesticide residues to regulate the food industry and should 
now begin to reassure the public that the use of these chemicals poses only a 
negligible risk. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it a good use of resources to expand our pesticide testing? No," said Jill 
Snowden, technical director for the Alexandria, Va.,-based United Fresh Fruit. 
"We need to spend more on reassuring the public that the risk from these 
compounds is slight." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, another federal official present at the convention said that expanded 
pesticide residue tests in food would produce no surprises on the exact levels 
of these chemicals in the food supply. 
</P>
<P>
"The rate of residue violations in food would not increase -- plus or minus the 
current margin of error -- if the number of tests were expanded," said Richard 
Ronk, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Ronk said that about 1% of the fresh produce tested by his agency was found to 
be in violation of federal standards in 1988, or the last year for which 
complete data is available. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 15,000 samples of domestic and imported fruit and vegetables tested by 
FDA, 96% were found free of chemical residues. The remaining 3% were considered 
to be in technical violation, or showed traces of a specific compound present 
that was not approved for use on that particular crop. 
</P>
<P>
A former high-ranking FDA official also doubted the benefit of expanded testing 
for farm chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about pesticide residues everyone is scared stiff," said Sanford 
Miller, dean of the University of Texas' Biomedical Sciences Graduate School in 
San Antonio. "But no one can offer the public absolute safety. We can only 
offer relative safety." 
</P>
<P>
A public relations consultant to the Center for Produce Quality, an industry 
promotional group, said that agriculture has had difficulty communicating with 
consumers about pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"What needs to be said is that the 'health benefits of produce outweigh any 
possible pesticide risk,' " said Rob Gould, with the firm of Potter-Novelli in 
Washington. "We're for produce, not pesticides. And we need to differentiate 
ourselves from the (chemical manufacturers)."

MY BEST RECIPE: CHINESE CHOWDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"For many years, I have had a simple fish chowder recipe that used chicken 
stock, rice, bacon and green onions," Sharon Gable writes. "My husband loves 
hot cuisines, spicy food and Chinese cooking, so I combined the three to make 
this soup. 
</P>
<P>
"It took some trial and error to come up with this version; and sometimes I use 
rice or noodles, instead of cellophane noodles. It is hot and spicy, so I serve 
ginger ice cream for dessert, otherwise it's a meal by itself." 
</P>

HEARTBREAK MOTEL;

<P>
OFFICIALS INTENSIFY CAMPAIGN TO CLOSE THE ATLANTIS IN CUDAHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

CUDAHY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sits along Atlantic Boulevard in an area where police say prostitutes ply 
their trade for anything from $40 to three cans of beer and a $15 IOU. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantis Motel consists of two stories of dirt-encrusted, broken-down rooms 
that stink of frying grease. Most of the tenants have lived there for months, 
sometimes years, signing over their welfare checks to the manager to cover the 
$150 average weekly rate. 
</P>
<P>
Many are on drugs, police say. Almost all have small children who play in the 
parking lot and are sometimes spotted bathing in the swimming pool, which reeks 
of urine and too much chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantis has been around Cudahy for 25 years, and every year, according to 
residents, business people and city officials, it becomes a bigger sore spot on 
a busy street lined with some of the town's most established businesses. 
Business people say they can't remember a time when the Atlantis was a decent 
low-budget motel where truckers or traveling businessmen, seeking clean rooms 
and color televisions, came for the night. Instead, they say, it is a place 
where drug deals are made from room windows and prostitutes hook with their 
children in tow. 
</P>
<P>
"Our customers can't even walk down the street without being propositioned or 
asked if they want to buy drugs," said one businessman. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantis, acting City Manager Jack Joseph said, is nothing more than "a 
blot on the city." 
</P>
<P>
Area business people and even some tenants say the only thing that will 
straighten out the old motel is a bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is basically a dump," said one tenant. "The best thing that could 
happen would be to knock it down." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few months the city, with help from the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, has launched a feverish campaign to wipe the Atlantis 
Motel from Cudahy's streets. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have tramped through the security gates innumerable times in the last 
few months for building inspections, fire inspections and Health Department 
inspections. Cudahy building inspector Daniel Pulone said inspectors from his 
office visit the Atlantis about twice a week, noting code violations. 
</P>
<P>
With long lists of violations from the county Department of Health Services and 
county Fire Department, the city is building an arsenal of evidence it plans to 
use to file suit against the owner in an effort to have the motel declared a 
public nuisance and closed. The city recently changed the curb marking in front 
of the motel from a temporary no-parking zone to a no-parking zone in an 
administrative attempt to stop drive-up drug transactions and prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
If the paper work onslaught fails to shut or clean up the Atlantis, city 
officials say they hope law enforcement will succeed. Sheriff's deputies have 
spent 263.3 hours in two months just responding to calls at the Atlantis Motel, 
Lt. Dennis Dahlman said. Dahlman said 36 arrests for prostitution have been 
made and there have been an unknown number of arrests for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major problem," Dahlman said. "But we are not going to give up by any 
stretch of the imagination. We're going to keep pounding on them and pursue 
every avenue to get it closed down." 
</P>
<P>
Shutting the Atlantis Motel for good may not be easy, city officials said. 
Although the motel has a long history of violations, inspectors said, 
violations are corrected within deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
"They do just the minimum to keep us from shutting them down," Pulone said. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a frustrating experience for city officials, who insist that the 
place is nothing more than a haven for drug dealers, vandals and prostitutes. 
One walk through the place, they say, tells the story. 
</P>
<P>
Room 106 of the Atlantis Motel is the room inspector Pulone says is least 
likely to win the Good Housekeeping award. The door has been broken off its 
hinges and rests precariously against the frame. Inside, a double bed with a 
stained mattress dominates the room. There is trash everywhere -- on the floor, 
piled on the kitchen table, crammed into cracks of ripped furniture. The 
curtains are tattered and faded green. The carpet is brown. Everything is 
covered with grime. 
</P>
<P>
This is the room from which deputies say many of the drug sales occur. They 
have arrested one of the women who lives there at least twice on suspicion of 
possessing and selling cocaine. Just last Wednesday, Patricia Hession, 31, was 
arrested after a sheriff's deputy found a pipe he said was used to smoke 
cocaine in her room. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, in cramped Room 209, 19-year-old Becky Sanchez tries to clean up 
after her two infant children. She lives in the $190-a-week room with her 
uncle, a friend and her children. She wants to get out, she said, but has to 
stay home with her children and can't save any money for first and last week 
rent deposit on an apartment. Her brother, she said, pays for everything. 
</P>
<P>
Down the hall, eight people live in Room 206. There are mattresses stacked 
against the wall in the bedroom and two cots in each corner of the bedroom. 
Sisters Carol San, 25, and Marcy San, 19, say they live there because, like 
Sanchez, they can't save the money to move out. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't pay rent and save at the same time," Marcy San said. 
</P>
<P>
Both say they hate being forced to live at the Atlantis because of its bad 
reputation, but they say: "Not everybody that lives here does drugs. We don't 
mess with that stuff, but people think because we live here, we do." 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone blames the condition of the motel on manager James Wu and owner 
Jau Huang. 
</P>
<P>
"The manager doesn't care about us," tenant Sandra Shaw said, plopping down on 
the bed. "There are drug deals going on at all hours of the night, screaming. 
We can't even call 911 because we don't have a phone in the room and we are too 
afraid to go out." 
</P>
<P>
Although Huang has owned the motel only since May, 1988, inspector Pulone says 
he has made no effort to clean it up and, in fact, has let it become more 
squalid. Pulone said Huang told him he bought the place sight unseen for $1.5 
million. Huang is listed on a business card as vice chairman of Radisson Plaza 
Hotel South Bay, which is scheduled to open in July in Carson. According to 
building permits, Huang is vice president of Wei-Chuan Construction, the 
Monterey Park company now building the Radisson Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Huang, who lives in San Marino, is now in Taiwan, Wu said. Representatives from 
Wei-Chuan construction refused to comment on the condition of the Atlantis 
Motel, saying it is Huang's private business, not theirs. However, Wei-Chuan 
Construction pays the water bills, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
Wu blamed the motel's problems on the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"We paint in the afternoon, they writing by the next morning," Wu said. "Who 
can handle? I cannot handle." 
</P>
<P>
Wu, who had a pile of eviction notices on his desk, said he has tried to evict 
unruly tenants, but added: "They don't want to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Pulone is not sympathetic. If Wu can't get rid of unruly tenants, somebody else 
should, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know who I really feel sorry for?" he said. "The kids. All those poor 
little kids."

SCHOOL OFFICIAL, CHALLENGED ON DEGREE, QUITS; 
</P>
<P>
COMPTON: AN INDIANA UNIVERSITY TELLS THE DISTRICT THAT IT HAS NO RECORDS ON 
ASSOCIATE SUPT. JAMES H. TURNER, WHO LISTED A DEGREE FROM THE SCHOOL ON HIS 
APPLICATION.

<P>
The associate superintendent of the Compton Unified School District resigned 
under fire Tuesday after the district learned that he apparently had not earned 
the college degree that he listed on a job application. 
</P>
<P>
James H. Turner was told to resign, said a district source, who added that if 
he had refused, acting Supt. Elisa L. Sanchez would have asked the school board 
to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
Turner emptied his desk Tuesday afternoon and carried his belongings to his 
car. He acknowledged that he had resigned but declined to answer questions 
about his departure, his background or the bachelor's degree he listed from 
Indiana State University in Terre Haute. 
</P>
<P>
In response to district inquiries, Indiana State officials apparently notified 
Compton school officials late last week that the university has no records on 
Turner, who was hired three years ago in the Compton schools as purchasing 
director. In 1988, he became associate superintendent in charge of maintenance 
and administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's first brush with controversy occurred in June, when county education 
officials held up payments to three contractors he had hired to renovate the 
district's administrative offices. 
</P>
<P>
In January, after a six-month review, the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education told district officials that they would not be allowed to pay the 
contractors, because the district should have solicited bids for the work. The 
county by law approves all bills paid by school districts. 
</P>
<P>
One former school district employee told the county that he had warned Turner 
before the contractors were hired that bids should have been sought. According 
to the former employee, Gene Parks, who was business services manager, Turner 
had replied: "I have a way around that." 
</P>
<P>
Turner did not return calls for comment last week. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez insisted last week that the district had acted properly in hiring the 
contractors. She did not return telephone calls Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
School board Trustee Kelvin D. Filer insisted that Turner's departure was not 
related to the bidding issue. Filer would not say what prompted the district to 
begin checking Turner's educational background -- three years after he was 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
However, Filer did say, "I'm furious about the circumstances that have led up 
to this event." 
</P>
<P>
Filer refused to elaborate, but he and another school trustee, Manuel Correa, 
said the district's personnel commission is in charge of all non-academic 
employees and was responsible for checking Turner's background. 
</P>
<P>
Correa said that the district is still investigating Turner's background and 
that the board will issue a statement, probably by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Sam Littleton said Tuesday night that he had not yet been told that 
Turner had resigned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to figure out how he did get hired," Littleton said. "I guess 
personnel must have made a mistake somewhere along the line." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Seidler, director of personnel for non-academic employees, said that 
neither he nor the commission made educational background checks of 
non-academic applicants until a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Seidler was in charge of classified personnel when Turner and several others 
applied for the associate superintendent's position in October, 1988. But he 
said former Supt. Ted D. Kimbrough, who now heads the Chicago school system, 
conducted all the interviews and appointed Turner. The superintendent is 
authorized to hire the associate superintendent and three other senior 
management posts -- controller, risk manager and director of accounting, 
Seidler said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not work for the district when Turner was first hired as 
purchasing director in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Correa said he thinks that district officials began checking Turner's 
background after receiving information that Turner had included false 
information on his job application. Correa said he does not know the source of 
the tip. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has learned that memos about Turner began circulating last month 
among school board members and administration officials. According to sources 
familiar with the memos, Turner was asked to produce evidence that he had a 
college degree. When he failed to do that, the school district contacted the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, when he applied for the position of purchasing director, Turner said 
on his job application that he had studied business economics at Indiana State 
in 1959-60. In 1988, when he applied for his most recent position, Turner said 
on the application that he had received a bachelor's degree in business 
administration and economics from the university in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Turner also claimed to have been in the Air Force and to have worked at a 
health-care management corporation before joining the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Correa said the district will check all the information on Turner's 
application. "Rest assured," he said, "we will get these answers by the end of 
the week." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
James H. Turner, associate superintendent of maintenance and administrative 
services in the Compton school district, has been in the center of a dispute 
over the hiring of contractors to renovate the district's administration 
building. County education officials told school officials last month that 
three contractors cannot be paid for the work because the district failed to 
solicit bids. A former school employee said he told Turner before the 
contractors had been hired that bids should have been sought. District 
officials have insisted that the district acted properly.

DESPITE THE FEUD, HE KEEPS ON TRUCKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a feud brewing in La Crescenta; been brewing there about 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Because he never got the Tonka toys he asked for as a child, Paris Fish grew up 
with an unrequited love for trucks. Big trucks, like a diesel-snorting Kenworth 
tractor. And the trailers that go with it. 
</P>
<P>
When Fish turned 17, he learned to drive -- in an 18-wheeler. That's when he 
bought his first truck. He's been buying and selling them ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"They're big Tonka toys," said Fish, whose curly white beard, ample girth and 
twinkling eyes give him a Santa-Claus like appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Fish's neighbors are not amused. 
</P>
<P>
They don't like the fact that he parks his equipment on a residential street in 
front of their homes. Fish purchased his current "toy" -- a 1950 green and 
yellow Kenworth tractor, once owned by a dairy -- in Texas two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He parks it on the street, near his home in the 4400 block of Raymond Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
He also has a flatbed trailer there. 
</P>
<P>
And a forklift. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say the equipment is unsightly, illegal and a safety hazard, blocking 
the view of motorists on a tight curve at Raymond and Community avenues. They 
have complained to the County Sheriff's Department, the California Highway 
Patrol, the air quality district, the county zoning department and their county 
supervisor. About 25 residents in a two-block area signed petitions of protest 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Fish, 39, has been hauled into court twice. One time he was charged with being 
a public nuisance and faced a jail sentence. He has received innumerable 
tickets and his equipment has been impounded. 
</P>
<P>
On every occasion, Fish beat the charges. He won in a jury trial two years ago 
and last year a Municipal Court judge threw out the case. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and his attorney have successfully argued that county rules permit him to 
keep the equipment at his house, where he has operated a heavy machinery 
brokerage since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Fish's neighbors contend that the business and equipment is 
inappropriate in a residential zone and have not relented. At their insistence, 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich last year asked that the district attorney again 
press charges, according to Ollie Blanning, an Antonovich deputy. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Noyes, a deputy district attorney who closed the case, said he 
rejected a request from the Department of Regional Planning seeking a criminal 
complaint against Fish. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no facts in the report, just neighbors complaining," Noyes said. 
"Besides, it has been to court several times before." 
</P>
<P>
Blanning said most neighborhood disputes are quieted when the offending party 
gives in to pressure and remedies the situation. "But this has not been easily 
solved," Blanning said. "It's been like trying to make Jello stick to a wall." 
</P>
<P>
Fish's detractors claim that the jury decision and court ruling were misguided. 
</P>
<P>
"He's wrong," said Carolyn Holmgren, who moved into the neighborhood with her 
husband five years ago. "He has squeaked under the law. It's just so 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Michael T. Wayland, Fish's attorney, called the complaints from neighbors to 
county and law enforcement officials "a gross misuse of public funds. This is a 
stupid neighborhood squabble, a private war." 
</P>
<P>
Fish, who accuses his opponents of being "a few quarts short," said they are 
just jealous of his hobby of collecting old heavy equipment. "They have never 
come up with a shard of evidence that I have done anything illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"These neighbors, they just like trouble," said Fish, who wears a heavy chain 
around his neck. "They don't have any hobbies. I'm their hobby. If I moved the 
trucks all off tomorrow, they would bug me about the color of my house." 
</P>
<P>
But Fish won't stand still for people bugging him about his trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked old trucks," he said. "I've driven them for years." 
</P>
<P>
He also has a 1928 Ford roadster stake truck, an antique wagon and the 1962 
Corvette he drove in high school -- all stored in a large building he built 
several years ago on his half-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
Fish admits that some of the animosity stems from a transition in the nature of 
the neighborhood since he moved there in 1975. Home values have soared along 
the street where it was once common for residents to keep horses and park 
trucks on the street. Recent buyers are more citified. "They're not what I call 
the more old-fashioned rural type like I am." 
</P>
<P>
Fish said he probably would move his wife and three children to a more rural 
area outside Southern California "if somebody gave me the price for the house. 
I'm not in love with the place by any stretch of the imagination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fish's unwelcome collection in the city is not surprising to officials of the 
American Truck Historical Society, a national organization of heavy equipment 
history buffs with more than 10,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people who collect the hardware -- the vehicles -- have some place to 
keep them, like an old barn in the country," said Roy Stewart, managing 
director. "If you're parking them on a street in the city, well, sometimes 
neighbors are unhappy about that."

DEADLINE NEARS FOR FILING IN SENATE ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Would-be candidates have until Monday to file papers allowing them to run in a 
special election to fill the state Senate seat vacated by the resignation of 
Joseph B. Montoya, who was convicted on corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), the only elected official 
expected to vie for Montoya's seat, is likely to emerge as the leading 
candidate in the heavily Democratic 26th State Senate District. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon will have to pick up more than half the votes in the April 10 special 
election or face a runoff June 5. The special election will determine who 
serves the remainder of Montoya's term, which expires in December. 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled for June 5 is the primary election to determine who will 
represent the district for a full four-year term, starting Dec. 3. Each party's 
top vote-getter will compete in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates who have filed declarations of their intention to run in the June 5 
primary election are Democrats Calderon and Richard S. Gonzales of Baldwin 
Park, Republican Joe Aguilar Urquidi of Alhambra and Libertarian Kim 
Goldsworthy of Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, who was elected to the Senate in 1978, was convicted Feb. 2 of 
racketeering, extortion and money laundering. His conviction grew out of an FBI 
sting investigation into corruption in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The 26th Senate District stretches along the southern part of the San Gabriel 
Valley from Monterey Park to La Puente. Democrats outnumber Republicans more 
than 2 to 1.

DEFENSE SAYS CLIENT'S BROTHER SHOT GUARD; 
</P>
<P>
HOLDUP: PETER GIORDANO, ALREADY ACQUITTED ON THE CHARGES, WILL BE NAMED AS THE 
GUNMAN IN THE SECOND TRIAL OF HIS BROTHER ALFRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The attorney for a man accused of shooting an armored car guard during a foiled 
robbery attempt has told jurors that he will prove his client's innocence by 
implicating another man as the gunman: the man's brother. 
</P>
<P>
In opening arguments in the Pasadena Superior Court trial of Alfred Giordano, 
attorney Robert Swanson said his client was visiting a girlfriend in Orange 
County on Dec. 31, 1987, when Howard White was shot with a machine gun in 
Glendale. White, who was an armored car guard for a security company, was left 
paralyzed by the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
It was Peter Giordano, Swanson said, not Alfred, who attempted the holdup and 
wounded White, now 34. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have contended that Alfred shot and tried to rob the victim while 
Peter drove the getaway car. During an earlier trial, the brothers faced 
charges of attempted murder and attempted robbery. They were dressed and 
groomed similarly and were sitting side by side when White identified Peter 
Giordano as his assailant. White said then that he meant to point to Alfred 
Giordano, instead of Peter, but made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Giordano, 33, was acquitted last May of the charges. The same charges 
against Alfred, 27, ended in a mistrial after jurors deadlocked 11 to 1 in 
favor of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of evidence will point to Peter Giordano, and Peter Giordano alone," 
Swanson told jurors last week. "A man who looks almost identical to Alfred, 
unfortunately." 
</P>
<P>
During four days of trial, Swanson has called Peter Giordano into the courtroom 
several times, asking White and others if they are certain it was Alfred and 
not Peter who assaulted him. Swanson said he may call Peter as a witness, and 
may ask him whether he was the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
That defense may be formidable, said Deputy Dist. Atty. JoAnn Glidden. Although 
the brothers' alleged roles in the crime were different, the charges are the 
same -- and Peter cannot be retried for attempted murder, Glidden said. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be nothing we could do," if Peter admits to being the gunman, 
Glidden said. "He's been acquitted. He has nothing to lose if he comes in here 
and says he actually did it. But I'm not really concerned about it. I think the 
jurors are smarter than that." 
</P>
<P>
In her opening statement, Glidden told the jury she would present several 
witnesses who saw Alfred Giordano shoot the security guard. Glidden said other 
witnesses -- including Alfred's wife -- would testify that he confessed to the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that after you hear the evidence, you'll know this is not a 
whodunit, but that this was a willful, deliberate, premeditated attempted 
murder," she told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend White was leaving a check-cashing business on San Fernando 
Road with an empty money bag when Alfred allegedly confronted him with an Uzi 
machine gun and demanded the money. When White paused, prosecutors said, Alfred 
Giordano shot him five times, grabbed the bag but dropped it after seeing it 
was empty and fled to a nearby alley where Peter was waiting in a car. 
</P>
<P>
Although Swanson has made it clear that Peter Giordano plays an important role 
in Alfred's second trial, the elder brother is now a spectator. He said outside 
the courtroom Tuesday that if he is called as a witness, he would invoke his 
Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and not answer any questions. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Terry Smerling has said he would conduct a hearing to determine Peter 
Giordano's rights if he is called as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
"Swanson has me here because of the identification problem," Peter Giordano 
said. "The evidence does point to me. But if I do take the stand, I don't think 
I'd want to incriminate myself." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, testifying from his wheelchair, White identified his assailant as 
Alfred Giordano, who sat alone. "He was the one. I have no doubt in my mind," 
he told Glidden. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Sherry Maxwell, who was in a convenience store near the 
check-cashing business the morning of the shooting, testified she had seen 
Alfred Giordano, not Peter, walk past her after White was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Another eyewitness who was at the scene also is expected this week to identify 
Alfred Giordano as the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
But Glidden acknowledged that problems may arise with the prosecution's key 
witness: Alfred Giordano's wife, Kimberly. 
</P>
<P>
The woman testified during a preliminary hearing that Alfred told her after the 
shooting that he shot an armored car guard. She also said she saw her husband 
bury a gun in the back yard of her Lancaster home. 
</P>
<P>
In the first trial she admitted to the previous testimony but altered it 
slightly by saying she never saw her husband bury a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Both Glidden and Swanson said they are uncertain what Kimberly Giordano will 
say on the stand. But the prosecutor said other witnesses, such as Kimberly's 
uncle, will testify that Kimberly told them about Alfred's confession not long 
after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson has long argued that Kimberly Giordano had a sexual relationship with 
Glendale Police Officer Joseph Jimenez, the primary investigator in the case, 
and that Jimenez paid her advance reward money to elicit her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Howard, Glendale's assistant city attorney, said Wednesday that a defense 
request for a police department investigation of Jimenez was denied. Jimenez in 
the first trial denied Swanson's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"We will hear testimony by a woman who has been confused and corrupted by all 
sorts of influences," Swanson told jurors last week. "The evidence will show 
that the testimony, whatever it will be, bears more than a little scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Giordano is being held in County Jail without bail.

MANSLAUGHTER VERDICT IN SHOTGUN DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
AZUSA: THE JURY DECIDED THAT THE SHOOTING, PROMPTED BY COMPLAINTS OF LOUD 
MUSIC, WAS A CRIME OF PASSION AND NOT A PREMEDITATED EXECUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old Azusa man accused of murdering his neighbor in a dispute over 
loud music has been found guilty of the lesser charge of voluntary 
manslaughter, as well as three other felonies stemming from the June 30 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Ternus, a truck loader at an electronics warehouse, faces a maximum 16 
years in state prison for the assault, a racially charged incident that 
occurred on a crime-plagued cul-de-sac after a night of beer-drinking. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to be sentenced March 19 by Pomona Superior Court Judge Robert 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had argued that Ternus committed first- or second-degree murder 
when, after trading epithets, he marched over to Anthony Ortiz's apartment with 
a loaded shotgun and blasted the 37-year-old glass cutter in the stomach and 
head. 
</P>
<P>
But after seven days of deliberations, a 10-man, two-woman jury Tuesday found 
Ternus guilty of voluntary manslaughter, indicating that they believed the 
shooting was not a premeditated execution but a crime of passion. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I was disappointed," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ingrid Uhler, who 
prosecuted the case. "But because of the quickness of the event, I could see 
how the jurors felt there wasn't sufficient time for him to cool off . . . so 
that he was still acting under the heat of passion." 
</P>
<P>
Ternus' attorney, Robert D. Chatterton, had argued that the husky redhead felt 
as if he were a victim of his neighborhood, a mostly Latino section of Azusa in 
which drug dealing was rampant. 
</P>
<P>
After shouting at Ortiz to turn down his stereo, Ternus carried the shotgun 
over there, "not intending to use it, but to protect himself, so he wouldn't 
get attacked," Chatterton said. 
</P>
<P>
Ternus contended that he fired the weapon in self-defense when Ortiz and 
several others on Ortiz's second-story balcony descended and began to surround 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Ternus guilty of attempted voluntary manslaughter and assault 
with a deadly weapon for firing three shots that wounded Ortiz's cousin, 
Jeffrey Mora, 22. Mora testified that Ortiz had approached Ternus merely to 
calm him down, not threaten him. 
</P>
<P>
Ternus, who admitted to drinking two six-packs of beer that night, was also 
convicted of assault with a deadly weapon for wounding Joe Rodriguez, 43, a 
neighbor who was visiting Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deadlocked, however, on whether Ternus was guilty of attempted murder 
for hitting Rodriguez in the nose with two pellets of buckshot. Prosecutors 
will announce at the sentencing hearing whether they intend to retry him on 
that charge.

PURCHASE OF SCHOOL SITE IS CANCELED BY DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Downey Unified School District officials said the city has imposed so many 
restrictions and given so much conflicting information to a Los Angeles-based 
home builder that he has canceled an agreement to buy a surplus school site for 
$9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The district planned to use the money to make badly needed repairs at Downey 
High School and other school sites, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they expect the cancellation will delay the refurbishing 
temporarily. They said they will continue to seek buyers for the site. 
</P>
<P>
M.J. Brock &amp; Sons Inc. informed the district last week that the agreement 
was canceled because of additional restrictions being placed on the proposed 
development by the city, schools Supt. Edward A. Sussman said. 
</P>
<P>
The company received a letter from the city Planning Department outlining so 
many obstacles that Brock decided to not go through with the deal, Sussman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the Board of Education approved the sale of 10.5-acre Edith 
Unsworth Elementary School at 9001 Lindsey Ave. The Brock company proposed to 
build single-family homes on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The district was to receive $6.75 million from Brock once the sale cleared 
escrow. The remaining $2.25 million was to be paid as homes were sold. 
</P>
<P>
The district planned to use about $5 million of the money to refurbish several 
buildings at Downey High School, and the remainder to pay for renovation at 
other schools in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The developer must meet city planning, zoning and building requirements to 
construct the project. City officials said they have not been unreasonable nor 
placed too many restrictions on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that Brock had a very workable plan, but there were some problems," 
Assistant City Manager Ken Farfsing said. 
</P>
<P>
Farfsing said the developer had not submitted a formal application but was 
proposing to build 85 homes on lots smaller than allowed by the city. Farfsing 
said the developer revised the plan by reducing the number of homes, but the 
proposed streets were not wide enough for parking and safety reasons. The city 
also required the developer to use two lots for a small park. 
</P>
<P>
The city was prepared to meet with the developer to discuss the requirements 
when the company canceled the agreement with the school district, Farfsing 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Bathen, legal counsel for the school district, accused the city of "just 
giving the developer the runaround." 
</P>
<P>
Farfsing denied the charge. He said it is "part of the process we go through 
with developers." 
</P>
<P>
Bathen said he received a letter from the development company last Tuesday 
saying that the company was withdrawing because of "mixed signals and 
inconsistency" from city officials and because of the declining real estate 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Bathen said the developer had estimated that the proposed homes could sell for 
between $300,000 and $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bathen said the district had received a deposit of $100,000 and was to receive 
an additional deposit of $150,000 Feb. 12, but after getting the city's letter 
on the same day, the developer decided to cancel the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Brock vice president Les Thomas said he would have no comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sussman said the district would continue to negotiate with Brock and 
other developers to work out a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic we can work something out," Sussman said. "We are trying to 
do the very best for the district and for the city. We also have an obligation 
to get all of our schools refurbished." 
</P>
<P>
Downey High School has several buildings that are in need of repair, Sussman 
said. The school was built in 1939 and has never had any major renovation. 
</P>
<P>
The district purchased 35 portable classrooms for $1.4 million for use by the 
students during remodeling, which was expected to start in June, Sussman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sussman said the district plans to move nearly half of the high school's 2,500 
students into the portable classrooms while the district continues a search for 
money to refurbish. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, voters rejected a bond issue that would have generated $11.4 million 
to renovate district schools. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted to sell Unsworth Elementary School last year and use the money 
for renovation. Unsworth was closed in 1972 because of a decline in student 
enrollment.

L.B. COUNCIL COMPROMISES ON DATA FROM POLICE SUITS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council reversed itself this week and agreed to provide the Public 
Safety Advisory Commission with part of the information it had requested on 
money paid out in police-related lawsuits over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided not to provide the requested case-by-case breakdown but 
compromised by agreeing to send information on settlements and judgments 
involving all city departments, including police, when amounts exceed $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
That translates to less than 15 cases a year for the city, including police, 
city attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has about 500 personal-injury lawsuits pending at any one time, with 
20% to 25% of those likely to result in settlements, Assistant City Atty. 
Robert E. Shannon said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach wins most lawsuits filed against it, Shannon said. An estimated 20% 
to 25% of them involve the police, according to City Atty. John R. Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone involved in the controversy over compiling the information 
embraced the compromise, which was proposed by Calhoun and Councilman Tom 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
For commissioners, who had hoped that such information would help them spot 
patterns and problem areas, the compromise was far from what was requested. The 
panel wanted a list of all police-related settlements and judgments. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members echoed concerns of other community leaders, who criticized 
the council for secretly settling a $330,000 police brutality lawsuit in 
December. While council members denied trying to hide the settlement, they 
nonetheless agreed two months ago to note publicly any final settlement 
approved in closed sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"We did ask for much more than what you seem agreeable to providing," 
Commissioner Barbara Shoag told the council before its Tuesday vote. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Kugler, a spokesman for Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, said: "I think 
it's the best we could get out of the council." 
</P>
<P>
"The public will now have a better idea of the nature of settlements, but in 
terms of evaluating trends, the information won't be adequate," he said after 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise also failed to satisfy members of the council, who last week 
denied the request for information on the grounds that it would take too much 
time and cost too much for city staff members to compile. 
</P>
<P>
The information, they said, is available to anyone willing to do the legwork to 
dig it up and would not provide clear evidence of patterns, because settlements 
do not always mean someone did something wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The ability to categorize or come up with patterns is next to impossible," 
Councilwoman Jan Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said that the commission will look for trends by reviewing about 45 cases 
and that just some of those will involve police. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's crazy," Hall said. "I don't think that makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jeff Kellogg agreed with Hall, and both voted against ordering city 
staff to compile the data. Joining Clark -- the only councilman who supported 
the commission's request last week -- were Councilmen Evan Anderson Braude, 
Wallace Edgerton, Ray Grabinski, Warren Harwood, Les Robbins and Clarence 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the councilmen said they were changing their votes not because they 
support the compromise but because of the public outcry that their vote 
generated last week. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders were outraged that the council had refused to help the 
commission gather the data. Although council members insisted that the 
information is public and available to anyone, commissioners said they have 
neither the resources nor the knowledge to gather the information themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, they said, the council's refusal to help was tantamount to denying 
them the information. 
</P>
<P>
Council members repeated Tuesday that they are not trying to hide any 
settlement. Nonetheless, the majority changed its vote to appease critics. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, the council will take a position based on newspaper reaction," 
said Edgerton, referring to an editorial in the Press-Telegram that criticized 
the council for its original vote. 
</P>
<P>
In casting his vote, Harwood alluded to the upcoming election and said the 
Public Safety Advisory Commission is taking advantage of the "political 
season." Four of the nine council members face re-election. Harwood and 
Grabinski are unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
"The council is being put in a squeeze," with the impression that to deny the 
commission's request is the same as denying access to public records, Harwood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He questioned whether this would set a precedent that would encourage other 
commissions and committees to ask the city to compile other information, such 
as: "How many homes have tile roofs?" Harwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Grabinski, who was strongly opposed to the commission's request, voted for the 
compromise, but even as he announced his vote he added: "I hope it doesn't 
pass." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, council members said they feared that the commission would 
second-guess their decisions. The council, on the advice of the city's 
attorneys, makes final decisions on what cases to settle out of court and for 
what amounts. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, community activists called the council's refusal to help the 
commission gather the information "atrocious" and "the supreme insult to the 
constituents."

GENTRIFICATION CAN TAKE A TOLL ON HUMANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have followed, with interest, your intermittent articles dealing with (staff 
writer) Berkley Hudson's move to Eldora Road in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
As I have worked in this area for four years, I've watched the slow, gradual 
change with interest and anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with your appraisal of the neighbors (people) and homes. I was 
saddened, however, by your article (Times, Jan. 7). Gentrification of a 
neighborhood can bring about as much loss as gain in human terms. 
</P>
<P>
The residents who have lived in this area for years are not necessarily 
"undesirable" because of income constraints. Many are as concerned of the 
future of their neighborhood as the newcomers. They are as caring and as good a 
neighbor as any, anywhere.

EXPANSION AT RIVER PARK TO BE DEDICATED SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A free pancake breakfast will highlight the dedication Saturday morning of the 
newly expanded River Park in Lakewood. There also will be free pony and hay 
rides, children's games and live entertainment at the event, which begins at 9 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
River Park sits beside the San Gabriel River north of the Lakewood Equestrian 
Center at Carson Street and stretches to Del Amo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
It is connected by bicycle and hiking paths along the river to Liberty Park in 
Cerritos and El Dorado Park in Long Beach. In all, the three parks have 700 
acres of open and recreational space. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-acre expansion at River Park was paid for with $1.4 million in state and 
federal recreation grants. The expansion includes the addition of an outdoor 
amphitheater, three picnic pavilions, three children's play areas, a wildflower 
meadow, 400 new trees and expanded parking for 200 cars.

REINFORCEMENT EXTENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Property owners who face deadlines for reinforcing masonry buildings to make 
them meet earthquake safety standards may appeal to the city for extensions, 
the City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
To help owners with the cost of adding reinforcements, the city also will 
explore ways of offering financial help, such as low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tom Breazeal, who dissented in the 4-1 vote, said appeals would be 
approved arbitrarily unless guidelines are set. He said extensions should be 
granted only if the property has been vacant, if major changes have been made 
or if there has been damage.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: EVEN THE DWP STAFF HAD A LAUGH AT THAT ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Water and Power came to Marshall High School last week to 
submit to a public lashing over the agency's plan to improve the water in 
several urban reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
It was an evening of high rhetoric, beginning with the agency's own. 
</P>
<P>
"Participate!" shouted a flyer promoting the fifth of nine sessions being held 
across the city. "The city of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power invites 
you to participate in shaping a program to maintain and enhance the quality of 
the water you drink." 
</P>
<P>
About 500 residents and two politicians answered the call, nearly filling the 
high school auditorium. Most of them had been participating for quite some time 
without solicitation by the DWP. They made it clear that they think the agency 
does not want their participation and will do whatever it pleases unless they 
stop it. 
</P>
<P>
What it wants to do, they believe, is to deface 10 jewel-like urban reservoirs 
by putting covers over six of them and building filtration plants next to the 
other four. Three on the list for covers are Elysian, Rowena and Ivanhoe, all 
within a couple of miles of Marshall High School. Ivanhoe forms the smaller 
part of the reservoir that gives Silver Lake its name. The larger part, Silver 
Lake proper, may be in line for a filtration plant. 
</P>
<P>
Technically speaking, the meeting Thursday night was a "scoping" session for an 
environmental impact report. Its purpose was to gather insights on what the 
report should consider. The public, however, chose to interpret the invitation 
more broadly as an occasion to demonstrate its mettle for a long campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, members of the Coalition to Preserve Open Reservoirs waved a few 
placards. Otherwise, they were generally diplomatic. They refrained from 
shouting down the DWP staff. They waited their turn to speak. They held their 
applause for a few dramatic moments. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), a resident of Silver Lake, spoke first 
and set the proper martial tone. 
</P>
<P>
"Look into the faces in this room tonight," Roos said. "Residents of our 
community are buffeted by powerful forces they cannot control, forces tearing 
at the very fabric of our neighborhoods: crime, drug abuse, urban blight, 
traffic gridlock. Now they are concerned that a public agency, an institution 
that should be working with them, may take away the very foundation of our 
neighborhood, the centerpiece that helps define and preserve our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo, who also lives in Silver Lake, offered his own 
definition of audience participation. 
</P>
<P>
"Only by having a large, organized and vocal opposition to covering reservoirs 
will we be able to stop what I believe is a senseless folly on the part of the 
DWP," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That was one of the dramatic moments when the audience let loose. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP's obviously practiced method for handling the criticism was to offer no 
response at all. 
</P>
<P>
Though several of its top officials attended, the agency did not conduct the 
meeting itself. That job was in the hands of a professional facilitator hired 
for the series. 
</P>
<P>
He said his role was simply to gather information. Even under intense 
provocation, he kept his composure. 
</P>
<P>
When one speaker, Bennett Kayser, called the water improvement program a sham 
and suggested that it should be the "alleged water improvement project," the 
facilitator asked smoothly what it should be called instead. 
</P>
<P>
"Filtration and covering for 10 reservoirs," Kayser snapped back. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry I asked," the facilitator quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Kayser suggested adding mental health as a component of the environmental 
study. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going to happen to the people of Silver Lake when instead of seeing a 
reservoir, they see a filtration plant down there?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Some speakers offered quasi-scientific, others personal experience to counter 
the DWP's approach. 
</P>
<P>
One man said he lived through a dysentery outbreak caused by fungus that grew 
under a reservoir cover. 
</P>
<P>
"Saying that covering these reservoirs is some sort of solution to clean water, 
it isn't at all," he said. "It's just creating another problem. It's sort of 
gunge in the Thermos." 
</P>
<P>
Even the DWP staff had a laugh at that one. 
</P>
<P>
But they became stone-faced a few minutes later when Dale Flanagan of the 
Committee to Save Silver Lake's Reservoirs quoted from a document that he said 
was written 12 years ago by the DWP staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The resistance met during a recent construction of the Silver Lake reservoir 
indicates the typical response likely to be encountered if any view of the 
water surface is diminished." 
</P>
<P>
Waving the document overhead, he said: "Heed your own warnings . . . Because I 
can guarantee you, you're not going to have a fight on your hands. You're going 
to have a war." 
</P>
<P>
The facilitator waited for the cheers to die down before observing dryly: 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's terribly unfair to use our own words against us like that." 
</P>
<P>
At an appropriately dramatic moment, a speaker called for a show of hands on 
who was on his side. Hundreds of hands shot up. 
</P>
<P>
It's going to be a long one.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER; 
</P>
<P>
FILING DEADLINE IS MONDAY FOR MONTOYA'S SENATE SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Would-be candidates have until Monday to file papers allowing them to run in a 
special election to fill the state Senate seat vacated by the resignation of 
Joseph B. Montoya, who was convicted on corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), the only elected official 
expected to vie for Montoya's seat, is likely to emerge as the leading 
candidate in the heavily Democratic 26th State Senate District. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon will have to pick up more than half the votes in the April 10 special 
election or face a runoff June 5. The special election will determine who 
serves the remainder of Montoya's term, which expires in December. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, also scheduled for June 5 is the primary election to determine who 
will represent the district for a full four-year term, starting Dec. 3. Each 
party's top vote-getter in the primary will compete for the job in the November 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates who have filed declarations of their intention to run in the June 5 
primary election are Democrats Calderon and Richard S. Gonzales of Baldwin 
Park, Republican Joe Aguilar Urquidi of Alhambra, and Libertarian Kim 
Goldsworthy of Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, who was elected to the Senate in 1978, was convicted Feb. 2 of 
racketeering, extortion and money laundering. His conviction grew out of an FBI 
sting investigation into corruption in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The 26th State Senate District stretches along the southern part of the San 
Gabriel Valley from Monterey Park to La Puente. It includes the Southeast 
cities of Montebello and Pico Rivera. Democrats outnumber Republicans more than 
2 to 1.

LOYOLA FORUM ADDRESSES DECISION TO DENY RECOGNITION TO GAY GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 Loyola Marymount University students attended a campus forum 
Tuesday on homosexuality that took the theological and ethical measure of the 
school president's decision last week to deny recognition to a club for gay and 
lesbian students. 
</P>
<P>
The forum, sponsored by the Student Housing Office and led by a panel of 
professors and students, discussed the church's teachings on homosexuality and 
heard students question the ruling that went against the Alliance of Gays and 
Lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Rabe, a professor of church history and one of five members on the panel, 
said a question defines the fundamental problem: "What is it about this issue 
that is so threatening? It has been my experience personally and as a historian 
. . . that when high emotion surfaces over issues it says a great deal more 
about the people who are rejecting groups than it does about groups 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The problem confronting the campus is one of "prejudice, rumor, false 
accusation, questions of human dignity, of civil rights and ignorance," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rabe also said she was disturbed by "violence in the words . . . and in the 
attitudes" among some students toward gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member alliance was formed last spring in an off-campus apartment. This 
year, the group sought official recognition from the university, including the 
right to meet on campus. University President James N. Loughran last week 
denied the group official recognition, but granted them access to campus 
facilities and support services. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced in a brief unsigned statement issued by the 
university's public relations office, and was accompanied by a two-page press 
release. It said the university cannot condone "a sexually active, homosexual 
life style" but should "support those among us who happen to be homosexual." 
</P>
<P>
Alliance President James Munselle, one of the five panelists, told the forum 
that the group is disappointed by Loughran's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe all people have a right not to be invisible, not to be segregated, 
not to be distinguished from other people as inferior," Munselle said. 
</P>
<P>
Panelist Father Michael O'Sullivan, a Jesuit priest who said he supported the 
group's right to meet on campus, was asked as a theologian to explain church 
policy on homosexuality. He said the Catholic Church does not condemn 
homosexual orientation and in fact "supports gays and lesbians in terms of 
people who are a minority who suffer prejudice, who suffer discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "the church does condemn homosexual genital sexual activity" 
because it takes place outside of marriage and because, "by its nature it 
cannot lead to procreation." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Brad Collins, a panel member who earlier this month voted against a 
student senate resolution supporting the group, said he was disappointed that 
the panel was not more representative of the campus. He was the only panelist 
who supported Loughran. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope future forums would be a little more evenly balanced," Collins 
said. "I know there are people who have very different opinions than were 
represented today." 
</P>
<P>
One student asked the panel members to speculate why Loughran denied the group 
recognition, but panel members declined. Munselle urged students to write or 
call the president's office asking for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Another student supposed that the university "said no because the (gay) group 
isn't treating homosexuality as a sin." 
</P>
<P>
Rabe pointed out, however, that the church sees any sex outside of marriage -- 
even gay sex -- as a sin. Homosexuality itself is not a sin, she said, as shown 
by the church's permitting homosexuals to be priests if they take a vow of 
celibacy. 
</P>
<P>
Other panel members also said the issue of sin couldn't be the deciding one 
because other campus clubs are not asked whether their beliefs conform with 
church policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Does Air Force ROTC discuss whether killing is a sin?" O'Sullivan asked. He 
said other campus clubs are not required to state whether their members have 
sex outside of marriage, which the church views as sinful. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Lawmaster, a member of the student senate who voted against the club, 
said the panel had not addressed the counseling needs of individual gays, 
especially those who want to refrain from homosexual sex. 
</P>
<P>
He said gays need to accept Christ and the word of the Bible, which allows 
celibacy or sex within heterosexual marriage. Lawmaster questioned whether the 
club could "match up with these alternatives," which would open the way for it 
to be permitted on campus. 
</P>
<P>
But Munselle responded that alliance group members are not confused about their 
homosexuality. "That's not this club," he said. "This is a group of people 
struggling with discrimination," he said. Homosexual students seeking spiritual 
or psychological guidance would be referred to counselors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Doyle, director of counseling services who was also on the panel, said 
gay students who are facing spiritual crisis "find it very difficult to find 
answers when the consistent message they hear from the church is negative. 
That's not the church's stance, but that's the message they hear in statements 
like this one that Father Loughran has issued." 
</P>
<P>
Since Loughran's decision, attorney Gloria Allred, who represents Munselle, has 
sent the president a letter asking him to meet with the group. Allred 
criticized the university's statement, which said the university "cannot 
endorse or condone, or appear to endorse or condone a sexually active, 
homosexual life style." 
</P>
<P>
Munselle argued that the group's purpose, as stated in its constitution, is to 
educate and to support the human rights of its members. 
</P>
<P>
Allred and members of both the undergraduate and law school gay students' 
alliances said they will picket Loughran's office today because the statement 
was "issued by some nameless and faceless individual" and was not signed by 
Loughran. Allred said they will seek an explanation from Loughran of why he 
rejected the group's application. 
</P>
<P>
Panel members discussed the possibility of holding more forums, and some 
students agreed it seems a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't know what the real issues are," one student told the panel. "I 
came here with questions and after hearing the discussion, I think the club 
should be approved."

15 BUILDINGS PROPOSED FOR HISTORIC STATUS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two years of study, Whittier officials are proposing that the city 
designate 15 buildings as historic structures, covered by a special code that 
prohibits owners from altering the buildings' appearance without city approval. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council deferred action Tuesday night, and scheduled a study session 
March 13 to discuss the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Some owners of the buildings complained that the city's proposal is an 
infringement of their rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be allowed to get up on a Saturday morning and paint my front steps 
. . . without getting a work permit," Barbara Light, the owner of one of the 
homes, told the council Tuesday night. "I want to be allowed to select the 
colors of the paint on my home and decide whether my bushes need to be pruned." 
</P>
<P>
But local conservationists say that regulations are needed to protect the 
city's historic resources. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not just resources that belong to individuals," said Helen Rahder, 
spokeswoman for the Whittier Conservancy. "These are resources that belong to 
the community. These are resources that belong to everyone."

DISQUALIFICATION ENDS COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What began as a dull campaign has evolved into no contest at all after local 
officials this week canceled what would have been the first election since the 
Crescenta Valley Town Council was formed. 
</P>
<P>
One of two candidates competing for the council's only contested seat has been 
disqualified, leading the council president this week to declare the sole 
candidates for the three open seats as automatic winners. "There will not be an 
election," said council President Thomas M. Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I was looking forward to an election to demonstrate community 
support for the council," said Johnston, who has served as president since the 
council formed last March. "I feel like a radio disc jockey: You know you're 
talking but you don't know if anyone out there is listening." 
</P>
<P>
There were six seats up for election: one with a two-year term in each of the 
council's three districts, and one non-voting, one-year alternate position in 
each district. No candidates filed for the three non-voting seats. Johnston 
said the empty positions on the 12-member council will be filled by appointment 
after new council officers are seated in April. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Judy Tejeda and Bill Beavers are not being challenged in their 
reelection bids. Johnston last week declared them the winners and canceled the 
election in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbent in the third district, Councilman Anthony P. Hurtado, is not 
seeking reelection. Two newcomers, Robert E. Yanez and Marjorie R. Koerber, had 
filed for that seat. 
</P>
<P>
After the two competitors appeared at three public forums, Koerber said, she 
learned late Thursday that she lives outside the unincorporated county 
territory the council represents. 
</P>
<P>
Koerber, an office manager who has lived in the area for 21 years, said, "I 
never thought of my home as other than La Crescenta," which is the mailing 
address she uses. 
</P>
<P>
However, her home in the 2900 block of Piedmont Avenue is three blocks inside 
the northeastern boundary of Glendale. She said officials of the Town Council 
and Chamber of Commerce failed to notice the discrepancy when she filed as a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"If the council didn't know it and the chamber didn't know it, how was I 
supposed to know it?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
Koerber said the error was discovered by Councilman Don Hogue after she gave 
Hogue directions to her home.

ALL-AROUND GOOD SPORT; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOLS: LA CANADA'S ROSS ALLAN HAS YET TO FIND A SPORT -- OR AN ACADEMIC 
SUBJECT -- THAT HE CANNOT MASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a guy who always seems prepared to scale athletic and academic hurdles with 
equal ease, Ross Allan certainly lacked knowledge about trends in high school 
sports when he entered La Canada High as a freshman four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Allan was under the mistaken impression that participating in a variety of 
sports was the norm for most athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Specialization? That was something to ponder after he finished a few years of 
medical school. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got here it was, 'Hey these are the sports I play and these are 
the ones I'm going to play in high school,' " Allan recalled. "I thought 
everyone would do that." 
</P>
<P>
It soon became apparent to Allan that his hypothesis was false. 
</P>
<P>
Most high school athletes limit their participation to one or two sports. Some 
do it because those are the only ones in which they are interested or capable. 
Others are instructed -- and sometimes pressured -- by coaches, parents or 
scouts to concentrate on a single activity that might earn them a college 
scholarship or a professional contract. 
</P>
<P>
Allan, however, kept to his plan and thus became part of a shrinking breed -- 
the three-sport athlete. 
</P>
<P>
The only things more impressive than Allan's independence are his 
accomplishments on the playing field and in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
He is an almost certain two-time All-Southern Section and three-time All-Rio 
Hondo League soccer player who helped lead La Canada to the 1-A championship 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
He was selected to the Times All-Glendale and Rio Hondo League football teams 
last fall after booting, among other less spectacular kicks, two field goals 
from 49 yards and one each from 45, 44 and 43 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He is a returning all-league first baseman for the La Canada baseball team, 
batting .423 last season. 
</P>
<P>
He was a member of the school's Academic Decathlon team and a National Merit 
Scholarship semifinalist who scored in the 97th percentile on the 
Pre-Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
If ever there was a money player, it's Allan, who also serves as senior class 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball is my favorite sport," Allan says. "It's the hardest sport of all of 
them and I think that might be the reason I like it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more challenging." 
</P>
<P>
Allan is hoping to compete in at least two sports in college. Stanford, UCLA, 
Cal and Claremont-McKenna are among his top choices. 
</P>
<P>
His most immediate challenge, though, is helping a young Spartan soccer team 
repeat as Southern Section champion. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Allan contributed an assist on what proved to be the game-winning 
by goal by Jensen Jaraba as the top-ranked Spartans beat No. 2 Agoura, 3-1, in 
a second-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada (23-1-2) meets La Mirada, a 3-2 winner Tuesday over Canyon Springs, 
in a quarterfinal game on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Allan, 6-foot-2, 180 pounds, leads La Canada with 22 goals. He scored most of 
those during the first part of the season when Spartan co-Coaches Afshin Ghotbi 
and Louie Bilowitz moved him to offensive midfield and experimented with 
younger players at defensive positions. 
</P>
<P>
But once league play began, Allan returned to sweeper. Since moving back to 
defense, La Canada has allowed just four goals in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Ross is a brilliant reader of the game," Bilowitz said. "He's excellent in the 
air and knows how to position himself in the right place. 
</P>
<P>
"If he needs to make a quick short pass, he can. If the opponents are packing 
in tight, he can put the ball long into the corners. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a real athlete." 
</P>

12 GLENDALE PLAYERS SIGN FOR FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve Glendale College football players signed national letters of intent last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick Jenkins, a 6-foot-3 tackle, signed with San Jose State and tight end 
Tom Sugg signed with Idaho. Guards Chris Allen and Anthony Navarro chose Cal 
State Northridge and Utah, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Other signees included defensive lineman Vince Lobendahn (Utah); defensive 
lineman Damon Hinton, linebacker Steve Ruedeflores and defensive back Dennis 
Breshears (Cal State Long Beach); and defensive back Paul Simpson, who signed 
with Whittier College, a Division III school that does not award athletic 
scholarships nor have recruits sign letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Four former Vaqueros also signed with four-year schools. Nose guard Cory 
Cheney-Rice, who played in 1987, will attend Sonoma State; linebacker George 
Sykes (1988) signed with New Mexico State; and defensive lineman Doug Bledsoe 
and running back James Bledsoe, both of whom played at Glendale in 1988, signed 
with Northern Arizona and Portland State, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Ronnie Lopez is still deciding between Northridge, Long Beach and 
Cal State Fullerton. Darren Fitzgerald will choose either Humbolt State or 
Sonoma State and wide receiver Danny Perez is considering offers from Sonoma 
State and Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament time: Los Angeles City and Glendale colleges open play in the 
Southern California Regional of the state basketball tournament Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. City (22-8), champion of the Southern California Athletic Conference, is 
seeded seventh in the 27-team, single-elimination tournament. The Cubs meet 
26th-seeded Mira Costa at home. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (22-11), seeded 11th, is at home against Citrus (15-17), which is 
seeded 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings game: The Glendale College men's track team is 12% of the way to 
the Western State Conference title after a 78-73-21 tri-meet victory over Santa 
Barbara and West L.A. in its conference opener last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The WSC title will be determined by the results of four tri-meets, each worth 
12%, and the conference finals worth 52%. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros (2-0) take on Bakersfield and Valley on Friday at Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Best-kept secret: Glendale was without Rick Provenzano in its meet against West 
L.A. and Santa Barbara because Provenzano was competing in The Times/Eagle 
Indoor Meet at the Forum, where he placed second in the 800 meters in 1 minute, 
57.10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Glendale distance Coach Ed Lopez was reluctant to let Provenzano run 
in the qualifying meet three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"He came up with a good enough story to convince me," Lopez said. "I didn't 
tell anybody else on the team. I didn't want to lose any more people (last 
Friday)." 
</P>
<P>
That proved to be a wise decision. Glendale needed to win the final event of 
the meet, the 1,600-meter relay, to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
In the swim: Occidental swimmers Ed Bedford and Scott Holdsworth have qualified 
for the NCAA Division III championships March 12 at Wheaton College in Norton, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Bedford, a sophomore, qualified in the 100-yard butterfly by clocking 51.73 
seconds at the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
championships last weekend at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Holdsworth, a senior, qualified in the 200-yard freestyle (1:43.18). 
</P>
<P>
Girls' playoffs: The Flintridge Sacred Heart girls' basketball team defeated 
Pius X, 65-37, Saturday to advance to quarterfinals of the Southern Section 
Division 2-AA playoffs. The Tologs, who advanced past the second round for 
first time since 1987, played host to Nordhoff in a quarterfinal game on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In other playoff games Wednesday, La Canada, which last week routed Duarte, 
68-25, traveled to Los Alamitos for a 3-A quarterfinal and Flintridge Prep, a 
45-30 winner Saturday night over Cate, played host to Rosamond in a 1-A 
contest. Ribet Academy, which last week defeated Big Pine, 43-42, played host 
to California Lutheran in a Small Schools game.

POLY COACHING LEGEND IS BACK, SHOOTING FOR CHAMPIONSHIP AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poly High School is driving for another CIF Southern Section basketball title 
under Coach Ron Palmer, just as the Jackrabbits did in 1984 when they were 31-2 
and also tacked on a state championship. 
</P>
<P>
Morlon Wiley, Terry Stallworth and Chris Sandle were the main players then, and 
Palmer was winding up a highly successful 11-year career. He would soon leave 
for Cal State Long Beach, making the almost unheard-of jump from high school to 
college Division I, a jump that would turn out to be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the stars are Willie McGinest, Roderick Hannibal, Melvin Jones and Tyus 
Edney, who have the talent for which Poly has always been known. They looked 
sharp Tuesday night in a 74-59 victory over Simi Valley in a quarterfinal 
playoff game at Lakewood High. 
</P>
<P>
And Palmer is back, still wearing his dark green sports coat, sitting hunched 
over with elbows on knees, holding up signs that read "time out" or "1-3-1" and 
offering sharp advice to his players and the officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, ref, what did he do? This is a contact sport," he complained when a foul 
was called on a Poly player. 
</P>
<P>
"Three seconds? Oh, come on," he said in disbelief, shaking his head and 
breaking into his familiar smile when an official ruled that a Jackrabbit was 
in the free-throw lane too long. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is that so hard to remember?" he asked his team sternly after someone 
missed an assignment. 
</P>
<P>
During his first tenure at Poly, Palmer's record was 270-51. He won nine Moore 
League titles and was in seven CIF championship games, winning three. He went 
out with the state crown in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of remember that team, I remember coming to the games," said McGinest, 
a preteen then but now an imposing 6-foot-7 center, after he scored 20 points 
and 11 rebounds against Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
McGinest is also a football linebacker who is going to USC. Some think he might 
be the next Lawrence Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"I just remember how good they were," McGinest went on. "And I remember Palmer. 
I had heard a lot about him. He was like a legend, a famous coach. But I never 
met him until he came back this season." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, after three seasons and a 23-64 record at Cal State Long Beach, was out 
of basketball the last two seasons. He returned to Poly last May to replace 
Chris Kinder, who was forced out. 
</P>
<P>
Kinder was 79-52 in five seasons, but his sin was not winning the CIF 
championship, something not easily forgiven at Poly, a school that has a 
basketball reputation as a junior UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an exceptional year," Palmer said Tuesday morning at the storefront 
school near downtown Long Beach where he teaches junior high students who have 
had discipline problems. 
</P>
<P>
He looked fresh and relaxed, unlike the day three years ago when he resigned 
under pressure at the university. Beaten down by the losing, he was tired and 
thin, and his stomach hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an aging experience," he said. "This is a totally different world 
than the college world. I felt my age, I don't feel it now. I'm 52 and I feel 
like I'm 30 something, doing what I've always done, coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Poly is 24-2 this season and has won 17 consecutive games. The Jackrabbits' 
only losses have been to Artesia and, in a December tournament in Texas, to 
Denton (Tex.) High. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer was 4-23 and 7-22 his first two seasons at Cal State Long Beach before 
improving to 12-19. 
</P>
<P>
The losses came with such regularity at the university that they eventually 
numbed Palmer. "In high school losing hurts more because you're always in the 
game, especially at Poly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the 49ers, Palmer was at first plagued with mediocre talent. When he did 
get some athletes, they had a difficult time scoring, just as the good athletes 
do at Cal State Long Beach today. 
</P>
<P>
"People out-jumped us and out-quicked us (at Cal State Long Beach)," he said. 
"Here, we can jump over your heads and put it in the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer believes that the big, talented players who can do everything on the 
court continue to go to schools such as North Carolina, Nevada Las Vegas and 
Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
"At Long Beach State you get some athletes, but guys who can do it all, 
including shoot, are at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out there was a vast difference in ability across the country. On the 
East Coast you have guys 6-7 and 6-8 dribbling the ball like a guard. They have 
more skills. And they play a more physical style that helps players adjust from 
high school to college. Here (in high school) a player gets touched and it's a 
foul." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer points to several reasons for his failure at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought we probably tried to achieve too much too soon, playing 
Georgetown and other nationally ranked teams," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also complained about having had to play the first 13 games on the road his 
second season and not being able to hold full-team practices because a gym 
renovation forced night practices, which some of the players could not attend 
because of classes. 
</P>
<P>
And he was distressed because he said he could never guarantee decent-paying 
summer jobs for his players. 
</P>
<P>
In his last season at the university, which ended with eight consecutive 
losses, team morale had broken down and his quiet style was often criticized by 
players and team boosters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was getting to me," he recalled. "I hold everything back, I think it was 
ready to come out. When you lose, all those things start to surface, nerves are 
frayed. If you have problems, winning will take care of all of them, and 
unhappy kids will be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Now Palmer is back where he is comfortable and where defeats are rarely a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate winning more now than I did at Poly before," he said. "I took it 
for granted before." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the travails of the intervening years, changes in Palmer are 
indiscernible. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell his college experience has added to his coaching ability, but 
he's basically the same type of coach," said Erroll Parker, a Poly assistant 
coach. "He's very well organized, he's a good teacher and he's blessed with 
talent and good support." 
</P>
<P>
And so the legend has come home, although it seems like he never left.

VETERAN UCLA GYMNAST SEEKS THE POT OF GOLD FOR BRUINS -- AN NCAA CROWN; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE SPORTS: JILL ANDREWS HAS THREE ALL-AROUND TITLE THIS SEASON AND A 
WOODEN CENTER RECORD OF 38.60. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Jill Andrews, UCLA All-American gymnast, tries to tell you she is over the 
hill -- as she has sometimes been heard to say -- don't believe her. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-year-old senior, Andrews is a bit long in the tooth for a gymnast, 
especially when you consider that she has been at it for 12 years and that Mary 
Lou Retton retired at 16 after winning the all-around title at the 1984 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Andrews is a long way from being washed up. Last year she was an NCAA 
co-champion on the balance beam, and this year she is having one of her best 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In UCLA's first meet of the season, she scored a 38.35 in the all-around to set 
a John Wooden Center record and increased that record to 38.60 in the team's 
third meet. 
</P>
<P>
In that first meet, she tied a Wooden Center record with a 9.75 in the vault 
and broke that record with a 9.85 in the third meet. 
</P>
<P>
Also this season, she has won the all-around competition three times, placed 
first on the beam four times and took two seconds on the bars. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for an old-timer. 
</P>
<P>
She might be approaching the crest of the hill; this is, after all, her last 
year in gymnastics. But she has one more goal in her sport before she starts 
taking that downhill slide. 
</P>
<P>
She would like to get better career marks in individual events; who wouldn't? 
</P>
<P>
But you can't get much better than a 9.90 in the vault, a 9.75 in floor 
exercise, a 9.70 in the uneven bars, a 9.80 in the balance beam and a 38.80 out 
of a possible 40 points in the all-around. 
</P>
<P>
You can't get much better than being the top-ranked college vaulter in the 
nation this season, No. 4 in the balance beam, No. 2 in the all-around. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews' teammate, All-American senior teammate Kim Hamilton, also has an 
individual goal. Last year Hamilton, who holds the national record of 9.90 in 
floor exercise, became the first woman gymnast to win three consecutive NCAA 
championships in floor exercise. Assuredly, she would like to make it four 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
But she and Andrews, teammates for four years, have yet to help the Bruins win 
an NCAA title, a prize they would both like to add to their individual laurels 
before they get out of gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has come so close to winning a national team championship in the last 
three years that it is "a huge source of frustration," Andrews said. The Bruins 
were third to NCAA champion Georgia in 1987, third to Alabama in '88 and second 
to Georgia last year by five-hundredths (.05) of a point at a meet held at 
Georgia's campus in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't lose by less," said Andrews, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"When we were (competing) on the balance beam, they were (doing) floor 
exercise. They blew out six speakers with the loud music they were playing. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Georgia) did a good job, but I think there was a little hometown 
favoritism (in the judging)." 
</P>
<P>
This year's NCAA meet will be held April 20-21 at Oregon State in Corvallis. 
That would be a neutral site for a showdown between Georgia and UCLA, should 
both teams get that far. And it's a pretty good bet that they will. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews is "off to a dynamite start," said UCLA Coach Jerry Tomlinson, but his 
team, troubled by injuries and inexperience, has been something less than 
explosive. The Bruins have a 6-2 record in dual meets, having lost to Oregon 
State and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
All-American Shawn McGinnis, the only other senior on the team, is out for the 
season because she tore ligaments in her foot. She may redshirt and return next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Rhonda Faehn, an alternate on the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, suffered a 
strained Achilles tendon and missed several meets. She has returned and posted 
a 9.4 in floor exercise in UCLA's last meet. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Paula Rasmussen sprained an ankle but recently came back to record a 
9.2 on the balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
Even the 5-foot-2-inch, 110-pound Andrews, who Tomlinson says is "built like a 
rock" and is seldom injured, sprained an ankle in the team's second meet of the 
season at Oregon State. But she has shaken off the injury and is back in top 
form. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said that she has been "lucky, extremely lucky" in avoiding injuries. 
"I'm strong, which helps prevent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm competing, (the sprained ankle) is not even a factor. I don't think 
about it till after the meet. It's no big deal if you get treatment after the 
meet and take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
Tomlinson said that Andrews is "a very, very exciting gymnast to watch because 
of her power and intensity. She is a perfectionist. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not one of the most talented gymnasts to come though here, but she is 
talented. She works very hard to get everything she has and works very hard to 
perfect (her routines)." 
</P>
<P>
Tomlinson said that Andrews, a native of Cupertino, has taken on an added role 
of being a team leader this year. "She is assuming a role that is not always a 
popular one. She is doing a really good job of setting the pace, stepping in 
for Tanya Service." Service, an assistant coach this year, completed her 
eligibility after being named the 1989 Pacific 10 Conference Gymnast of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said that she thinks that she and Hamilton have become leaders "by 
virtue of being seniors. You kind of assume the leadership role and hope it is 
based on setting an example." 
</P>
<P>
Tomlinson hopes that Andrews will set an example by leading the Bruins to an 
NCAA championship. "She hates to lose, and she brings a lot of desire and 
energy to our team. She can be a big driving force in our quest for a national 
title." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said she thinks that the Bruins "have the skills" to win at nationals, 
"and we are steadily improving. We started out slowly this year; usually, we 
jump right out. I don't know. Maybe that's a good sign, a sign that we haven't 
peaked early." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she hopes that the team may have gotten its worst performance of 
the season out of its system: the loss at Oregon State, where the Bruins 
suffered 13 falls out of 24 routines. 
</P>
<P>
She thinks that the team, with many new members, may have gotten over the 
jitters of its first road meet of the season. "It couldn't have been worse, but 
I think it was a good learning experience. We've gradually developed since 
then." 
</P>
<P>
There is one more development that Andrews is waiting for: a national 
championship for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to go out in style and win the all-around championship, but I'll be 
satisfied with whatever happens to me individually. To me it's more important 
that the team win a championship."

FISHING NOTES: A TALE OF A TAIL: BASKING SHARK EXHIBIT NEWEST AT CABRILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN STANTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro has some new specimens on display. 
</P>
<P>
* Dan Zambrano of the museum went to Newport Beach where the boat Can Ran H was 
towed in by San Pedro seiner Maria Fatimo with a basking shark wrapped up in a 
gill net. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to free the shark had failed. 
</P>
<P>
Zambrano said the basking shark is the least aggressive of the shark family and 
completely harmless to man. This shark has no teeth. They are plankton feeders 
and have been uncommon in California waters. 
</P>
<P>
The shark weighed about 1,500 pounds and was about 30 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-foot tail section was transported to the museum and is now on display with 
a history of the basking shark. 
</P>
<P>
* Larry Fukuhara, who often fishes on the San Pedro half-day boats for the 
museum, added another fish to the museum's aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
Using cut squid, Fukuhara sent his line to the bottom as he does on most trips 
to try for some rare or unusual species. 
</P>
<P>
He was trying for a male sheephead. 
</P>
<P>
After many hookups of female sheephead, and just a few minutes before the boat 
had to return, he landed a male with its glowing orange and black colors. He 
wasted no time placing it in the bait tank. 
</P>
<P>
Fukuhara took it to the museum, weighed it at an even 10 pounds and put it in 
one of the large aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
The tasty sheephead enters the world as a female. It matures at age three and 
changes into a male and then fertilizes the young females to continue the 
breeding cycle. 
</P>
<P>
* The Monte Carlo from 22nd Street Landing was fishing at Rocky Point last week 
in a light rain when an angler brought aboard a curious-looking fish. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Paul Scholser identified it as a popeye catalufa. 
</P>
<P>
Their large eyes make them effective predators even in the darkness. These fish 
are bright red and range from central California to Peru. 
</P>
<P>
The angler donated it to the museum to join the many other rare live fish on 
display. 
</P>
<P>
The Southwest Anglers Assn. held its annual awards banquet last Saturday. Ron 
Schin of Torrance won a first-place trophy with his 343-pound shark. Second 
place went to Fred Oakley of Hawthorne for a 147-pound shark. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Bert Michael of Long Beach, fishing at San Clemente Island aboard the Toronado, 
used a squid-baited jig and caught the whopper of the week, a 26-pound 
yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Hess of Harbor City, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at The Rockpile, 
caught a 23 1/2-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Don Lyndon of Gardena, fishing at the Cherry Bank aboard the Diawa, caught a 20 
1/2-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Nakasuka of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Condor, caught a 19-pound 
lingcod at the Deep Hole. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: 
</P>
<P>
The recent winter storm failed to detour fishing action at local and island 
waters. Anglers braving the elements caught bass, rock cod and a few 
yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the bay and returned with a 
catch of 24 sculpin, eight sand bass and four halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Happyman on a half-day trip garnered 25 sculpin and three halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty O rock cod special fished Shallow Rock Reefs and anglers sacked 175 
rock cod. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray chalked up 220 rock cod and three 
lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Special fished shallow on a half-day trip and anglers caught 120 
rock cod and one lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackjack worked Cherry Bank and anglers were rewarded with 435 rock cod 
and three cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
At 22nd Street Landing: The Monte Carlo fished the Rocky Point area for 218 
rock cod and one popeye catalufa. 
</P>
<P>
At L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Outerlimits caught live squid at Catalina 
Island and headed to San Clemente Island, where anglers caught 238 calico bass, 
15 blue perch, 10 rock cod and one lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach Sportfishing: The Southern Cal fished local rock reefs and found 
a good bite as anglers sacked 301 rock cod and 30 sculpin.

An American geologist, his wife and father-in-law were shot dead in an ambush 
in the central Philippines, the military said. 
</P>
<P>
The American was identified as John R. Mitchell, 42, of Fairbanks, Alaska. 
Communist rebels who have vowed to kill Americans and attack U.S. interests in 
the Philippines were thought to be responsible. The three were riding in a 
private jeep that looked like a military vehicle when they were attacked near 
Balilihan, a town in Bohol province about 400 miles south of Manila.

Redoubt Volcano erupted without warning, sending gritty ash raining down south 
of Anchorage, and the Coast Guard demanded stepped-up precautions at an oil 
depot on Cook Inlet. The Drift River terminal had been ordered closed to guard 
against an oil spill being caused by a future eruption, but the Coast Guard 
relented and said the terminal must empty six of its seven storage tanks and 
have cleanup equipment ready.

The National Guard locked up all of its buildings in Massachusetts to prevent 
other local law enforcement agencies from emulating the Hampden County sheriff, 
who commandeered the Springfield, Mass., armory to use as a jail. Sheriff 
Michael Ashe moved 15 low-risk inmates into the armory because his jail had 
exceeded its occupancy limit. Ashe has been negotiating with the state and 
National Guard to determine if another building can be used as a temporary 
jail.

A quadriplegic who won court permission to shut off his life-sustaining 
ventilator told lawmakers in Atlanta that the state's way of caring for the 
severely disabled was a big reason behind his wish to die. 
</P>
<P>
Larry McAfee, 34, appeared before the Georgia Senate to plead for changes in 
care for the disabled, which he called obsolete and cruel. Although he has 
changed his mind and decided to live, McAfee said the quality of his life since 
he was paralyzed in 1985 has been poor, primarily because he has been in 
institutions. McAfee said the state should adopt programs of independent living 
for the disabled and should not send them to out-of-state nursing homes.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
ACC STRIVES TO STAY OFF FIGHT CARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILTON KENT, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the last 20 years, college basketball players have gotten bigger and 
stronger, so, in many ways, it seems only natural to expect that play would get 
more physical. 
</P>
<P>
But the sport has been marred by a series of ugly, bench-clearing brawls the 
past six weeks that have required, in some cases, hospitalization of players 
and spectators. 
</P>
<P>
In the first battle, players and fans from North Carolina Central and North 
Carolina A&amp;T slugged it out for 15 minutes last month, with some fans 
wielding chairs as weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent fights have pitted players from Nevada-Las Vegas and Cal 
State-Fullerton against each other, and the most recent brawl between West 
Chester and Cheyney State in Pennsylvania two weeks ago, found one West Chester 
player knocked unconscious while players and fans scrapped with each other. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous conferences have taken steps to curtail fighting and the taunting that 
can lead to fisticuffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Big East, for example, after celebrated brawls involving Georgetown, 
Pittsburgh and other schools a few years ago, has issued a memo through 
Commissioner Dave Gavitt's office, strongly discouraging taunting, as well as 
ordering suspensions for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic Coast Conference, which hasn't had a notable fight in recent 
memory, also has placed the kibosh on KOs, according to league coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Our conference has always been good about that from (Commissioner) Gene 
Corrigan through (supervisor of officials) Fred Barakat," said Duke's Mike 
Krzyzewski. "I think it starts at the top. I don't think anybody wants that. 
The ACC's been a class conference." 
</P>
<P>
Maryland's Gary Williams added, "I think the officials have done a good job in 
talking to the players so that nothing gets out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
But Georgia Tech's Bobby Cremins said during an ACC coaches' teleconference 
that despite Corrigan's diligence, he is surprised that there haven't been any 
fights in the league this year. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Smith of North Carolina said he could recall the last two brawls in the 
league, back in 1959 and in 1961, remembering that the conference then 
suspended the participants.

<P>
"I don't think we've had anything happen since then, but I don't think we've 
done anything since 1961," said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the officials are letting things go, I'm surprised that (a fight) 
hasn't happened. But cooler heads have prevailed. I'm talking about the 
players, not the conference officials." 
</P>
<P>
While on the subject of Smith, the Tar Heels lost a recruit to Stanford two 
years ago for a most unusual reason. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Keefe, then a senior at Woodbridge High School in Irvine, had decided he 
wanted to play both basketball and volleyball in college, and although the Tar 
Heels aren't known for their prowess in the beach sport, North Carolina were 
still on his list of considered schools. 
</P>
<P>
Between Keefe's junior and senior years, North Carolina assistant Bill 
Guthridge tried to call Woodbridge Coach Bill Shannon to express an interest in 
Keefe. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble was, Shannon didn't answer, because the school's athletic offices were 
closed for refurbishing. Whoever picked up the phone told Guthridge that Keefe 
wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it was a construction worker," Keefe told the Orange County Register. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, before North Carolina discovered what had happened, Stanford had 
established a foothold for Keefe. 
</P>
<P>
You don't suppose that Lefty Driesell posed as a construction worker just to 
confound his old nemesis, do you? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
Less than three weeks remain before those office pools start turning up and 
Brent Musburger becomes a staple in your household, sort of the know-it-all 
uncle you wish you didn't have. 
</P>
<P>
It's getting to be NCAA tournament time and in preparation for college 
basketball's answer to the World Series and Super Bowl, Jim Delaney, chairman 
of the nine-member NCAA Division I selection committee, met the press by phone. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney, who is also Big Ten commissioner, said the committee already has met 
once to discuss criteria for inviting the 64 teams -- 30 automatic qualifiers 
and 34 at-large teams -- to participate in the big dance that culminates with 
the Final Four in Denver at the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney said the committee will likely begin meeting in a Kansas City hotel the 
Thursday before invitations are sent out on March 11, and caucus through the 
weekend to come up with the nominees. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney expects the committee will make recommendations to the NCAA membership 
on how to allocate the $1 billion that CBS will begin paying next year for 
exclusive rights to the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to get back to the point where we play more for the trophy and 
less for the money," said Delaney. "I think there is a recognition that we need 
to use the money to encourage broad-based programs and more academic programs." 
</P>
<P>
Fairly certain is that the tournament will remain in its current 64-team format 
through 1997, when the CBS contract expires, because the broadcast rights were 
sold on that premise. 
</P>
<P>
In all the good news talk of power ratings, strength of schedule and magic 
numbers of wins and losses, Delaney did have one potentially ominous note for 
the ACC. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney declined to speak specifically on Maryland's current NCAA problems and 
the anticipated punishment, saying the school still is eligible for postseason 
play. 
</P>
<P>
But he did say that if a conference allows teams to participate in its 
postseason tournament where an NCAA bid is at stake, it runs the risk of 
forfeiting that bid if any of those teams wins the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"If that conference permits an ineligible institution to participate, and that 
team wins, then the automatic bid is lost," said Delaney. "It's as if they had 
forfeited the automatic bid." 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State already has been banished from this year's tournament, and 
Maryland may be forced to sit out when the sanctions are announced, presumably 
within the next two weeks.

LIVE, FROM OUTER SPACE: A NEW UNIVERSE OF TELECAST POSSIBILITIES; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: FOR THE COUCH POTATO OF THE FUTURE, DIRECT BROADCAST SATELLITES 
WILL PICK UP WHERE CABLE LEAVES OFF. PRICE, HOWEVER, COULD DETERMINE PROGRAM 
CHOICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For some of us, a simple television set, capable of receiving just the free 
programming broadcast over the airwaves, will be enough to meet our at-home 
video entertain- 
</P>
<P>
ment needs. 
</P>
<P>
But we will be the techno-dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
As Wednesday's announcement from four of the world's largest entertainment and 
technology companies underscores, yet more choices are on the horizon to entice 
would-be dinosaurs into accepting additional programming into their TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
Direct broadcast satellite, or "direct from outer space and into your home" 
broadcasting, is the latest service offering additional information and 
entertainment. Over the next two decades, there will be yet other services. 
They include improved cable service, which is expected during the next few 
years. Also possible are fiber optic broadcast lines, but these are not 
expected to be commonly available into the home for at least 20 years because 
of the high cost of bringing the cable to the doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
Which services will win out will depend largely on which can provide the best 
programming at the best price. Technology alone isn't the issue, some analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't watch fiber optics or satellites. They watch programs," said Paul 
Marsh, analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The real business question is simply whether there is any demand for yet more 
pay-to-view broadcast services, and whether that air time can be filled with 
quality programming," says Mitch Shapiro, a cable television analyst with Paul 
Kagan Associates in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Already it's clear that a growing number of Americans want more than just what 
is provided by conventional free network broadcasting. An estimated 45 million 
U.S. house- 
</P>
<P>
holds -- or nearly half of the total -- subscribe to cable television, 
generating about $13 billion a year in revenues for cable operators. Analysts 
estimate that by the end of 1992, 92% of the nation's households will have 
access to cable television and 70 million will subscribe. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement demonstrates that at least four major companies -- the 
Hughes Communications unit of General Motors, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., 
General Electric's National Broadcasting Co. and Cablevision Systems Co. -- 
believe that there will be sufficient demand for more programming. 
</P>
<P>
"The new service will give Americans a taste of the next century's boundless 
range of video choices," said Stephen J. Petrucci, president and chief 
operating officer of Hughes Communications, which will provide the satellite 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro says they may be right. Although direct broadcast satellite service was 
tried several years ago in the United States and was a colossal, expensive 
flop, Shapiro says the economics and technology of the business have changed 
sufficiently to give this service a chance. 
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, the costs of traditional lay-it-in-the-ground cable 
service is rising as operators are being forced to replace old wiring and relay 
stations with more state-of-the-art devices. Further, attempts to get by with 
simply extending the coverage of their existing equipment have prompted a 
flurry of customer complaints about service. That, along with concerns about 
high charges, has brought calls for re-regulation of the entire cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the cost of satellite service has dropped. The proposed 
service, called Sky Cable and scheduled for introduction in late 1993, plans to 
use the most powerful space transmitter satellite ever launched for commercial 
communications, according to the companies' joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
The high-power satellite system will make as many as 108 new channels available 
to receivers as small as a flat, napkin-sized dish that could be mounted on a 
window sill or roof top, the companies said. The receivers would cost about 
$300 and would be easily available at consumer electronics stores, the firms 
said. And Sky Cable operators say their monthly charge will be $25, about what 
the average cable subscriber now pays. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, current satellite broadcasting services beam low-power signals 
that require huge back-yard receivers -- often 12 feet in diameter -- to 
receive them. These "satellite dishes" cost $2,000 to $3,000 and are banned in 
many suburban communities as unsightly. 
</P>
<P>
But if Sky Cable is a success, analysts say, you can bet that there will be 
other similar services. Already, the Federal Communications Commission has 
issued licenses for eight satellite broadcast systems. And traditional cable 
operators may be among those operating the satellite systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Cable companies believe they are in the business of bringing entertainment to 
people's homes. If that means by wire in the ground, fine. But if it means with 
a satellite in the sky, that's what they will do, too," said one cable 
programming executive. 
</P>
<P>
SATELLITE TRANSMISSION 
</P>
<P>
1. Tevision programming is transmitted to a satellite. 
</P>
<P>
2. The satellite receives the programming. The satellites planned for Sky Cable 
are being billed as the most powerful space transmitters ever launched for 
commercial communications purposes. 
</P>
<P>
3. A home with a satellite dish can pull in the television signal from the 
satellite. Sky Cable will use a mini-dish the size of a dinner napkin and will 
cost about $300, the venture's participants say. Conventional dish antennas are 
about 10 feet in diameter and can cost more than $3,000. As with most existing 
cable and satellite systems, a cable will run from the mini-dish to a decoder 
on top of the television set. 
</P>
<P>
CABLE TELEVISION 
</P>
<P>
1. Programming of all types -- news, movies, sitcoms, sporting events -- is 
transmitted to a satellite orbiting high above the earth. 
</P>
<P>
2. The satellite receives, sorts and amplifies the information, then transmits 
it back to a ground station. 
</P>
<P>
3. The television programs travel along cables to the homes of subscribers. The 
telecommunications industry is moving toward the use of fiber-optic cable, 
which can carry its signals more quickly and with less interference than copper 
wire cable. 
</P>
<P>
The local cable operator receives the signal on a large dish antenna and 
redistributes it to customers. The company schedules and promotes the shows and 
signs up subscribers.

SIMMONS TO OFFER HIS OWN SLATE FOR LOCKHEED'S BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold C. Simmons, the Texas financier who has been challenging the management 
of Lockheed Corp., disclosed plans Wednesday to nominate his own slate of 
candidates for the aerospace firm's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Simmons said he will 
submit a rival slate of candidates at Lockheed's annual shareholder meeting 
March 29. Simmons, who controls about 18.9% of Lockheed, said he will ask 
Lockheed shareholders to reject the 15-member slate endorsed by Lockheed 
management in favor of a rival group that he plans to name. To comply with 
Lockheed's corporate bylaws, Simmons must identify his candidates by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed had no comment on Simmons' filing, said Ron 
Meder, a company spokesman. However, Meder said Lockheed recently prepared for 
such a board challenge by retaining Kekst &amp; Co., a New York-based 
communications consultant. "In the event there is proxy contest at the meeting, 
(Kekst &amp; Co.'s) expertise would be beneficial to us," Meder said. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed stock closed Thursday at $36 on the New York Stock Exchange, up $1.25. 
</P>
<P>
The Simmons announcement is the latest in a series of maneuvers and 
confrontations involving Lockheed and Simmons, chairman of the Dallas-based 
Valhi Inc., a holding company with subsidiaries involved in the production of 
chemicals, petroleum and forest products. At stake is control of the nation's 
eighth largest defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute erupted shortly after a Jan. 31 meeting between Simmons and 
Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep. Simmons demanded six seats on Lockheed's 
board, which consists of 15 directors, and asked the company's management to 
eliminate a "poison pill" takeover defense that was erected after Simmons began 
buying shares last year. Tellep refused to promise Simmons the seats and 
rejected proposals for eliminating the anti-takeover measures. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Simmons said he might seek control of Lockheed's board of 
directors by mounting a challenge at the company's annual meeting. Lockheed 
responded last week, surprising much of the financial world by scheduling the 
annual meeting for March 29. In recent years, Lockheed has held its annual 
meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
The scheduling forced Simmons' hand because Lockheed shareholders are required 
to make any board nominations within 10 days of the public announcement of a 
meeting date. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of methodically planning a board slate and a strategy for winning 
shareholder support in May, Simmons will now have to scramble to prepare for a 
March meeting, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Lockheed moved up the date to force Simmons to act immediately," said Howard 
Mager, an analyst at New York-based Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. "They 
forced him (Simmons) to move." 
</P>
<P>
However, Michael Snetzer, president of Simmons-controlled Valhi, said Simmons 
would select a board slate within the required time. A subsidiary of Valhi 
holds the 18.9% stake, the largest single block of Lockheed shares. Snetzer 
said Simmons decided to field a slate because he could not get a voice on the 
Lockheed board. 
</P>
<P>
"We own almost 20% of the stock in (Lockheed) and we think its appropriate to 
have representation," he said. "We're unhappy with the fact that we've been 
denied representation." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed spokesman Meder repeated a statement that Lockheed Chairman Tellep 
made Feb. 2 after Simmons indicated that he might launch a proxy fight for 
shareholders' votes to oust board members. 
</P>
<P>
Tellep's statement said in part that Simmons offered no plans or proposals for 
Lockheed and "provided no basis whatsoever for us to determine his intentions 
with respect to the company or whether his interests would be consistent with 
those of Lockheed and its other shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Simmons steadily has increased his holdings in Lockheed, 
developer of the Stealth fighter plane, from 6.25% last fall to 18.9% two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed produces some of the nation's most advanced weapons systems. However, 
like all arms makers, it is trying to deal with declining sales and tougher 
contracting terms imposed by the Pentagon. Some analysts say investors will be 
searching for a new vision for financial growth from Simmons and Lockheed 
executives in the wake of declining East-West tensions and the prospect of 
smaller defense budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to hear what Simmons has to say," said Howard Rubel, an analyst at C. 
J. Lawrence. "If he wants credibility, he will have to come to the street and 
preach his gospel. It's incumbent on both sides to articulate strategy and a 
fallback strategy as to how Lockheed can become a better company over the next 
two to five years."

AIR FORCE LIED ABOUT B-1 COSTS, GAO STUDY SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE CONTROVERSIAL REPORT BLASTS AF ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AS SHODDY. 
IT ALSO CHARGES THAT THERE WERE BILLIONS IN COST OVERRUNS ON THE F-15 AND F-16 
JET FIGHTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Air Force understated its cost on the B-1 bomber by $7.5 billion and on two 
other aircraft programs by an additional $18 billion, according to a draft 
General Accounting Office report that found that the Air Force's accounting 
practices have "significant internal control weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
The GAO disclosed, for example, that when the Air Force Space Division in Los 
Angeles found a $2.4-billion discrepancy in its accounting books, it simply 
made an "unsupported and arbitrary" adjustment to get the books to balance. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial report, which was the culmination of a three-year 
investigation, elicited a sharply worded statement by the Air Force, which "had 
serious disagreements with the content of the draft report and the handling of 
the audit. GAO's findings are fundamentally misdirected." 
</P>
<P>
But some members of Congress reacted with outrage to the findings and vowed to 
hold hearings to develop new laws to strengthen the government's financial 
management. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), whose staff obtained and leaked an 
executive summary of the unpublished draft report, said the findings "would be 
unbelieveable had we not seen firsthand the chaos in Air Force management." 
</P>
<P>
A number of the GAO disclosures are sure to prompt serious concerns throughout 
Congress, including the disclosure about the cost for 100 B-1 bombers. The 
report states that the cost of the bomber was represented as $23 billion, but 
the actual cost was $7.5 billion more. If that is confirmed, it would mean the 
B-1 exceeded the cost cap that the Pentagon guaranteed to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report said the F-15 jet fighter cost was understated by $8.3 
billion and the F-16 was understated by $9.9 billion. The gaps are even wider 
when research and development is included, it said. 
</P>
<P>
One specific problem is the service's failure to track military-owned hardware 
that is held by defense contractors. For example, $630 million worth of 
satellites paid for by the Air Force but in the possession of defense 
contractors were "not recorded in any Air Force property or accounting system," 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the GAO, which is an investigatory arm of Congress, was titled 
"Financial Management -- Billion Dollar Decisions Made Using Inaccurate and 
Unreliable Air Force Data." The GAO assigned hundreds of its auditors to the 
massive project. 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force spokeswoman said the service received the report Feb. 1 and has 
not had time to respond to specific allegations. In a lengthy rebuttal, 
however, the service claimed the GAO attempted to apply accounting principles 
used by profit-making corporations. It said the GAO concept for accounting "has 
not been accepted by the Congress or the executive branch." 
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the report fails to recognize the Air Force's "fund 
control system" used to report on the status of its funds to Congress. And the 
statement concludes, "The GAO report creates a faulty impression of waste and 
mismanagement. That perception is simply not true." The Defense Department may 
be less inclined to object to the GAO findings or to future reforms, according 
to a knowledgeable source. Longtime internal Air Force critic A. Ernest 
Fitzgerald, remarked, "Missing a few billion dollars? What the hell." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald, the management systems deputy in the Office of the Assistant 
Secretary of the Air Force for financial management, has railed for years that 
the defense procurement system has a "weakness in our protections against 
collusive fraud." He charged that what few internal checks and balances existed 
in the Pentagon's financial system were watered down by the Packard Commission 
reforms, implemented in an executive directive in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Julian Epstein, the staff director for the House Government Operations 
Committee, said, "If the report is true, it indicates very serious problems in 
the Air Force in terms of wasting billions of taxpayers dollars." The 
committee, along with Dingell's powerful Committee on Energy and Commerce and 
the House Armed Services Committee, may hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter, Dingell said the $2.4-billion accounting error committed by the 
Air Force Space Division is "five times the entire drug abuse education budget 
of the U.S. government." Dingell called for a 10% to 15% cut in the Pentagon 
acquisition budget. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO found that when the Air Force recently submitted financial reports to 
the Treasury it neglected to include $25 billion in assets and counted $10 
billion in other assets twice. 
</P>
<P>
The service lacks accurate data for "almost all of its non-cash assets, such as 
inventory, equipment, aircraft and missiles," despite the fact that its bases 
represent 16% of the real property of the entire U.S. government, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Air Logistics Centers, which hold inventories of spare parts, 
have record-keeping deficiencies that "contribute to $18 billion of inventory 
in excess of requirements."

Rosewood's Oil, Gas Assets for Sale: Buyers are being sought for the oil and 
gas assets of Rosewood Corp., the holding company owned by the trust estate of 
heiress Caroline Rose Hunt, whose financial unit is fighting for control of the 
financially troubled Los Angeles-based insurer First Executive Corp. The assets 
of Rosewood Resources are being shopped around as part of a divestment strategy 
that saw the sale last year of the Bel-Air Hotel in Bel-Air and the Hana-Maui 
hotel in Hawaii, a Rosewood spokesman said. The assets include oil and gas 
properties in the Midwest, Southwest and Rocky Mountain areas of the U.S.; 
offshore properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the Dutch North Sea, as well as 
onshore fields in France.

Irvine Buildings Sold: In a deal estimated to be worth more than $40 million, 
Newport Beach developer Hillman Properties sold two buildings in Irvine near 
John Wayne Airport to a partnership including billionaire Robert M. Bass. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership is leasing most of the space in the buildings -- about 234,000 
square feet -- to Bass' American Savings Bank. The lease is the third largest 
ever signed in Orange County. American, one of the nation's biggest thrifts 
with $16.3 billion in assets, finished moving 500 people into the buildings 
last week from offices in Whittier, Sherman Oaks, Fullerton and elsewhere in 
Irvine.

FDIC Chief Urges Deposit Insurance Reform: Depositors should be required to 
pick up more of the cost when financial institutions fail, L. William Seidman, 
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., told the House Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
However, Seidman said he is not yet prepared to endorse any specific plan to 
alter the current federal insurance system. The FDIC currently protects 
deposits up to $100,000. Seidman also said the corporation is studying a 
proposal to prohibit so-called golden parachutes for managers of banks that 
fail. The hearing was the first in a series to be devoted to the issue of 
deposit-insurance reform.

APPLE TO LAY OFF 3% OF STAFF AMID WEAKER EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Apple Computer Inc. announced Wednesday that it will lay off 3% of its work 
force as it struggles with rising customer dissatisfaction and sagging profit. 
</P>
<P>
"Apple is now paying the price for decisions it made several years ago when it 
elected to go for short-term profit gain rather than taking advantage of its 
leading position to go for greater market share," said Jonathan Seybold, 
publisher of Los Angeles-based Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
John A. Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, blamed the 400 layoffs 
on the slowing of the U.S. personal computer industry, which, after three years 
of double-digit growth, is expected to increase no more than 9% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts have been criticizing the world's second-largest personal computer 
maker for neglecting -- and even alienating -- its traditional customers. 
</P>
<P>
Apple was particularly faulted for failing to introduce an inexpensive, updated 
version of its original Macintosh, which has legions of stalwart users 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Apple introduced expensive Macintosh models for corporate use, where 
profit is greater. After numerous delays, Apple also released a portable 
considered by many as costly, bulky and difficult to read. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cuts in Apple's 13,500-member work force, which become effective in 
two months, will be made in the marketing and distribution departments of 
Apple's domestic division and in personnel, finance, community and government 
affairs and customer service divisions throughout the company.

TOKYO STOCKS CONTINUE TO FALL AFTER BIG PLUNGE

Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange continued to plunge early today, following 
Wednesday's sharp decline. Traders blamed foreign sellers, but overall trading 
was thin. 
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index of 225 stocks tumbled 601.98 points in late morning trading, 
then recovered some of the loss. At midday, the index was off 405.97 points to 
35,328.36. That 1.1% drop followed Wednesday's decline of 1,161.19 points, or 
3.15% -- the fourth daily loss in a row, and the worst since the global market 
crash in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese market's weakness will cast a shadow over Wall Street's opening 
today, where bearish sentiment is likely to rise among already jittery traders. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks opened with a rally today: 13 minutes into the session, the Nikkei 
was up 414 points. Then sellers soon took over, led by foreign speculators 
unwinding futures-related positions, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
But even without the futures-related pressure, "there aren't any reasons for 
the market to go up," said Toranobu Sugai, a trader at Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Asia Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's selloff was sparked by fears that the Bank of Japan might raise its 
discount rate for a fourth time since last May 31. That spurred dumping of 
Japanese bonds, driving market interest rates higher and spooking stock 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese interest rates rose sharply in January, partly as a reaction to 
Japan's strong economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated to Congress on 
Tuesday that he would not ease credit in the United States. That threw cold 
water on Japanese hopes that lower American interest rates might help lead to 
lower Japanese interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the market was primed for bad news by Sunday's good news -- for 
investors -- that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had won a convincing 
victory in elections for the lower house of Parliament. There had been 
widespread fear that the central bank had been postponing a rise in the 
interest rate it charges on loans to commercial banks until after the elections 
in order to bolster the ruling party's fortunes at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when trading opened Monday, stock prices declined instead of increasing 
as they usually do when the Liberal Democrats win an election. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, continuing fears ignited the selloff of national government 
bonds, forcing the Finance Ministry to step in with purchases to prop up prices 
in the morning. Then, an hour before closing, institutional investors began 
dumping large lots of stocks amid light trading, spurring a final-hour plunge. 
</P>
<P>
American-style computer-directed program trading -- which takes advantage of a 
gap between current prices and prices of stocks for delivery in the future, a 
trading strategy not followed here in 1987 -- was blamed in part for the 
plunge. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds rebounded sharply as stocks fell. 
</P>
<P>
Institutional investors reportedly sold stocks to avoid further losses that 
they feared they would have to list when they settle accounts March 31, the end 
of Japan's fiscal year.

BENNETT HAS A HUG FOR NEIGHBORHOOD PLAGUED BY DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saul J. Hill, who has spent 50 of his 91 years in the crowded blue-collar 
neighborhood near Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, did a spry little dance 
there Wednesday on 40th Place, a street plagued by drug sales and gang gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a ball cap and tennis shoes, Hill was looking excited and optimistic on 
a block that had been, to some extent, under siege. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, responding to repeated drive-by shootings, Los Angeles police 
began six months of stepped-up, 24-hour patrols of the neighborhood. 
Residential streets were barricaded with warning signs: "Narcotics Enforcement 
Area: Open to Residents Only." 
</P>
<P>
Now, in an atmosphere of calm, Hill had stepped out to welcome a newcomer to 
the block -- federal drug czar William J. Bennett, making one of his first 
stops on a three-day visit to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to do some good," Hill said happily. "This is what we need. You can 
never stop trying." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who met with teachers, parents and students at Jefferson High before 
touring the racially mixed neighborhood, was on his first trip to Los Angeles 
since the Bush Administration designated the Los Angeles-Orange County region a 
"high-intensity" drug trafficking center in January. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new anti-drug strategy, Los Angeles and four other targeted areas -- 
Houston, Miami, New York and the U.S.-Mexican border -- qualify to share $25 
million this year in special federal funds to combat the drug problem, and 
twice that much in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, a graying, tousle-haired administrator nearing the end of his first 
year as federal drug czar, spent much of Wednesday meeting with state, city and 
county officials to hear their ideas about anti-drug tactics and to brief them 
on the federal program. 
</P>
<P>
But, playing a favorite role as cheerleader and first-hand observer, he also 
took time to look at the problems of a particular neighborhood. In choosing the 
area surrounding Jefferson High, the nation's top drug official sought a place 
that has been hard hit by drugs and related crime -- and a place that is doing 
something about it, according to Bennett's aides. 
</P>
<P>
"This is another foray for me into the heart of America," Bennett told a crowd 
of several dozen residents from a lectern placed in the middle of 40th Place. 
Traffic was blocked off by police cars while mounted LAPD officers rode past 
homes like figures out of the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
The street is home to a Latino gang -- Crazy Street Kids -- which reportedly 
has been feuding with a gang to the south known as the 33rd Street Gang, said 
Sang Brown, a block captain of the local Neighborhood Watch program. 
</P>
<P>
There have been eight attempted drive-by shootings reported on 40th Place in 
the last 18 months, according to Brown. Around the high school, located down 
the block, there were 37 drive-by shootings and 112 assaults last year, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett described 40th Place as a tough neighborhood in a tough region -- 
noting that 47 gangs inhabit 10 square miles of South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"And yet progress is being made (here)," Bennett said. "This community is 
starting to turn itself around. Everybody I've talked to said it's better. You 
can walk the streets now." 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD barricade program, nicknamed "Operation Cul-De-Sac," is given much of 
the credit -- along with community Neighborhood Watch groups -- for 
discouraging drug dealing and drive-by attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month program is designed to make it more difficult for dealers and 
gang members to drive through residential areas. In its first two weeks, police 
said, the program has contributed to a decrease in crime and, at the same time, 
an increase in daily attendance at 2,590-student Jefferson High. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most striking things I've ever heard, I heard today," Bennett told 
residents after a closed-door meeting with school Principal Philip Saldivar. 
"And that's that 150 to 200 more students are back in school" during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents are concerned, however, over what might happen once the program 
ends. Asked whether drug dealers and gang shooters will renew their attacks, 
Bennett optimistically called for homeowners to take over a part of the burden 
of patrolling their street and reporting crime. 
</P>
<P>
"You never entirely remove the police," Bennett said. "But the responsibility 
may pass on to other people." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than rely on several policemen, he said, patrols may be taken over by 
"three or four civilians, with a policeman down the block. That's one way to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"Drug dealers . . . run from a policeman," he added. "They also run from a 
flashlight. They run from a neighbor with a bullhorn. Someone told me drug 
dealers behave like roaches -- you put the light on them and they run." 
</P>
<P>
One resident, however, described that outlook as overly optimistic. Calvin 
Wills, who has watched the neighborhood deteriorate over 20 years, said the 
stepped-up patrols have come too late. And once they end, he said, crime will 
creep in again. 
</P>
<P>
"With a show of force like this, naturally things are going to slow down," 
Wills said. "(But) the people committing the crime, they'll know the exact 
second the police leave. Then they'll start all over again." Pausing, he added: 
"Maybe it won't be as much as in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, however, seemed to win points from residents with his enthusiasm and 
good humor. Lumbering around the block with an entourage of police and county 
gang specialists, Bennett and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates stopped 
to hug the children of one resident who rushed out to see them. Later, Bennett 
took a long-handled roller to help a painting crew cover gang slogans scrawled 
on a block wall. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who was scheduled to continue his West Coast tour with a stop today in 
San Diego, is mindful of Los Angeles' importance to the anti-drug effort, said 
David Robb, a spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The region is considered a leading port of entry and trading center for not 
only cocaine but also PCP and Mexican and Asian heroin, Robb said. A recent 
study also disclosed that the average selling price for cocaine is lower in Los 
Angeles than any other place in the nation -- $11,000 to $16,000 a kilogram, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit worrisome," Robb said. "That's one of the reasons we designated 
L.A." as a drug trafficking center.

JUDGE POUNDERS IS TAKEN OFF BUCKEY'S RETRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS PREJUDICED. BUT CONCERNS ABOUT 
POST-TRIAL COMMENTS RESULT IN THE PLAN TO ASSIGN THE CASE TO A DIFFERENT JUDGE. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William R. Pounders, who presided over the 
record-breaking McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, was barred Wednesday 
from hearing the retrial of defendant Ray Buckey because of remarks the judge 
made after Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted last 
month of 52 counts. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Michael Hoff, who evaluated the defense's claim of bias, 
said in a written recommendation that, although he found no evidence that 
Pounders was prejudiced against Buckey or his lawyer, the case should be 
reassigned to another judge to avoid potential conflicts of interest during 
jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the prosecution and the defense would want to know if a prospective juror 
saw or heard any of the post-trial broadcasts that involved Judge Pounders and 
if so, what effect, if any, that would have on the prospective juror's capacity 
to be impartial," Hoff wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Judge Pounders may very well be forced into the position of ruling on a 
challenge for cause by either the prosecution or defense and would, in effect, 
be ruling on his own actions that were taken during the post-trial publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Hoff did not specify what Pounders had said that might influence a potential 
juror. 
</P>
<P>
After Hoff's recommendation, Judge Gary Klausner, presiding judge of the 
Superior Court's central criminal division, announced that he had decided to 
assign to a different judge Buckey's March 9 retrial on the 13 counts on which 
the earlier jury deadlocked. That choice will be announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Danny Davis called the ruling "a good decision," and his 
client agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with the ruling," said Buckey, 31, who is free on his own 
recognizance. "It concerned me that he (Pounders) had gone public and made a 
lot of statements people might misinterpret." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "I thought there was justice in the first trial. . . . Now 
we're going to go for justice again, for total acquittal, and put this thing to 
rest finally." 
</P>
<P>
District attorney's spokesperson Sandi Gibbons said the prosecution "respects 
Judge Hoff's ruling. Our concern is to try to bring this case to trial as soon 
as possible. We're ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
The removal of Pounders could delay the start of the trial, depending on how 
much preparation time the new judge feels is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders said afterward that he felt both "relief that I'm finally free" to 
channel his energies elsewhere, but also "disappointment" that he will not be 
the judge to take the case to its conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had appeared on at least 12 news programs after the verdicts because 
he felt it was important to explain why the trial took nearly three years and 
to defend the jury against public reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Following the first trial, Pounders made himself available to the local and 
national media and made the talk show circuit -- including "Nightline," "Oprah 
Winfrey," "Geraldo," "The Today Show," and "Good Morning America." 
</P>
<P>
The judge discussed the significance of videotaped interviews with the alleged 
child victims that the jury, but not the public, saw, and the impact of earlier 
interviews on the children's later trial testimony. He also talked repeatedly 
about the system of justice as one "that is set up to allow guilty people to go 
free" rather than to risk convicting the innocent. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge maintained that, "I don't think anything I said would affect the 
merits of the second trial and I didn't see any problem in selecting a second 
jury." 
</P>
<P>
However, Pounders said the stress and strain of the long trial had left him 
exhausted. He said he broke a molar while clenching his teeth and often took 
his frustrations out on his family, rather than allow them to surface in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I was honestly afraid I wouldn't live through it," he said. "I never saw a 
doctor. I didn't want to know. I had literally committed my life to the case." 
</P>
<P>
Davis had alleged that Pounders had demonstrated bias during the trial, which 
Pounders vehemently denied. The defense attorney cited the judge having called 
him "an ass," his slashing of the defense witness roster, his exclusion of some 
evidence, his refusal to pay all defense costs, and his vow to conclude the 
trial "even if it's over your dead body" as evidence of prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
But Pounders countered that the defense had consumed the majority of trial 
time, and had submitted "excessive" or unauthorized claims for financial 
reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
After reading written arguments from both sides, Hoff determined that "the 
papers and videotape submitted by (the defense) and the gross allegations 
contained therein did not cause me to find Judge Pounders was prejudiced 
against Mr. Davis or Mr. Buckey in the trial that recently concluded. The 52 
'not guilty' verdicts tend to support this view." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, while there was "a need to explain the court's function" to 
"an irate community," and that "the judge did just that," such activities would 
create a problem in jury selection for both the prosecution and the defense. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the first trial was frequently hostile and tense. But everyone was 
smiling Wednesday when Davis and Buckey stopped by Pounders' courtroom. The 
judge shook hands with them and wished Buckey "good luck."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY MOVES TO ENFORCE PROPOSED POLICE PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unable to forge a new labor contract with the Long Beach Police Officers Assn., 
Long Beach city officials said Wednesday that they have begun taking steps to 
enforce the provisions of their last contract offer in the 642-member Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
A state appeals court this week refused the police union's request for a stay 
that would have barred the city from implementing the contract offer while the 
union appeals a Superior Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
That ruling allowed the city to declare an impasse in police negotiations and 
adopt the work rules spelled out in its last offer without the consent of the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new work rules, the union president loses paid release time from 
regular police duties, some nighttime police patrols will be changed from 
two-officer cars to one-officer cars, and some officers will be reassigned from 
four-day work weeks of 10-hour days to conventional five-day work weeks.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FAMILIES OF SUSPECTS IN HOLDUP SUE FOR $10 
MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The families of robbery suspects killed by Los Angeles police and a fourth man 
who was wounded after a holdup at a Sunland McDonald's restaurant filed a 
$10-million lawsuit Wednesday charging that the officers used excessive force 
and murdered the three men. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed against the city, Mayor Tom Bradley, Police Chief Daryl 
F. Gates and more than 100 other defendants by Stephen Yagman, who specializes 
in civil rights suits against law enforcement personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department's Special Investigations Section, whose members opened 
fire on the robbery suspects Feb. 12 when one allegedly pointed a gun at the 
officers, was called a "death squad" in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that the mission of the SIS is to execute criminal suspects 
and that members of the unit used excessive force when they shot the four men, 
thereby violating their constitutional rights.

DAUGHTER BLOCKS AUTOPSY ON MAN WHO DIED AFTER MUGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Claiming that her family's religious rights have been violated, a Los Angeles 
Jewish woman received a one-day restraining order Wednesday blocking an autopsy 
on her father, who died last week from injuries suffered during a mugging. 
</P>
<P>
The children of Paul Reznek, who died Feb. 14 at the age of 83, said that the 
county medical examiner's handling of their father's case already has prevented 
an immediate burial as is called for by Jewish law. 
</P>
<P>
In the request for a restraining order, Reznek's daughter also argued that the 
autopsy is unnecessary because, she said, authorities have expressed doubts 
over whether there will be a criminal trial in the case. There are no suspects 
and police say the chances of finding one are slim, said the daughter, Dorothy 
Reznek, 40. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the 12:30 p.m. autopsy was scheduled to begin, Los Angeles 
County Superior Court Judge David Yaffe issued the temporary restraining order 
on the grounds that incisions made during the examination might violate 
religious guidelines about desecration of the dead and that a forensic 
examination is not likely to produce significant new findings, according to 
Reznek's son, Phillip. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision on whether to conduct the autopsy will be made at a hearing 
scheduled for today. Until the matter is decided the body will be held at a 
local funeral home. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Richard Townsend, the attorney representing the medical 
examiner's office, said he has not heard of any other case in which a 
restraining order based on religious reasons prevented the autopsy of a 
homicide victim. 
</P>
<P>
The medical examiner's office has insisted that the autopsy is necessary in the 
event that a suspect in the case is found. Because Reznek apparently died of 
complications from injuries he suffered during the mugging, charges in the 
crime could include murder, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Without an autopsy report, prosecutors probably will not have enough evidence 
to charge Reznek's assailant with murder, Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
But family members said that the medical records kept from the day of the 
assault clearly show the connection between a hip injury that Reznek suffered 
in the incident and his death. Reznek had been hospitalized since the attack on 
Dec. 12, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Reznek was mugged in downtown Los Angeles while returning to his Westside home 
after unsuccessfully trying to buy a monthly bus pass. He was thrown to the 
ground, and his assailant took a wallet with credit cards, traveler's checks 
and cash, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of Reznek's fall broke his left hip, authorities said. He underwent 
an operation and, although his condition had stabilized somewhat, he and his 
family felt that death was imminent, Dorothy Reznek said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Paul Reznek died, he and his family raised objections to an autopsy and 
a religious waiver form was filed with the medical examiner, the daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
The family was told that the body would be released after a brief "physical 
examination" and that no incisions would be made, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"All along the detectives had been strongly recommending that an autopsy be 
conducted," Dorothy Reznek said. But after reviewing hospital records, police 
detectives agreed with the family that the autopsy was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The evening my father died, the police investigators told me that a sufficient 
'paper trail' based on doctors' reports would provide everything that an 
autopsy would provide," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Family members also have expressed concerns about how the police investigation 
into the mugging was handled. Dorothy Reznek claimed that a cursory initial 
investigation into the robbery has reduced the likelihood of finding a suspect. 
Police did not interview her father, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no hope that they will ever find anyone, or that true justice will be 
served in this case," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Given the problems with the case, Reznek said, the coroner's interest in 
pursuing the autopsy for the sake of bringing Reznek's assailant to justice is 
all the more frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
"The (coroner's officials) seem to have completely lost sight that there was a 
human being involved here at one point. My father seems to have been lost in 
the shuffle. All we want to do is take him home."

ADDING TO MOSAIC OF L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forest Lawn, the cemetery outfit that brought you replicas of Leonardo da 
Vinci's "Last Supper" in stained glass and Michelangelo's "David" in marble, 
has added an attraction at its memorial park in the Hollywood Hills: copies of 
ancient Mexican artifacts in sandstone, concrete and plaster. 
</P>
<P>
The park's Plaza of Mexican Heritage, completed in 1987, includes full-scale 
copies of mosaics, sculptures and glyphs from the Olmec, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, 
Toltec, Mayan, Aztec, Huastec and Totonac cultures. 
</P>
<P>
There's a circular calendar stone copied from one found buried in Mexico City, 
a sacrificial chacmool figure from the ruins at Chichen Itza, a bas-relief from 
the ball court at El Tajin, and a god of pulque, the pungent fermented wine 
said to have led to the downfall of Quetzalcoatl, the priest-leader of Tula. 
</P>
<P>
The plaza also features subtropical plants native to the lush environment of 
southern Mexico and desert plants from the arid areas of northern Mexico.

MOST OF BEACH IS REOPENED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: ONLY HALF A MILE OF SHORELINE REMAINS CLOSED IN THE WAKE OF SEWAGE 
SPILL. BRADLEY JOINS CALL FOR ROUTINE CLOSURES AFTER STORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
County health officials on Wednesday reopened all but half a mile of coastline 
shut down last weekend when nearly 8 million gallons of minimally treated 
sewage flowed into Santa Monica Bay during heavy storms. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mayor Tom Bradley joined a growing chorus of environmentalists and 
government officials suggesting that Santa Monica Bay beaches be routinely 
closed following rainstorms because of contamination from another source: storm 
drain runoff. 
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded letter to county Board of Supervisors Chairman Pete 
Schabarum, the mayor wrote that county health officials should send "a clear 
message" to the public that "no one should swim in Santa Monica Bay after a 
rainstorm -- period." 
</P>
<P>
"(There are) more than 60 storm drains between (the) county line and the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula," Bradley wrote. "Through these storm drains flow a veritable 
witches' brew of oil and grease, organic compounds, bacteria, litter and 
residues of toxic heavy metals that originate on streets and property." 
</P>
<P>
The county is in charge of beaches and its health officials determine when and 
if beaches are to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Schabarum said Wednesday afternoon that the supervisor had not 
yet seen Bradley's letter. County health officials said that their decisions to 
open and close beaches are based strictly on the results of coliform tests 
which show the presence of bacteria caused primarily by sewage spills. The 
government-funded Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project is currently studying 
the development of a storm drain testing program -- to supplement the coliform 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 18 miles of shoreline from Topanga Beach to Palos Verdes Estates was 
closed over the weekend as a result of the city sewage overflow, which 
officials blamed on antiquated pipes that flooded with rainwater. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, county health officials had reopened all but four miles of beach in 
the vicinity of Ballona Creek, where the sewage, treated only with chlorine, 
spilled into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Based on additional coliform lab tests, officials Wednesday reopened all but a 
half-mile section of Dockweiler Beach in the Playa Del Rey area, from Sandpiper 
Street north to Ballona Creek. 
</P>
<P>
At a Los Angeles Board of Public Works meeting Wednesday morning, recently 
appointed Commissioner Felicia Marcus said that more discussions are 
anticipated with the county in an effort to have Santa Monica Bay beaches 
routinely closed after following storms. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, in his letter, urged the county, with city assistance, to "post signs 
year-round at every beach, explaining the impact of storm water pollution on 
swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus and other commissioners Wednesday praised city sewage treatment 
employees for their handling of the sewage crisis.

SANDINISTAS PULL LEVERS OF STATE POWER TO WOO VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the National Opposition Union closed its electoral campaign here last 
weekend, hundreds of Managua-bound supporters were stranded in the city of 
Masaya. The state-owned trains they were awaiting had been diverted without 
warning to Leon, scene of that day's rally of the ruling Sandinista Party. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did the huge sound system rented for the opposition gathering get to 
Managua. Trucked from Costa Rica, it remained impounded at the border for a 
fourth straight day, awaiting clearance by Sandinista customs officials. 
</P>
<P>
In an all-out drive for reelection, President Daniel Ortega's Sandinista 
government has pulled countless levers of state power to overwhelm its 
challengers in every way a campaign can be conducted -- from fund-raising to 
media exposure to crowd turnout. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a country torn by guerrilla war and lacking a tradition of free 
elections, the contentious six-month campaign for Sunday's election has 
surprised international observers and opposition parties by its relatively 
peaceful and open atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas flexed their organizational muscle by mobilizing 200,000 to 
300,000 supporters in buses, jeeps, dump trucks, trains and army vehicles to a 
festive demonstration along Managua's lake front Wednesday. The flow of 
humanity paralyzed the city of 1 million and made the ruling party's final 
rally at least five times bigger than the one staged by the opposition last 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"They say that the people are mobilized because we pay them or threaten them," 
Ortega told the crowd, which was also treated to fireworks, go-go dancers and 
brass bands. "Those who assert this have received millions of dollars from the 
North American government, which has not succeeded in buying the conscience of 
our people." 
</P>
<P>
By law, politicking was prohibited after midnight Wednesday. And, under a 
directive by the government's Supreme Electoral Council aimed at preventing 
violence, all parties are to keep demonstrators off the streets until midnight 
Sunday, six hours after the polls close. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has been marked by hundreds of peaceful rallies drawing large and 
enthusiastic crowds, mostly for Ortega and Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, 
presidential candidate of the U.S.-backed opposition union known as UNO. Just 
one was marred by violence, a Dec. 10 clash between UNO and Sandinista 
militants that left one man dead at a UNO rally in Masatepe. 
</P>
<P>
Some leaders of the 14-party coalition have complained of a "silent campaign" 
of Sandinista intimidation against their candidates and poll-watchers. 
Chamorro's chief strategist, Alfredo Cesar, charged Wednesday that the 
Sandinistas have abused their control of the media, public transport and the 
state bureaucracy to wage a "tremendously unfair campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Such grievances have been echoed by the Bush Administration throughout the 
campaign as a basis for questioning whether free and fair elections are 
possible here. 
</P>
<P>
While reporting extensively on these complaints, both official observer 
missions, from the United Nations and the Organization of American States, have 
presented a more favorable picture of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The difficulties that have arisen for the most part have been overcome," the 
OAS secretary general, Joao Baena Soares, concluded in a pre-election report 
issued Wednesday. "It is expected that the elections will take place in a 
climate that permits citizens to choose freely." 
</P>
<P>
All assessments of the campaign agree that the Sandinistas, who fought their 
way to power a decade ago and turned their guerrilla army into a powerful 
political machine, hold the incumbent's edge over a fragile and emerging 
opposition. But several disparities raise the question of fairness: 
</P>
<P>
 -- News broadcasts on the state television monopoly gave far more time to 
Ortega than his challengers. The state-owned Voice of Nicaragua radio network 
stretched the limits of objectivity by offering prizes such as cars and houses 
to listeners who correctly predict Ortega's margin of victory. Under criticism 
from observer groups, the government expanded free TV time set aside for debate 
among candidates. Baena Soares' report said television news coverage was more 
balanced at the end of the campaign but still gave the Sandinistas more time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Army trucks and other state-owned vehicles were routinely used to transport 
people to Ortega rallies, while government buildings were festooned with red 
and black Sandinista banners and wall paintings, in violation of the electoral 
law. 
</P>
<P>
"They fly the Sandinista flag from an army barracks near my office," said 
Guillermo Selva, an opposition member of the electoral council that is assigned 
to enforce the law. "I asked the army 20 times to remove it, but they just 
ignored me." 
</P>
<P>
Baena Soares said the government had shrugged off such appeals, even those made 
formally by the council. Nor has the government produced the receipts to back 
its claim that the Sandinista Party rents its trucks from the government. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he said in an interview, "the use of public facilities (by the 
government party) happens to some degree in every country. It's not a threat to 
this election." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sandinistas outspent the opposition while delaying delivery, through 
the Central Bank, of $3.3 million voted by the U.S. Congress to help Chamorro 
offset the Sandinistas' advantages. Those funds reached her coalition in late 
January, more than a month after they were deposited here -- a delay caused, in 
part, by UNO's failure to legally register an institute receiving part of the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
While the $3.3 million made up the bulk of UNO's campaign budget, the 
Sandinistas reported spending $6.4 million, including $3 million in materials 
and $419,000 in cash donated from sympathizers abroad and the rest in corporate 
and individual contributions at home. UNO's estimate of Sandinista expenses 
runs up to $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Fiallos, president of the electoral council, noted that UNO fared 
relatively well compared to the other eight opposition parties, none of which 
received more than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sixty-eight candidates for the National Assembly and 243 candidates for 
municipal councils resigned during the campaign. Most represented UNO, which 
claimed they were threatened by state security police and other Sandinista 
militants with loss of their lives, jobs or property. 
</P>
<P>
Baena Soares endorsed the finding of an earlier U.N. investigation that such 
cases did not suggest a pattern of intimidation centrally planned by the 
Sandinista government but rather were the work of local party members. He said 
his investigation was hampered by the failure of opposition parties to offer 
evidence of intimidation in most of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fair to say that there is a wide discrepancy between the prevalence of 
these charges and the production of any evidence of such actual intimidation," 
said former U.S. Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson, head of the U.N. mission 
watching the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that U.S.-backed Contras have attacked and killed at least four 
Sandinista campaign workers, Baena Soares branded the rebels as "the principal 
form of electoral violence." 
</P>
<P>
Despite claims that its poll watchers were threatened, UNO reported this week 
that it had fielded poll watchers for all but seven of the nation's 4,391 
polling stations, a critical step in monitoring the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Some observer groups are more critical than the U.N. and OAS missions of the 
Sandinistas' campaign conduct. But all observers agree that the election itself 
will have enough safeguards and international scrutiny to ensure a relatively 
fair count. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not feel the campaign has gone well," said Allen Weinstein, head of the 
Washington-based Center for Democracy observer group. "But if I felt the 
campaign were so badly flawed that it wouldn't matter what happened on election 
day, I'd strike my tent and go home." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties have reached the same conclusion. Because the main U.S.- 
backed anti-Sandinista coalition spoiled the 1984 election by pulling out, it 
is a notable event in Nicaragua's violent history that the contending forces 
are staying in this time.

BONNIE RAITT, MIDLER WIN TOP GRAMMYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonnie Raitt, whose career seemed in jeopardy four years ago when she was 
dropped by her long-time record company, climaxed a dramatic comeback Wednesday 
night by winning a Grammy for best album of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Raitt, who also won three other Grammys during the nationally televised 
ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium, has long been admired in the record industry 
for her fierce devotion to the blues, including championing veteran artists 
whose accomplishments have been sometimes overlooked by the pop world. 
</P>
<P>
"This means so much for the kind of music that we do," the red-haired singer 
said in accepting the best-album award. "It means that those of us who do 
rhythm and blues are going to get a chance again." 
</P>
<P>
In the other key awards, Bette Midler's "Wind Beneath My Wings" was named best 
single record of 1989 and the composition itself, written by Larry Henley and 
Jeff Silbar, was declared song of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Grammy awards are determined by the approximately 6,000 active members of 
the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Raitt, the 40-year-old daughter of Broadway singer John Raitt, 
come up in 1989 with her most successful album ever, "Nick of Time," she also 
overcame in recent years a drinking problem that led her to Alcoholics 
Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Delighted by the response to the new album last October, she said in an 
interview at the time, "In many ways, this is like a first album. . . . It's 
for a new label (Capitol) and getting all of this attention and critical 
acclaim 
</P>
<P>
"And it's my first sober album. . . . Being this age and being straight -- it's 
been the greatest time." 
</P>
<P>
In accepting the best-record Grammy, the evening's other most coveted award, 
Midler said, "I'm stunned and I'm flabbergasted. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Bonnie Raitt, I got one, too." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Raitt, other multiple winners Wednesday included jazz great Miles 
Davis, British soul-dance group Soul II Soul, composer-arranger Dave Grusin and 
country music's Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who was also saluted with a prestigious lifetime achievement award, 
picked up his fifth and sixth career Grammys for best jazz instrumental 
performance by a big band and by a soloist. 
</P>
<P>
Soul II Soul won Grammys for R&amp;B group vocal award and R&amp;B 
instrumental. The group, however, lost in the more prized category of best new 
artist to the duo Milli Vanilli. 
</P>
<P>
Grusin, winner of three previous Grammys, picked up three more, including one 
for the background score of the film "The Fabulous Baker Boys." 
</P>
<P>
The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band won a Grammy for best group vocal and shared a 
Grammy with Bruce Hornsby for best bluegrass recording. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's most potentially dramatic moment -- the much rumored reunion of 
the surviving Beatles -- failed to materialize because neither George Harrison 
nor Ringo Starr attended the event, though both were nominated for Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
That left just Paul McCartney, who was also saluted by the Academy with a 
lifetime achievement award. McCartney, currently on his first U.S. tour in more 
than a decade, thanked his wife, Linda, and their children for their support, 
gave a brief environment awareness message and described his former band mates 
as "beautiful people." 
</P>
<P>
The absent Harrison won a Grammy for best rock group vocal as a member of the 
Traveling Wilburys, the veteran rock group that also featured Bob Dylan, Jeff 
Lynne, Tom Petty and the late Roy Orbison. But the Wilburys lost to Raitt in 
the best-album competition. 
</P>
<P>
Starr was nominated in the country vocal collaboration category for a duet with 
Buck Owens, but also lost. 
</P>
<P>
Raitt's other Grammys were for female pop vocal, female rock vocal and 
traditional blues recording. The latter was for her duet with John Lee Hooker 
on "I'm in the Mood," a track from Hooker's album, "The Healer." 
</P>
<P>
Metallica's "One" was named best rock/metal recording, while Living Colour's 
"Cult of Personality" single was named best hard rock performance of 1989. 
Living Colour's victory shut out the controversial Los Angeles-based hard-rock 
band Guns N' Roses. 
</P>
<P>
The latter group had been widely criticized for allegedly racist remarks in a 
song, "One in a Million," that was included in its "GN'R Lies" album, which was 
a contender in the hard-rock category. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 members from the Los Angeles chapter of the Guardian Angels, the 
self-styled crime fighters, marched in front of the Shrine on Wednesday, 
handing out leaflets that branded "One in a Million" as racist for its use of 
racial epithets and New York rap group Public Enemy's "Welcome to the 
Terrordome" as anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy -- whose "Fight the Power" single lost in the rap category to 
Young M.C.'s "Bust a Move" -- has been criticized by Jewish leaders and others 
for possible anti-Semitic attitudes ever since a controversial interview by 
Professor Griff, the group's former "minister of information," that appeared 
last May in the Washington Times. 
</P>
<P>
Both Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns N' Roses, and Chuck D., the leader of 
Public Enemy, have denied racist or bigoted attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bolton won best male pop vocalist for his recording "How Am I Supposed 
to Live Without You," with the pop duo award going to Linda Ronstadt and Aaron 
Neville. 
</P>
<P>
Former Eagle Don Henley was judged best male rock vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
The video awards were strictly a family affair. Michael Jackson won in the 
short-form music video category as his younger sister, Janet, triumphed in the 
long-form music video competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Winans family teamed up for three indvidual Grammys in the gospel 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Connick Jr.'s victory in the male jazz vocal category is likely to stir 
criticism from the purist wing of the jazz community that has tended to think 
of Connick primarily as a cabaret or pop singer. 
</P>
<P>
Two names more commonly associated with pop and rock, Dr. John and Rickie Lee 
Jones, were also honored for best jazz vocal by a duo or group. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Ruth Brown, a star over the years in the R&amp;B and rock fields, was 
named best female jazz vocalist for her album, "Blues on Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Brown and Anita Baker were named best male and female R&amp;B vocalists. 
</P>
<P>
In the country field, k.d. lang was named best female singer for the second 
straight year, while Lyle Lovett's victory in the male singer category ended a 
three-year win streak for Randy Travis. 
</P>
<P>
Los Lobos was judged the best Mexican-American performance, while Jose 
Feliciano was cited as best Latin pop record. 
</P>
<P>
Celia Cruz and Ray Barretto shared the best tropical Latin performance award, 
while Ziggy Marley captured the reggae Grammy for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
The late actress-comedian Gilda Radner was honored for best spoken word 
recording. "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" was named best musical cast show album. 
Peter Asher was voted pop producer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In the composition categories, Carly Simon's "Let the River Run," from the film 
"Working Girl," was named best song written for a movie, while Danny Elfman's 
"Batman" theme was voted best instrumental composition. 
</P>
<P>
The classical Grammys produced a bumper crop of surprises this year. 
</P>
<P>
Best album -- a category dominated by big-budget, big-name symphonies and 
operas -- went to the Emerson Quartet's Bartok set, which also took the chamber 
music award. Placido Domingo and Kathleen Battle lost the vocal soloist prize 
to Dawn Upshaw and her Barber-Menotti-Harbison-Stravinsky program with the 
Orchestra of St. Luke's. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial sentiment did not help Herbert von Karajan's final recording, nor did 
25 weeks on the best-seller charts boost Gerard Schwarz and the Seattle 
Symphony past Leonard Bernstein's Mahler Third in the orchestral category. 
</P>
<P>
Other areas proved more predictable. Bloc voting from the Atlanta classical 
contingent no doubt contributed to the choral performance and engineering 
awards for Robert Shaw's recording of Britten's "War Requiem." Steve Reich -- 
the only American composer on the ballot -- took the composition prize for 
"Different Trains." 
</P>
<P>
The award for best opera went to the Metropolitan Opera's recording of Wagner's 
"Die Walkure." 
</P>

JOSTLING TO FIND A SISTER CITY; 
</P>
<P>
SO YOUR TOWN WANTS TO SHOW ITS CULTURAL SOLIDARITY WITH A FLEDGLING LOCAL

The idea struck Redondo Beach Councilman Terry Ward last month like a peal from 
the Liberty Bell: A constituent, a Czechoslovakian immigrant, had asked if the 
beachside city might be interested in becoming a sister city of Prague, the 
capital of his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'My God, what a terrific idea!' " Ward said, recalling his pleasure 
at the thought of casting a local vote of confidence in the recent democratic 
reforms in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"It touched me deeply. I wanted to move as fast as I could because I was afraid 
some other city would get the idea, too." 
</P>
<P>
Too late. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Ward was firing off an invitation to the mayor of Prague -- a letter 
studded with congratulations to him, his city and the whole nation of 
Czechoslovakia -- Chicago was issuing a rival proposition to Prague to become 
its partner in a cultural exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Stirred by the developments that have swept the communist world in recent 
months, U.S. municipalities nationwide are vying to establish city-level 
diplomatic ties with the fledgling local governments of Eastern Europe, 
according to the Alexandria, Va.,-based Sister Cities International, which acts 
as a clearinghouse for the municipal affiliations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting inquiries about Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, East Germany," 
said Tom Gittins, Sister Cities International executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"Muscatine, Iowa, and Cedar Rapids want to develop Czechoslovakian 
relationships, and Bloomington, Ind., has indicated they want a relationship 
with an East German city. Chicago has a serious proposal out for Prague and 
Cleveland is interested in Bratislava. The mayor of Fort Worth (Tex.) just got 
back from Budapest, and Toledo, Ohio, and New Brunswick, N.J., are working on 
Hungarian cities." 
</P>
<P>
The heightened interest is the understandable byproduct of a year of 
extraordinary change worldwide, Gittins and others say. To many, a link with 
the communist world right now is a link with history, observers say. And in the 
light of reform, governments that once seemed impenetrable now feel more 
approachable to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, he said, a team of Polish emissaries will visit 10 U.S. cities to 
learn the rudiments of running a local government. Meanwhile, demand is 
skyrocketing for affiliations with Soviet cities in the age of perestroika. 
Only last month, for example, Los Angeles officially adopted Leningrad, and 
Pasadena decided to pursue a link with Byurakan, a research center in Soviet 
Armenia that once was closed to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago, there were only six sister cities in the Soviet Union. Today 
there are 52, and we have about 60 pending inquiries," Gittins said. "As you 
can well imagine, there's a lot of excitement and a lot of change." 
</P>
<P>
Set up to promote cultural understanding through student exchanges and the 
like, sister cityhood, although generally apolitical in theory, has over the 
years shifted with changing global politics. When President Richard M. Nixon 
visited China, for example, U.S. towns rushed to find partners in that country, 
said Dick Oakland, director of member services for Sister Cities International. 
Now, in the wake of last June's massacre at Tien An Men Square, China is out, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Nixon's visit to China in the early 1970s, 40 U.S. cities established 
ties with municipalities there. But in the wake of the Beijing bloodshed, no 
new links have been forged, and 18 to 20 affiliations that were being 
negotiated have been put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, during the American hostage crisis, Los Angeles unilaterally suspended 
its sister city relationship with Tehran, and did not even bother to inform its 
sister city's government. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of what's hot and what's not," Oakland said. "And, right now, 
Eastern Europe is very hot." 
</P>
<P>
An offshoot of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's mid-1950s "People-to-People" 
initiative, Sister Cities International has linked about 870 U.S. cities with 
about 1,400 sister cities in 91 countries, Gittins said. Los Angeles has 16, 
more than any other city in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The relationships typically involve official visits, pen pal programs, zoo 
exchanges and other symbolic gestures of friendship that give even the most 
isolated U.S. towns a window on the world. In return, foreign cities -- which, 
unlike U.S. cities, can have only one sister city at a time -- get the 
advantage of direct medical, cultural and trade exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of those partnerships are in communist Europe -- Chicago, for 
example, has been a sister city of Warsaw since the 1960s. But most of those 
relationships, including the Chicago-Warsaw link, have been dormant until now, 
officials say, partly because the communist governments were uninterested or 
wary, and partly because of U.S. opposition to human rights violations in the 
Soviet bloc. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1984, for example, the politically conservative City Council of 
Vista, citing national security, turned down a local grandmother's emotional 
appeal to take a Soviet community as a sister city. The woman ended up creating 
a U.S.-Soviet pen pal program in her San Diego County city under the auspices 
of a now-defunct pacifist group based in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, then-San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein was forced to take back her 
city's invitation to Leningrad because of criticism from fellow Democrats and 
her city's Jewish community. And in 1987, opposition from an anti-Soviet group 
killed a proposal in Costa Mesa to make its first sister city the Soviet 
community of Melitopol. 
</P>
<P>
But in the wake of reforms, such relationships are now being sought by even the 
most conservative cities, said Steven Kalishman of the Center for Innovative 
Diplomacy, based in Washington, D.C., with offices in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who were interested before (in Soviet bloc sister cities) felt they 
needed to do something because of the nuclear situation," Kalishman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, people are interested for different reasons -- they want to be able to 
tell their kids and grandkids that they were part of the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, with Eastern Europe opening up, there is a lot of money to be be made," 
Kalishman said. "Through the sister city organizations, a lot of smaller 
corporations will have the opportunity for trade." 
</P>
<P>
Local officials, however, say that most recent efforts to link with Eastern 
Europe are based more on emotion than economics. The majority, they say, have 
been initiated by Eastern Bloc dissidents who emigrated here, and who are 
hoping to re-establish contact with their homelands after being estranged for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In Fort Worth, for example, the push to join with Budapest came at the behest 
of a pair of Hungarian-born Texas businessmen, said Toni Brown, executive 
director of the Fort Worth sister cities program. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men was an old friend of the mayor of Budapest, who -- in the age of 
Hungarian political reform -- was anxious for an alliance with a U.S. city, 
Brown said. The businessman approached Fort Worth City Hall, got the go-ahead 
to pursue the idea, and in early December a Hungarian delegation arrived in 
Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
"We took them to a ranch and a rodeo," Brown said, "and visited some schools 
and companies. We met with the Chamber of Commerce, did some Rotary (clubs), 
had a lot of private dinners and receptions." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the visit, the delegation from Budapest publicly invited Fort 
Worth to be its sister city. But "the real shockeroo," according to Brown, came 
at a private dinner held just after the announcement when the notoriously 
reclusive pianist Van Cliburn, who lives in Fort Worth, disclosed that he 
wanted to celebrate the new relationship by playing a rare concert this summer 
in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the union will become official with a signing ceremony the Fort 
Worth City Council hopes to link to the Van Cliburn concert several months from 
now. Meanwhile, in the spirit of the union, a delegation of Hungarian 
journalists has scheduled a trip to Fort Worth to bone up on U.S. political 
journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"Hungary's going to have their first election ever and the reporters there 
don't know how to cover one," Brown explained. 
</P>
<P>
In Redondo Beach, which has no Czech community to speak of and which already 
has two sister cities in Mexico, a similar personal contact prompted Ward's 
invitation to Prague. 
</P>
<P>
Josef Kubicek, a local developer who had defected from Czechoslovakia in 1964, 
said the idea came to him after reforms brought his old friends from the Czech 
resistance into power. Forty-one years of communist rule ended on Dec. 10, when 
Czech President Gustav Husak resigned, swearing in a new 21-member cabinet with 
the Communist Party in a minority role. 
</P>
<P>
"When the revolution actually happened, I knew that people in Prague needed 
emotional help more than anything else," said Kubicek, 55. He thought of 
approaching the Los Angeles City Council, since Los Angeles is better known, he 
said, but his City Hall contacts were all in Redondo Beach, where he has done 
business for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
So he took his idea to Ward, hoping, he said, that it would "let the people of 
Czechoslovakia know that people on the other side were thinking about them." 
</P>
<P>
There were a few glitches: Ward speaks nary a word of Czech, and when he asked 
a friend to help him find the name of the mayor of Prague, they came up with 
the wrong mayor -- a Communist who had just been ousted. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the letter was delivered to Prague, the old Communist mayor had 
been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Kubicek said he ended by hand-delivering Ward's letter late last month to the 
new mayor, Jaroslav Koran, who opened it on the day of his inauguration and 
didn't seem to mind that it was addressed to his Communist predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
Kubicek said Koran was "deeply moved," although "I don't think he ever heard of 
Redondo Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Koran sent back a letter expressing "great interest" in the offer and 
authorizing Redondo Beach to make a formal application to Sister Cities 
International. On Tuesday, Ward got a local go-ahead from the Redondo Beach 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
What will become of the offer is unclear. Lois Weisberg, Chicago's commissioner 
of cultural affairs, said Chicago has not yet had formal contact with Prague 
but has already asked Sister Cities International for priority on the Czech 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
Who will get Prague will be up to the international group, but Weisberg said 
Chicago is particularly anxious. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, she said, her city had put in for Budapest, only to find that Fort 
Worth had gotten there first. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Redondo Beach, Ward said he will fly to Washington next week to 
lobby the Czechoslovakian Consulate. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't get Prague, I don't know what we'll do. Suck our thumbs and pout, 
I guess," Ward said. "It doesn't mean we wouldn't be interested in reaching out 
to another (Eastern European) city though. We've got to teach these people what 
democracy's all about."

PRICE RISE OF 1.1% HIGHEST IN EIGHT YEARS 
</P>

<P>
Consumer prices shot up 1.1% in January, the largest monthly increase in nearly 
eight years, the Labor Department reported Wednesday, prompting warnings from 
economists that Americans may be facing a new inflationary spiral. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the January price gain was December's record cold snap, which caused 
huge jumps in energy and food costs. But even without energy and food, the core 
inflation rate for January was a troublesome 0.6%. 
</P>
<P>
If maintained for a full year, that would translate to an annual inflation rate 
of nearly 7.5%, contrasted with last year's 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Federal Reserve Board, which nudged interest rates down as 
the economy showed signs of cooling in 1989, is unlikely to allow rates to fall 
further as long as inflation appears to be gaining momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the energy and food (price gains) will probably unwind in the next few 
months, but it will be hard to get the core rate below where it is," said Bruce 
Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Inflation is certainly not declining, because labor costs were rising at about 
5% last year -- which puts a floor under what inflation reduction can do," 
Steinberg said. "There's not much comfort here." 
</P>
<P>
With energy and food costs included, January's gain was the biggest monthly 
jump in the Consumer Price Index since the 1.1% increase posted in June, 1982, 
when the economy was still recovering from the inflationary binge of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, which tends to interpret economic statistics as favorably as 
possible, acknowledged that January's retail figures were too high for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
"This is disappointing news," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
said. "We are hopeful that this is a bulge that will be temporary in nature, 
but inflation requires eternal vigilance, and we remain on a policy of wanting 
steady growth with low inflation." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that 
lingering inflationary pressures remain a stubborn problem for the U.S. 
economy. He suggested that the Fed would not allow interest rates to decline 
from current levels. 
</P>
<P>
The price figures, along with the prospect that the Federal Reserve Board will 
keep a tight grip on the nation's credit supply, offered little in the way of 
encouragement to consumers or investors. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rate jitters have contributed to recent declines in the stock and bond 
markets, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling nearly 39 points Tuesday 
and another 13 points Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Greenspan said economic indicators suggest that the economy 
is increasing in strength. "While we cannot be certain that we are as yet out 
of the recessionary woods, such evidence warrants at least guarded optimism," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the Fed had lowered its overall inflation estimate for 1990 to 
4% to 4.5%, down from a June forecast of 4.5% to 5%. The Bush Administration, 
meanwhile, is forecasting a 4.1% inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
But January's retail price report could raise doubts about both projections and 
the Fed's ability to keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
"This report is disturbingly high, because if you take out special factors it 
still leaves inflation at a 7.5% annual rate -- which is much higher than the 
Fed target," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The key here is services inflation," Sinai said. "That sector is strong, in 
short supply of workers, and wage costs are going up. Commodity prices can 
gyrate like a yo-yo, but services inflation is rock-hard." 
</P>
<P>
The nation's growing services sector, which accounts for nearly 55% of the CPI, 
posted a 0.6% price gain. 
</P>
<P>
But it was record cold weather that was responsible for much of January's price 
gain. Home heating oil soared a record 26.3%, pacing a 5.1% increase for 
overall energy prices. Fruit and vegetable prices jumped a record 10.2%, 
pushing the overall food index up 1.8% for the month. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Labor Department noted that food and energy accounted for 60% of 
the overall January price increases, economists warned that the report 
contained ominous signs of pervasive inflation in virtually every category of 
the CPI. 
</P>
<P>
Auto prices, for example, rose 0.6% during the month after sizable 0.8% and 
1.1% increases in December and November, when new-year models came out. Medical 
services, which tend to outrun other categories, were up 0.6% in January. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a good report," said Stacy Kottman of the economic forecasting 
unit at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "The most optimistic we can be is 
that, by the second quarter, we should see relief in food and energy. But these 
are real price moves which drain disposable income from people's pockets. It 
has a dampening economic impact." 
</P>
<P>
In Greater Los Angeles, consumer prices rose 1.1% for the month before seasonal 
adjustment, compared to a 1% unadjusted increase nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Before adjusting for seasonal changes, the consumer price index stood at 127.4 
in January. That means a hypothetical cross section of goods and services that 
cost $100 in the 1982-84 base period would have cost $127.40 last month, up 
from $126.10 in December and $121.10 a year earlier.

February storms may have been too much of a good thing for some -- closing 
highways and ski slopes under fresh powder -- but water sensors in Sacramento 
say California still faces a worrisome fourth year of drought. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers and municipal water districts have been warned to expect a 50% cut in 
Central Valley Project supplies -- the first such cuts since 1977, and only the 
second in the entire 50-year history of the federal irrigation project. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose, the state's third-largest city, has already decided on mandatory 
rationing this summer, while other cities along the Central Coast from Santa 
Cruz to Santa Barbara continue planning similar restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this, Los Angeles and most other Southern California cities will be 
spared major discomfort this year because they are a top priority of the State 
Water Project, which imports water from Northern California.

"We're not in a position yet to say it is certain, but we are pretty close to 
that -- it looks as if Southern California will receive 100% of its order," 
said David Kennedy, state water resources director. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, however, generally are not so lucky. Many are facing the difficult 
choice of finding alternative water supplies -- by pumping more from the ground 
or buying from neighbors -- or scaling back operations and scrambling to find a 
way to make loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for an end to the drought is not good, state water officials said 
Wednesday. No more storms are due in February, the last of the season's three 
wettest months, and forecasters do not expect a repeat of 1989's March Miracle, 
in which unseasonable storms delayed serious shortages. 
</P>
<P>
"It would take several pretty heavy storms to bring us out of it," said Gino 
Young of the California Department of Water Resources Drought Center in 
Sacramento. "Normal rainfall for the rest of the year is not going to do it at 
this point." 
</P>
<P>
Despite pounding storms that have inundated some Sierra towns with snow and 
washed down coastal cities, the state has seen only 70% of usual precipitation 
this year, Young said. Most of that has already soaked into dry soils, leaving 
little to run off into reservoirs or percolate into ground-water basins. 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, for example, the state's Four River Index measured only 4.26 
million acre-feet flowing in the Sacramento, Feather, Yuba and American rivers 
systems, the main source of the state's surface water. Water from those rivers 
slakes the thirst of Central Valley farms and cities in Northern and Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
At the current pace, those rivers will probably move about 11 million acre-feet 
of water in the entire year, Young said, or about 60% of normal. Based on 
historical rainfall patterns, there is only a 10% chance that enough rain will 
fall in the rest of the year to move the index into the normal range. 
</P>
<P>
Runoff is unlikely to increase in the spring because the state's snowpack 
contains 62% of the water it historically should contain this late in the rainy 
season. This is up from only 45% of normal two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
A lack of new water is compounded by low reservoir levels caused by three 
earlier drought years. As of Wednesday, statewide reservoir capacity stood at 
68% of its historic average for that date. In real terms, the state's biggest 
storage sites were less than half full. 
</P>
<P>
In scattered cases, the situation is much worse. Lake Isabella northeast of 
Bakersfield, for example, still contains only about 15% of capacity, according 
to state water-monitoring computers. 
</P>
<P>
State water officials have been trying to increase precipitation by seeding 
clouds, but the program has come under attack in rural Sierra County northwest 
of Lake Tahoe. Residents and elected officials there complain that additional 
snowfall will cause them hardship and cost them more for everything from space 
heating to snow plowing to flood control in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
William I. DuBois of the California Farm Bureau Federation said growers are 
already making hard choices about what to do if they cannot work out a way to 
replace the water being withheld by the Central Valley Project. 
</P>
<P>
Some growers, he said, will simply match the 50% water cut by planting 50% 
fewer acres, usually forsaking surplus crops, such as grains, in favor of 
perishable annuals, such as vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock operators will line up outside sources of feed for their cattle, 
sheep and other animals. This feed, from such places as the Colorado River 
basin that are not experiencing cutbacks, will pressure prices upward. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit and nut growers with trees in the ground likely will simply try to keep 
their orchards alive through the summer using whatever water is available and 
not worrying about poor crop yields. 
</P>
<P>
"It is serious, no doubt about that," DuBois said. "But it's not equally 
serious for all growers. . . . These people are really ingenious. Most of them 
will figure out a way to get by with the least possible damage."

CONVICT LAKE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As rescue divers lifted five more bodies from the frigid depths of this Sierra 
lake Wednesday, officials at the residential camp attended by the lake's 
teen-age victims said the youths were warned shortly before their deaths that 
the ice on which they were playing was too thin. 
</P>
<P>
"Come back! It's too dangerous!" camp counselor Randy Porter yelled at three 
teen-agers who were venturing toward the center of the lake, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Another boy also cried out to the group, according to a chronology prepared by 
officials at Camp O'Neal, where three victims resided and two others worked as 
counselors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is dangerous. We should go back. We could kill ourselves," the statement 
quoted the youngster as telling his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"He also stated that the ice was cracking under their feet as he made these 
comments," the statement said. "They (the victims) kept walking." 
</P>
<P>
Moments after the warnings, the three youngsters dropped through the ice, 
setting off a chain-reaction that ended with them and four would-be rescuers 
dead in the freezing lake waters. Porter, who issued the first warning, died as 
he struggled to rescue the children. Camp officials said it was his first day 
at work. 
</P>
<P>
The camp's statement was approved for release by the Mono County Sheriff's 
Department, which is leading the investigation into the deaths. It came as 
sheriff's deputies announced their own preliminary findings, which confirmed 
that adult counselors were with the youngsters on the ice shortly before their 
hiking party turned disastrous at noon Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The level of supervision accorded the youngsters has been a central part of the 
investigation into the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The findings of the investigators -- who include officers from the Sheriff's 
Department and the U.S. Forest Service -- will be forwarded to the Mono County 
district attorney on Friday, Sheriff-Coroner Martin Strelneck said. He refused 
to comment on whether the teen-agers should have been allowed on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I want to comment on that because of the continuing 
investigation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rescue teams using a sophisticated underwater camera worked 
throughout the day Wednesday and spotted all six bodies that remained trapped 
in the lake. One victim had been recovered Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, members of the Los Angeles County sheriff's diving team 
pulled up two bodies that had been resting on the sandy bottom 117 feet below 
the lake's surface. Authorities identified them as two 15-year-olds, David C. 
Sellers of Tulare and Shawn Rayne Diaz of Dinuba. 
</P>
<P>
Another two were brought to the surface Wednesday afternoon. They were 
identified as volunteer firefighter Vidar Anderson, 58, of nearby Sunnyslope, 
and counselor Porter, 36. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth body was pulled out shortly before dark. The Mono County Sheriff's 
Department said the victim was a juvenile. They would not officially identify 
him, but the third teen-ager who fell into the water Monday was Ryan 
McCandless, 13, of Redlands, whose parents said he had just arrived at Camp 
O'Neal on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the sixth body had been sighted, but waters clouded over before 
the diving team could move in. That final body was presumed to be that of camp 
counselor Dave Meyers, 53, of Bishop. Tim Christensen, who runs a school on the 
camp's grounds, described Meyers as an experienced back-country hiker who was 
familiar with conditions on the lake. 
</P>
<P>
The recovery effort was halted as darkness fell and will resume at daylight 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies, who earlier had predicted that they would not find all the 
bodies, credited the underwater camera for their success Wednesday. Its 
originator, Mark St. James of Reno, volunteered the camera and his services. 
The cylindrical camera can broadcast pictures from any depth to rescuers on the 
surface and can stay submerged in the icy water for long periods. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Sheriff's Capt. Steve Batchelor, who supervised the diving team, 
called St. James "today's hero." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we would not have recovered all these bodies without him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim recovered Tuesday was U.S. Forest Service employee Clay Cutter, 31, 
who ran to the lake to rescue others and was himself trapped. Cutter's wife, 
Terry, held a tearful lakeside press conference Wednesday in which she 
recounted watching her husband struggling to save others before he went through 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that Clay would not have had it another way," she said, her voice 
breaking. 
</P>
<P>
"God needed him early because he's such a good man." 
</P>
<P>
The chronologies released by the Mono County sheriff-coroner and the camp 
Wednesday addressed a major question for the investigators, who have, among 
other things, been trying to determine whether the children were unsupervised 
or whether counselors were with them on the treacherous ice. 
</P>
<P>
According to what investigators have been able to piece together so far, 16 
teen-agers and two adults left the camp on a recreational outing Monday morning 
and ended up playing on the ice at Convict Lake. It was not immediately clear 
how deep the water was in the area where they initially played. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, they broke into three separate groups, two of them accompanied 
by a counselor. The group without the counselor, Strelneck said, ventured 
farther out onto the lake than the others and was playing there when the ice 
beneath them shattered. Four of the five fell through, including the three who 
drowned and a fourth who made it back to shore. The unidentified teen-ager was 
hospitalized briefly. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing the ice crack, the counselors rushed to help the boys and fell through 
in what was a shallower, though no less lethal, area. They and two rescue 
workers who arrived later all perished. 
</P>
<P>
"(Counselor) Dave Meyers dropped his gear and went running in to save the 
boys," the camp's report said. "Randy (Porter) immediately told the kids to 
call 911 and then went in after the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Meyers, the camp statement said, was able to lift one of the boys from the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"(Meyers) went back in to the water to help the others," the report said. "It 
is unclear if the child he got out fell back in or jumped in to help others." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities identified Sellers as the boy Meyers had pulled out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
The camp, meanwhile, sought to counter any questions about the conduct of its 
employees. In addition to releasing the report, which repeatedly noted that the 
teen-agers had been warned off the ice, it also flew to Convict Lake the 
parents of one victim, Ryan McCandless. Speaking before their son's body was 
recovered, Ryan's father, Kerry McCandless, said he held the camp blameless. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids made a choice to go out on the lake," McCandless said. "It was wrong. 
. . . Accidents do happen." 
</P>
<P>
McCandless and his wife, Linda, spent the afternoon at the camp, where they 
talked to residents and were consoled by counselors. While they were there, 
groups of boys slept or lounged in a dayroom, receiving updates as the bodies 
were identified. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff-Coroner Strelneck, in comments to reporters Wednesday, characterized 
the investigation as a "borderline case" and said his plans to forward it to 
the district attorney did not imply that criminal charges would be filed. 
Strelneck said he decided to forward it to Dist. Atty. Stan Eller to ensure a 
thorough review. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Forest Service spokesman Dave Reider said the agency is reviewing its 
involvement in the tragedy, and said the probe could lead to a change in its 
policy of not posting signs warning of thin ice. But he said it would be 
impossible to police all of the state's lakes well enough to keep people off 
the ice. The Forest Service has jurisdiction over Convict Lake. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds of lakes and we can't post them all," he said. Even so, 
Reider issued a warning: "California's wild lands are inherently dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
On the icy lake surface, some rescuers spent the morning probing the hole into 
which the teen-agers disappeared, which is closer to the center than the one 
into which the adults fell. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a diving team from Washoe, Nev., was probing in the shallower area 
where the adults were last seen and came upon Cutter's body when they pulled on 
a rope that was floating below the ice. Cutter's hand was still grasping the 
end of the rope, which he had taken with him when he raced from his home toward 
the lake. 
</P>
<P>
But no other bodies were sighted, and authorities on Wednesday moved toward the 
deeper area where the children were last seen, using an air-propelled boat and 
the underwater camera. The camera spotted, in rapid succession, the remaining 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to retrieve the bodies were delayed for hours by a broken starter on 
the rescue boat. When the effort resumed, members of the Los Angeles diving 
team slipped into the lake, replacing the Washoe County team. Unlike the Nevada 
team, whose equipment limits it to dives of about 80 feet, the Los Angeles team 
can dive to about 300 feet, officials said. The Los Angeles team also has 
two-way radio equipment that allows it to communicate with supervisors at the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
Seven divers from Los Angeles arrived at the lake early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry we can't be here saving lives," said sheriff's Capt. Batchelor, a 
dive team supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, onlookers watched the rescue effort from the shoreline, 
among them the families of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Collins, the step-granddaughter of Vidar Anderson, the volunteer 
firefighter who lost his life trying to save other victims, came to the lake 
Wednesday against the wishes of her family. They felt it would be too 
traumatic, but she said she had to be there. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody had to be here for him," she said. "I'm here because I loved him."

JUDGE RULES TRIBE CAN'T DICTATE BABY'S FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise victory for a part-Aleut mother, a Santa Ana judge reversed 
himself Wednesday and decided that the teen-ager's native Indian tribe has no 
right to dictate who will adopt her 8-month-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis gave Jodi 
Argleben, 19, of Cypress, the right to choose who will rear her daughter, 
Rebecca. Argleben already has selected a couple in Vancouver, Canada, and 
smuggled the baby into their care in September. The baby has remained there 
during the protracted legal struggle over the adoption here and in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
A final decision almost certainly will be delayed by appeals. But Argleben has 
sworn that she will rear Rebecca herself rather than surrender her to the 
Aleuts in Akhiok, the small village on Kodiak Island, Alaska, where the 
teen-ager was born. 
</P>
<P>
Argleben beamed as Polis announced his decision Wednesday. Later, she said 
simply: "It's great." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Trope, the attorney representing the Aleut tribe, said he was so shocked 
by Polis' decision that he had not yet considered an appeal. But Argleben's 
attorney, Christian R. Van Deusen, said he expects the Aleuts to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Polis ruled Jan. 19 that the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act gave the tribe the 
right to make sure Rebecca is placed with an Aleut family. The Aleuts had cited 
that law, designed to stem the breakup of Indian families and the loss of their 
customs and culture. 
</P>
<P>
Polis said at the time that he made the decision reluctantly, because he felt 
that the law infringed on a woman's right to reproductive freedom by "reaching 
into her womb" and dictating who will rear her baby if she decides to give it 
up for adoption. But he said his personal objections did not make the law 
unconstitutional, so he had to follow it. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with Argleben's request for reconsideration Wednesday, Polis initially 
indicated that he was inclined to stick by his decision. But one hour later, he 
changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Polis zeroed in on a section of the law that says that Indian nations must be 
notified when an Indian child is being taken from its parents against the 
parents' will. But he noted that the law requires no such notice when an Indian 
child is voluntarily surrendered for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
The judge reasoned that if Congress did not mandate notice to the Indians in 
voluntary adoptions, it "may well be that (Indian tribes) have no right to be 
heard" in those situations. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is no question that Indian nations have been subjected to "crass 
racism and discrimination" by whites who felt that troubled life on tribal 
reservations entitled them to "drag off" Indian children and have them adopted 
by non-Indian families. 
</P>
<P>
But the circumstances of Rebecca's adoption are not the ones contemplated by 
Congress when it passed the Indian Child Welfare Act, Polis said. Rebecca has 
virtually no link to Aleut culture, since Jodi Argleben is only half Aleut and 
was adopted by a white family when she was 18 months old. 
</P>
<P>
If the baby were being taken from her parents and an existing Indian community 
involuntarily, Polis said, his decision "would be quite different." 
</P>
<P>
He also told Trope, the lawyer for the Aleuts, that he was troubled by the fact 
that Rebecca's Indian heritage means her mother loses control over her 
adoption.

LOTTO JACKPOT REACHES RECORD $67 MILLION

<P>
Californians' frenzied buying of up to 1,250 lotto tickets a second pushed the 
jackpot to a state record of $67 million, virtually assuring there was at least 
one winner in Wednesday night's drawing, lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities will not know for sure until about 6 a.m. today whether anybody 
beat odds of 1 in 14 million by picking these numbers: 44, 27, 34, 12, 21, 41, 
and the bonus number, 6. 
</P>
<P>
It will be later in the day before they can say where the winning Lotto 6/49 
tickets were purchased. And the announcement of who won depends on when winners 
come forward for verification. 
</P>
<P>
With sales as much as 35 times normal for the dream windfall that will pay off 
at about $2.5 million annually after taxes for 20 years, officials said they 
believe more people watched the televised drawing than tuned in to the Super 
Bowl last month. 
</P>
<P>
The prize pools were $9.03 million for players picking five of six numbers plus 
the bonus number; $4.6 million for picking five of six and $4.2 million for 
picking four of six. Players picking three of six will win $5, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Odds grew to 98 in 100 Wednesday that at least one gambler among the horde 
snatching up tickets would win the big prize. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely likely that there will be a winner because most of the (14 
million) possible combinations of numbers have been picked," state lottery 
spokeswoman Joanne McNabb said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only two chances in 100 that there will not be a winner." 
</P>
<P>
The odds were substantial, but not calculated precisely, that there would be 
more than one winning person, McNabb added. Sometimes the winning tickets are 
held by groups, so the riches from this jackpot may be spread to dozens of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery Director Chon Gutierrez said the top prize exceeds California's record 
jackpot of $61.98 million on Oct. 29, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
There were three winning tickets for the October, 1988, record jackpot -- two 
of which were held by groups. The jackpot ranks fourth in the nation, trailing 
a record $115-million lottery prize in Pennsylvania last year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how sales were running at the Ramona Village convenience market in Chino, 
assistant manager Adria Singleton said: "Like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
"We're running around chasing our tails here," Singleton said, laughing. "In a 
matter of two hours I probably did over $800 to $1,000 in sales on lottery 
tickets alone." 
</P>
<P>
The store might normally take in $400 to $500 in total sales during the same 
period, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are buying them up hundreds at a time," she added. "We even have our 
own little pool going here at the store just in case." 
</P>
<P>
McNabb, the lottery spokeswoman, said the pace of sales had hit a state record 
of $4.5 million per hour at one point, compared to a normal hourly sales pace 
of about $125,000. That figures to about 1,250 tickets per second, roughly 35 
times normal.

SOVIET TROOPS OK FOR NOW, WARSAW SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
POLAND: THE PRIME MINISTER WANTS ANY GERMAN REUNIFICATION ACCORD TO INCLUDE 
BORDER GUARANTEES.

<P>
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said Wednesday that he does not want to see 
Soviet troops withdrawn from Poland until the issue of Poland's western border 
with Germany is guaranteed by a formal agreement on German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a new stage of history created by the reunification of Germany 
. . . must not be entered with any ambiguity regarding Poland's western 
border," Mazowiecki said. 
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 Soviet troops are stationed in Poland, primarily supply and 
communications units supporting Soviet bases in East Germany. In other East 
Bloc countries, pressure is growing to speed up planned Soviet military 
pullouts. Some Soviet troops began leaving Hungary and Czechoslovakia last 
year. More are due to leave Czechoslovakia next week. 
</P>
<P>
Poland, which was the first East European country to oust its Soviet-backed 
Communist government from power last year, now finds itself willing to rely on 
Soviet forces to provide a guarantee for the borders set by the Yalta and 
Potsdam agreements at the end of World War II. Under those agreements, Poland 
lost eastern territories to the Soviet Union and gained German territory along 
its western borders. 
</P>
<P>
The Poles have demanded a role in the so-called two-plus-four negotiations over 
German reunification. Mazowiecki said Wednesday that Poland's ambassadors are 
delivering letters to the four major victorious powers of World War II -- the 
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France -- to press the Polish 
case. The "two-plus-four" formula refers to a plan, accepted by the two 
Germanys and the four wartime Allies, to have the Germanys meet to draw up a 
reunification program dealing with internal issues, followed by negotiations 
among the six nations on external and security issues. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki said Poles "cannot overlook" the pressure from right-wing groups in 
West Germany now agitating for the return of Silesia to Germany. On Monday, an 
association of West Germans forced to leave Silesia at the end of the war 
pledged to continue pressing their claims on the territory. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot give up our homeland," said Herbert Czaja, head of the group and a 
deputy in the federal Parliament in the Christian Democratic party of 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of conservatives in his election campaign, Kohl has not 
clearly stated his recognition of the Polish borders. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Michnik, a Solidarity Parliament deputy, criticized Kohl in Paris on 
Tuesday for his failure to do so. "If Mr. Kohl wants to be credible with his 
neighbors, he should express himself openly." 
</P>
<P>
East and West Germany have individually signed agreements recognizing Poland's 
western border, but Mazowiecki said Wednesday that he felt the agreements are 
unsatisfactory in the changing situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot have a situation in which we are told that a treaty is no longer 
binding because one of the countries involved no longer exists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have passed in the alliance with the Soviet Union to the state level from 
the ideological level," Mazowiecki said. "But this does not mean that . . . we 
do not see the importance of this alliance for the security of our borders." 
</P>
<P>
Although Polish public opinion supports a withdrawal of Soviet troops, 
Mazowiecki said, "We assess this situation realistically, in the perspective of 
the Germany problem, and thus at this moment do not put the issue in such a 
category."

GORBACHEV POWER PLAN FUELS DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
REFORM: AN EFFORT TO BEEF UP THE SOVIET PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY SPARKS FEARS OF A 
DICTATORSHIP.

Debate is growing in the Soviet Union over President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
proposals to strengthen the presidency, with some warning that the Kremlin may 
be creating legal mechanisms that eventually could turn the country into a 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
Others argue that the Soviet Union is being transformed so radically and 
quickly that it threatens to slide into chaos unless the president is given 
broad new powers to control the changes. 
</P>
<P>
New details emerged this week about the extent of the authority Gorbachev hopes 
to see vested in the presidency, including the power to declare a state of 
emergency in any area even without the approval of regional leaders and the 
right to override legislation passed by parliaments in any of the republics. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed constitutional changes to beef up the role of the presidency have 
been presented to deputies on a Supreme Soviet committee that views draft 
legislation in advance, and the proposals are expected to come soon before the 
entire Congress of People's Deputies, or Parliament, which has the power to 
enact constitutional amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev became chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1988, 
making him also the national president. It is his post as general secretary of 
the Communist Party that gives him his authority, but as the party loses power, 
Gorbachev is seeking to dramatically revise that formula. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III earlier this month that the party leadership decided it was necessary to 
increase the authority of the office of president if Gorbachev is to be able to 
overcome "obstacles" slowing perestroika, his program of economic and social 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
A number of officials have said that 1990 is a crucial year for the future of 
perestroika but that conservatives are still standing in the way of some 
reforms, particularly of the country's economic system, which they fear would 
represent too great an ideological break with communism. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some officials have complained that Gorbachev does not have enough 
authority to deal effectively with ethnic unrest that has swept the country at 
a dizzying rate. 
</P>
<P>
When he recently signed an order sending troops to the southern republic of 
Azerbaijan to stop anti-Armenian pogroms and what the Kremlin described as a 
nationalist uprising -- a move many in the nation thought was long overdue -- 
he had no clear constitutional right to do so. 
</P>
<P>
But some fear that giving the president these vast new powers may be going too 
far without the proper checks and balances. Their concern about an abuse of 
power is not focused on Gorbachev as much as it is on the leaders who might 
follow him, the critics say. 
</P>
<P>
Others believe that the Communist Party leadership, which developed its plan 
only earlier this month as part of an effort to restructure the government, is 
trying to get it approved by legislators too quickly, without needed debate and 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"I am rather worried by the undue haste with which this is being pushed 
through," said Anatoly Sobchak, a legislator from Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to be sure to create a balance of power," Sobchak said in the weekly 
Moscow News, published Wednesday. "Otherwise, we face the dangerous possibility 
of establishing a dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Alexeyev, chairman of the committee that considers draft laws before 
they are submitted to the Supreme Soviet as a whole, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
He said he supports strengthening the presidency as much as possible both to 
help Gorbachev in the face of his anti-reform opponents and to lead to greater 
political organization in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The new system approved by the Central Committee this month -- under which the 
Communist Party is no longer to be all-powerful, and could share control of the 
country with other parties -- may lead to confusion and even disintegration 
into nationalist groups unless the president is made the nation's clear leader, 
Alexeyev said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is as though our country were in a region threatened by a landslide, and I 
would like to get out of this situation as soon as possible," Alexeyev told 
Moscow News. "Delay could lead to the collapse of the state and the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Real power must belong to a strong institution which would stand above all the 
political parties and political infighting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sergei Stankevich, a member of Alexeyev's committee and prominent liberal 
legislator, said the planned changes do not provide enough checks and balances 
for the president's power and predicted the proposals will have a difficult 
time getting approved unless they are amended. 
</P>
<P>
"The leadership seems to have sent this document out in great haste, apparently 
in an effort to get discussions on it under way," Stankevich said in an 
interview. "But I definitely cannot support the proposals in their current 
form, and I will actively fight against them." 
</P>
<P>
Under the current draft changes, the president initially would be elected by 
the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies for a limited term while 
preparations are made for the first direct, nationwide elections of a 
president. The country's leader would then serve a six-year term, Stankevich 
said.

<P>
SOVIET UNION: IT WILL BE THE FIRST NEW RUSSIAN ORTHODOX EDIFICE IN 70 YEARS. 
AND THE PUBLIC WANTS CUPOLAS.

One design looked like the Taj Mahal. Another, sporting a minaret-like tower, 
could have been a mosque. And a third might have been an import from Disney's 
"Magic Kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
Interesting, perhaps, exotic even, but clearly not what the thousands who 
thronged an exhibition hall on the Moscow River on Sunday had in mind for Holy 
Trinity Cathedral, the first new Russian Orthodox church to be built in this 
country in 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
It was a traditional crowd, and they wanted a traditional design for the 
edifice that is to commemorate 1,000 years of Russian Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
"The cathedral should exemplify the magnificance of the Russian Orthodox 
Church, its connection with the history of the great Russian people, its 
activity, full of hardship, aimed at creating a united, multinational, strong 
state," wrote an anonymous 64-year-old on his ballot. "That is why a modernist 
project, to my mind, cannot reflect the significance of Christianity in 
Russia." 
</P>
<P>
The votes of these ordinary Russians will help a church panel narrow the design 
choice to eight finalists by the end of the month, with the winning entry to be 
selected in July. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both the exhibition itself and the extraordinary attendance are 
testimony to the enormous change in church-state relations under President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika program of reforms. 
</P>
<P>
It is symbolic that one of the two favorite designs submitted for the new 
church is an exact image of Christ the Savior Cathedral. Built in the 19th 
Century to commemorate Russia's defeat of Napoleon, the central Moscow 
cathedral was one of the largest in Europe until the late dictator Josef Stalin 
ordered it razed in 1931, to be replaced eventually by a heated, year-round 
outdoor swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
That was one of at least 40,000 Russian Orthodox churches destroyed here after 
the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution made atheism the official dogma. Thousands more 
were confiscated and turned into warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gorbachev, 1,000 churches have reportedly been given back to the 
Patriarchate, and last fall the leadership permitted the first religious 
service since 1918 within the Kremlin walls at Uspensky Cathedral, where czars 
were once crowned and church leaders buried. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time (since the revolution) that the Russian Orthodox Church 
has gotten so much freedom," said Valentin V. Solodovnikov, a construction 
engineer formerly employed by the Foreign Ministry to build Soviet embassies 
abroad but now working for the Patriarchate on the cathedral project. 
</P>
<P>
"If you visit any church you'll see crowds. There are many young people. Lots 
of baptisms and weddings. In today's unquiet times, people tend to go to church 
and find peace there," added Solodovnikov, himself a professed non-believer. 
</P>
<P>
"The policy today gives ground for a revival of people's interest in the 
church," agreed Elena Yegorova, who came to look at the competing designs with 
her husband. "People feel freer." 
</P>
<P>
So many came Sunday -- young and old, believers and atheists, men and women -- 
that the biggest problem was finding paper for them to write down their 
impressions. Exhibition workers ran out of pre-printed questionnaires by noon, 
with five more hours of crowds to come. 
</P>
<P>
One teen-age boy had a small silver cross dangling from his pierced left ear. 
Many visitors had learned of the exhibition from a lengthy segment about it on 
the main television news program Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was first announced in 1988, during the church's millennial celebrations, 
that a new cathedral would be built, and last year, Moscow Patriarch Pimen 
announced an open contest to come up with the best design. 
</P>
<P>
A wooded hilltop site overlooking the scenic Tsaritsyn Ponds in southeast 
Moscow has already been set aside for the cathedral, and completion is targeted 
for the year 2000. The church, to be financed entirely from contributions, is 
to hold up to 10,000 people, have underground parking for 700 cars and be 
surrounded by a park "with fountains, decorative ponds and exotic plants." 
</P>
<P>
By last Dec. 1, about 320 designs had been received from architects and a few 
amateurs in more than 50 cities. Many submitted not only drawings but colorful 
architects' renderings of their designs, and even scale models. Those were the 
materials put on public exhibition here. 
</P>
<P>
Most -- but not all -- featured at least a few traditional Russian Orthodox 
cupolas, or "onion domes," and one proposal had 45. But beyond that, the 
architects clearly let their minds roam. There were many modernistic designs, 
which drew large but mostly critical crowds Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Take the cupolas off and it looks like a railroad station to me," grumbled one 
young man about one design.

YUGOSLAVIA SETS CURFEW IN KOSOVO; 
</P>
<P>
ETHNIC STRIFE: TANKS PATROL THE STREETS OF THE PROVINCE TO PREVENT CLASHES 
BETWEEN ALBANIANS AND SERBIANS.

The government imposed a nighttime curfew Wednesday in Kosovo province, where 
more than two dozen people have died this year in ethnic clashes. 
</P>
<P>
The official Tanjug news agency said Soviet-built tanks and armored personnel 
carriers patrolled the streets of most Kosovo towns to enforce the 9 p.m. to 4 
a.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said Yugoslav authorities decided Tuesday that the curfew is needed "to 
defend the constitutional order and prevent violence." 
</P>
<P>
MIG-21 fighters streaked at low altitude over several towns, and small groups 
of heavily armed soldiers patrolled villages, sources in the region said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Serbs had rallied for three days in Kosovo Polje, a suburb of the 
provincial capital of Pristina, demanding a curfew and protesting what they 
claimed were threats by ethnic Albanian "separatists and terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians make up 90% of the population in Kosovo, a province of the 
Serbian republic. They oppose moves by Serbian leaders to more tightly control 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
One person died Tuesday and dozens were injured in clashes between security 
forces and tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian demonstrators demanding free 
elections, an end to a year-old state of emergency and the release of political 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, 28 ethnic Albanians have been killed in ethnic unrest, according 
to official figures. The same number were killed in all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
During the curfew, "movements and gatherings of people for the purpose of 
demonstrating" were strictly forbidden, said Belgrade Radio. 
</P>
<P>
Some small protests were reported during the day, mainly involving ethnic 
Albanian schoolchildren and youths who taunted riot police in several towns. 
</P>
<P>
A journalist who spoke by telephone from the region said nearly all ethnic 
Albanian students boycotted classes and at least 30,000 workers continued a 
two-week-old strike to protest what they described as "police repression." 
</P>
<P>
Serbian students at Pristina University demanded that authorities "guarantee 
their safety" from ethnic Albanians, Tanjug said. 
</P>
<P>
The students also demanded that all university officials who supported past 
demonstrations by Albanian students be fired and threatened to "continue their 
education outside the province" if the demands are not met, Tanjug said. 
</P>
<P>
The students also want authorities to jail the leaders of seven new opposition 
movements. The Serbs accused the students of inciting demonstrations and 
strikes by ethnic Albanians last month.

OMB CAN'T BLOCK SAFETY REGULATIONS, COURT SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: AGENCY MISUSED THE ANTI-PAPER WORK LAW, JUSTICES HOLD. THE RULING IS 
SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR WORKERS AND CONSUMERS AND AS A SETBACK FOR BUSINESS.

<P>
In a victory for workers and consumers, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that 
the White House may not block regulations intended to warn employees about the 
dangers of hazardous chemicals in their workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the dispute predicted that the ruling will have wide 
ramifications. Public interest lawyers said it could lead to more public 
disclosures on everything from food nutrition to the dangers of tampons. 
Business officials predicted that the decision would foster more costly and 
unnecessary warning labels. 
</P>
<P>
The high court said that the President's Office of Management and Budget has 
been overstepping its bounds by forcing federal agencies to withdraw 
regulations that it found too burdensome for business. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute dates to 1980, when Congress said the OMB could oversee the federal 
bureaucracy to ensure that citizens and businesses were not required to supply 
excessive and unnecessary paper work to the government. 
</P>
<P>
However, the court concluded, the Reagan and Bush administrations have used 
that authority to block the flow of warnings and other information to workers 
and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the case before the court (Dole vs. United Steelworkers, 88-1434) 
focused on the disclosures of hazardous chemicals mandated by the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act, the ruling went well beyond that situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold that the Paperwork Reduction Act (of 1980) does not give the OMB that 
authority . . . to review and countermand agency regulations" that order 
regulated entities, such as manufacturers or employers, to disclose information 
to third parties, such as employees or the public, Justice William J. Brennan 
Jr. wrote for a 7-2 majority. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White dissented. 
</P>
<P>
"For the worker, the consumer or the community activist, this will free up the 
flow of information on hazardous materials, consumer warnings and nutrition 
labeling," said David Vladeck, a lawyer with Ralph Nader's Public Citizen 
project. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug 
Administration have not required public disclosures of dangers from chemicals 
and drugs because of OMB pressure, Vladeck said. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision will unshackle those agencies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The United Steelworkers of America and the AFL-CIO first took the OMB to court 
in 1983 for blocking the worker-disclosure rules on hazardous chemicals. Two 
years ago, an appeals court in Philadelphia ruled for the steelworkers, a 
decision affirmed by the high court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the outcome. This means that all workers will be able 
to continue to have readily available on-the-job site information about toxic 
chemicals and hazards," said Margaret Seminario, AFL-CIO's director of safety 
and health. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the OMB refused to comment on the decision. 
</P>
<P>
During the Richard M. Nixon Administration, the Bureau of the Budget was 
transformed into the OMB and given new authority to put the President's stamp 
on the vast federal bureaucracy. In the 1980s, the OMB gained even more power 
as former President Ronald Reagan sought to get the government "off the back" 
of American business. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, however, the OMB's only legal authority to block federal agency 
regulations was the 1980 anti-paper work law. 
</P>
<P>
A series of business organizations joined the Bush Administration, 
unsuccessfully, in urging the high court to grant the OMB broader powers. 
</P>
<P>
"OMB provided a forum for business to make its case. Now that forum has been 
eliminated," said Clark R. Silcox, who filed a court brief on behalf of the 
Business Council on the Reduction of Paperwork. "There are a dozen other 
regulations out there like this one," he said, referring to the hazardous 
chemical disclosure rule upheld Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He and other business lawyers contend that zealous federal regulators, if 
unchecked, may require that everyone from pharmacists to gasoline station 
attendants be given lengthy disclosure statements on the dozens of chemicals 
that could be used in their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"This means just a lot of extra pieces of paper that are redundant and 
unnecessary," said Lawrence W. Bierlein, a lawyer who represented the National 
Wholesale Druggists' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In other rulings, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Upheld the popular "rails-to-trails" program under which abandoned rail 
lines are converted to hiking or biking trails. However, the court said that 
property owners whose land is crossed by a trail may file a federal claim for 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, more than 3,000 miles of recreational trails have replaced unused 
rail lines since Congress created the program in 1983. But a Vermont couple 
whose deed gave them the rights to the abandoned rail line on their land said 
the program was unconstitutional, both because it violated their property 
rights and because it exceeded Congress' authority. 
</P>
<P>
The high court disagreed unanimously but said the government could be required 
to pay the couple for their property (Presault vs. ICC, 88-1076). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said the Social Security Administration may deduct past overpayments of 
benefits from a recipient's monthly check without granting a hearing. On a 5-4 
vote, the court overturned a ruling that said this practice was unfair to 
elderly and disabled persons who depend on the money. The court said that the 
law required officials to correct errors whenever a recipient has been paid 
"more or less" than he or she is entitled to (Sullivan vs. Everhart, 88-1323).

Doctors for 12-year-old Stormie Jones, the world's first recipient of a 
heart-liver transplant, spent much of Wednesday trying to stop internal 
bleeding that began shortly after her second liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Children's Hospital suspected internal bleeding when the girl's 
blood pressure began dropping Tuesday night, seven hours after her transplant 
surgery ended. She had regained consciousness and was listed in critical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors decided Feb. 13 that Stormie, who lives in the Ft. Worth suburb of 
White Settlement, needed a new liver. The liver she received in 1984 had been 
damaged by hepatitis.

IT WASN'T MTV, BUT THIS GRAMMYCAST HAD ENERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's always the most performance-oriented of the awards shows, and thus the 
truest to its roots. So Wednesday night's Grammycast on CBS rocked. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly. 
</P>
<P>
The MTV revolution has so dramatically altered the way much of America receives 
its popular music that live performances at music awards shows inevitably 
suffer by comparison with the best of the multimillion-dollar maxi-videos that 
continually reach us through TV. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder, then, that some of Wednesday night's live numbers came across as 
lower-case music videos, projecting neither the driving physicality and 
sweatiness of a live concert nor the precision, climate-controlled cinematic 
quality of a studio production. Whatever the impact of some of these 
performances on the audience in Shrine Auditorium, no magnetism transferred to 
TV. Too much Milli, too much Vanilli. 
</P>
<P>
Yet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
From Billy Joel's energized opening to Bette Midler's energized thank-you 
speech for record of the year that closed the evening, there were many more 
riffs than raff. 
</P>
<P>
Credit executive producer Pierre Cossette with a good concept and Walter Miller 
with crisp direction. Although there were some obvious misfires -- pairing 
Olivia Newton-John with Sam Kinison was like pairing Jessica Lange with King 
Kong -- the talent blend mostly worked. 
</P>
<P>
A small but memorable moment: Presenters Ella Fitzgerald and Natalie Cole 
singing "Straighten Up and Fly Right." A big moment: Lifetime achievement award 
recipient Miles Davis working his magic. An eclectic moment: A chorus 
collaborating with Mike + the Mechanics on "The Living Years." A soulful 
moment: Harolyn Blackwell singing "Summertime." 
</P>
<P>
For sheer electricity, however, nothing topped the tribute to Paul McCartney -- 
a lovely, lingering interlude on a medium that too infrequently takes the time 
to linger. 
</P>
<P>
What inspired choices: Meryl Streep to present McCartney with his lifetime 
achievement award, after recalling her worship of the Beatles; Ray Charles, who 
inspired a young McCartney, to sing "Eleanor Rigby," and Stevie Wonder to pump 
out a moving, stomping, clapping, hothouse, Shrine-shaking rendition of "We Can 
Work It Out." Whew! 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't Garry Shandling's show. From his opening monologue, however, host 
Shandling was funny ("The updated score is Bonnie Raitt four, the Denver 
Broncos nothing," he cracked at one point about four-time winner Raitt) without 
being intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
If only he hadn't had such a bad hair night.

BENNETT VISITS L.A. COMMUNITY TORN BY DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saul J. Hill, who has spent 50 of his 91 years in the crowded blue-collar 
neighborhood near Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, did a spry little dance 
there Wednesday on 40th Place, a street plagued by drug sales and gang gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a ball cap and tennis shoes, Hill was looking excited and optimistic on 
a block that had been, to some extent, under siege. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, responding to repeated drive-by shootings, Los Angeles police 
began six months of stepped-up, 24-hour patrols of the neighborhood. 
Residential streets were barricaded with warning signs: "Narcotics Enforcement 
Area: Open to Residents Only." 
</P>
<P>
Now, in an atmosphere of calm, Hill had stepped out to welcome a newcomer to 
the block -- federal drug czar William J. Bennett, making one of his first 
stops on a three-day visit to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to do some good," Hill said happily. "This is what we need. You can 
never stop trying." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who met with teachers, parents and students at Jefferson High before 
touring the racially mixed neighborhood, was on his first trip to Los Angeles 
since the Bush Administration designated the Los Angeles-Orange County region a 
"high-intensity" drug trafficking center in January. 
</P>
<P>
Four Orange County representatives -- Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, Sheriff Brad 
Gates, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi and Santa Ana Police Chief Paul Walters 
-- took part in a meeting with Bennett and other public officials at Los 
Angeles County Jail. While no specific allocations of new funds to fight drugs 
in either Los Angeles or Orange counties were discussed, the Orange County 
contingent said they found the meeting useful. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent 90 minutes addressing in depth the nuts and bolts of the federal 
strategy of the drug war," Vasquez said afterward. "It provided us with a great 
opportunity to better understand what it is and what it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new anti-drug strategy, Los Angeles and four other targeted areas -- 
Houston, Miami, New York and the U.S.-Mexican border -- qualify to share $25 
million this year in special federal funds to combat the drug problem, and 
twice that much in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, a graying, tousle-haired administrator nearing the end of his first 
year as federal drug policy adviser, spent much of Wednesday meeting with 
state, city and county officials to hear their ideas about anti-drug tactics 
and to brief them on the federal program. 
</P>
<P>
But, playing a favorite role as cheerleader and first-hand observer, he also 
took time to look at the problems of a particular neighborhood. In choosing the 
area surrounding Jefferson High, the nation's top drug official sought a place 
that has been hard hit by drugs and related crime -- and a place that is doing 
something about it, according to Bennett's aides. 
</P>
<P>
"This is another foray for me into the heart of America," Bennett told a crowd 
of several dozen residents from a lectern placed in the middle of 40th Place. 
Traffic was blocked off by police cars while mounted LAPD officers rode past 
homes like figures out of the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
The street is home to a Latino gang -- Crazy Street Kids -- which reportedly 
has been feuding with a gang to the south known as the 33rd Street Gang, said 
Sang Brown, a block captain of the local Neighborhood Watch program. 
</P>
<P>
There have been eight attempted drive-by shootings reported on 40th Place in 
the last 18 months, according to Brown. Around the high school, located down 
the block, there were 37 drive-by shootings and 112 assaults last year, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett described 40th Place as a tough neighborhood in a tough region -- 
noting that 47 gangs inhabit 10 square miles of South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"And yet progress is being made (here)," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD barricade program, nicknamed "Operation Cul-De-Sac," is given much of 
the credit -- along with community Neighborhood Watch groups -- for 
discouraging drug dealing and drive-by attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month program is designed to make it more difficult for dealers and 
gang members to drive through residential areas. In its first two weeks, police 
said, the program has contributed to a decrease in crime and, at the same time, 
an increase in daily attendance at 2,590-student Jefferson High. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most striking things I've ever heard, I heard today," Bennett told 
residents after a closed-door meeting with school Principal Philip Saldivar. 
"And that's that 150 to 200 more students are back in school" during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents are concerned, however, over what might happen once the program 
ends. Asked whether drug dealers and gang shooters will renew their attacks, 
Bennett optimistically called for homeowners to take over a part of the burden 
of patrolling their street and reporting crime. 
</P>
<P>
"You never entirely remove the police," Bennett said. "But the responsibility 
may pass on to other people." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than rely on several policemen, he said, patrols may be taken over by 
"three or four civilians, with a policeman down the block. That's one way to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"Drug dealers . . . run from a policeman," he added. "They also run from a 
flashlight. They run from a neighbor with a bullhorn. Someone told me drug 
dealers behave like roaches -- you put the light on them and they run." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who was scheduled to continue his West Coast tour with a stop today in 
San Diego, is mindful of Los Angeles' importance to the anti-drug effort, said 
David Robb, a spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The region is considered a leading port of entry and trading center for not 
only cocaine but also PCP and Mexican and Asian heroin, Robb said. A recent 
study also disclosed that the average selling price for cocaine is lower in Los 
Angeles than any other place in the nation -- $11,000 to $16,000 a kilogram, he 
said.

MARROW DONORS DON'T NEED PERFECT MATCH, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Medical researchers unveiled new evidence Wednesday showing that doctors don't 
need a perfect match when they try to transplant bone marrow into someone whose 
blood-producing cells have been damaged by leukemia or another deadly illness. 
</P>
<P>
Bone marrow transplants are usually most successful when the marrow is donated 
by a brother or sister whose cells have the same pattern of surface proteins. 
When the protein pattern matches, it reduces the likelihood that the donated 
marrow will be rejected or produce serious side effects. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin, using special techniques 
to cleanse the donated marrow, found that transplants can be successful when 
the protein pattern in the donor's marrow is similar to, but not identical to, 
the recipient's. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, reported in the current New England Journal of Medicine, suggest 
that "we can now start tapping into the enlarging pool of volunteer marrow 
donors" whose marrow "will lead to satisfactory results for many patients," 
said Dr. Robert C. Ash, chief author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
The ability to use marrow from unrelated donors is important because only about 
30% of patients who might benefit from a bone marrow transplant will have a 
brother or sister whose marrow is perfectly matched, Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
This issue was dramatized last week when a 43-year-old Walnut woman disclosed 
that she was having a baby in the hope that the newborn can become a bone 
marrow donor for her 17-year-old daughter, who has leukemia. Tests have shown 
that the fetus's bone marrow is nearly identical. The birth is expected in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
In the four-year study of 55 patients, the transplants were successful in 48% 
of patientswith early leukemia, 32% of the volunteers whose leukemia had 
reached an advanced stage, and 63% of the patients who suffered from diseases 
other than leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 31 of the 55 patients died, usually from infection. 
</P>
<P>
Graft-versus-host disease, a potentially deadly reaction that appears when the 
cells of the transplanted marrow attack the body, occurred in nearly half the 
patients. Ash and his colleagues characterized that rate as relatively low. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce the risk of graftversus-host disease, the donated marrow was 
initially treatedwith chemicals to kill white blood cells that trigger an 
immune response.

O.C. 8TH-GRADERS SCORE WELL ON WRITING TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County eighth-graders bucked a slight statewide decline in writing 
scores released Wednesday by posting a six-point increase at the same time that 
their counterparts across California dropped a point. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Orange County schools averaged 288 on the test, compared to a 
statewide average of 255. 
</P>
<P>
"Six points is really quite significant," said Tom Fong, a research analyst 
with the state's California Assessment Program. "Orange County did very well." 
</P>
<P>
Most districts in the county showed significant gains, with some leaping by 
more than 20 points on the 400-point test. Brea-Olinda Unified School District, 
in northern Orange County, scored the greatest improvement, increasing by 22 
points to an average of 352. That score put it in the 98th percentile of 
districts statewide. 
</P>
<P>
At the district's only junior high school, Principal Mike Condiff credited the 
improvement to his staff and to a classroom configuration that gives students 
two consecutive periods of language arts and lumps the school's highest 
achieving students with others who are struggling. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since we've gone to that system, our scores have increased dramatically," 
he said. "If you track kids into a remedial program, all they get is mediocre 
literature." 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Elementary School District, also on the county's northern border, 
dropped by 26 points, the most of any county district. However, its students 
still posted an average score of 258, three points higher than the state 
average. Educators there said they were still reviewing the scores. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lange, director of the county Education Department's effective schools 
unit, attributed Orange County's generally strong scores to the emphasis area 
schools have placed on writing in recent years. Some districts have also been 
especially effective at teaching students whose native language is not English, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with many students who come from foreign-language backgrounds, 
and teaching them writing is an important part of their education," Lange said. 
"I think you'll find that our students probably will always be a little bit 
above the state average." Local educators were particularly gratified by the 
progress made in Santa Ana, which, with 43,000 students, is Orange County's 
largest district and the ninth biggest in the state. More than half of the 
district's students have limited English skills. Still, writing scores there 
increased 11 points to 259, for the first time overtaking the state average. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Ana is to be commended for the tremendous work that they are doing, 
especially with dealing with their large population of students who have 
limited English skills," Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Supt. Rudy Castruita, an outspoken proponent of improved 
English-as-a-second language instruction, agreed that renewed emphasis on 
writing skills has helped boost the district's scores. 
</P>
<P>
More than 21,000 Orange County eighth-graders took the 45-minute essay test 
last spring, and they were among 308,000 students statewide to participate in 
the exam. Students were required to write an essay in one of eight categories: 
autobiographical incident, evaluation, problem solution, report of information, 
firsthand biography, story, observational writing or speculation about causes 
or effects. 
</P>
<P>
The essays were graded on the thinking and writing processes they displayed, as 
well as on basic skills such as spelling and grammar. 
</P>
<P>
Because the exam moves away from multiple-choice testing, it has won high 
praise from some testing experts. Cinthia Schuman, executive director of 
FairTest, a watchdog group campaigning for better ways of measuring student 
achievement, praised California's writing test as "moving in the right 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, girls continued to score markedly higher on the writing test than 
did boys, a pattern that has shown up every year since 1987, when the test was 
first administered. This year, girls scored an average of 280, while boys 
averaged 232. 
</P>
<P>
The CAP tests, which are administered annually to almost all California 
students at various grade levels, are not meant as barometers of individual 
students' performance. Rather, they are used to evaluate schools and the 
effectiveness of their curricula. 
</P>
<P>
While Orange County educators said their continued success in the writing 
scores was evidence of the county's strong commitment to teaching those skills, 
Bill Honig, state superintendent of public instruction, worried that the 
statewide trend is not as positive. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said the one-point dip in scores might be attributable to the addition of 
two new writing categories in the eight-essay test but added that "it's clear 
we still have a long way to go in developing our students' writing abilities." 
</P>
<P>
Although some teachers and educators complain that CAP scores oversimplify a 
school's educational performance, Honig said Wednesday that a recent survey 
indicates that the CAP writing test is "successfully influencing the English 
curriculum in middle and junior high schools." 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of English teachers polled said they believe that the CAP writing 
test "will improve or strengthen" their schools' English curricula, Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writer Jane Merl in Los Angeles contributed to this report. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY GRADE 8 WRITING ASSESSMENT TEST SCORES 
</P>
<P>
California Assessment Program scores for eighth grade writing were released 
Wednesday, and Orange County students overall raised their scores by six 
points. Meanwhile, students across the state dropped one point, at least in 
part because of changes in the test format, according to state officials. The 
Orange County improvement was "significant," state officials said, and local 
educators credited the results to area districts' emphasis on writing skills 
and new programs for educating students who speak English as a second language. 
</P>
<P>
To read the scores: Averages on the 400-point test are listed by county, 
district and individual schools. Testing experts advise against making too much 
of a single year's results and instead recommend that parents look at a 
school's progress over a period of at least two years. Scores for 1987-88 are 
listed in the left-hand column, while last year's are displayed in the 
right-hand column.

DELAY IN HIRING NEW DEPUTIES RECOMMENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The county administrative office is recommending that the hiring of between 20 
and 54 new sheriff's deputies for the South County area be delayed until the 
1990-91 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Adding the deputies for the unincorporated part of South County -- where the 
patrol staff is stretched thin and there has not been a manpower increase since 
1984 -- was considered during last year's budget hearings, but the Board of 
Supervisors agreed to delay a decision until the mid-year budget review. 
</P>
<P>
That review was completed last month. The Sheriff's Department did receive $4.6 
million to cover a budget shortfall, but action on the South County patrol 
issue was delayed once again, with the county staff promising to return to the 
board with its analysis and recommendation within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The initial recommendation by the administrative office was to simply defer any 
consideration of new deputies until the 1990-91 fiscal year. But after meeting 
with three supervisors Wednesday -- South County representatives Gaddi H. 
Vasquez and Thomas F. Riley and Board Chairman Don R. Roth -- Assistant County 
Administrative Officer Murry L. Cable agreed to put the item on the agenda for 
the board's March 6 meeting, with a recommendation from his office that new 
hiring be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue needs to be deliberated in public in a board meeting," said Vasquez, 
whose district includes the unincorporated communities of El Toro, Lake Forest, 
Rancho Santa Margarita and Coto de Caza. "It's something that I'm concerned 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, whose district includes Laguna Hills and Aliso Viejo, said he hopes that 
he and Vasquez can persuade at least one other supervisor to approve the hiring 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is now," Riley said. "The growth in South County is great; the needs 
are there. We sometimes think of it as a rural area when really we should think 
of it as urban." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Brad Gates, who was in Los Angeles much of Wednesday and had not yet 
heard about the county administrative office recommendation, responded angrily 
when he heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been told that," Gates said. "The agreement we had with the CAO is 
that (County Administrative Officer) Ernie Schneider was supposed to call me 
last Friday. . . . He hasn't done that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider is on vacation this week. Cable, as the assistant administrative 
officer, is scheduled to meet with the two remaining supervisors, Roger R. 
Stanton and Harriett M. Wieder, today. 
</P>
<P>
The last few months have been rough going for Gates, who has increasingly found 
himself at odds with the Board of Supervisors and the county staff over his 
budget requests. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, some board members told Gates that the new genetics testing 
laboratory he wanted should be paid for with money seized in drug raids. Gates 
eventually got funds for the lab without using the drug-raid money. But Gates 
was dealt another, big setback when the board voted to sell Rancho del Rio, 
where the sheriff had wanted to build an international narcotics enforcement 
training facility. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a Gates-backed plan to increase the sales tax to pay for a 
new jail was ruled unconstitutional by a Sacramento County judge, leaving the 
county's plans to relieve jail overcrowding in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Doug Storm, commander of the South County sheriff's substation in Laguna 
Niguel, said he did not want to comment on the county administrative office 
recommendation to delay the new hires until the matter goes before the board 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still hopeful that something can be worked out," Storm said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the three alternatives the board will consider are plans to hire 20, 39, 
or 54 new deputies, at initial costs of $1.3 million or $2.6 million or $3.6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
There are now 122 deputies to patrol South County -- the same number as in 
1984. According to a county report completed last December, population in the 
area has increased about 18% a year and calls for service have increased about 
15% per year in the unincorporated area. 
</P>
<P>
The report also says that South County deputies spend almost 60% of their time 
responding to calls for service and writing reports, and 13% of their time on 
"preventive patrol" -- that is, developing contacts, stopping people who are 
acting suspiciously and patrolling neighborhoods to seek suspects and deter 
crime. The average response time for the highest-priority calls, including 
those for crimes in progress, is more than eight minutes, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
The general standard for law enforcement is to have patrol units spend between 
40% and 60% of their time on preventive patrols; the average response time for 
highest-priority calls should be five minutes. 
</P>

OIL IN SAND MAY KEEP BEACHES SHUT

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when it appeared that efforts to mop up the Orange County oil spill were 
winding down, authorities feared Wednesday that a thin vein of crude may have 
seeped into the sand along a broad stretch of shoreline, threatening to 
indefinitely delay the opening of beaches. 
</P>
<P>
If tests find oil lurking in more than a few isolated pockets in Huntington 
Beach and Newport Beach, officials say they would be forced to rev up the 
cleanup and possibly call in heavy equipment to tackle the oil-tainted sand, a 
process that could take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Kim McCleneghan, the state Department of Fish and Game's oil-spill coordinator, 
said the oily residue runs along about 10 miles of shoreline from Bolsa Chica 
State Beach to Newport Beach, in some spots 10 to 20 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
"In some areas it is heavier than others," McCleneghan said. "In the sand you 
can feel it, you can smell it." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities speculated that heavy rain, strong winds and pounding waves from a 
fierce storm that lashed the Southland last weekend may have driven oil that 
had washed ashore as much as a foot deep into the sand above the high tide 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect this will delay the opening of the beaches," said Petty Officer Tim 
Rowe of the U.S. Coast Guard. "The beaches look very good on the surface. But 
right now we have to figure out what to do with the stuff underneath." 
</P>
<P>
Work crews began in earnest Wednesday taking samples along a six-mile stretch 
of coastline from the Huntington Beach pier to just south of the Newport Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with British Petroleum, the firm that owned the 394,000 gallons of 
Alaskan crude that spilled Feb. 7 off Huntington Beach when the tanker American 
Trader punctured its hull with an anchor, said workers were digging into the 
sand at periodic points along the shoreline to determine the extent of the 
spread. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Webster, the firm's crisis manager, said British Petroleum has "always 
felt we would find areas in which some subsurface penetration of oil had 
occurred. There is now evidence that the storm may have resulted in a larger 
penetration zone than initially recognized." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the state Department of Fish and Game will review the results 
from the survey of the sand and decide how to tackle the problem after 
consulting with representatives of local cities, the Coast Guard and the oil 
company. 
</P>
<P>
In past days, authorities have found oil "from an inch down to four inches, a 
fairly significant amount of concentrated oil," said Curt Taucher, a state Fish 
and Game Department spokesman. Last week, Fish and Game officials found oil at 
a depth of 15 inches, he said. In most places the ribbon of oil has been less 
than an inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
Taucher said teams from the agency at first "were under the impression the 
beaches were being cleaned up satisfactorily" but found in recent days there 
were still significant concentrations of oil when they surveyed the area. 
</P>
<P>
Among the options being weighed by officials is employing a tractor and disk to 
plow up the crude so it can be removed by work crews or allowed to break down 
and evaporate in the sunlight. Authorities are also considering whether to try 
using a machine that normally picks up beach debris to sift the oil-tainted 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
McCleneghan also said that hundreds of workers wielding shovels would dig up 
some sections of oil-stained sand, put it in bags and have it trucked away. 
</P>
<P>
But they appeared to have ruled out employing bulldozers to dig up large 
sections of sand and cart it off. McCleneghan said officials want to "minimize 
the amount of sand removed from the beaches." 
</P>
<P>
For all the cleanup efforts, "there are limitations," McCleneghan said. "We 
can't get all the oil off the sand. . . . It won't be gone. We're not going to 
physically pick up and carry away" all the sand. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "we're going to try" to clean up enough oil "so you won't be able 
to pick up a handful of sand and say this feels oily, this looks oily, this 
smells oily." 
</P>
<P>
McCleneghan said he could not estimate when the cleanup could be finished. 
"It's not going to be months," he said. "In some areas, it could be a matter of 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Webster said it is unclear how long a stretch of beach contains the layer of 
oil, which mixes with sand to look like brown sugar. But the firm remains ready 
to do whatever is necessary to clean the beach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing we want to see are the beaches reopened, kids out there playing 
with sandcastles and coming across oil," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
Some local city officials, meanwhile, were calling on British Petroleum to 
conduct toxicity tests to ensure that the beach will be safe when the weather 
turns warm and crowds begin to hit the sand. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to have chemical analysis done every quarter or half mile to see if 
there's any contamination," Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays said. "When I 
open that beach, I want to make sure its safe for people to walk on." 
</P>
<P>
Mays said he suspected all along that oil had seeped below the surface of the 
beach, noting how he watched high winds from the weekend storm spread sand 
drifts over sections of shoreline already covered with crude. 
</P>
<P>
Other local officials said they were pleased that British Petroleum was making 
efforts to unearth any oil that may have percolated into the sand. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy they are testing because we have been suspicious about the 
possibility of seepage," said Newport Beach City Manager Robert L. Wynn. "We 
suggested to BP in our meetings with them that they test for this." 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Game marine biologist Ken Wilson was one of several experts who has 
run across pockets of oil deep in the sand, but closer to the surf line. 
</P>
<P>
While digging for grunion eggs last week at Bolsa Chica State Beach, Wilson 
found "thin layers of what appeared to be oil-soaked sand" about four inches 
below the surface. About 5 or 6 inches down the biologist discovered an 
inch-thick layer of sand saturated "very heavily with oil." 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't gooey but you could definitely see the sand grain was discolored to 
a brown," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The layer of ooze could pose problems for the environment. Any grunion eggs 
would probably die as the oil permeated them, Wilson said. On rock jetties 
blackened by oil, numerous organisms risk being fouled by the crude, including 
barnacles, algae and various sea creatures. 
</P>
<P>
But the spill has had its most visible impact on birds. By Wednesday afternoon, 
446 birds had been found covered with oil but alive, while 370 have died 
because of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, work crews on Wednesday began cleaning rocky jetties stained by the 
crude. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with equipment shipped from Alaska, where it had been used on the Exxon 
Valdez spill, workers sprayed a warm rinse of seawater to wash down rocky 
stretches of shoreline on Newport Beach and Bolsa Chica State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
About 350 people participated in the cleanup Wednesday along beaches stretching 
from Bolsa Chica south to Newport Beach.

DEVELOPMENT PLAN CLEARS A HURDLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 37-acre development along Santiago Creek cleared a major hurdle this week 
when the City Council approved a conceptual plan for the project, despite pleas 
from several local residents who said traffic and flood problems have not been 
adequately addressed. 
</P>
<P>
The council must adopt a special traffic plan for the area before the project, 
dubbed Villa Santiago, can receive final approval. 
</P>
<P>
The Santiago Golf Course is on the main portion of the development site in the 
south central section of the city. The Burnett-Ehline Development Co. of 
Anaheim plans to develop 160 homes, a shopping center and a 3.5-acre greenbelt 
on the site. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 to conditionally approve the plan. Councilman Gene 
Beyer and Councilwoman Joanne Coontz said they could not support the 
development because the lot sizes are smaller than anticipated. They also 
expressed concerns about liability issues associated with placing that many 
residences on a flood plain. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 local residents, including several from the Santiago Creek Homeowners 
Assn., spoke in opposition to the project at the council meeting. The main 
concern voiced by the residents was that the developer had not made sufficient 
plans to control Santiago Creek in the case of a flood. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a honeymoon between the home buyers and (the developer). It'll 
be great," said Dave Horowitz, who lives near the proposed development. "Until 
the first flood, that is. Then there will be trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Developer Lynn Burnett said the creek bed will be channeled in anticipation of 
the "worst-case scenario," a 100-year flood. 
</P>
<P>
A few residents commended the developers for coming up with a workable project 
that included larger lots and a greenbelt not seen in the original plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission had sent the development plan to the council with no 
recommendation earlier this month, saying it had not had enough time to review 
changes the developer had made in the project. 
</P>
<P>
The changes included dropping the extension of La Veta Avenue between Tustin 
and Cambridge streets and, instead, creating a greenbelt area with bicycle 
paths and walkways. KATHIE BOZANICH

2 FRAT HOMES DENIED OPERATING PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Greek letters must come off the front of two fraternity houses in Fullerton 
as the result of a city decision to deny operating permits for both houses near 
Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
After three hours of public hearings Tuesday, the City Council ordered Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Pi to vacate their fraternity houses on Teri Place 
north of the campus. Neighbors and police said the houses are sites of frequent 
loud parties, including a "house-emptying brawl" in December between members of 
the two fraternities. 
</P>
<P>
Although the unanimous decision means both houses must revert to their original 
use as apartments, City Atty. R.K. Fox said, the council's vote does not 
prevent fraternity members from moving back into the houses once modifications 
are finished. 
</P>
<P>
Members of both fraternities said they plan to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision requires that the apartments may not be used for 
fraternity functions, but both fraternities may reapply to the city in six 
months for permits to reopen the apartments as fraternity houses. 
</P>
<P>
Along with denying permits for the two fraternities, the council also voted 
Tuesday to send letters to the university and to the fraternities' national 
charters asking them to disband the groups. 
</P>
<P>
Revocation of the permits does not mean the death of the two fraternities, said 
Charles Buck, vice president of student services at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The university will decide on the fate of the fraternities after the Greek 
judicial council completes its review of the two houses, Buck said. The council 
will hold hearings on the matter in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
For years, fraternities living in Greek houses in residential neighborhoods 
near the campus have resulted in complaints from neighbors of loud noise, 
fights, trash left in yards and parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to solve the problem, the city began requiring fraternity and 
sorority houses to apply for operating permits beginning in 1988. The permits 
require the residents to limit noise, the numbers of cars parked in the street, 
and abide by other restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Pi sued the city over the regulations, claiming 
that Fullerton didn't have the right to regulate those actions. But a Superior 
Court judge upheld the city's permit process in August and told the 
fraternities to seek a permit or close. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's public hearing, Melinda Cater, who has lived half a block from 
the fraternity houses for 10 years, said the fraternities create noise and 
parking problems late at night. 
</P>
<P>
"They have individually and collectively tried the patience of our 
neighborhood," Cater said. "I beg of you to stand firm and remove these two 
from our neighborhood and send a message to the other fraternities." 
</P>
<P>
Sigma Alpha Epsilon member Greg Simonian, 20, said his fraternity has done its 
best to be a better neighbor, including banning all parties at the house and 
adopting a formal quiet period beginning at 9 p.m. every night. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're asking for is a chance to officially abide by your rules," said 
Simonian, a sophomore at the university. "SAE has cleaned up our act 
substantially." 
</P>
<P>
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Pi are the only two Cal State Fullerton 
fraternities denied permits for their houses along fraternity row. Five other 
fraternities and six sorority houses have received city permits.TOM McQUEENEY

HOUSING COSTS CITED IN HOMELESS SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most comprehensive survey of Orange County's homeless in five years 
suggests that most are victims of the high cost of housing, and most in need of 
help paying their first month's rent. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the study says, most of the homeless do not fit the stereotype of 
a drug- or alcohol-addicted, mentally ill transient who rejects assistance and 
chooses a rootless life style. 
</P>
<P>
Many are young -- baby boomers who lack a college education, marketable skills 
and who are forced into the streets by the high cost of housing. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the key findings of a survey of nearly 2,000 homeless people 
sponsored by the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
The study, released Wednesday at a Santa Ana news conference, is intended to 
aid service providers in pinpointing the community's specific needs. 
</P>
<P>
"It will allow us to help begin to direct our goals and objectives, what we 
will be doing as a task force in the next few years," task force Chairman Scott 
Mather said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force also hopes that the survey will aid local officials in devising 
broader solutions to end homelessness -- and spur increased spending on the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I think there is a recognition of the problem, but it boils down to 
funding," said Joel W. Rosen, a senior planner with the city of Fullerton and a 
member of the task force research committee that presented the survey findings. 
"Cities must deal with competing resources, and it creates serious problems," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Questionnaires were distributed in January and February, 1989, at 17 agencies, 
including all four county welfare offices, a mental-health drop-in center, 
homeless shelters, a center for the disabled, and the Santa Ana and Fullerton 
National Guard armories, which shelter the homeless during inclement weather. 
</P>
<P>
Task force members noted that the survey was not designed to provide a count of 
homeless in Orange County, generally estimated to range between 6,000 to 10,000 
men, women and children. It has been suggested that those estimates are too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
But task force members said that the limited survey sample does not necessarily 
relate to the overall number of homeless in the county, adding that estimates 
of their number may actually be too low. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of people not coming forward for help is the same problem you have 
in trying to determine unemployment," said James W. Meeker, a UC Irvine 
professor of social ecology and a member of the task force research committee. 
"People get so discouraged that they don't look and are not counted." 
</P>
<P>
The numbers suggest a disturbing increase in families that are homeless, Mather 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that Orange County's homeless do not tend to be a 
transient population, most saying that they have lived here for three or more 
years and 41% indicating they have lived here for 10 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
One of the survey questions asked respondents where they had spent the night 
before completing the questionnaire. The results revealed a "surprising and 
depressing" number of people who are in a cycle of moving from home to car, to 
motel, to the street, said John Dombrink, a UC Irvine professor of social 
ecology who helped prepare the survey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orange County's Homeless 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to determine the needs of area homeless, the Orange County 
Homeless Issues Task Force surveyed 1,974 of an estimated 6,000 to 10,000 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employment 
</P>
<P>
The task force noted that most surveys were completed during weekday business 
hours and may have excluded some homeless with jobs.

"It doesn't take the brightest porch light on the block to see that this 
community is developing an international character," Mayor Larry Agran said 
after a Wednesday conference at the city's civic center. 
</P>
<P>
Agran said one-fourth of the industrial development in Irvine has been sold to 
foreign nationals. He added that a recent survey showed that between 500 and 
600 businesses in the community have international ties or are interested in 
establishing such connections. 
</P>
<P>
Yogi Sharma, a yoga master and adviser to the mayor on international affairs, 
said he has already received inquiries from India about investment in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"More than half the people here are doing business with other countries," he 
said of the others attending the conference. "We should do something about it 
to help our local businesses." 
</P>
<P>
City leaders claim that Irvine is different from other communities interested 
in investment abroad. Since Irvine has no aging industrial or urban base that 
needs to be redeveloped, the city can focus on economic expansion and 
diversification. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line, real simply, is that international business is here to stay," 
said Larry Larsen, the city's officer for international affairs. "If Irvine is 
interested in having a growing economic environment, we ought to focus more 
attention on helping businesses position themselves in the global marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan developed by the city and King International Group, a consultant, 
the city would have a full-time coordinator of international affairs and a 
consortium would be established to contribute to the community's international 
economic development efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The program would be paid for by the businesses involved and should ultimately 
cost the public nothing, Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is set to come before the Irvine City Council in six to eight weeks. 
"In creating this kind of specific consortium with a clear mission, the 
opportunities are limitless," Agran said. DANICA KIRKA

DUPLEX OWNER GETS FIX-UP DEADLINE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A vacant downtown duplex that neighbors say is a haven for transients will be 
demolished within a month unless its owner starts to fix the place up. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council also told property owner Merle Cade that the refurbishing of 
the 1920s-era building at 211 Sixth St. must be finished by Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
"This has just reached a breaking point," said Michael Strange, a city senior 
planner. " . . . The neighbors are adamant about getting the building 
demolished." 
</P>
<P>
Cade said that when he bought the duplex 15 years ago, it was a habitable, if 
aging, residence. In recent years, however, the building deteriorated, and Cade 
eventually removed the door and much of the front facing to prepare it for 
rehabilitation. Police say transients often take refuge in the duplex, and 
fires have broken out there twice in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Cade said he was reluctant to continue the improvements because the property 
was the subject of a dispute between him and his ex-wife. Their divorce became 
final last week. Cade now says that the refurbishment will begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
But annoyed neighbors say they have little patience with Cade's explanations. 
The neighbors, many of whom own recently built homes near the aging duplex, 
claim that the building is a nuisance and should be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
Cade's son, Eric, who has taken over many of the management duties on his 
father's properties, acknowledges that the building is a neighborhood problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We do want to keep the building and restore it as a duplex," he said. "We see 
that the city of Huntington Beach, with its (nearby) redevelopment project, is 
making an effort to clean up the area, and we want to do that, too." JOHN 
PENNER

CLOSED ROAD TAKES TOLL ON BUSINESS 
</P>

<P>
The warm sun and clear, blue sky lulled Jim Nudo to a near-doze as he sat on a 
bench in front of his surf shop Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I might as well go to sleep," he said bitterly, staring at the deserted street 
in front of him. "Nobody will be coming here, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The closure of El Camino Real, now 3 weeks old, has been an inconvenience for 
drivers. But for merchants along the main streets that lead to El Camino Real, 
the closure is becoming an economic disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The coastal highway was shut down Feb. 5, when geologists found that the cliffs 
over El Camino Real were riddled with crevices and threatening to tumble. So 
far, city officials say their best guess is that the highway will be closed for 
up to two months, while work crews try to stabilize the bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
Not only has the closure isolated a handful of stores near the barricaded road, 
but the traffic jam it created down the road -- near the Avenida Pico 
interchange -- is driving customers from stores there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like South Coast Plaza at Christmastime," said Sid Beaty, store 
director of Ralphs Grocery Co. "It takes a considerable amount of time to get 
in and out of the parking lot. Our sales have definitely been hit in a negative 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Both Nudo and Beaty were among the merchants invited to City Hall on Wednesday 
to discuss problems caused by the closure, but nothing was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
To Nudo, a barricaded El Camino Real means that thousands of cars that used to 
pass by every day are now taking their business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in limbo here," said Nudo, owner of the Herbie Fletcher Surf Shop on 
North El Camino Real. "People are avoiding this end of town, and the business 
is really hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Nudo, who has owned the shop for 10 years, estimated that receipts have 
plummeted 80% since the closure. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected a lot of business to come in over the three-day weekend, but it 
didn't happen," he said. "I don't know what we'll do if this goes on for 
months." 
</P>
<P>
Walk-in business has slowed to a standstill for Margaret Cortens, who owns 
Capistrano Realty across the street from the surf shop. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been heavily impacted," she said Monday. "Our business deals with a lot 
of walk-ins. We haven't had any come in today." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the other end of Avenida Pico near the Interstate 5 interchange, 
vendors are complaining about too much traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The city was already in the middle of a $352,000 project to widen freeway ramps 
when they were forced to close El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
The construction and the extra traffic created by drivers trying to find 
alternative north-south routes have combined to create a traffic nightmare in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying to brave the traffic jams, merchants say, people are just 
staying away. 
</P>
<P>
"I think business has been a lot slower" since the closure, said Jill Gordon, 
assistant manager at Aaron Brothers Art Marts. "I know that our customers are 
coming in frustrated and so are the employees -- everybody's frustrated." FRANK 
MESSINA

PEOPLE: ART COLLECTOR BRINGS CULTURE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago an art historian's illness changed Gene L. Isaacson's life. 
</P>
<P>
"They handed me an assistant professorship and asked me to take his place on 
Chapman College's (World Campus Afloat) cruise," said the Rancho Santiago 
College instructor. 
</P>
<P>
The trip opened his eyes to new cultures and new people, and most of all, to 
their art. 
</P>
<P>
Today he has a major collection of contemporary and tribal art in wood, metal 
and fabric from Africa, the Pacific islands, Mexico and South America. 
</P>
<P>
"I got my heart into it on that first cruise," said Isaacson, whose 
imaginatively remodeled home in Huntington Beach is a gallery for the 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
A waterfall in his enclosed front yard is a dazzling greeting to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, for him, art collecting "grew from a mild interest, to a passion 
to an incurable disease." 
</P>
<P>
His collection, part of it in storage and in a second home, includes three 
original Picassos and 300 African art pieces that span 2,500 years. Among the 
primitive pieces are colorful African masks and the tools with which they're 
made. 
</P>
<P>
The collection is chronicled in the Smithsonian Institution's book, "African 
Art in Private American Collections." 
</P>
<P>
His collection, believed to be the largest of about a dozen in Orange County, 
was financed with what he said were good real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
He regularly shows his collection at home -- frequently to his art classes from 
the Santa Ana college campus -- and exhibits and discusses the works with 
grade-school students as well. 
</P>
<P>
He also allows organizations to have fund-raising parties in his home, which 
has artwork even in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Isaacson, who is single, said that his art "crowds my life at 
home," he added: "I wake up and get a daily high (from the artwork) with no 
aftereffects." 
</P>
<P>
Isaacson just returned from a three-day visit to Augsburg College in 
Minneapolis in advance of an exhibit there of his mask collection. 
</P>
<P>
"If people open their eyes to art and receive whatever the content of that art 
has to offer, they get a spiritual enrichment," said Isaacson, who also teaches 
art classes in the evening at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Those are heady words from the former North Dakota farm child who said that he 
had "zero exposure to art" while growing up and was ready for a life working 
the fields. 
</P>
<P>
But the academic world got his attention. He graduated with art and music 
degrees from Concordia College in Moorhead, Minn., and did graduate work in 
Rome and Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"Art isn't just an aesthetic experience. It's a historical thing," he said. 
"You read about the people who made the art so you can understand it all. At 
first it's like a foreign language. You don't understand it until you study 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone studying tribal and primitive art, he said, will quickly realize that 
"you don't get fine, primitive art from the countries that once made it." 
</P>
<P>
"The artwork just isn't being made any more, and what was made is in private 
collections and museums. Today, all you can buy in those countries are tourist 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
"Collectors like myself who want to zero in on fine quality art have to go to 
auction houses in Europe," he said. "There is very little in the United States, 
and what is here is financially prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
There's a definite trend at the Anaheim Central Library or any of its branches. 
</P>
<P>
During the past eight years, according to Kevin Moore, central library manager, 
15 full-time workers gave birth to boys. 
</P>
<P>
She said some employees suspect the water. Others call it the "Library Curse." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that she advises her female employees to drink bottled water if they 
want a girl. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Jane Lindsey, 68, who played the violin for her talent 
segment, was named Ms. Senior America of California over a field of 20 other 
contestants who competed in the pageant recently at the Grand Hotel in Anaheim. 
The Santa Ana resident will now compete in April in Atlantic City for the 
national title.

PIERSIDE VILLAGE PASSES CITY COUNCIL TEST, NOW FACES TOUGHER EXAM BY STATE, 
COURT

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial plan to build more commercial development on the city's main 
beach has won a victory, but now goes to court. 
</P>
<P>
The Pierside Village project -- a lightning rod for protest by environmental 
groups in the past six months -- won, in concept, a 5-2 endorsement by the City 
Council late Tuesday night. The council voted in support of a scaled-down 
version of the "restaurant row" proposal after a long, emotional public 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
But Pierside Village is not in the clear yet. 
</P>
<P>
The project cannot proceed beyond the talking stage unless the State Lands 
Commission drops its opposition to having more commercial buildings on public 
beach right-of-way. The state panel, despite pleas and heavy lobbying by the 
city, has so far steadfastly refused to accept the project. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, city and state lawyers are scheduled to meet in Orange County 
Superior Court on Friday morning in a crucial legal encounter involving 
Pierside Village. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Robert Sangster said the city hopes to get the state's 
opposition dismissed without going to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically we're arguing that the state doesn't have any (legal) interest in 
the property," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert G. Collins, a deputy state attorney general, said he will argue that 
the state has a vital interest in the case. The State Lands Commission has 
rights as an adjoining property owner, and the attorney general's office has 
the legal interest of enforcing public easements, said Collins. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the case is a narrow, two-acre strip of paved-over beach extending 
from the intersection of Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway to the 
intersection of 1st (formerly Lake) Street and Pacific Coast Highway. The land 
is immediately south of the city's famous pier. The strip is the site for 
Maxwell's Restaurant and a ribbon of paved parking strips extending south to 
the city's lifeguard headquarters. None of the land is raw sand or pristine 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have charged that any new commercial buildings on the beach 
would reduce public access and would be "visual pollution." 
</P>
<P>
In rebuttal, city officials have argued that Pierside Village would be an open, 
attractive area that would enhance public access to the beach. The buildings 
would not detract from the ocean view, the city officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
As originally proposed in 1984, Pierside Village would have involved 87,500 
square feet of restaurants and other commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
But over the years, the project has been scaled down. As presented to the City 
Council on Tuesday night, the proposal called for 25,000 square feet of new 
restaurant development, plus 15,000 square feet for a relocation of Maxwell's. 
</P>
<P>
"This plan is definitely an improvement, but the basic problem is that it is 
inherently flawed because it puts commercial development on the beach side of 
Pacific Coast Highway," said Councilwoman Grace Winchell. "This beach is our 
crown. . . . Let's not destroy the crown." 
</P>
<P>
Winchell and Councilman Peter M. Green cast the opposing votes against Pierside 
Village on Tuesday. Green said the council's vote was premature since the legal 
action by the state is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
The other five members of the council said they believe that Pierside Village 
deserves support now. "This is a great plan," said Councilman Wes Bannister. 
Councilman John Erskine said he thought much of the opposition to the 
restaurant proposal had been based on "pure and unadulterated propaganda." 
</P>
<P>
The vote Tuesday night does not legally commit the city to back Pierside 
Village, according to the city attorney's office. The council's action was akin 
to a straw vote on a concept rather than a specific plan. But the vote was 
pivotal in that it clearly showed a majority of the council wants to pursue the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The legal obstacles ahead, however, including the court action scheduled 
Friday, will determine whether the council can move ahead with Pierside 
Village. Curtis Fossum, senior counsel for the State Lands Commission, said on 
Wednesday that the state agency remains opposed to Pierside Village, regardless 
of its size. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we still must defend the public's right-of-way," Fossum 
said.

SCHOOLS: CLASSROOM DANGER IS ON THE RISE, EXPERTS TELL GATHERING, AND SUBURBIA

A gun-wielding madman takes over a classroom. The teacher feels his pulse race 
and his temples pound. And then, even as the drama is unfolding, he starts to 
daydream and feels an overwhelming desire to sleep. Some of his students put 
their heads on their desks and nod off. 
</P>
<P>
Bizarre as this scenario sounds, teacher and students in this hypothetical 
scenario are demonstrating a normal human response to danger, a primal desire 
to escape through sleep, a panel of experts told school administrators from 
nine Southern California school districts Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The "Safe, Secure and Peaceful Schools Conference," sponsored by the Los 
Angeles County Office of Public Education and held at the Hyatt Regency 
Alicante here, presented a view of public education in America today that 
seemed anything but safe or peaceful. Topics ranged from dealing with students 
who bring automatic weapons to class to handling bomb threats. 
</P>
<P>
Violence is on the rise in the nation's schools, and no school system, no 
matter how suburban or middle class, is immune, experts on hostage-related 
stress warned. 
</P>
<P>
"There is every reason to expect that the recent trends of school violence will 
continue to worsen . . . ," said a paper presented by a team of legal and 
psychiatric experts formed by the Simi Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are an educator in an inner-city secondary school, it is likely that 
you will need no encouragement to prepare for the threat of armed assaults and 
hostage-taking on your campus," the paper continued. "However, the problem is 
not confined to these high-risk schools." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Police Lt. Robert Klamser, an international consultant on hostage 
negotiating and a co-author of the paper, told the conference that 150,000 
crimes are committed each year in the nation's schools. In 1988, 18 classrooms 
around the country were held hostage, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
But Klamser said 95% of all hostage situations are resolved with no loss of 
life. In most cases, it is simply a matter of calming the captor down and then 
waiting for him to reach a point of exhaustion, which usually comes 13 to 14 
hours after the siege begins. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer the bad guy and good guy are together, the less likely the bad guy 
is going to kill the good guy . . . ," Klamser said. "If the hostage-taker 
wanted to commit a massacre, he would have already done it." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Bonaccorso, a Simi Valley psychiatrist and a consultant on hostage 
negotiations, advised educators to be cooperative and try to reassure a captor, 
even if they are ordered to leave their students alone with the hostage-taker. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Anaheim handled the crisis admirably last October when 
15-year-old Cory Robb took a Loara High School drama class hostage with a 
short-barreled shotgun and a .22-caliber pistol, both Bonaccorso and Klamser 
agreed. One student was injured, but no one was killed, and Robb gave himself 
up after about 40 minutes. Bonaccorso and Klamser noted that drama teacher 
Kenneth Tuttle acted wisely when he left the room after Robb ordered him to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
"The review of these incidents shows clearly that kids are in no more danger if 
you comply with the hostage-taker," Klamser said. "If the teacher 'John Waynes' 
it, what you're doing is creating a much more dangerous situation." 
</P>
<P>
During a hostage-taking, the so-called Stockholm syndrome, in which hostages 
identify with their captors, is common, arising from a healthy survivor 
instinct, Bonaccorso said. Hostages often experience guilt over such feelings 
after their release but should not, Bonaccorso said. He added that police 
welcome such developments because they tend to defuse the situation and buy the 
negotiators more time. 
</P>
<P>
"Time is on your side," Bonaccorso told his audience. "Exhaustion is what 
police officers are waiting for. . . . Suddenly, we're negotiating for a 
McDonald's hamburger and a cup of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
Klamser said police who are criticized in hostage situations for failing to act 
quickly enough may have simply been buying time. He noted that 85% of the 
captives killed during a hostage situation are slain when police attempt a 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we get to talking about food, it can go on and on," he said. " 'Do you 
want McDonald's or Jack-in-the-Box? Do you want it with catsup or without?' . . 
. We want to keep him making decisions because that wears him out." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the task of defusing potential violence in Southern California 
schools are the maze of language and cultural barriers, several experts noted. 
Jeffrey J. Munks, a former San Jose police officer and now manager of an 
emergency translation service provided by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 
Co., said public school teachers in the state now deal with 60 different 
languages and cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Munks advised teachers to brief themselves on a student's culture before trying 
to talk to his family about academic or behavior problems so as to avoid 
unintended faux pas. For example, Munks said, a teacher talking to Vietnamese 
parents might unknowingly insult them by pointing, which is reserved for 
children and pets in Vietnamese culture and is considered highly offensive 
among adults. 
</P>
<P>
Lillie Wilson, an administrator with the Los Angeles County Department of 
Education who helped organize Wednesday's conference, said that educators are 
"beyond awareness" of the potential dangers they must deal with and are now 
looking for responses "that work." 
</P>
<P>
Experts conceded, however, that some violence in the schools is beyond their 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't much anybody at the Cleveland School could do once Patrick Purdy 
parked his car," Klamser said, referring to Purdy's random shooting spree on an 
elementary school playground last year in Stockton that left five students dead 
and 29 injured. 
</P>
<P>
In their paper presented Wednesday, Klamser and his colleagues noted: "Today's 
schools no longer represent the sort of safe and secure haven they did as 
recently as a generation or two ago."

ANGELS WATCH WHILE CLARK WORKS ON PITCH

The hitter dug in, the crowd cheered merrily and the umpire leaned intently 
over the plate. Poised for action, everyone awaited the magic phrase that would 
set the game in motion. Another few seconds for the anticipation to build, and 
here it was. It came as a shout. 
</P>
<P>
"Action!" 
</P>
<P>
So much for "Play ball!" 
</P>
<P>
The umpire was an actor and the fans at the UC Irvine baseball field were 
Hollywood extras, all players in a television commercial starring San Francisco 
Giant first baseman Will Clark. To the eight Angels who had gone there 
Wednesday to run and stretch and throw, the film crew's visit was a welcome 
diversion from a routine that had become tiresome by the time the lockout 
reached its seventh day. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Chuck Finley, his workout done, sat with his back against the fence and 
regarded Clark with a bemused expression. "Well," he said, "I'm glad somebody's 
working." 
</P>
<P>
Left to their own devices and consciences, the Angels worked hard enough to 
break a sweat during their 90-minute session at the place that has become their 
home away from home since the lockout put Anaheim Stadium off limits. 
</P>
<P>
Finley and Jim Abbott paired off to loosen up with easy tosses that grew 
progressively harder, breaking up the monotony with chatter about a pickup 
basketball game Finley had played. Bert Blyleven, wearing a T-shirt imprinted 
with the slogan "Play Ball," did exactly that with reliever Willie Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
"Throw it where I can reach it," Blyleven scolded after Fraser hurled a pitch 
high over Blyleven's head. Fraser wasn't the least bit remorseful. "Hey, the 
fence will stop it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Witt and Bryan Harvey wandered past the commercial set at home plate and 
headed for the left-field bullpen, where Witt got in some throws off the mound. 
Kirk McCaskill did some serious throwing in another enclosure on the first-base 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Only shortstop Dick Schofield, the lone nonpitcher at the workout, left before 
his teammates had finished their regimens by running in the outfield. Schofield 
says he has felt the effects of the lockout less than the pitchers because 
although pitchers and catchers would normally have reported to spring training 
a week ago, the earliest all other players were permitted to report was today. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing to do here," Schofield said. "It hasn't gotten to me yet 
because (Thursday) I'd just be leaving for spring training. The pitchers are 
the ones it's bothering. But if it goes into March, it's going to hurt 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The workout was satisfying for Witt even if "there probably wasn't as much 
intensity" as in a usual spring practice. "It's getting kind of boring," he 
said. "You enjoy your time off, but there comes a time when you should be out 
there using your skills." 
</P>
<P>
Those skills might rust if the lockout drags on. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser said he would continue to work out even if the negotiations recess, as 
players union head Don Fehr said would be the case if an agreement weren't 
reached today. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott also will go on working out. "I have nothing else to do. I didn't plan 
on being here, so I didn't make any other kinds of plans, and I'm getting 
bored," he said. "You end up feeling like you've just wasted days at a time, 
not doing too much." 
</P>
<P>
Finley shares that sense of futility. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been losing a lot of golf balls," he joked. "I don't even know what I've 
been doing. . . . I've just got to stay in the same pattern, but it's hard to 
get motivated to come out here and go through these workouts. I've got to force 
myself to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll keep prying myself out of bed and coming here until somebody tells me 
something else. But if it doesn't get settled this week, I'm going back to 
Louisiana and going fishing."

ANGELS' MINTON ACCEPTS $850,000 DEAL

<P>
Greg Minton, who had filed for free agency after the Angels declined to go to 
arbitration with him, agreed to a one-year contract with the club Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Minton's contract includes a base salary of $850,000, with incentive clauses 
worth as much as $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Minton, 38, was 4-3 with eight saves and a 2.20 earned-run average in 62 relief 
appearances last season. He had filed for arbitration at $1,150,000 and the 
Angels had offered $780,000. He earned $630,000 in salary last season and 
$100,000 in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
The right-handed pitcher joined the Angels as a free agent in June, 1987. He 
set a club record last season by pitching 105 2/3 innings without allowing a 
home run, a streak he started in 1988. HELENE ELLIOTT

COSTA MESA FRESHMAN GETS 24 POINTS, 23 REBOUNDS

<P>
Freshman Olivia Dicamilli scored 24 points and had 23 rebounds Wednesday night, 
leading the Costa Mesa High School girls' basketball team to a 56-44 victory 
over Sherman Oaks Notre Dame and into the Southern Section 3-A semifinals for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa (15-11) continued its most successful season in the school's history 
with Dicamilli dominating play inside and consistently hitting soft jump shots 
outside. Dicamilli made 12 of 24 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Her rebounding total was one short of the 24 she had last Saturday in a 47-45 
victory over third-seeded Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been playing really well the last week," said Jim Weeks, Costa Mesa's 
coach. "I think we've peaked at the right time. The players and the student 
body are really into this. This school had never won a quarterfinal game." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (11-11) had problems defending Costa Mesa's outside shooting as 
Dicamilli, Rachel Ward and Thuy Nguyen took advantage of a soft zone. Notre 
Dame made one offensive run, trimming a 34-20 deficit to 38-32 late in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Dicamilli and Nguyen finished the quarter by making jump shots that pushed 
Costa Mesa ahead, 42-32, and the Mustangs were never threatened again. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Notre Dame was played against the man pressure that we gave them 
tonight," Weeks said. "I've got three girls who shoot really well, so I don't 
think a zone is going to stop us. We started slow, but it was just a matter of 
time before we started hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Ward, Costa Mesa's best outside shooter, missed her first six shots and was 
scoreless in the first quarter. She finished with 12 points. Nguyen made three 
three-point shots and finished with 15 points. Then, there was the play of 
Dicamilli. "She's a miniature Joni Easterly," Weeks said. "She's a strong 
rebounder with great instincts inside. She's got some future, doesn't she?"

ESTANCIA'S EARLE SCORES 42 IN VICTORY AT LOMPOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guard Melody Earle scored 42 points to lead Estancia to a 71-60 victory 
Wednesday over Lompoc in a 3-AA playoff game at Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
The victory over the division's third-seeded team gave Estancia a 14-12 mark 
for the season. Lompoc finished at 21-4. 
</P>
<P>
Earle had 27 of her points in the first half, including a twisting 3-point 
basket at the buzzer to give Estancia a 34-31 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were tied at 48 after three periods, but the Eagles outscored Lompoc 
23-12 in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Center Nicki Manzo scored 30 points for Lompoc, but Lompoc had trouble getting 
the ball to its inside players in the final period, according to Lompoc Coach 
Sherman Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't get the ball to our big people. That was our plan, to get our 
big people involved in the fourth period," Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita 63, Beaumont 48 -- Guard Kristen Mulligan scored 32 points, 19 
of them in the second half, to lead visiting Santa Margarita. Forward Sarah 
Witte had 22 for Santa Margarita (20-6), which will face Santa Ynez, a 64-33 
winner over St. Anthony's. Beaumont finished at 17-7. Santa Margarita led just 
27-24 at halftime, but used a tenacious defense to pull away in the final two 
periods. The Eagles outscored Beaumont 17-12 in the third period and 19-10 in 
fourth. Diane Terrill had 12 points for Beaumont. 
</P>
<P>
In the Small Schools: 
</P>
<P>
Ribet Academy 74, Cal Lutheran 58 -- Kate Stoll scored 29 points to lead the 
Fighting Frogs. Cal Lutheran finished 14-1. Becky Clark scored 14 points and 
Kim Floyd scored 13 for Ribet Academy (16-5). Cal Lutheran had an 18-10 
advantage after the first quarter, but Ribet Academy outscored Cal Lutheran

FOOTHILL TO TAKE SHOT AT NO. 1 BREA-OLINDA

<P>
One thing kept the Foothill High School girls' basketball team from losing to 
nationally ranked Brea-Olinda Wednesday night in the Southern Section 3-AA 
girls' basketball playoffs -- the game was postponed for a day. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill (15-9) will have its chance to pull what would be the biggest upset in 
Orange County girls' basketball this season when it plays Brea-Olinda (27-0) in 
a 3-AA quarterfinal game tonight at Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda is the top girls' team in California and is ranked fifth nationally 
by USA Today. Brea-Olinda lost a coin flip for the home court. 
</P>
<P>
The teams did not play Wednesday night because Foothill did not play its 
second-round game against Rim of the World until Tuesday night. The game, 
scheduled for last Saturday, was postponed twice because snow in the Cajon pass 
prevented Rim of the World from traveling to Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section moved the Brea-Foothill game from Wednesday to today to 
give the teams a day to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda Coach Mark Trakh calls this year's team -- the defending 3-A and 
state champions -- the best in the school's history. They have a 49-game 
winning streak and are heavily favored over the Knights, ranked eighth in the 
final Southern Section 3-AA poll. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill defeated Rim of the World, 64-47, after a first-round bye. The Knights 
got 17 points from 6-2 senior center Heli Syrjanen, 14 points from 5-8 senior 
forward Shannon Ebert and 10 point from 5-9 senior forward Shelly Gagen. 
Forward Stacy Hipsak is the Knights' only player who started last season. 
</P>
<P>
After a first-round bye, Brea-Olinda defeated El Dorado, 57-34 
Saturday.Top-seeded Brea has four players who were starters on last season's 
state champion team. Leading the way are senior all-state guards Aimee McDaniel 
and Tammy Blackburn, followed by second-team all-state post players Jody Anton 
and Jinelle Williams. The other starter is Allison Bickell. DONNA CARTER

Any doubt that third-seeded Cypress High School could handle Santiago left the 
mind of Cypress Coach Fred Leininger one minute 20 seconds into the Centurions' 
second-round 2-A boys' soccer match Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Mike Rapski headed in a corner kick from Cory Senko to give Cypress 
a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Senko's pass sailed over the Santiago defenders and met Rapski in front of the 
far goal post. Rapski didn't have to move his feet to head the ball in. 
</P>
<P>
The play was executed so perfectly that Leininger said he had a feeling Cypress 
would have an easy time advancing to the quarterfinals. As it was, the 
Centurions thoroughly dominated Santiago and won, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we ran seemed to work," Leininger said. "When we got that first 
goal, I kind of figured the game was over." 
</P>
<P>
Senko's assist gave him 20 for the season and broke the school single-season 
record of 19 set by Chad Benson last year. Senko added to his record late in 
the second half when he assisted Cypress' fifth goal, a header by Ray Klug. He 
also scored a goal on a penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
In between, the bigger, faster Centurions (18-2-5) showed why they are ranked 
among the top three soccer teams in the 2-A division. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago (17-4-4) finally broke through on a penalty kick by Eric Paniagua. 
</P>
<P>
In another 2-A match: 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 3, Brea-Olinda 1 -- Chris Cannenberg, Brian Beaman and Doug Barnes 
scored for the Hawks (21-5-0). Jaysn Ochs scored for Brea-Olinda (14-8-2). 
</P>
<P>
In the 1-A: 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran 2, Aquinas 0 -- Host Orange Lutheran (15-2-2) was led by Greg 
Pargee, who scored 15 minutes into the match, and Todd Dudley, who scored with 
time running out.

Kim Campbell scored the only goal in Canyon High School's 1-0 overtime victory 
overWoodbridge in the second round of the Southern Section 3-A girls' soccer 
playoffs Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the second 10-minute overtime period began, Canyon had taken 15 
shots on goal, and Woodbridge three. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with only a few minutes left, Warrior goalie Michelle Helring slid out in 
front of the ball, which bounced off of her and away. Fullback Deanna Doolittle 
ran in to cover and struck the ball with an arm. 
</P>
<P>
The sideline referee called a hand ball, and Campbell was awarded a penalty 
kick. The freshman forward shot a perfect arc over Helring for the game's only 
goal, and her 34th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (15-0-4) almost scored again a minute later, but forward Mary Wilson's 
shot hit the top of the goal, and Kim Studley's shot off the rebound went way 
over. 
</P>
<P>
After the match, Woodbridge Coach William Bell was distraught about the call 
that led to the winning goal, saying the call was too close to allow it to 
decide a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had seen the touch, Bell said, "I saw touches and pushes the whole 
game. Look, that's my opinion, and you know what everyone says about opinions. 
They're an outstanding team. Our job was to shut them out until overtime, and 
take it to a shoot out." 
</P>
<P>
In other 3-A matches: 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei 4, Long Beach Poly 0 -- Mater Dei (22-2) held Long Beach Poly to five 
shots and goalie Julie Tarney got her 19th shutout of the season. Katie Ward, 
Robyn Camarillo, Kim Conter and Amber Escobedo scored for Mater Dei, which led, 
2-0, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Troy 3, Buena 1 -- Jenny Scanlon scored all three goals to lead visiting Troy 
(15-3-3). It was the seventh time this season that Scanlon has scored three or 
more goals in a game.

Shawna Armstrong scored a career-high 31 points to lead Golden West College to 
a 115-61 rout of Antelope Valley in the first round of the Southern California 
women's community college basketball playoffs Wednesday at Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong scored 23 points in the second half, including 18 on lay-ins as the 
Antelope Valley defense failed to get back. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, a sophomore, scored nine consecutive points to help Golden West 
expand a 57-33 halftime lead into a comfortable 68-35 margin with 15:39 left. 
Donna Gondringer, who scored 21 points, had the other basket in the run. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth consecutive game in which Golden West has scored more than 100 
or more points, tying a school record set last season. The Rustlers, the 
top-ranked team in the state with a 33-1 record, are averaging 94.1 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West plays host to El Camino Saturday at 5 p.m. in the second round of 
the playoffs. El Camino defeated Moorpark, 77-59, in another first-round game. 
The winner of Saturday's game advance to the state tournament March 1-3 at 
College of the Sequoias. 
</P>
<P>
"That was typical of the games we've played all year," Golden West assistant 
Coach Dave Stricklin said. "We get a big lead in the first half then just 
outrun the team in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Gondringer added 21, Stacee Johnson 20, Claudette Jackson 16 and Bits Sirchia 
had 10 as the Golden West starters all scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't all good news for Golden West. Jackson took a hard fall early in 
the second half and have to leave the game with a bruised wrist. She is 
expected to be ready for Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
The news isn't as good about back-up point guard Cossette Smith, who sprained 
her ankle and is doubtful for Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Molly Jonnum scored 16 and Susan Hervey added 15 for Antelope Valley, which 
finishes 17-11. 
</P>
<P>
In other playoff games: 
</P>
<P>
College of the Canyons 71, Fullerton 66 -- Tressie Millender scored 32 points, 
22 in the second half, to lead Canyons over visiting Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons struggled in building a 33-31 first-half lead, and Fullerton took the 
lead, 40-39, in the second half before Millender took control. Millender, a 
5-foot-10 sophomore forward, scored seven consecutive points on a rebound 
basket, a three-point shot and a layup. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (16-14) refused to quit, though, and was within four points, 60-56, 
with less than 10 minutes remaining. However, Millender wasn't finished either. 
</P>
<P>
She scored seven points in a 9-0 Canyons run that put the game out of reach, 
69-56. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (24-7) had defeated Fullerton by 30 points earlier in the season, but 
the Hornets had played the first game without point guard Candi Burnett and 
forward Kris Kelley, who missed that game due to disciplinary action. Burnett 
scored 23 points in the rematch, and Kelley scored 10. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura 62, Orange Coast 54 -- Orange Coast's most successful season (26-6) 
come to an end in the first round of the playoffs at home. Sophomore Chris 
Roayls scored a game-high 21 on 10-of-15 shooting from the floor and added 12 
rebounds for Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
She broke a 54-54 tie with a lay-up with 3:31 left. OCC led, 49-46, with 8:18 
but Ventura's Suzanne Hoag scored three consecutive baskets to put the Pirates 
ahead, 52-49, two minutes later. Erika Manning had 13 points, Kami Bigler 12, 
and Michelle Hennessey 10 for OCC.

O.C. POP BEAT: ROBERT LUCAS: A BACK-TO-THE-BASICS BLUESMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditional blues is difficult to play convincingly, and it certainly isn't one 
of the more financially rewarding branches of music. It's not surprising, then, 
that most of the musicians who play the deep blues say they didn't take it up 
as a matter of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, some compulsion in the music pulled them in, ears first. Maybe it was 
the resonance of a quavering slide guitar, or the mystery in a drawled, 
incantatory vocal cry. In any case, something inside answers to the depths of 
history and culture and the wells of elemental emotion embedded in the blues, 
and it sets the listener on a lifetime course. Robert Lucas says that is how it 
happened with him. 
</P>
<P>
At 27, a relative youngster on a local blues scene populated mostly by veterans 
in their 30s and 40s, Lucas has just released his first album, "Across the 
River." For his debut, the Huntington Beach resident recorded the most basic, 
traditional kind of blues there is -- solo, acoustic performances steeped in 
the Delta style that came out of backwoods Mississippi in the 1920s and 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who also fronts an electric blues band, Luke &amp; the Locomotives, will 
play a solo show tonight at Cagney's in Huntington Beach, where he is the host 
of a regular "Open Mic Night" every Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas is a big man with exceptionally thick fingers and a hulking build. 
Sitting at a front table in Cagney's long, rectangular barroom, he talked about 
the blues in a low, gravelly speaking voice that was a harbinger of the deep, 
full moan that comes out when he sings. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky. . . . I got turned on to a Robert Johnson record when I was very 
young," he said. "Actually, (traditional blues) is all I ever wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who grew up in Long Beach, was in his mid-teens, listening to 
blues-based rockers like Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix when he came across his 
first acoustic blues song, "Turtle Blues," on the Janis Joplin/Big Brother 
&amp; the Holding Company "Cheap Thrills" album. The song struck him deeply 
enough to trigger a special trip to his local record shop. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas told the shopkeeper that he wanted to find out more about the sound 
behind the Joplin song. "I asked the guy, 'What is this, and why does it sound 
like that? And where can I get more records like this?' " The clerk recommended 
albums by fundamental bluesmen Leroy Carr and Robert Johnson. It was Johnson's 
"King of the Delta Blues Singers," probably the greatest album in any pop 
category, that grabbed Lucas by the ear. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know anything about blues. I put the record on with a totally blank 
mind, thinking, 'What is this?' The way (Johnson) phrased his words, I never 
heard music with so much feeling. I'd never felt music before, until I heard 
that stuff. There's a certain eeriness. I could actually see myself being 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas rejected all the other pop music of the day (which wasn't that big a 
sacrifice in 1976) and dove into collecting old blues records. "I was pretty 
snobby when I was in high school," he said. "I used to rant and rave about it." 
He took up the guitar for a while, then set it aside and switched to harmonica, 
which remains his primary instrument. At 19, his search for a guitar teacher 
who could show him Robert Johnson-style acoustic slide guitar techniques led 
him to Bernie Pearl, the Long Beach blues band leader and KLON disc jockey. 
Lucas got his lessons, plus a two-year hitch as a harmonica-playing sideman in 
Pearl's band. 
</P>
<P>
Wanting to step out as a front man, Lucas joined the Confessors, a R&amp;B band 
whose repertoire included songs by such master soul singers as James Brown, 
Jackie Wilson and Wilson Pickett. "At the time I didn't like (R&amp;B)," Lucas 
said. "I just wanted to play blues, but it helped me get my vocal chops 
together because that stuff is hard to sing." 
</P>
<P>
Early in 1986, he formed Luke &amp; the Locomotives. After three years of busy 
gigging, the band mustered financing to make its first record. But last summer, 
just as it was on the verge of recording, Lucas decided that the music was all 
wrong, fired the entire band and started over from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
"The band progressively had turned into a kind of Southern rock band," said 
Lucas, whose vision for Luke &amp; the Locomotives had been a more traditional, 
Texas- and Chicago-blues sound. "No matter what I tried, it always ended up 
sounding like the Allman Brothers, and I didn't want to do that." Firing the 
band "was one of the hardest things I ever did. One of the guitar players 
(Robert Lieberman) had been my friend for 10 years, and we're not really 
friends now, as you can imagine. But the music is more important to me than all 
that buddy-buddy stuff." 
</P>
<P>
During the next two months, Lucas put together a new band of Locomotives -- 
guitarists Paul Bryant and Rick Gould, bassist Al (Bedrock) Bedrosian and 
drummer Bob Ebersol, who goes by the stage name Max Bangwell. All of them are 
at least 10 years older than Lucas. "When I got the new guys," Lucas said, "I 
got people playing just what I wanted them to, without me having to say 
anything to them. It's been the easiest, most stress-free six months of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
The changeover period, and a scaled-down performing schedule since then, gave 
Lucas more time to concentrate on solo acoustic performances -- which led to 
"Across The River," a self-financed cassette album that he recorded on a $1,500 
budget in one day, without overdubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like Robert Johnson in the hotel room in San Antonio," Lucas said, 
referring to the ad-hoc circumstances behind the only surviving recording 
sessions of Johnson's career. Lucas' album includes remakes of two of Johnson's 
classics, "Terraplane Blues" and "Crossroads," as well as songs by John Lee 
Hooker, Muddy Waters and Fred McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just me redoing it to see how much I can sound like (Howlin') Wolf or 
Robert Johnson," Lucas said. "This is my interpretation. It's sounding like 
myself and keeping the idiom alive with things that are fresh." The album's 
title track, one of three Lucas originals, is something fresh, a fine blues 
that, in the best tradition of the style, is drawn from real-life observation. 
</P>
<P>
"A girl I knew in high school became addicted to cocaine, and she became a 
prostitute," Lucas said, explaining the song's background. "I'd see her working 
the streets in Compton. Seeing a girl you knew in high school out on Long Beach 
Boulevard flagging down cars to make 20 bucks, it's kind of a sad situation." 
Lucas invested the song with added emotional resonance by writing it from the 
tortured perspective of a man in love with the streetwalker. Like everything 
else on "Across the River," the title song comes across in a voice that sounds 
timeless and ancient -- a throwback to Lucas' original inspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas sees the album as a modest first step on a long road toward his goal of 
recording for a high-profile blues specialty label and establishing his band as 
a touring act (Luke &amp; the Locomotives are planning to record early in 
March). "It's part of the dues-paying process," Lucas said. "You've gotta put 
out a couple albums yourself to show 'em you're serious. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like a major label to come in and say, 'You're going to be the next 
Robert Cray,' but I don't want to have any futile illusions. The whole key to 
doing this for a long time is keeping your attitude right. If you say, 'I'm 
going to be the next John Mayall,' you're setting yourself up for a fall." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with some bill-paying help from his girlfriend, Lucas has been 
earning a living playing the blues since early 1987, when he quit his job as a 
municipal maintenance man for the city of Long Beach. That, he figures, is a 
pretty significant accomplishment in itself. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lucas plays solo tonight (and every Thursday) at 9:30 as host of Open 
Mic Night at Cagney's, 406 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Huntington Beach. 
Information: (714) 960-9318. Lucas also plays solo Tuesday nights from 8 to 11 
at Taka-O, 425 N. El Camino Real, San Clemente. Information: (714) 498-7111. 
Luke &amp; the Locomotives play this Saturday night at Taka-O, and every Sunday 
at Cagney's from 4:30 to 8:30 p.m.

LIFE STYLE: A POETRY READING EXPERIMENT IS CATCHING ON. "PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF 
NOT THINKING," SAYS ONE PARTICIPANT. "PEOPLE REALLY WANT THIS."

<P>
It was a night of poetry versus the Big Chill on Monday, but despite 
temperatures that dipped into the 40s, this ancient art form showed it still 
carried heat for the human heart. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 kindred spirits turned out for the third outing in a monthly series 
for which the courtyard of Diedrich's Coffee &amp; Espresso Bar is transformed 
into the ambitiously named Cafe of Dreams. 
</P>
<P>
But according to audience members, poets and promoters, battling the literal 
cold is only half the problem facing the angel-headed hipsters of Orange 
County. Yet such hurdles as lack of community, growing pressures to conform, 
subtle forms of censorship, a steamroller mass culture and a lack of social 
alternatives for the smart and the cool may have helped to spark a resurgence 
in the local poetry scene. 
</P>
<P>
"People are tired of not thinking," said Lee Clark, a Long Beach musician and 
poet. "People really want this. There's people here that I haven't seen in 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Mallory, a poet and professor for the Rancho Santiago Community College in 
Santa Ana, explained why he attended: "People are spiritually empty. Poets are 
the cutting edge of consciousness. The poet is a subversive, but always for the 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Because the organizers are hoping to foster a greater sense of literary 
preparedness, it is no small poetic coincidence that their logo for the Cafe of 
Dreams closely resembles that of the Civil Defense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's stuff you've never heard before," audience member Jessica Iverson said. 
"You're going to hear it for the first time and probably the last time. You'll 
probably forget most of it, but some of it you will remember." 
</P>
<P>
Much was made Monday of the prospect of a freewheeling, uncensored poetry scene 
developing in a conservative bedroom community such as Orange County. Poet Joe 
Williams drew laughter and applause in proclaiming: "This is Orange County and 
the multitudes have come to a poetry reading. Orange County isn't what it used 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
The poetry was as varied as the audience, which was made up of young and old, 
the colorful and the staid. In the course of the 2 1/2-hour evening, topics 
included lost love, alienation, social ills, humor, male foibles, parents and, 
naturally, freeway driving. 
</P>
<P>
"This is essential in Orange County," said Mark Carranza, of the Institute for 
the Prevention of Design, one of the event's sponsors. A computer consultant by 
day, Carranza has organized poetry readings at laundromats, industrial 
complexes, the beach and other less likely places. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is the land of the living dead," said Carranza. "There is 
nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
Kathi Georges, a graphic designer and another of the series organizers, said 
she believes that the poetry readings fill a necessary niche in Orange County's 
evolving culture. "I think it's very important. There's a new tendency to 
conformity. You need to have that other outlet." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the dark, smoky coffeehouses of beat-generation legend, there 
was an exuberance and lack of pretension at the Cafe of Dreams. Tables and 
chairs sat half the audience, while others made do on makeshift benches of wood 
planks across milk crates. Some listened from the second-floor balcony. 
</P>
<P>
Flamenco guitarists John Schuster and Jon Bryant began the evening and were 
followed by featured poets Mitch Teemley and Joe Williams. The evening ended 
after several members of the audience volunteered to share their recent work, 
some of it written that evening. 
</P>
<P>
"People can come here and find community sustenance," said Martin Diedrich, 
host of the event, held the third Monday of each month at 8 p.m. "This is very 
much a community event." 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the bright, upscale Costa Mesa shop as well as a second location 
in Tustin, Diedrich represents the third generation in his family to enter the 
coffee business. He grew up on his family's coffee plantation in Guatemala and 
missed the sense of community he knew there. 
</P>
<P>
"In coming to Orange County, for years I really felt lost," he said. "I feel 
I'm successful if people can come here and have a good time." He said his goal 
is to capture the atmosphere of the traditional European coffeehouse, "not the 
fancy, artsy stuff you see in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Georges said she believes that the crowds are larger for Orange County poetry 
readings than those in Los Angeles, perhaps because there are fewer venues for 
poetry here, thus concentrating the audiences. 
</P>
<P>
For those who read new cultural events like tea leaves, the success of local 
poetry readings may bode significant cultural changes ahead. "It's nice to go 
someplace other than a (rock) concert," Lee Clark said. "People can come 
together here, where you can't hear each other talk at a concert. People are 
getting tired of rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe of Dreams will be held next on March 19 at Diedrich's Coffee &amp; 
Espresso Bar, 474 E. 17th St., Costa Mesa. Admission: free. Information: (714) 
646-0323.

They've been touring and recording for nearly a quarter of a century. Their 
songs have been covered by a wealth of other artists, including Hank Williams 
Jr., Bonnie Raitt, Dave Edmunds, the Box Tops and the Carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Records once hyped them as the "new Beatles," and their peer-group 
admirers include Keith Richards and R.E.M., with whom they spent two months on 
the road last year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the members of NRBQ have never even come close to having a hit record, and 
their live appearances as headliners are still confined to nightclubs, 
including tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
With the recent release of the album "Wild Weekend," however, Terry Adams -- 
the group's co-founder, lead singer and keyboard player -- believes that NRBQ's 
long-awaited commercial breakthrough is finally at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think our time has come," he said. "It's our first studio album in five 
years, we've got a major label (Virgin Records) behind us, and I have a feeling 
people are going to pick up on it." 
</P>
<P>
If NRBQ does make it big, it won't be because of any shift in musical 
direction. It's still playing the same eclectic mix of rock 'n' roll, country, 
jazz and rhythm and blues it has always played. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sound hasn't changed; it's just gotten better," Adams said. "We're not 
going to change to suit somebody else's idea of what's in; we believe in 
playing (for) ourselves and waiting for people to catch on. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all natural musicians; it's the only job we've ever had, and none of us 
has ever held down a regular job. This is what we do -- we're out there 
together, playing our sound." 
</P>
<P>
The unique NRBQ sound is based on segregation rather than integration, Adams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you take something like fusion, you get neither jazz nor rock 'n' roll," 
he said. "And to me, that's no fun -- I'd rather hear someone play a jazz tune 
right and then a rock 'n' roll tune right. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like, if you're a painter, and you take all your colors and dump them 
into one thing, you get dull gray. It's better to reserve the right color for 
the right moment. 
</P>
<P>
"We use every color that God gave us, whenever we feel like it, but instead of 
mixing everything together, we play everything pure -- the songs on our albums 
are mainly rock, but we might throw in a country tune or a jazz tune just to 
keep it interesting." 
</P>
<P>
NRBQ stands for New Rhythm and Blues Quintet, though the group today has four 
members. It was formed in 1967, when Adams and a fellow Kentucky native, 
guitarist Steve Ferguson, met Bronx-born bassist Joey Spampinato in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
With singer Frank Gadler and drummer Tom Staley, they began playing together in 
Miami nightclubs and gradually made their way north to New Jersey, where blues 
man Slim Harpo saw them in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Harpo got them booked into New York's prestigious Scene, and within months they 
were signed by Columbia Records, which in 1969 released the band's debut album. 
</P>
<P>
NRBQ's 1970 follow-up, "Boppin' the Blues," was a collaboration with rockabilly 
legend Carl Perkins; like the group's first album, it was a critical triumph 
but a commercial bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia subsequently dropped NRBQ, and the group recorded its next two albums 
for Kama Sutra Records. After a three-year sabbatical, NRBQ resurfaced in 1977 
with "All Hopped Up" on its own Red Rooster label; since then, it's released 
several more albums -- on Mercury, Rounder and Bearsville -- and toured 
incessantly, averaging upward of 180 gigs a year. (Al Anderson joined the group 
in 1971, and Ferguson and Gadler later quit. Tom Ardolino replaced Staley.) 
</P>
<P>
"We literally live on the road," Adams said. "None of the band members live in 
the same state, and when we do go home, it's to pick up our mail and change 
socks. 
</P>
<P>
"Touring not only keeps us young and healthy -- whenever I come to California, 
the first thing I do is go to the Beverly Hills Juice Club and grab some 
wheatgrass juice -- but that's how we get the music out there." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, NRBQ members have called time out to pursue individual projects. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Adams toured Europe with Carla Bley. Two years later, he compiled 
Thelonious Monk's "Always Know" album. And bassist Spampinato was a member of 
the "dream band" that Keith Richards assembled for the Chuck Berry tribute 
film, "Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll." 
</P>
<P>
But since 1987, when a protracted legal battle with Bearsville Records was 
finally resolved, the emphasis has been on collective activities. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we got out (of the Bearsville contract), we did two live albums, 
and then we began working on our new studio album for Virgin," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
"And now that our Virgin album is out, we're supporting it the best way we know 
how -- through touring, touring and more touring." 
</P>
<P>
 NRBQ will play tonight at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan 
Capistrano. Show time: 8 p.m. Tickets: $13.50. Information: (714) 496-8930.

UCI SCORES COUP, BOOKS AILEY DANCE TROUPE FOR NEW THEATER; 
</P>
<P>
BALLET: UCI'S ARTS AND LECTURES DIVISION, WHICH WILL PRESENT THE DANCE COMPANY 
IN ITS FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE COUNTY, ALSO LISTS 1990-1991 SEASON.

<P>
In a major programming coup, UC Irvine's Arts and Lectures division has booked 
the Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre Company for the inaugural season of the Irvine 
Theatre, which is expected to open in October. 
</P>
<P>
The New York City-based troupe has never appeared in Orange County. "We've 
wanted to get them for a long time," said Betty Tessman, the Arts and Lectures 
manager who scored the coup. "But until this theater came along, we've never 
had the proper place to put them." 
</P>
<P>
The Ailey troupe will give a single performance of an as-yet-undetermined 
ballet work at the $17.6-million facility in April, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The 750-seat theater, under construction on the UCI campus, is a joint venture 
of the city of Irvine, the university and the Irvine Theatre Operating Co. It 
will provide a three-way combination of community offerings, university 
programs and operating-company presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Other notable dance attractions destined for the theater under the sponsorship 
of UCI Arts and Lectures will be the Royal New Zealand Ballet on its first U.S. 
tour and the Los Angeles-based Bella Lewitsky Dance Company, which will perform 
a work commissioned to honor UCI's 25th anniversary. Both troupes are to appear 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
Tessman said that Arts and Lectures anticipates a 1990-91 budget of about 
$220,000 for bringing performance events to several venues on the UCI campus. 
The budget will be financed by ticket sales, projected at $160,000, she said, 
in addition to arts grants of $25,000 and a UCI subsidy of $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
She said that if the Irvine Theatre opens on time -- the second week of October 
is being considered -- the Arts and Lectures division also may be able to 
include the Colorado-based Indian Dance Theatre among its presentations that 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Theatre general manager Douglas C. Rankin said he is exploring Oct. 12 
and 13 as possible dates for the theater's debut weekend, provided it doesn't 
conflict with other premieres in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at October and November as the theater's official opening," he 
added. "Both of those months will be a long gala in which we will attempt to 
showcase as many of the user organizations as possible -- if not with full 
productions, then with showcase performances. That will include everything from 
the community companies to the professionals." 
</P>
<P>
Rankin said he has just begun to pencil in the Irvine Theatre schedule, and so 
far has offered actual performance dates to only two organizations: UCI Arts 
and Lectures (see below) and the Orange County Philharmonic Society, which 
announced its plans for the theater on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the theater-operating company is itself negotiating to present several 
notable dance and theater troupes. Although contracts have yet to be signed, he 
said, several dates are being held open. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Arts and Lectures will present: 
</P>
<P>
Indian Dance Theatre (Oct. 19, tentative); Bella Lewitsky Dance Co. (Nov. 1 
through 3); Opera a la Carte doing Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" (Nov. 
10); Royal New Zealand Ballet doing "Coppelia" (Nov. 16). 
</P>
<P>
Jack Daniels' Silver Cornette Band (Dec. 1); Seattle Mime Theatre Co.'s 
"Pinocchio" and five adult vignettes (Jan. 12); Western Opera Theatre 
production of Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor" with six singers from the San 
Francisco Opera and a two-piano orchestration (Jan. 30). 
</P>
<P>
"Gershwin by Request," featuring pianist Leon Bates and two singers (Feb. 20); 
"Broadway Celebration," featuring four vocalists singing show tunes (April 5); 
Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre Company (April 25), and the San Francisco Mime Troupe 
doing "Seeing Double," an original musical about Nicaragua (May 3). 
</P>
<P>
Tentatively scheduled presentations of the Irvine Theatre are: 
</P>
<P>
National Theatre of the Deaf (Oct. 10); Maria Benitez Spanish Dance Company 
(Nov. 24-25); Children's Theatre Company of Minneapolis doing "Pippi 
Longstocking" (Jan. 22), and Hubbard Street Dance Company (Jan. 24 through 26).

'TURANDOT' SECOND-GUESSED AT CAST PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Impresario Circle of Opera Pacific dodged raindrops Friday on a 
short hop from the Performing Arts Center to the "Turandot" cast party at 
Scott's Seafood Bar and Grill. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside the restaurant -- a glass of champagne or Chardonnay in hand -- the 
arts patrons mulled the fortunes of Princess Turandot, her tenacious suitor, 
Calaf, and the saintly, doomed slave girl, Liu. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept hoping Turandot would die," said Kathleen Deighton, who attended the 
performance and party with friend Jon Buyle. "We wanted Liu to get the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Buyle, laughing, joined in. "Wouldn't that have been wonderful? That would be a 
very modern love story -- much more proletarian!" 
</P>
<P>
"All that beautiful music," said Floss Schumacher, board chairwoman of Opera 
Pacific. Schumacher was discussing that beautiful music with her husband, Ed, 
and guest, Painter Woodley. Ed Schumacher shook his head. "I don't know about 
that Hollywood ending," he said of the happily-ever-after finale. 
</P>
<P>
Bill and Laila Conlin, who underwrote the "super title" translations projected 
above the stage, munched appetizers near the buffet. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight was a little slow," joked Bill. "Only two murders." 
</P>
<P>
At a candle-lit table along the wall, impresarios George and Arlene Cheng 
chatted with their guests, Bessie Loo and Frank Que. All four gave the 
production a thumbs-up, but Que, a dress designer in L.A., found the costumes 
lacking authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
Calaf's outfit, for instance, with puff sleeves and fur-topped boots, was "very 
Western," Que noted. And the "rabble," he said, "looked like Gypsies." 
</P>
<P>
"Asian colors are vibrant, more exciting. These (costumes) seemed to me a 
little on the drab side," Que said. "I think they should have studied Oriental 
things, or asked some Asian designers, since they went to all that expense." 
</P>
<P>
Mixing with the donors were opera stars Maria Spacagna (Liu) and Lando 
Bartolini (Calaf), as well as other cast members. 
</P>
<P>
Diva Johanna Meier, who sang the role of Princess Turandot in Friday's 
production, was a head-swiveling addition to the party when she arrived at 
midnight. She was greeted by Opera Pacific board president Tom Hammond with 
lavish praise and a hopeful promise. "I think one of these days David 
(DiChiera, general director of Opera Pacific) will have the courage to do some 
Wagner," Hammond said to the soprano, who has made her international reputation 
singing Wagnerian roles. 
</P>
<P>
Meier and Spacagna's appearances were sponsored by Richard and Jolene Engel and 
Lee West. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the party were Ealynn Voss and Giorgio Tieppo (Turandot and 
Calaf alternates), and patrons Hal and Jeanette Segerstrom, LaDorna and Bob 
Eichenberg, Walter Henry and Maria del Carmen Calvo, and Phil and Betty Quarre.

ASK THE VET: PETS NEED PREPARATION FOR LONG AUTO JOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn.

<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Is it necessary to get some tranquilizers for my cat if I plan to take him 
with me on a trip to Montana? He has ridden in my car before and just hides and 
starts to cry. I plan to get a large pet carrier to keep him in during the 
trip. I plan on being on the road for about 2 1/2 days with some frequent 
stops. He is about 6 years old and seems to be perfectly healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Simms, Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: If you have enough time before your journey, you might try taking your cat 
for a couple of short-duration car rides in the new carrier to see how well he 
travels. You should put a favorite blanket or towel in the carrier for him to 
hide under as well as a toy or two to keep him company. I recommend that you 
feed him about six to eight hours before the trip and give him a small amount 
of water at each stop. It might not be necessary to keep a litter box in the 
carrier unless you are planning long stretches of driving without a stop. 
Otherwise, give him a box to use at the stops or when you stop for the night. 
</P>
<P>
If he still has a very stressful time in the new carrier, you should have him 
checked by your veterinarian before getting any sedatives. Make sure you have a 
copy of his vaccinations, especially rabies, when you travel, and if he needs 
any medication, get an adequate supply to last for the length of your stay. 
Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When I first got my cat, I left food out and he started to gain weight, so I 
went to feeding him only twice a day. Can I go back to free feeding? It would 
sure be great for me. 
</P>
<P>
Renee Oughton, Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
A: I assume that feeding your cat just twice a day led to a return of his 
normal weight. If you want to go back to free feeding, you will first need to 
measure the amount of food that you leave out for him each day. 
</P>
<P>
You might try the free choice feeding for two weeks and then weigh him again. 
If his weight stays constant at the desired level, then continue to feed this 
measured amount. If his weight goes up, you must decrease his food by a small 
amount and then feed this new level daily. 
</P>
<P>
By monitoring his weight and the amount fed, you can control his diet and keep 
him being a healthy cat. I would recommend that he have a checkup by your 
veterinarian if he hasn't had one recently and get any necessary advice as to 
what to feed him to ensure good health.

HEALTH &amp; FITNESS: TEST'S SQUIGGLES ALERT DIETER, GIVE NEW MOTIVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since he started a new diet and exercise program last November, Kae Ewing's 
biggest problem has been motivation. He wanted to lose weight and get in shape, 
but there just didn't seem to be room in his busy schedule for regular exercise 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the 55-year-old Newport Beach stockbroker, who agreed to let 
Health &amp; Fitness follow his progress, has been frustrated because there 
hasn't been as much progress as he had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of the program, he lost 14 pounds, and in the third 
month he dropped aonly a single pound. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the numbers have been moving again -- but in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he's been sticking religiously to the low fat, high 
complex-carbohydrate diet recommended by his fitness consultant, Ewing has 
started gaining again and now weighs in at about 250, up from a low in January 
of 243. The 6-foot, 3 1/2-inch Lido Island resident's original goal, on the 
advice of fitness consultant Joe Dillon of Irvine's Body Accounting, was 203 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of exercising five or six times a week, as Dillon recommends, Ewing has 
managed only one or two sessions a week. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, Ewing may have found the motivation he needs, in the form of 
some electronic squiggles so slight even the doctor didn't notice them at first 
glance. 
</P>
<P>
The squiggles showed up on an electrocardiogram taken while Ewing walked, then 
jogged on a treadmill at the UC Irvine Executive Health Program. Although Ewing 
had no symptoms or history of heart problems or any other chronic ailments, 
Dillon recommended that he undergo a health screening just to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
It's something he suggests for all his clients, Dillon says, "But it's 
especially important for somebody like Kae, who has been sedentary for a long 
time, who's a male over 40 and who is significantly overweight." 
</P>
<P>
As we are reminded every February during National Heart Month, heart and 
circulatory diseases are the nation's top killers, accounting for nearly 50% of 
all deaths. The UCI program also screens for other problems such as diabetes, 
cancer and their precursors. 
</P>
<P>
But wouldn't Ewing have noticed something -- pain, shortness of breath, high 
blood pressure -- if he had a serious problem? 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily, says Dr. James Lindberg, medical director of the UCI program. 
"In 40% of cases, the first symptom of heart disease is sudden death," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some busy executives who never find the time for a checkup, Ewing had 
undergone treadmill tests before, always with normal results. But this time, 
the tracings of his heartbeat showed slight changes as he exercised, changes 
that Lindberg says "might indicate there's some coronary artery disease." The 
coronary arteries supply oxygenated blood to the heart muscle, and when they 
become blocked, heart attacks can occur. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing definite, but it does warrant further investigation," Lindberg 
says. He glanced at the electrocardiogram tracings immediately after the test, 
but "the changes were so slight I didn't even notice them at first," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The treadmill test was part of the UCI program's comprehensive evaluation of 
current health, which includes an individualized battery of tests based on a 
person's age, sex and condition. In addition to the usual medical examinations 
such as blood tests, thyroid tests, urinalysis, blood pressure checks, the 
Executive Health Program also takes into account such factors as stress level 
on and off the job and even whether the person wears a seat belt regularly in 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
After the results from all the tests are in, Lindberg will sit down with Ewing 
for a one-hour review of the findings and prepare a thick, bound personal 
health profile for him, spelling out Ewing's chances of dying of a heart 
attack, various forms of cancer or a motor vehicle accident within the next 
decade or so. The profile will also include a specific prescription for 
exercise, based on Ewing's current condition and capacity. 
</P>
<P>
But Lindberg isn't waiting for the numbers to come back from the lab. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after he looked at the electrocardiogram printout and saw the 
irregularities, he made arrangements to send Ewing to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange for further tests. The first step, he says, will be another, more 
sophisticated treadmill test, and if that confirms Lindberg's findings, the 
next step would be an angiogram, in which doctors at UCI would inject dye into 
Ewing's coronary arteries while a special X-ray machine displays and records 
the results. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a blockage in one or more of Ewing's coronary arteries, doctors may 
be able to remove it without major surgery by using a technique such as balloon 
angioplasty, in which a tiny balloon is inserted in the artery and then 
inflated to flatten out the blockage. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there's a chance that those suspicious squiggles amount to nothing 
more than a false alarm. Lindberg says there's roughly a 20% chance that the 
results are a false positive and Ewing has no coronary artery disease. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what the doctors ultimately conclude, Ewing says the preliminary 
results have made a difference already. "When Dr. Lindberg called and told me, 
it was like when you hit the jackpot on a pinball machine, you know, how all 
the lights flash and the bells go off? And I thought, 'Maybe that's why I 
should lose weight.' Whether they find something this time or not, this brings 
it home that being overweight has to be a health hazard. Maybe this is what I 
needed to get me motivated." 
</P>
<P>
In a couple of weeks, we'll check back with Ewing and find out what the other 
test results showed.

DOUGLAS SIGNS FOR MIRAGE FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: BUT $25-MILLION DEAL IS CONDITIONAL ON NEW CHAMPION GETTING OUT OF 
CONTRACT WITH KING.

<P>
Buster Douglas signed a "conditional contract" Wednesday to defend his 
heavyweight boxing championship at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas in September, 
a fight that will pay him a record $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
A Mirage spokesman said the contract Douglas signed was contingent on Douglas' 
breaking his contract with promoter Don King, and that Douglas and the Mirage 
had filed suit against King Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Buster Douglas and the Mirage, as co-plaintiffs, today filed suit against Don 
King, seeking to break a promotional agreement King has with Douglas," Mirage 
spokesman Alan Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas promoter Bob Arum, New York promoter Shelly Finkel and Douglas' camp 
all said that John Johnson, Douglas' manager, and Mirage owner Steve Wynn had 
completed a deal.

Douglas, who made $1.3 million in knocking out Mike Tyson Feb. 11, would earn 
boxing's biggest purse for his first defense, most likely against No. 1 
contender Evander Holyfield. One rumor had it that a two-fight deal was in the 
works, with former champion Mike Tyson meeting the Douglas-Holyfield winner. 
</P>
<P>
If the Mirage-Douglas deal is indeed made, Douglas' September payday will 
exceed the record $21 million reportedly paid to Tyson after his 1988 knockout 
of Michael Spinks. 
</P>
<P>
According to Arum, Wynn and Johnson signed an agreement Wednesday afternoon. 
And Arum said that he has a handshake deal to promote the fight and distribute 
the pay-per-view telecast. 
</P>
<P>
"Wynn has guaranteed Douglas $25 million," Arum said. "They signed an agreement 
for Douglas to fight in September against Holyfield or another opponent." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson acknowledged after the Tokyo fight that Douglas had signed a 
promotional contract with King, in the event he defeated Tyson. But Johnson 
said King breached his legal standing with Douglas by attempting to have the 
Douglas-Tyson result overturned in the hours after Douglas' victory. 
</P>
<P>
King and the Tyson camp claimed that Mexican referee Octavio Meyran had 
blundered by giving Douglas a long count when Tyson knocked him down in the 
eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's son and Douglas' assistant manager, John Johnson Jr., said Wednesday 
that a deal had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be September and Buster will get $25 million," he said. "Dad and Buster 
were to come back to Columbus and talk over everything, but things are moving 
pretty quickly. It's possible everything could be signed Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
Faced with covering Douglas' guarantee, Arum said the promotion of Douglas' 
first defense will be a huge undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll have to be the biggest-grossing fight in history just to break even," 
Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no word Wednesday as to what Holyfield would earn for a fight with 
Douglas. But before Tyson-Douglas he had signed for a June 18 fight with Tyson 
that would have paid him $12 million, and Tyson $22 million to $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Shelly Finkel, New York rock-concert promoter and pay-per-view TV syndicator, 
said Johnson had told him Tuesday night he had cut a deal with Wynn. 
</P>
<P>
"I told John that September is a problem for Holyfield's people and he 
understands that. I told him we ought to look at what kind of money is out 
there (for Douglas-Holyfield) before we discuss the September date." 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, Wynn seemed to have been the bidding leader for Douglas' first 
defense. In fact, the red carpet reached all the way from Las Vegas to 
Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Wynn arrived in Columbus in his private jet, a 26-seat DC-9, 
picked up Douglas and Johnson, and flew them to Las Vegas. Two hours after 
arriving, Douglas and Johnson had prime seats, with Wynn, for the Siegfried and 
Roy show at the Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Duva, Holyfield's promoter, was unavailable for comment Wednesday. But a 
spokeswoman for his firm, Main Events, said Duva remains strongly opposed to a 
September fight with Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
"If it turns out September is non-negotiable, I'm sure he'd discuss it," said 
Ellen Krudys. "But he definitely feels very strongly that the fight should be 
in June." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield will be Douglas' opponent in September, Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
"They may not like the date, but they'll take the fight," he said."

St. Just.

Sometimes it pays to have a nosy neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
When Anthony Allen was becoming a high school standout in Port Arthur, Tex., a 
neighbor, James Washington, decided to become involved in planning his college 
career -- without telling Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, 69, told Steve Berkowitz of the Washington Post: 
</P>
<P>
"I used to look at the games on TV, and the announcers would say how many of 
Georgetown's players completed their educations. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to get (Allen) recognized by a school that would make sure he 
would come out with a degree. 
</P>
<P>
"Starting when he was a junior, whenever I saw something in the newspaper I 
thought might be of interest, I'd cut it out and send it to Coach (John) 
Thompson. Then, when Anthony was a senior, I sent him a letter." 
</P>
<P>
Allen went on to become Texas high school player of the year and was already 
high on Thompson's recruiting list. Now, with some assistance from Washington, 
he plays for the Hoyas. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Feb. 22, 1969, who became the first female jockey to win a race 
at an American thoroughbred track? 
</P>
<P>
Claims to fame: Said ABC's Al Michaels, who broadcast the United States' hockey 
upset of the Soviet Union 10 years ago in the Olympics at Lake Placid, N.Y., 
and the San Francisco earthquake during the World Series last fall: "To me, 
it's an incredible irony that I built my career around baseball, everything 
I've done in my career is spun off of baseball, but what I'm known for is 
hockey and an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Street smarts: Joe Walton, fired after seven years as the New York Jets' coach 
and hired Friday as the Pittsburgh Steelers' offensive coordinator, on signing 
quarterback Tony Eason during the 1989 season: 
</P>
<P>
"Any guy coming off the street would have trouble learning a new offense. 
Unfortunately, we had to bring a lot of guys off the street because we had a 
lot of injuries. One reason you're on the street is possibly (because) you 
don't learn things too well." 
</P>
<P>
Night vision: Illinois assistant basketball coach Jimmy Collins says the NCAA 
recruiting allegations against him by LaPhonso Ellis, a sophomore at Notre 
Dame, are giving him nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
"LaPhonso was right in front of me, laughing in my face, and all of his teeth 
were gold," Collins said. "I was so mad, I jumped out of bed and paced the 
room. My wife said, 'Calm down, calm down -- it was only a dream.' "

NEWSWIRE: SULAIMAN GETS SUPPORT TO STAY WBC PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Sulaiman will continue as president of the World Boxing Council after 
winning support Wednesday from a majority of the nine federations that make up 
the organization. 
</P>
<P>
A WBC official said in Mexico City that Sulaiman received support from seven 
federations and was then given "absolute support" by the rest of the group. 
</P>
<P>
The WBC also said it would sanction a heavyweight title defense by Buster 
Douglas against top-ranked challenger Evander Holyfield, the winner to meet 
Mike Tyson, who was upset by Douglas in Tokyo on Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
It had been reported that Sulaiman would resign or be ousted at Wednesday's 
meeting but Eduardo Lamazon, the WBC's executive secretary, said that 
Sulaiman's status was never an issue at the emergency meeting of the WBC 
executive committee. He said the meeting was to review the controversy 
surrounding the delay in recognizing Douglas as the new heavyweight champion 
after his knockout of Tyson.

Kristi Terzian made a yawner out of the women's giant slalom Wednesday, blowing 
away her competition with a blistering second run for a victory margin of more 
than two seconds at the U.S. Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Terzian, 22, of Salt Lake City was nearly a full second faster than the field 
on the second run, recording a time of 1 minute 18.80 seconds for a combined 
time for two runs of 2:35.99. 
</P>
<P>
Heidi Bowes of Steamboat Springs was a distant second at 2:38.01. Bowes had 
rallied from eighth place after the first heat with a second-run time of 
1:19.76 that bettered every skier but Terzian. 
</P>
<P>
Krista Schmidinger of Lee, Mass., was third in 2:38.63, followed by her twin 
sister, Kim, in 2:38.82. Eva Twardokens of Santa Cruz was fifth in 2:39.00. 
</P>
<P>
Diann Roffe of Williston, Vt., the favorite in the event, nearly fell on her 
first run but recovered, then missed a gate on her second run. 
</P>
<P>
Terzian paced the first run as well, taking a lead of 0.13 seconds over Kim 
Schmidinger. 
</P>
<P>
Terzian leads U.S. skiers with 12 top-15 finishes this season on the World Cup 
circuit and ranks second to Roffe among U.S. skiers in overall points. 
</P>
<P>
The men's giant slalom is scheduled for today.

Former football coach Joe Morrison and his staff at South Carolina "had to know 
or they were blind" that some players were taking steroids, according to 
documents released by the school. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison acknowledged several months before his death of a heart attack last 
year that he had heard rumors of players using steroids. But the university's 
recently released report to the NCAA offers support to the belief that the 
popular coach looked the other way when it came to steroids.

NBA WEDNESDAY'S TRADES;

<P>
CHEEKS DEALT FOR STRICKLAND; CARROLL TO NUGGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Knicks traded backup point guard Rod Strickland to the San Antonio 
Spurs on Wednesday for veteran guard Maurice Cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland, 23, a second-year pro, had expressed unhappiness with his role as a 
backup to Mark Jackson earlier this season and asked to be traded. He averaged 
8.2 points and 4.3 assists while playing 20 minutes per game. 
</P>
<P>
Cheeks, 33, was traded from Philadelphia to San Antonio last summer after 
spending his 11-year NBA career with the 76ers. He averaged 10.9 points and six 
assists in 35 minutes per game with the Spurs. In his 11 seasons with the 
76ers, Cheeks averaged 12.2 points and 7.3 assists in 853 games and leads 
active players in steals. 
</P>
<P>
Cheeks is expected to back up Jackson. Strickland likely will assume the 
starting point guard role with the second-place Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey Nets traded center Joe Barry Carroll to the Denver Nuggets for 
rookie guard Michael Cutright and acquired center Chris Dudley from the 
Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for two second-round draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland then packaged the draft choices from the Nets to acquire Derrick 
Chievous from the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Dudley, a fourth-round selection from Yale in the 1987 draft, averaged five 
points and 5.5 rebounds in 37 games with Cleveland this season. The 6-foot-11 
Dudley started the season on the injured list with a broken bone in his left 
wrist and was activated Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll entered the NBA after being drafted by Golden State with the first pick 
in the first round of the 1980 NBA draft. After playing six seasons with the 
Warriors, he was traded to Houston in December of 1987, then went to New Jersey 
in November of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll has played in 45 games for the Nets this season, starting 20, and has 
averaged 8.8 points, 5.4 rebounds and 21.8 minutes per game. In his nine-year 
career he has averaged 18.2 points and 7.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets received three second-round draft picks and an undisclosed amount 
of cash from the Cavaliers for forward-guard Chievous. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Rockets acquired guard Vernon Maxwell from San Antonio for an 
undisclosed sum, said Houston General Manager Steve Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets will get the Cavaliers' 1992 or 1994 second-round draft pick, plus 
Boston's 1991 and 1993 second-round picks, which Cleveland had acquired from 
New Jersey for Dudley. 
</P>
<P>
Chievous was the Rockets' 1988 first-round draft pick. He averaged 5.9 points 
and 1.8 rebounds in 41 games for Houston this season.

PISTONS DON'T LET UP ON MAGIC, 140-109 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons, who used an impressive defense to carry them to the NBA 
championship last spring, can also turn on the offense on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dumars scored 22 points and five teammates were in double figures Wednesday 
night at Auburn Hills, Mich., as the Pistons routed the expansion Orlando 
Magic, 140-109. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, who built a big early lead and coasted to their 13th victory in a 
row, have not lost since the Lakers beat them Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, who began to emphasize defense a few seasons ago, again have the 
best defensive record. They have yielded an average of 97.5 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
In this game, though, it was the offense that prevailed. The Pistons scored 70 
points in each half. At halftime they led by 17 and the Magic never made a game 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars, the most valuable player in the NBA Finals last season, scored the 
5,000th point of his career late in the third quarter. The basket gave the 
Pistons an 87-63 lead. The crowd of 21,454 gave the guard a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a real big number," Dumars said, "but it's nice to be appreciated. 
A few years ago I didn't play well enough to be appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 121, Portland 109 -- The Cavaliers have struggled all season because 
of a wave of serious injuries. So they were in no mood to sympathize with the 
Trail Blazers, who played this game in Richfield, Ohio, without injured star 
Clyde Drexler. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers, slowly rounding into playoff form, made 61% from the field in 
the first half to build a 64-48 lead, and the Trail Blazers never were able to 
get back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Chucky Brown and Mark Price led the Cavaliers with 24 points each. Price 
sank three three-point shots. Monday night, Price missed all seven of his 
attempts from long range to end his streak of games in which he made a 
three-pointer at 34. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers had won three in a row on the road. They are hoping that 
Drexler, their leading scorer who has a sprained ankle, will play Friday night 
at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 123, Atlanta 96 -- When they missed their first seven shots at 
Indianapolis, the Hawks had a pretty good idea their slump was not over. 
</P>
<P>
The game was five minutes old before they made their first field goal and the 
Hawks, in danger of blowing a playoff spot, lost for the 13th time in the last 
15 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks' star, Dominique Wilkins, never did find the range. He was two for 14 
and had only four points in 28 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The hot Pacers made 15 of their first 19 shots to build a big early lead, with 
Reggie Miller getting seven points in the first three minutes. Indiana went on 
to earn its 28th win, matching its total for all of last season. They have 29 
games left. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 116, Boston 103 -- Before losing his cool in the third quarter and being 
ejected at Salt Lake City, Karl Malone had already scored 27 points and helped 
the Jazz put away the weary Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 17th win in a row at home for the Jazz and the Celtics' fourth loss 
in a row on their tough trip West. Referee Jack Madden charged Malone with two 
technicals only 16 seconds after Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan was ejected with five 
minutes left in the third quarter. The Jazz led at the time, 77-60. 
</P>
<P>
Thurl Bailey also scored 27 points for Utah, and John Stockton had 17 points 
and 17 assists for the Jazz, who are 25-3 at home, with their last defeat Dec. 
11 against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McHale, who was only two for 11 in a loss Tuesday night at Phoenix, led 
the Celtics with 34 points. He was 10 for 17 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 96, Golden State 95 -- Hersey Hawkins sank a three-point shot to 
break a 93-93 tie with a little more than a minute left at Oakland and the 
76ers held on to win. 
</P>
<P>
A jumper by Terry Teagle with 34 seconds left brought the Warriors to within a 
point, but they never got the ball again. The 76ers ran the clock down, and, 
after Hawkins missed, Mike Gminski pulled down the rebound and the 76ers ran 
out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 95, Minnesota 93 -- The Nets' 14-game losing streak came to a halt, 
but just barely, at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets built a 75-57 lead late in the third period, then blew it and trailed, 
93-92, with six seconds to play. Lester Conner took the inbounds pass, dribbled 
down the court and sank a 10-foot jumper at the buzzer. He was fouled on the 
play and his free throw made it a two-point victory. The Timberwolves had won 
four in a row.

victory.

The Heat trailed, 75-62, after three quarters, then scored the first nine

PRIZED'S 1990 DEBUT TO BE ON BIG 'CAP DAY, BUT HE WILL NOT RUN IN THE 
$1-MILLION RACE

To the surprise of no one, Prized will make his 1990 debut a week from Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But it won't be in the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap. Rather, the Breeders' 
Cup Turf winner and upsetter of Sunday Silence in the Swaps Stakes, will return 
in the $100,000 Arcadia Handicap, the day's supporting feature. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jeff Siegel, one of the heads of Clover Racing Stable, which owns 
the 4-year-old son of Kris S. in partnership, Prized's schedule was thrown off 
by the recent rain. 
</P>
<P>
"The rain cost him a work," Siegel said. "He was supposed to work last 
Saturday, but he couldn't. He's training fine and he's healthy, but he's not 
ready to go a mile and a quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Prized, who might very well have been favored in the Big 'Cap, breezed six 
furlongs in 1:13 2/5 Tuesday at Hollywood Park and galloped seven furlongs in 
1:26 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
The Arcadia, a mile on the turf, will also bring out Steinlen for the first 
time this year. Wayne Lukas' horse hasn't run since he won the Breeders' Cup 
Mile, capping a year in which he was voted the Eclipse Award as the nation's 
top grass performer. Another likely contestant is millionaire Music Merci. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the defection of Prized, there is no change in Bayakoa's status for the 
Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just continue to take it one day at a time," trainer Ron McAnally said. 
"There's a lot of factors involved. It's a hard decision to make right now. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been doing well and hasn't missed any feed. She's nice and relaxed. 
Hopefully, we'll get there, and, who knows, it might rain again." 
</P>
<P>
Taken off the pace for the first time in his five-race career, Burnt Hills 
responded with a half-length victory over Shantin O. in the $82,800 Bolsa Chica 
Stakes Wednesday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old son of Conquistador Cielo, saved ground early under Eddie 
Delahoussaye, swung outside for the stretch run and collared Shantin O., the 
5-1 third choice, in the final strides. He was timed in a solid 1:09 1/5 over a 
track that wasn't particularly fast. 
</P>
<P>
This was the third win in five starts for Bobby Frankel's colt, who has been 
second in his two defeats. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he ran well and I thought Eddie rode him well," said Frankel. "He's 
a good horse. He fires every time and this is only his fifth start." 
</P>
<P>
Burnt Hills will try a longer race in his next start, possibly the San Felipe 
at a mile and a sixteenth March 18 or the Gotham at a mile in New York April 7. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye, who was riding Burnt Hills for the first time, said he had some 
anxious moments. 
</P>
<P>
"He scared me," the jockey said. "When he got up alongside (Shantin O.), he 
started to pull himself up. "Maybe, he doesn't like to be hit. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no plan to take him back, just to get him out and see where he was. 
. . . He relaxed well and was running easy. When I got him outside, he cut. He 
never jumped or anything and he had a lot of dirt hitting him for the first 
time. He rates well and he's honest." 
</P>
<P>
Shantin O., who set or forced the pace throughout, finished three-quarters of a 
length ahead of 13-1 shot Keep Clear, who was five and a half lengths ahead of 
Real Cash, the more highly-regarded half of the Wayne Lukas entry that was the 
actual 17-10 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
When it is run for the 51st time June 24, the Hollywood Gold Cup will carry a 
$1-million purse. 
</P>
<P>
The increase was announced Wednesday and makes Hollywood Park the only track to 
regularly schedule two million-dollar races during a calendar year. The other 
is the Hollywood Futurity, which is run in December. 
</P>
<P>
The Gold Cup, won last year by Blushing John, is the prime Inglewood objective 
for Sunday Silence, who will resume light training within the next two weeks. 
The 1989 horse of the year, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Nov. 16, is 
scheduled to return in the $300,000 Californian June 3. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens will ride Ruhlmann in the Santa Anita Handicap, one of two horses 
Charlie Whittingham will saddle for the race. The other is Lively One, the San 
Pasqual runner-up. . . . Laffit Pincay galloped some horses Wednesday morning 
and plans on riding Saturday. He has been out since breaking his collarbone in 
an accident during a harness racing exhibition Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Present Value, who is still being pointed for the Big 'Cap despite a dismal 
effort in the San Antonio, worked six furlongs in 1:15 3/5 on the turf 
Wednesday morning. Also out was another Big 'Cap possible, Hawkster. He worked 
five furlongs in 1:00 4/5. . . . Robbie Davis had three winners Wednesday -- 
Damazar, a first-time starter who was impressive taking the third; Crystal 
Pirate in the sixth, and River Master in the seventh. David Flores won twice, 
on Romaxe in the first and Pewter in the fifth.

TOO MUCH TRUMP, PLEBES HARRUMPH, BUT KEEP READING

<P>
"If this were Mr. Cohen and Mrs. Cohen, who would care?" -- Sarah Frantz, 
lifelong New Yorker 
</P>
<P>
Enough already. 
</P>
<P>
It's been 12 days since news of the Great Divorce first rocked Gotham. Twelve 
long days since New York went bonkers over the breakup of mega-developer Donald 
Trump and his Czechoslovakian wife, Ivana. Since then, Trumpmania has become a 
way of life. 
</P>
<P>
The city's warring tabloids and talk shows have shifted into overdrive, chasing 
a daily story that reeks of sex, power, greed and revenge. Should Ivana get 
more than the $25 million promised her in a prenuptial agreement? Will Donald 
lose control of his $1.7-billion empire? Can we believe those rumors about the 
Other Woman, a blond knockout named Marla Maples? 
</P>
<P>
Gossip columnists have taken sides in the first great marital tiff of the '90s, 
and on some mornings the steamy story has blown all other news off the front 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for the latest from Eastern Europe? Get real. Nelson Mandela's release? 
Please turn to page 15. 
</P>
<P>
But take it from the hard-working stiffs of New York, the $20,000-a-year folks 
who trudge to work each day past the screaming headlines: The Trump story is 
beginning to get old. 
</P>
<P>
On a cold, blustery afternoon, Yusef Achmed stands in front of the posh Plaza 
Hotel as he always does, selling hot dogs and dispensing wisdom. Trump, The 
Divorce, is roaring into its second week, but Achmed couldn't care less. 
</P>
<P>
"In my country, in Egypt, this could never be," he says, slapping a pink dog 
into a steaming bun. "Here, the rich are crazy. A man leaves his wife. A woman 
cries her heart out. And they do this in public, all of it, in newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, Jesse Stearns waits for passengers to hitch a ride past 
Trump's luxurious hotel and through Central Park in a horse-drawn carriage. He, 
too, is weary of the story. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy Trump is a real piece of work, and his wife's no bargain either," 
Stearns says, stamping his feet to ward off the cold. "I'm tired of 'em both, 
you know? I'm tired of the whole damn thing." 
</P>
<P>
But even Stearns says he reads each new installment with fascination. Like many 
New Yorkers, he has taken Ivana's side, saying she should get more from "The 
Donald," as Ivana has dubbed him. He relishes the prospect that the brash 
44-year-old developer might actually lose for a change. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the press, Trump vs. Trump seems to be getting hotter as it rolls 
into Week 3. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the tabloids sent squads of reporters to Palm Beach to cover 
Donald and Ivana's chilly vacation -- in separate beds -- at their 118-room 
estate. Trump denies that he has been unfaithful to Ivana, 41, but Maples' 
friends have told reporters that the 26-year-old actress-model is "obsessed" 
with the developer. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the papers breathlessly reported that Trump had hired a team of 
three bodyguards to hustle Maples in and out of hotel rooms, to make sure she 
never bumped into Ivana. Meanwhile, a society writer explained that Ivana would 
have to "cut corners" if she hoped to maintain her exclusive life style on only 
$25 million. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ivana's lawyer announced he was no longer speaking to Donald's 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The Trumps have deplored all of the publicity, blasting the media for lack of 
good taste and restraint. But behind the scenes, their high-priced lawyers and 
publicists -- and a rapidly multiplying number of anonymous sources -- have 
been whipping the press into a feeding frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
"Best Sex I Ever Had," screamed the New York Post last week, hyping a comment 
that Maples reportedly made about her boudoir romps with Trump. "A real peach," 
leered the Daily News, probing her years as a cheerleader and high school 
basketball player in Dalton, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
As they dish the dirt, gossip queens Liz Smith of the Daily News and Cindy 
Adams of the Post have hooked up with the rival camps -- Liz with Ivana, Cindy 
with Donald -- and are even firing shots at each other. Last week, the Daily 
News invited New Yorkers to write letters to the feuding couple and printed the 
best ones. Not to be outdone, New York Newsday ran a gaudy cartoon on its front 
page lampooning the whole affair. 
</P>
<P>
Even Maples has gotten into the act, hiring a lawyer to squelch stories and 
racy modeling photos that have been popping up in the tabloids. She also has a 
press agent, reportedly on Trump's payroll, who tells reporters that she is 
"The Marilyn Monroe of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
The soap opera is getting dirtier by the day, and prominent celebrities have 
plunged into the suds. Leona Helmsley, the serpent-tongued hotel magnate who 
was convicted for tax fraud, lashed out at Trump in an interview published last 
weekend and said his wife deserves more money. Cardinal John J. O'Connor, 
urging calm, has publicly counseled both Trumps to pray. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing is out of control," boxing promoter Irving Rudd says as he 
muscles his way through a sandwich in a mid-town deli. "We had Trump at a press 
conference the other day to promote a boxing match with Thomas Hearns, and 25 
television cameras showed up. Do you think they cared about the boxing match? 
I'm getting tired of this." 
</P>
<P>
So are the little people, as Helmsley once called those who pay taxes. 
</P>
<P>
An impromptu public opinion survey this week in New York and on the Atlantic 
City boardwalk showed growing support for Ivana -- but even more, a belief that 
the whole story has been blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are so many more important things going on than this," says 
Roberta Washington from Brooklyn, as she waits for a bus to take her home from 
the Trump Plaza Casino. "The homeless, crime in the street. And here are these 
two people with millions of dollars, fighting for even more." 
</P>
<P>
Washington gathers up her handbag and coat and announces that she has nothing 
more to say. Then, she adds in a whisper: "I hope she takes him to the 
cleaners." 
</P>
<P>
Back in New York, taxi driver Debra Augustus laughs at the big story as he 
cruises past the glitzy Trump Tower building on Fifth Avenue. For Augustus, a 
native of Ghana, Trump vs. Trump is something uniquely American -- and 
therefore bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she should get more," he says with a smirk. "Maybe $100 million. No, 
maybe $200 million. Throw in the hotel, too? OK, throw in the hotel. Whatever 
you say." 
</P>
<P>
Swerving to avoid a pedestrian, Augustus looks up at the shimmering golden 
facade of Trump's high-rise building and laughs again. 
</P>
<P>
"People are rooting for her, I guess, but does it matter? It is a fairy tale. I 
am still looking for my fortune, and I work very hard. I have no time for fairy 
tales." 
</P>

ART BUCHWALD: HOW TO PREDICT THE UNPREDICTABLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Presidents of the United States are not the only ones who hire soothsayers to 
tell them what the future will bring. Large corporations also sign up former 
Cabinet officers and foreign policy experts to warn them what to expect around 
the globe. These experts don't come cheap, but they're worth it. From Moscow to 
Mandela it's been one triumph after another for global consultants. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, there are misunderstandings. I was sitting in the anteroom of 
Heinrich Applebaum's "Made-to-Order Quality Predictions" when Willard Dergen, 
CEO of Stardust Avionics, charged in. He wanted to know why he hadn't been 
informed about the overthrow of the old regime in Czechoslovakia, and its 
replacement with a playwright, when he had paid Heinrich a fee of $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Heinrich smiled, as he usually does when stuck in a corner, and replied, "We 
didn't want to bother you with something so insignificant. Czechoslovakia is 
such a little country, it can't affect anything." 
</P>
<P>
Willard spluttered and said, "Why did I have to find out on CNN that Romania 
was about to fall and its leader had been killed? Your job is to let me know 
who is going to get killed in Romania." 
</P>
<P>
"Willard, we didn't want to go off the deep end until our CIA sources confirmed 
it for us. One thing we don't do at Applebaum Predictions is fax a client for 
the sake of faxing him." 
</P>
<P>
"This may sound strange to you, but I don't like to spend $2 million a year and 
not even know about the fall of the Berlin Wall. Why didn't you people inform 
us that the wall was going to be torn down?" 
</P>
<P>
"The East Germans gave us their word that the wall would stay forever. But they 
double-crossed us to suck up to West Germany." 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't your firm predict the collapse of communism in East Germany?" 
</P>
<P>
"We don't Red-bait. Nobody could have seen that coming. If we had told you last 
year that there would soon be only one Germany, you would have asked for your 
money back. Weren't you surprised?" 
</P>
<P>
"I pay you so that I won't be surprised. How come I didn't hear from you when 
Bulgaria went under?" 
</P>
<P>
"We told you that there is a surcharge for information about events in 
Bulgaria. Willard, were we or weren't we right on Poland?" 
</P>
<P>
"You were as right as Time magazine which was where I first read the story. 
What have you been doing about the Soviet Union? 
</P>
<P>
"I have to know now. If I can't figure out what the Soviet Union is doing, I 
won't be able to decide how much business the Defense Department is going to 
throw my way. You owe it to me to give me the scoop on daily events in the 
Kremlin." 
</P>
<P>
"Willard, we have a report on Raisa Gorbachev's dressmaker that will make your 
hair stand on end." 
</P>
<P>
"When do I see this intelligence?" 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we get the leather-bound report with your name engraved on it back 
from the printer. It's a gorgeous presentation if I must say so myself." 
</P>
<P>
"Give me something today that I can go back to my board with to justify your 
outrageous fee." 
</P>
<P>
"The South Africans are going to release Nelson Mandela from prison." 
</P>
<P>
"They did that last week." 
</P>
<P>
"They did?" Heinrich was truly surprised. "Nobody tells me anything."

11 YEARS OF SHOVING HARVARD UPHILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The University, an Owner's Manual by Henry Rosovsky (W.W. Norton: $19.95; 299 
pages.) 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the '70s, when Harvard University launched a drive to 
substantially increase its already massive endowment, all the stops were pulled 
out. There was a twisting of alumni arms on a scale never seen before. Among 
the really high-torque operatives was Henry Rosovsky, dean of the faculty of 
arts and sciences and the university's chief academic administrator. 
</P>
<P>
An early arm was that of John L. Loeb, a prominent New York financier and 
philanthropist. For the occasion, President Derek Bok came along; Loeb treated 
them to hamburgers at the Four Seasons. It was gastronomic Harvardry -- 
provident chic, that is, like using a worn Vuitton bag to carry your cheese 
sandwich. In his memoir, "The University," Rosovsky recalls: 
</P>
<P>
"As the conversation gently evolved towards specific dollar amounts, our host 
inquired: 'Are you asking me for $5 million?' I replied: 'Not quite, sir. My 
hope is that you will agree to give $10 million, so that others would be 
inspired to give $5 million.' 
</P>
<P>
"Henry," Loeb said, darkening, "that comes close to chutzpah." Abruptly, he 
asked whether Rosovsky knew how to spell the word. (One thing you get in 
exchange for multimillion benefactions is the right to grill a Harvard dean on 
his spelling.) 
</P>
<P>
But if knowledge is power, then it was time for No. 1 to strut his stuff. 
"Suddenly, the president of Harvard University snatched the napkin from my 
hands," Rosovsky continues, "and printed CHUTZPAH in large block letters on the 
paper and gave it to Mr. Loeb." 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Loeb sent word he was good for about $9 million. "We had 
established that the value of chutzpah is approximately $4 million," the writer 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
It is witty, urbane, a touch cool, a touch smug, a touch fierce, and it ends 
with an academic flourish in Prof. Rosovsky's own field: economics. And 
underneath there is a winning glee in the entire operation and, above all, in 
telling of it. 
</P>
<P>
These are the marks of Rosovsky's engaging account of 11 years spent shoving 
Harvard uphill. It's hard to do when your shov-ee hasn't the least doubt that 
it already is on top. In general, Rosovsky thinks so too, but he gives us an 
account of the diplomacy, finagling, and intellectual judo -- you use your 
partner's lunge to keep him pointed the right way -- to patch the holes and 
minimize the slides. 
</P>
<P>
Rosovsky has dean-like things to say about the advantages for undergraduates of 
university-colleges such as Harvard, with big research and graduate programs, 
as against the small liberal arts college (more stimulation). We hear about 
Harvard's core curriculum -- a means of broadening a student's program by 
replacing general education courses with a series of highly focused specific 
ones. Some of it sounds like a speech or a position paper; some of it is. 
</P>
<P>
When Rosovsky, like his core curriculum, gets away from generalities and down 
to particulars, the book shines. He gives us a composite of a well-packed 
dean's day. Among its events is the discovery that his plan to save money by 
reducing the painting of classrooms would mean laying off painters; and, under 
union rules about seniority, those laid-off would be black. Painting will 
proceed as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is linked to everything else. His financial assistant insists 
tuition must be raised; this will mean anguish and higher outlays for 
scholarships. We get one of the Rosovskyisms that stud the book: "I know that 
few decisions have to be made immediately and that it is best not to make them 
in a macho frame of mind." 
</P>
<P>
An economics professor comes in to complain that his pay raise is only 1%. 
Rosovsky takes pleasure in proving to him that the correct figure is 6%. A 
delegation of Jewish students brings 3,000 signatures to protest the holding of 
commencement during a religious holiday. Rosovsky is unimpressed: "In our 
community, thousands of signatures can be obtained in a few hours for nearly 
anything." More to the point, he has obtained in advance rabbinical advice to 
back him up; it helps, he adds, that he is Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
He has to speak harshly to a professor who refuses to meet with his classes, 
complaining that his students are "inauthentic." Later, painfully, it turns out 
that the man has lost his mind and has to be retired on pay. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard has no special dispensation in the competition for talent. It has to 
sweat. The chairman of the chemistry department sends over a note from a Nobel 
prize winner in Britain who had been asked to comment on a list of names for a 
vacancy. "With the reputation you have got for treatment of the branch of 
chemistry that has most rapidly developed over the past 30 years . . . any of 
the distinguished gentlemen on your short list would be as mad as the 
proverbial March hares to leave their cushy nests, particularly those who have 
been spurned by Harvard in the past." 
</P>
<P>
It is a reflection of the most important battle Rosovsky fought during his 
tenure: getting fresh blood. There are Harvard departments that resist 
virtually any possible candidate. The philosophy department, he writes, is so 
highly rated it suffers "the classic pathology: the inability to find anyone 
worthy of joining its ranks. It is in imminent danger of becoming a club of old 
gentlemen, more exclusive with every retirement and death. In my imagination, I 
picture the department with only one member: a patriarch holding a gigantic bag 
of black balls." 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Rosovsky sets aside an hour and a bottle of the best sherry to woo 
a brilliant young philosopher from a Midwestern university who has managed to 
crawl out of the black ball sack. There is a high salary, a job for the wife, a 
housing allowance and a small slush fund. 
</P>
<P>
Rosovsky has provocative things to say about tenure, about the pleasures and 
pains of being a professor, the hard path for the young Ph.D., the peculiar 
strains, balances and imbalances of power in a university, the envy and 
rivalries that develop. "Universities and colleges are schools for adults," he 
writes, "and the requirements of schooling and adulthood can be difficult to 
reconcile." 
</P>
<P>
It is appropriate that the book concludes with an exchange of letters with John 
Kenneth Galbraith. (The latter responds to Rosovsky's all-points instruction 
warning against romances between faculty and graduate and undergraduate 
students. He had committed such a fault decades ago, Galbraith confesses, and 
was still happily married to her; what did the dean advise? Discretion, the 
dean replies.) 
</P>
<P>
Rosovsky, who held his job longer than anyone since World War II -- he lets us 
know this -- before deciding to return to teaching, much resembles Galbraith in 
his style, graceful and with a deadly understatement.

MAGAZINES: BEACH CULTURE: SALTY VISION OF MEANING OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just because surfers have spawned a billion-dollar fashion industry, do we need 
to listen to their ruminations on the meaning of life? 
</P>
<P>
A new publication from the folks at Surfer Magazine thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
Beach Culture -- Real Life in the Coastal Zone hit the stands this month with a 
note from publisher Steve Pezman declaring: "Unabashedly hedonistic and 
narcissistic, the beach culture is now truly a significant marketplace of the 
modern human condition." 
</P>
<P>
By the time a subculture becomes self-reflective, it's a good bet that the sea 
gulls of mainstream merchandising are already nipping at its leathery flesh. In 
fact, the fashion industry has been scavenging ideas from the beach culture for 
decades. Now the fashion industry has absorbed everything that defined beach 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
The line between the realities of the surfer-skateboarder-snowboarder 
subculture and marketing mythology washed away long ago. But Beach Culture 
isn't about to back away from the pose of macho individualism that sells 
neoprene bikinis in Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
Intent on establishing the superiority of the surfer world view, 
Editor-in-Chief Paul Holmes writes that "testing limits (through surfing or 
skateboarding or playing volleyball) builds character, enhances the sense of 
individualism in a land of lemmings." 
</P>
<P>
And then: "What does George Bush know about staring into the face of a 20-foot, 
fish-killing, close-out set? 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing," he answers. "And that's his problem." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the most compliant conformists are those under peer pressure to be 
different, and surfers have always been dragged around by fashion currents -- 
even, perhaps, the one-tenth of 1% or so who have actually surfed 20-foot 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, readers should know better than to take the highbrow beach blather 
seriously. Sand has never been particularly fertile turf for the rigorous 
analysis of society. 
</P>
<P>
The beach is, however, a great place to forget modern reality and enjoy life. 
And Beach Culture makes up for its inability to articulate a post-adolescent 
world view with lots of blazing color and visual attitude that says it all. 
</P>
<P>
That the editorial content and advertising are a bit blurred together is part 
of the gestalt, Dude. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing in this premiere issue of this "seasonal bimonthly" (next one 
hits the stands in April) is a well-reproduced collection of art by artists who 
surf. Their mercifully brief commentary demonstrates that the beach life can be 
inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
So. If you forget all that brow-wrinkling stuff and let Beach Culture wash over 
you like a warm wave, if you absorb it like summer sunshine chances are you'll 
find it pleasant and invigorating. 
</P>

Abuzz Over a Monthly and Its Fall Premiere 
</P>
<P>
For several months now, there's been a buzz about an aspiring Los Angeles 
monthly called Buzz. 
</P>
<P>
Now the proposed magazine has named several of its columnists and it looks as 
if Buzz has actually moved beyond the realm of cocktail chatter. 
</P>
<P>
The launch is scheduled for October. 
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship to Los Angeles will be what the New Yorker was to New York 50 
years ago," publisher Susan Gates said last fall. "Bright and crisp, the voice 
of what's going on in the city." 
</P>
<P>
A magazine consultant and former circulation executive, Gates has been working 
on the project with co-principals Alan Mayer (editor) and Eden Collinsworth 
(president) at a five-acre spread on Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Although the magazine will hardly spurn gossip, it hopes to rise above the 
dirt-dishing connotation of its title, reflecting a buzz of the sort that makes 
up good conversation at a dinner party, Mayer said. 
</P>
<P>
But "rather than have professional journalists writing about what people are 
doing, we're going to have the people themselves write about what they're 
doing," Mayer said. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's monthly columns will be the exception to that rule. So far, Buzz 
has hired George Christy, who also writes for the Hollywood Reporter, to do a 
column called "Restaurants and Such." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate broker Cheryl Crane, best known as Lana Turner's daughter, will 
write a column called "Gimme Shelter," about real estate and "the way people 
live in Los Angeles and why." 
</P>
<P>
Other columnists named by Mayer include Mary Gwynn, who will contribute a 
parenting column titled "Oh Baby," and novelist Harlin Ellison, who will write 
a column titled "The Valley,"which he promises will "boil the blood, open the 
eyes and sting the soul." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defenders Make Pitch for Desert Protection 
</P>
<P>
For an unabashedly biased look at the controversial California Desert 
Protection Act, pick up a copy of the January/February Defenders magazine, 
which is published bimonthly by the Washington, D.C.-based organization 
Defenders of Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
The two main articles in this special issue -- Peter Steinhart's "Desert Hope, 
Desert Folly" and Elena Jarvis' "Rambo's Racers" -- reveal as much love for 
off-road vehicle enthusiasts and other desert despoilers as a road runner has 
for a rattler. 
</P>
<P>
The pictures in this issue speak even more forcefully than the well-crafted 
words. Coyotes, quail, golden eagles, mountain sheep and owls prowl beautiful 
desertscapes. But then cattle, Army tanks, motorcycles and bulldozers prowl 
similar scenes. 
</P>
<P>
(Defenders, c/o Defenders of Wildlife, 1244 19th St. N.W., Washington, D.C.

Prenuptial Contracts Boost Prying Business 
</P>
<P>
Donald and Ivana, take note: A prenuptial agreement may not be enough. 
According to the current issue of P.I. Magazine ("fact and fiction about the 
world of private investigators"), the number of premarital investigations 
conducted by private investigators has jumped 800% since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Potential spouses of either sex are apparently deciding that they have as much 
right as the government, insurance companies and credit agencies to pry into 
someone's past -- especially since they're going to be sharing a bed as well as 
a bank account with said person. 
</P>
<P>
"Our heart just doesn't control the brain like it once did," Ralph Thomas, 
director of the National Assn. of Investigation Specialists, tells the 
magazine. A complete background check can be done in about 24 to 48 hours with 
a price tag of a few hundred dollars to $1,000.

YOUR STAMPS: SHAKY ECONOMY OFTEN LEADS TO DEVALUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY KRAUSE, Krause, a free-lance writer and a member of several national 
stamp-collecting organizations 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: In a recent column, you used the word demonetized. I am an 
experienced collector, but I do not understand this term. Would you explain it? 
-- W.C.P. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Demonetization is the official governmental fiscal deprivation of the 
standard value of a medium of exchange. In common language, that means that 
money (or stamps) are no longer worth the face value that they had when issued. 
</P>
<P>
Shaky economies in some countries often lead to debasing or revaluing of the 
paper money. For instance, rampant inflation may make money practically 
worthless. So the government announces that 1,000 of its currency, say pesos, 
will henceforth be known as 1 "New Peso" and that, after a certain date, all 
the old currency that hasn't been exchanged for new money will no longer be 
honored. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States in the last century, our Post Office Department 
demonetized pre-Civil War stamps of the 1851 to 1860 designs so stamps then in 
the hands of Confederate postmasters couldn't be used in some way to disrupt 
the commerce of the Union states. Perhaps Southern spies might have infiltrated 
business houses in the North and sold them U.S. stamps at a discount (stamps 
that were sitting in Confederate post offices after secession), thereby 
depriving the Federal postal service of revenue. The beautifully engraved and 
quite valuable 1847 first issues (5-cent Franklin and 10-cent Washington, our 
first "General Issue" adhesive stamps) were similarly declared invalid for 
postage as of July 1, 1851, when the 1851 to 1860 definitive series began. It 
is still against the law to use a lot of pre-Civil War U.S. stamps for mailing 
letters, but for large-margined pristine specimens, if any can be found in 
1990, the philatelic and market value is astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
Q: As an insider in the stamp market, you must make a lot of money from stamp 
deals. Is it hard to establish the contacts that result in lucrative stamp 
investments? -- D.E. 
</P>
<P>
A: I break even on my stamp "deals." Some stamps I sell at a small profit, 
others I sell at a loss. I am not a stamp dealer, so I don't have to buy at 
rock-bottom prices and sell at comfortable profits to make a living from 
stamps. I teach and write for money. 
</P>
<P>
If it were that easy to get rich, we would all be millionaires. I know a lot 
about stamps after studying them and the stamp hobby/business for 30 years. But 
that doesn't enable me to see into the future, with all its unpredictables. 
</P>
<P>
Some people study the horses for a lifetime and still can't win consistently at 
the race track. Stock brokers know a lot about stocks, but they have to cater 
to customers at moderate buying/selling commissions because nobody knows for 
sure which stocks will double in price this year. In fact, "insiders" with 
extensive knowledge about a tradable commodity are the first to admit that it 
is tough to predict precisely anything in that business. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a few plate blocks of the 80-cent Hawaiian air mail from the 1950s. 
Are these worth something? -- R.W.E. 
</P>
<P>
A: About $20 each for an unhinged plate number margin block-of-four. Issued 
March 26, 1952, this reddish-violet, 80-cent U.S. air mail (Scott No. C46) was, 
according to some stories, produced specifically for paying the cost of sending 
orchids between Hawaii (which wasn't yet a state) and the U.S. mainland, 
because no normal air-mail rate required an 80-cent stamp then. The pretty 
stamp is ever-so-slowly increasing in value as the years go by. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is membership in national stamp societies expensive? And what are the 
benefits? -- P.R. 
</P>
<P>
A: For $21 (an admission fee of $3 plus annual dues of $18), you can join the 
largest philatelic society in the United States: American Philatelic Society, 
P.O. Box 8000, State College, Pa. 16803. Bank and credit references as well as 
two character references must be given on the application forms (send a 
stamped, self-addressed business-size envelope to the above address). Benefits 
include an impressive, 96-page monthly journal; low-cost stamp insurance; sales 
circuits; discounts on expertizing (guarantee) certificates, and news on 
upcoming stamp exhibitions and auctions. Probably 95% of the serious 
philatelists in the country are members of the APS. My membership dates from 
1976, and I've found the membership fees have more than paid for themselves 
many times over. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have some 19th-Century Egyptian stamps showing the Sphinx and a Pyramid. 
Are these rare? -- F.G. 
</P>
<P>
A: From 1867 until the early 20th Century, the "workhorse" stamp issues of 
Egypt were the Sphinx and Pyramid varieties. They range from a few cents each 
to hundreds of dollars apiece in current market value. Many varieties exist, 
such as different watermarks, thin and thick papers, perforation gauge changes 
and the like. Show your stamps to a dealer for a professional evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there a stamp club in the Fairfax-Wilshire area? I used to go to a club a 
long time ago and would like to get involved in stamp collecting again. -- R.W. 
</P>
<P>
A: Try the Collectors Club of Hollywood, which meets at the California Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn., 3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue, on the second Tuesday 
of each month at 8 p.m., according to my latest information from them. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you recommend as a sound stamp investment for the 1990s? I've been 
working on U.S. air mails and an album of Canadian plate blocks from 1930 to 
date. -- T.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: Ah, the future! Sometimes you have to wonder whether it is good or bad that 
we can't see the future with complete clarity. If differences of opinion make a 
horse race, then similar varying viewpoints make stamp investment an 
interesting speculation. 
</P>
<P>
My advice is to stick with the so-called "blue-chip" stamps, the ones with an 
established track record for steady price appreciation over the years. Early 
U.S. mint and used in extremely fine condition, costing more than $25 per 
stamp; complete sets of British Colonies; choice Western European definitives 
and souvenir sheets from before World War II; nice Asian covers, and 
19th-Century classics in multiples (more than one stamp in a "piece") or with 
unusually wide, well-balanced margins around the designs -- these are stamps 
that have been in demand and probably will always have buyers as long as there 
are philatelists in the world.

MOVIES: GENE HACKMAN, THE EVERYMAN WHO SEEMS TO ALWAYS WORK, IS BACK BEFORE THE 
CAMERAS IN SAN FRANCISCO, PLAYING A RUMPLED LAWYER IN 'CLASS ACTION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA ROSENTHAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the lights and camera are readjusted, Gene Hackman munches popcorn in a 
corner, amusing himself with a "Pacific Flyer" article about his new acrobatic 
plane. Nearby, the crew of "Class Action" are collecting on Super Bowl bets -- 
Hackman won $100. 
</P>
<P>
"We're rolling!" The playfulness stops abruptly, the set falls silent and 
Hackman, playing a rumpled balding lawyer on the side of the underdogs in a 
class-action suit against a car company, saunters into a board room of a 
prestigious San Francisco law firm where he faces his opponent in the case, a 
hard-edged lawyer in an Armani suit, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. 
</P>
<P>
With undisguised contempt, Mastrantonio snipes at Hackman then savagely 
cross-examines his witness, a man crippled by a defective car manufactured by 
her client. She's a corporate lawyer snarling at the 1960s-style people's 
advocate, but it's a relationship whose tension is heightened by the fact that 
the aggressive young attorney is her opponent's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
It's jungle warfare in this high-tech glass law suite 20 floors above the San 
Francisco morning mist and the bullets are words. Hackman picks up his tattered 
briefcase and British director Michael Apted yells "cut." Another perfect 
performance in only three takes. For Apted, it's an easy swing from his 
"Gorillas in the Mist" to lawyers in the mist. 
</P>
<P>
"Class Action" is ahead of schedule, but it had a shaky beginning back in 
October. The 7.1 quake hit as the preproduction crew was reading for shooting. 
"We thought it was all over for us," recalled Apted. "We spent 10 days 
frantically considering other cities." 
</P>
<P>
Hackman was in San Francisco, watching trials and researching his role. "I 
heard people screaming, then we all ran downstairs in panic," said Hackman, who 
was on the third floor of a shop when the temblor started. The production 
office was closed and Fox flew the preproduction crew back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the sets were affected. The fireplace in Hackman's woodsy Berkeley home 
collapsed and a Marina District apartment chosen as Mastrantonio's was declared 
unsafe. Books and glass were strewn over Hackman's law office, which belongs to 
J. Tony Serra, the attorney whose exploits inspired James Woods' character in 
"True Believer." 
</P>
<P>
After the earthquake, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, which had 
initially refused to grant permission to film key courtroom scenes in their 
stately Legislative Chamber in City Hall, gave in. After pressure from Mayor 
Art Agnos and some political squabbling, the supervisors voted 8 to 3 to let 
"Class Action" shoot. The film means about $3 million to the financially 
strapped city. Fox was wooed back. 
</P>
<P>
Crews went into action, using special "earthquake kits" to fix cracked plaster 
and to paint and install false facades at the battered City Hall. Whenever 
moody San Francisco fog failed to appear, special effects technicians brought 
out fans and smoke canisters. One day, they created such a thick fog outside 
Hackman's law office, a fire truck rushed to the scene, mistaking the billowing 
clouds for smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Apted, who started his career making documentaries, also happened to have a law 
degree from Oxford. He insisted that this film be accurate. During the last 10 
years, the bi-continental director has made his mark with such films as "Coal 
Miner's Daughter," "Gorky Park" and "Gorillas in the Mist." 
</P>
<P>
In "Class Action," he moves into an environment of ambition and high money 
stakes, where lawyers lie and conceal evidence to defend a corporation. "It's a 
junk-bond culture creating a junk society," Apted said. "A chilling aspect of 
life in America is that acquiring wealth and paying less taxes are more 
important than dealing with the nightmare of growing poverty and cities falling 
to pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Hackman, who has made more films in the last six years than any other American 
actor, said he can't remember how many lawyers he's played, but called this one 
his meatiest yet. "There are a lot of highly emotional, gut-wrenching scenes," 
he said. "I don't have to shoot anybody or ride in fast cars and best of all, 
Michael keeps the set calm, listens to what I have to say. He's very civilized, 
great to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Apted urged Hackman and Mastrantonio to watch Tony Serra deliver a 2 1/2-hour 
opening argument of a murder case. "My character," said Hackman, "is a similar 
kind of people's advocate -- very theatrical, powerful, impressive." 
Ironically, Hackman played a scene for Francis Coppola's 1973 "The 
Conversation" in Serra's law office. Like both Serra and his film character, 
Hackman is a liberal who proudly recalled making Nixon's notorious "Enemies 
List" because of his work for George McGovern. During filming he made two 
public service TV spots for charity and spent his 59th birthday teaching acting 
to kids in a San Francisco high school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rare to see a father-daughter relationship explored on film," said 
Hackman, who brought his two grown daughters and son to watch his tense 
courtroom scenes with Mastrantonio. "A conservative daughter raised by a very 
liberal father -- this is very fertile territory." 
</P>
<P>
Hackman talks with obvious wariness to reporters, but he loosens up when 
talking about his three stunt planes; he's been doing aerobatics as a hobby for 
12 years. "I just bought an Eagle, a two-seater plane. I wish I could fly more, 
but I can't when I'm in a picture because of insurance. You can't be a weekend 
acrobatic pilot . . . otherwise you will be an ex-acrobatic pilot." 
</P>
<P>
After he finishes his next film, "Dinosaurs," with Mikhail Baryshnikov in 
Berlin, Hackman said he's going to take a break and relax in his planes and in 
the race cars he often drives in celebrity events. On his days off here, he has 
been house-hunting. "I love it here," said Hackman. Since his 30-year marriage 
ended in 1986, he's been sharing his Santa Fe adobe with 29-year-old Betsy 
Arakawa, whom he met while she was working at a fitness center. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Goosen, Hackman's stand-in for his last nine movies, calls him "Everyman, 
a working man's actor." It's a term many critics have applied to him, as well, 
and Hackman winces when it's brought up. "I don't like being called Everyman -- 
that sounds like I'm not acting, that I'm not putting thought into my 
performance. It's hard work making the character look easy." 
</P>
<P>
It was an uneasy, long road to the screen for Hackman. A poor kid from 
Danville, Ill., his father abruptly left home when he was 13. The troubled 
adolescent lied about his age and joined the Marines at 16. During his five 
years in Asia, a stint as an Armed Forces radio announcer hooked him on acting. 
</P>
<P>
But it took years to make it to the screen. For the next decade he drifted 
around the United States working as a truck driver, soda jerk, doorman, shoe 
salesman, furniture salesman. He finally made it to the Pasadena Playhouse, 
only to find that he and "beatnik" pal Dustin Hoffman were considered least 
likely to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
He hitchhiked to New York, where he did menial jobs and talked his way into 
summer stock and bit parts for another decade. In 1967, Hackman finally earned 
enough money to support his wife and three kids, after Warren Beatty cast him 
as his older brother in "Bonnie and Clyde." His Academy Award nomination as 
Best Supporting Actor proved Pasadena Playhouse wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But it was his landmark performance in "The French Connection" that showed he 
was more than a character actor. As Popeye Doyle, the vulgar New York police 
detective, Hackman won the Oscar as Best Actor in 1971. Despite his new fame, 
an insecure Hackman did what he called "the poor-boy thing," working non-stop, 
making some forgettable films, buying and selling real estate, cars and planes. 
</P>
<P>
Suffering burn-out, Hackman quit acting in 1978 after "Superman," a time he 
remembers as "probably a mid-life crisis" -- he took to the cockpit, raced 
cars, and painted impressionist oils. He returned to acting two years later, 
discovering "there wasn't much else I was suited for."

ABT'S BIRTHDAY BASH HITS THE ROAD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The massive party took place last month at the Metropolitan Opera House in New 
York when American Ballet Theatre celebrated its 50th birthday. No one 
pretended that the event was coherent, but a lot of push-button sentimentalists 
enjoyed the glitzy rituals. 
</P>
<P>
This, after all, was a very big socio-aesthetic deal. A good seat cost $1,200. 
The on-stage guest list included such bona fide ballerinas as Alicia Alonso 
(dancing in the face of dotage), Carla Fracci, Gelsey Kirkland and Natalia 
Makarova. Agnes de Mille contributed a few testy words. Twyla Tharp made a 
surprise appearance shoving a delirious danseur out of her epochal "Push." 
</P>
<P>
Only one beloved body was conspicuously missing. It belonged to Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, who had abandoned his company in the wake of a major managerial 
imbroglio. 
</P>
<P>
Whether his self-imposed absence made the collective heart grow fonder became a 
moot point. Fernando Bujones, a rival matinee idol, provided compensation of 
sorts, returning to the fold from which he had been ousted. Moreover, one could 
find distraction in home movies, production numbers, nostalgia indulgences and 
orgies of self-congratulation. 
</P>
<P>
Had all gone as planned, Los Angeles would have caught up with some 
manifestation of the anniversary festivities this summer. The projected ABT 
engagement at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was canceled, however, when the 
Music Center failed to reconcile an unfortunate booking dispute with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Ergo, the version of the historic event mustered Tuesday night at the War 
Memorial Opera House provided California with its only exposure to the great 
balletic bash. As the ever-perverse fates would have it, alas, this Gala didn't 
turn out to be particularly gala. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco got the economy-size road-show version. The top ticket fetched a 
paltry $250. The only live guest in sight was Makarova, who, having finally 
hung up her toe shoes, rambled through some charming, ultra-affectionate 
anecdotes. Not incidentally, Bujones had been promised by Jane Hermann, the new 
executive director, but he didn't show. 
</P>
<P>
Each half of the three-hour would-be extravaganza began with a razzle-dazzle 
overture energetically conducted by Jack Everly. Then came tantalizing -- and 
frustrating -- collages of film clips. Some were ancient and some recent, some 
rare and some commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
The often fuzzy, nearly subliminal images on the screen flitted forward and 
backward in time, reducing significant art to stream-of-consciousness snippets. 
The musical pastiches on the sound track sometimes forced the protagonists to 
dance to the wrong tune. The uncredited, hyperbolic narration, voiced-over by 
Peter Donat, proved notable neither for good grammar nor for good taste. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to show time, the company mustered a little bit of this, and a 
tiny bit of that. The dancers plucked highlights from highlights, strung 
together in willy-nilly chaos. Place the accent on nilly. 
</P>
<P>
The viewer was allowed no sense of context. No continuity. No edification. No 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
Turning 50, American Ballet Theatre turned to a slick collection of variety 
acts. The tone was flashy, the pace fast, fast, fast. Here was another fancy 
installment in the annals of balletic vaudeville, conceived and directed by 
Michael Smuin. 
</P>
<P>
Finding specific things to savor in the hippety-hop jumble seemed akin to 
picking the peanuts out of a box of Cracker Jack. One's hands got sticky, yet 
the rewards -- beyond indigestion -- remained small. 
</P>
<P>
The company performed chunklets of 25 repertory items frantically, and often 
well. Although Baryshnikov's dancers may not command instantly compelling 
personalities, they are strong technicians and careful stylists. 
</P>
<P>
Amanda McKerrow, sympathetically supported by Kevin McKenzie, floated 
exquisitely through a moment from Antony Tudor's "The Leaves Are Fading." 
Alessandra Ferri, sensitively partnered by John Gardner, arched poignantly amid 
the "Lindenduft" of Eliot Feld's "At Midnight," and ignored a chronically 
off-pitch mezzo-soprano in the process. Susan Jaffe, nobly seconded by Ricardo 
Bustamante, exuded lyric refinement as the White Swan. 
</P>
<P>
Johan Renvall glittered as the Bronze Idol of "La Bayadere." Julio Bocca 
gobbled space ferociously as Solor, and Cynthia Harvey breathed refinement as 
his Gamzatti. Martine van Hamel defined Petipa grandeur as Raymonda. Cynthia 
Gregory, the obvious audience favorite, sustained the poetic balances of the 
Rose Adagio even better in the flesh than she had on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
No one, unfortunately, had a chance to establish a serious interpretive 
statement. There was no time to set, much less develop, a specific mood. 
Everything and everyone passed in a pretty blink. 
</P>
<P>
The choreography of "La Sylphide" melted into "Giselle," which blurred into 
"The Sleeping Beauty." Tudor got scrambled, Baryshnikov got slighted, and, 
inexplicably, Clark Tippet got snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, Smuin &amp; Co. trivialized Balanchine's "Theme and Variations," 
transforming the elegant finale into a motley costume parade. This act of 
violence heralded the arrival of tinsel streamers, balloons and curtain calls 
for the anonymous administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The applause wasn't deafening.

HOLLYWOOD SPOOF SINKS UNDER SILLINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone paying attention to the smaller-theater scene this time last year had to 
be heartened by all the good work going on. A wave of intelligence and energy 
splashed across town; with such good news, the death of Waiver wouldn't mean 
much. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, and a wave of the sillies has come down upon us. Even a usually 
reliable group like L.A. Theatre Unit, which has produced such work as 
"Andrea's Got Two Boyfriends" and "The White Death," has come up with some 
silly antics posing as a play, "Tiger Treadwell Takes Tinseltown." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Steve Itkin's production at the new but user-unfriendly Ventura 
Court Theatre certainly doesn't serve John Susman's Hollywood spoof very well. 
The only way to save Susman's string of ludicrous comic scenes and plot points 
is to play it over the top -- but with style. Itkin's style is like a badly 
drawn cartoon, with the ham-fisted support of David Andrade's slide projections 
and Marc I. Rosenthal's lights. 
</P>
<P>
We won't reveal Susman's narrative trick that begins and ends the Tinseltown 
conquest of Tiger (Karl Wiedergott), but it plays on Edward G. Robinson prison 
movies and "The Wizard of Oz." Tiger's rapid rise to the top -- imagine a rock 
'n' roll Sammy Glick, fond of dining at Morton's -- involves an agent who plays 
tennis with his phone headset on (David Wells), an ex-hooker (Laura Summer) and 
two Arab money men (Daniel Mahar and Charles Dayton). 
</P>
<P>
In the early stages, Susman's ear isn't so out of whack that we can't accept 
his show-biz cliches. And for admirers of Howard Korder's brilliant comic 
thriller of movie- and dream-making ambition, "Search and Destroy," Susman's 
"Tiger" has some pleasing echoes. 
</P>
<P>
It all goes downhill frighteningly fast. Tiger wants to make a teen-age-alien 
love story. Dayton's Amir loves it, but sees it as a sailing picture (he has 
this thing for boats). Yet the financing Arab country wants the flick shot 
entirely within its borders. Solution: Build a huge lake in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Someone should have stopped things right there, when this comedy goes over the 
side into pure dumb nonsense. More business with slave-labor on location, and 
distribution deals, and Cannes yacht parties, and so on, fill out the rest of 
the play. But that's all it is: filler. Susman's people are vacuously 
low-calorie. 
</P>
<P>
Another cast -- perhaps the Actors' Gang -- might be able to turn this into a 
bold cartoon. But only Wells has enough of a quirky personal touch to turn his 
character into more than a familiar stereotype. Tiger, at least, isn't a 
stereotype, but Wiedergott brings nothing original to a part wide open to a 
creative actor's impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12417 Ventura Court, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., until March 25. 
Tickets: $12-$14; (213) 466-1767.

TANDY BEAL AND COMPANY IN CSLA DANCE SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From mere nothings to a dance of metaphoric implication, Tandy Beal and Company 
triumphed in a seven-part program Tuesday at the State Playhouse at Cal State 
L.A., second in a new dance series at the university. 
</P>
<P>
In her lightweight solo "Figure of Speech," the Santa Cruz-based Beal made 
several not-so-false starts, took audience members into her confidence and 
challenged them to consider various ways of continuing the work, and ultimately 
made a dance about making a dance. Modest but engaging. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the scale was her "Dust to Dust" (music by Jon Scoville), 
in which five dancers evoked universal games and struggles, became icons of 
Eastern religions, metamorphosed into everyday figures; then begin the cycle 
anew, only to vanish into luminous pillars of sand streaming down from the top 
of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Before that stunning ending, Beal managed another theatrical coup: two screens 
upon which projected slides of the dancers were slowly peeled open, allowing 
the images to pass through to a scrim at the back of the stage, while, one by 
one, the living figures moved through seams in the screen onto the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The multiplicity of images, the juxtapositions of fixed art and living humanity 
suggested the reciprocal processes by which life and art are transformed and 
informed by one another. 
</P>
<P>
Beal's four-part solo "Everything Is True but Desire" (substituted, because of 
technical problems, for "Mysterious Barricades") traced a woman's excursions 
into experience -- the rebuffs she encounters, her stylized rituals of defense 
and her final ambiguous triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
"Little Kings," a satirical group piece, mocked pretentions and power plays and 
ended with the six puffed-up egos being deflated like plums dried into prunes. 
</P>
<P>
Four familiar works completed the program: "Creation du Monde," Beal's genial 
company vignette, winding back from a sophisticated ballroom scene to an 
animal-romp Garden of Eden; "Neither Darkness nor Science," a playful, eerie 
shadow duet for Beal and Ellen Sevy, and two excerpts from "The Time Falling 
Bodies Take to Light" -- a men's gymnastic duet (danced strongly by Erik Stern 
and Ken Williams) and Beal's superb weightless, feathery solo. CHRIS PASLES

BOSTON CAMERATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The point of the Boston Camerata's "Sacred Bridge" program is simple enough in 
theory, complex in practice -- the interrelationship of medieval Jewish and 
Christian music. Director Joel Cohen and five other early music heroes of the 
Camerata made this potentially dry subject live through fluent, stylistically 
persuasive music-making Tuesday evening at the Sephardic Temple Tifereth 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The Bostonians were repeating the program with which they made their local 
debut in 1985. Cohen provided some humorous verbal annotation, but largely let 
the music deliver its own message through pointed program juxtapositions. 
</P>
<P>
The entire second half of the agenda matched songs from the Sephardic oral 
tradition with some of the Cantigas de Sancta Maria collected by Alfonso el 
Sabio in the 13th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The program began similarly, with sets that included a performance alternating 
the Latin and Hebrew versions of the same Psalm tone. This monophonic repertory 
was presented simply, but with remarkable vocal grace and clarity. 
</P>
<P>
A set devoted to Jewish minstrels culminated in another bit of early music 
kitsch, based on a comically boastful autobiographical poem by one Yitzhak 
Gorni. 
</P>
<P>
Selections from the 18th-Century repertory of the Jewish community in 
Carpentras, some of it based on familiar Baroque airs such as "La Folia," were 
the only ventures outside the Medieval-traditional bounds. These pieces 
featured the bright, supple singing of soprano Anne Azema, and allowed Carol 
Lewis -- otherwise confined to droning vielle accompaniment -- some difficult 
solo gamba opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the ensemble were the busy singer-lutenist-harpist John 
Fleagle, his warm, focused baritone particularly effective in Mathieu le Juif's 
"Par grant franchise;" clarion countertenor Michael Collver, who also played 
percussion and contributed a cornett solo to the Cantigas set; and under-used 
flute and recorder virtuoso Jesse Lepkoff. Cohen himself sang reedily and 
played lutes. JOHN HENKEN

SOME ARTISTS FEELING LEFT OUT OF SEPTEMBER'S L.A. FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: HUNDREDS OF ARTISTS AND PERFORMING GROUPS WHO APPLIED WERE REJECTED. 
OBSTACLES TO THEIR PARTICIPATION IN A CONNECTED FESTIVAL INCLUDE A LACK OF 
FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A week after the Los Angeles Festival made its first announcement of programing 
for the Sept. 1-17 arts festival, many of the more than 600 artists and 
performing groups who had applied but were not included are undecided as to 
whether to take part in the connected Open Festival, which offers no financial 
subsidies for artists. 
</P>
<P>
In making such decisions, artists contacted this week said that they faced 
several obstacles, including lack of funding, not enough time to find venues, a 
lack of information from festival planners and inability to compete with 
curated events for audiences once the festival rolls around next fall. Some 
said that they had already decided not to participate. 
</P>
<P>
"I had applied for the L.A. Festival and hoped to be included, but I don't 
think I will do the Open Festival at all," said Francisco Martinez, whose 
10-member Francisco Martinez Dance Theater is in residence at East Los Angeles' 
Plaza de la Raza. "I don't think I would be able to gather any kind of audience 
because there will already be so much going on in terms of dance." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such obstacles, however, Open Festival coordinator Aaron Paley, who 
also ran the Open Festival's precursor, the 1987 Fringe Festival, said that he 
expects about 500 artists and groups totaling about 10,000 individuals to 
participate (about the same number involved in 1987, when 450 events were 
produced). Any and all artists are welcome, but all will have to produce their 
events themselves. Paley hopes, however, that the Open Festival's guidance may 
make the difference for artists who wouldn't be able to do so otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"Our responsibility is to ease those burdens of production as much as we can," 
said Paley, adding that the Open Festival's $260,000 budget will be used to 
promote and provide publicity for all Open Festival activities and to hold 
workshops dealing with production aspects such as ticketing and finding a 
venue. 
</P>
<P>
The Open Festival is also producing a how-to manual, "Doing it Right in L.A.: 
Self-Producing for the Performing Artist," and a list of about 900 venues in 
Los Angeles County ranging from churches and community centers to traditional 
theaters and museums. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, L.A. Festival Executive Director Judith Luther has said that some 
Open Festival programs may be selected to appear on the same stages as curated 
programs, and thus would receive free use of the stage and some technical 
support. Paley said that details for such arrangements were still up in the 
air, however, because matters such as who would insure those Open Festival 
artists had not been determined. But, Paley added, a main activity of the Open 
Festival staff is networking with venues throughout the city to find spaces in 
which artists can present their works for reduced costs. 
</P>
<P>
With only a little more than six months to go, most artists contacted had not 
yet decided whether to be part of the Open Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City-based contemporary composer Paul Des Marais is in the position of 
many artists contacted this week. He had hoped to present his "Two Fables," a 
moveable theater piece featuring a narrator and three musicians, in the curated 
portion of the festival. He is interested in the Open Festival, but doesn't 
know much about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I received a letter that was so complicated and baroque that I didn't quite 
know what it meant, but I think it was a rejection notice (from the L.A. 
Festival)," he said. "I'm still interested in the Open Festival, but I don't 
quite know how to move from here. I thought I would get a little more 
information and recommendations (from Festival organizers) on what to do." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Paley said he and his staff (which includes five paid people and 
six interns) produce a monthly newsletter that is sent out to more than 700 
artists who have expressed interest in the Open Festival. In addition, they 
speak in depth with more than two dozen artists a day, both by phone and in 
person. And an average of 15 additional "intent to participate forms" arrive 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
Of those already familiar with the concept of the Open Festival, many said 
their participation is contingent on receiving funding from sources such as the 
city's Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be at least $7,000 for me to produce my piece (for a weekend 
run) and I don't think I can do it if I don't get the funding," said 
dancer/choreographer Donna Sternberg, who has applied for a $10,000 grant 
through the Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts and hopes to collaborate with a 
composer, singer and other dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Also waiting to hear about Cultural Affairs grants is Santa Monica-based 
performance artist Sharon Kagan, who is working on a large-scale piece 
involving about 25 performers, called "As I Recall." 
</P>
<P>
"If I can get the funding in time, I would like to do it," Kagan said, noting 
it would cost about $15,000 to produce the piece. "But right now I'm really up 
in the air." 
</P>
<P>
According to Al Nodal, general manager of the Cultural Affairs Department, Open 
Festival projects will be given some priority when the more than $2 million in 
grants is awarded July 1, but they will not take precedence over other 
priorities, including artists with special needs, such as minorities and the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
"The Open Festival is one of many (priorities)," said Nodal, noting that 
Cultural Affairs had already given grants of $150,000 to the L.A. Festival and 
$10,000 to the Open Festival. "We want to support the Open Festival and we've 
encouraged people to apply, but we can't limit all our funding to things going 
to the Open Festival. . . . We have not set a specific amount aside (for the 
Open Festival)." 
</P>
<P>
Funding is not the artists' only concern, however. Some worry that the time is 
too short to prepare works for the festival. Such is the case with 
writer/director Teresa Chavez, who has spent the past year working on her 
theater piece "L.A. Real," but still doesn't know if it will be ready by 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can get the funds for the work, then I'm considering being in the Open 
Festival," said Chavez, part of the collaborative theater group About 
Productions. "If it comes together by then, then great, but I'm not going to 
kill myself to get it ready in time for the festival." 
</P>
<P>
But while she said there is about a 50% chance that her piece, focusing on 
Mestizo history in Los Angeles, will be included in the Open Festival, Chavez 
added, "I don't really think I have time to find a venue -- unless something 
just pops up in the air -- because venues get booked up." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, "I'm not sure if it's worth being attached to the 
festival. Being in the Fringe Festival in 1987 did not attract a different or 
better audience. So unless you're in the larger (L.A.) festival, I'm not sure 
what kind of an audience you can get (in the Open Festival)." 
</P>
<P>
Taking a different view is performance/conceptual artist Elisha Shapiro. Like 
everybody else, he had hoped for funding from the Los Angeles Festival. But he 
said that lack of funding wouldn't stop him from producing his "Nihilism Expo 
90" during the Open Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do it one way or another; I've done things on no money before," said 
Shapiro, who said his "world's fair" will include interactive installations by 
artists including Jeffrey Vallance and Michael McMillan and performance pieces 
by artists such as Linda Albertano 
</P>
<P>
Also set on being in the Open Festival is Burbank-based performance artist 
Deborah Marsh, who didn't find out about the L.A. Festival until it was too 
late to apply, but decided about a month ago to be in the Open Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of the (Open) Festival goes back to the grass root arts, when art was 
performed just for the love of the craft. So much of the art now is commercial, 
but here are a bunch of artists saying, 'Hey, I love my craft. I love my art.' 
That's what makes me want to be in this festival -- my love for my art." 
</P>
<P>
Marsh is now looking for a venue in which she can produce her one-woman show, 
"The Final Mission of Mother Jones," which she has been touring since 1986. She 
says she may not have time left to find a traditional house, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be a little tight," said Marsh. "But if I can't get into a theater, I 
might end up doing it at one of the community centers or libraries, just to put 
it on for the festival." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who have decided to join the Open Festival had already planned to 
present works independently, so foresee no problems with their participation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if our work fits in with the standard 'festival' work, but we 
want to be under the umbrella of the thing," said Lenore Carlson, who is 
working with director Lisa James in developing "Palladium is Moving," a theater 
piece that Carlson plans to open in the Spring. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be open long before the festival, but if we close down for any reason in 
the summer, we want to reopen in September. We just want to be a part of it," 
said Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
Still another view was that of dancer/choreographer Naomi Goldberg, who 
participated in the Fringe Festival but has decided not to present work this 
time around. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, really, I'd just like to have the time to go and see stuff 
during that time. The stuff they're bringing is wonderful, and I really want to 
see it, but when you're involved in a production, that's really hard. So I 
think this time it might be good just to be a nice attendee." 
</P>
<P>
Said Open Festival coordinator Paley: "Not everybody has to be in the festival. 
It's important that people consider the context, and the factor that there will 
be a lot of competition for audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're helping people look at ways of cutting costs so they can be in the 
festival. Ways like being a better producer, sharing costs, finding venues at 
less cost, and maybe even scaling down expectations. These things are just as 
important as getting grants." 
</P>
<P>
However, noted Paley: "People have to get in gear. There is definitely a 
critical time frame here." 
</P>
<P>
The deadline to register for the Open Festival is the end of May, and Paley 
said he hopes to compile a final list of events by July. He urges those 
interested in information about the Open Festival or who need help finding a 
venue to call his office at (213) 315-9444.

NORTHWEST VALLEY CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
North Valley League 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Manny Alvarado, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 22-7; 1st in league at 12-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Kennedy won its third City Section 4-A Division title of the 
decade last season behind a group of talented seniors. The band included City 
MVP Gino Tagliaferri, All-Valley infielder Mike Murray and three-year starter 
Pat DeBoer. Yet, even with those standouts in the lineup, All-City junior 
Garret Anderson batted cleanup -- and did he mop up statistically. Anderson, 
who bats left-handed and plays in the outfield, hit .362 with five home runs 
and 31 runs batted in. He led area juniors in RBIs in City play. Anderson is 
not the lone threat, however. Catcher Lazaro Campos, who hit .367, is back for 
his third season of varsity play and will bat cleanup behind Anderson. Troy 
Bourne, a reserve last year, will start at first. James Bernas, an all-league 
member of the junior varsity, will start at second. Either Billy Ramirez or 
Rich Trujillo will fill Tagliaferri's slot at short. Palmer Drain, used as a 
designated-hitter last year, starts at third. Ben Guzman, Jason Rosen, Mitchell 
Drain and Birmingham transfer Jack Moussa (.266, nine RBIs) are in a fight for 
the remaining outfield berths. The pitching corps has been through it all 
before. Left-hander Denny Sharp (7-2, 3.75 earned-run average, 108 strikeouts 
in 84 innings) might possess the best curveball in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Junior right-hander Cody Beaumaster (4-1, 2.13 ERA) is the No. 2 starter. 
However, Sharp (67 walks) and Beaumaster (15 walks in 19 2/3 innings) will need 
better control if the Golden Cougars want to make it two titles in a row. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "Last year at this time pitching was our big question mark," Alvarado 
said. "Now that seems to be one of our strengths." Last year's strength was the 
infield. That also has changed. "It's one of the strongest outfield teams I've 
ever been associated with," Alvarado said. "As long as we can catch it and 
throw it, we'll be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Steve Marden, 14th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 16-7-1; 2nd in league at 10-5-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: If San Fernando makes a run at Kennedy for the league title, 
it will be behind the strength of its pitching staff. John Najar, a utility 
player last season as a junior, has been converted into a pitcher and Marden is 
pleased with what he sees. "He could be the most dominant pitcher I've seen all 
winter," Marden said. Hector De La Cruz, a three-year letterman, returns for 
his senior year. De La Cruz (6-1, 3.42 ERA, 58 strikeouts in 58 1/3 innings), a 
left-hander, included among his victories an upset of Chatsworth on the road. 
Left-hander Canto Franco, the junior varsity league MVP last year, and 
sophomore right-hander Rick Savala are also in the running for a place in the 
rotation. "With a lefty and righty in the starting rotation and a lefty and 
righty in the bullpen, we look real strong with our pitching," Marden said. Two 
starting position players return: third baseman Richard (Shorty) Sanchez and 
outfielder Octavio Serrano. Fernando Ortega and Roy Aguilera, reserves last 
year, are among a large group fighting for outfield berths. Marden's biggest 
discovery could be shortstop Luis Rodriguez, a switch-hitting sophomore. 
Rodriguez follows in the footsteps of All-City shortstops Bobby Corrales (1989) 
and Albert Torrez (1988). "He's going to be better than both of them before 
he's through," Marden predicted. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The 1990 Tigers are similar to their predecessors in almost every 
respect, Marden said, and status quo is fine with him. "The key for us is to do 
what we do well -- put the ball in play, have solid pitching and play good 
defense," Marden said. "We play for one run an inning." Where do they rate? "We 
may not be as strong as some teams we've had in terms of returning starters," 
he said. "But nobody else does, either, except maybe for El Camino (Real)." 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Darryl Stroh, 21st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 4-16; 4th in league at 1-15 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Last season, Stroh's 20th as coach, was the worst in his 
tenure, a career that includes five 4-A City titles. Are his players intent on 
proving that 1989 was a fluke? Stroh says he doesn't know, and for good reason. 
"We haven't spent any time talking about last year," he said. Based on the 
early returns, '89 might have been an anomaly. The Highlanders won seven of 
eight games in winter-league play, Stroh said, and have been opening some eyes 
-- namely his own. "I've been pleasantly surprised," he said. Right-hander Gabe 
Miller returns as does left-hander Mike Komsky. Another familiar face will 
brace the pitching staff -- football quarterback Bryan Martin. The younger 
brothers of two former Highlander standouts will play at first. Josh Leach, 
whose brother Jeremy played football and baseball, will see time at first along 
with Robert Fowble, whose brother Greg also was a two-sport player. Second base 
will be manned by either Todd Williams or Darryl Stroh Jr. Shortstop Jon 
Condos, a returning starter, "has looked outstanding," Stroh said. Gabe Padilla 
or Derrick Cole will start at third. The outfield likely will consist of 
Martin, Alex Vasquez and Eric Anderson. Scott Berger, the lone sophomore on the 
team, also might play in the outfield. Andy Petroski, a kicker on the football 
team, is the catcher. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Stroh says the team strength is undeniably its defense, "but it'll all 
boil down to the pitching," he said. The team's superlative performance in 
winter ball has left Stroh guardedly optimistic. "We won seven of eight and we 
played well," he said, "but we won something like three out of four last year 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Rich Raymond, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-12-1; 3rd in league at 5-10-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: With the exception of returning All-City outfielder Pat 
Bryant, the Cavaliers' strength also appears to be on the pitching rubber. A 
pair of right-handers, Bobby Macias (5-11, 175) and Bobby McRae (6-5, 175), are 
the likely starters. McRae, who starts on the basketball team and will be a 
late arrival, was 2-5 with a 3.26 ERA last year. Sophomores Mike Petruzates, 
Robert Rundquist and Mario Macias, Bobby's brother, also will pitch. 
Right-hander Steve Pressler is a possible relief specialist. Petruzates and 
McRae will alternate at first when not pitching. Sophomore Julio Marcial will 
start at second and David Sipolla -- who batted a team-high .465 last year on 
the junior varsity -- will play shortstop. Mike Sutyak, a junior, is the third 
baseman. Macias and Petruzates are probable starters in the outfield. Bryant, a 
senior who will start in center and bat first, hit .464 and stole 21 bases last 
year. Both marks ranked first among returning area City players. He also drove 
in 14 runs and recorded team highs in doubles (five) and home runs (four). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Raymond coached the Cleveland junior varsity last year, so he is 
familiar with the many youngsters who populate the Cavs' roster. He knows their 
strengths, their limitations. "Our sophomores are highly skilled," he said. 
"Some have played for those world championship teams in Encino . . . but we're 
awful green and young." If the pitching comes through as expected and the 
defense holds up -- a couple of big ifs -- Cleveland might well knock off some 
of the 4-A title contenders. 
</P>
<P>
West Valley League 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Maio, 8th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-8; 3rd in league at 9-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: First things first. Maio wants everyone to be aware of one 
thing: "I'm trying very hard to keep American Legion and El Camino baseball 
separate." It might be a tall order. The Woodland Hills West Legion team won 
the World Series title in August, and the majority of its players were from El 
Camino Real. Included on the West team were Ryan McGuire (first base), Pat 
Treend (pitcher), Jason Cohen (left field), Bobby Kim (catcher), Jeff Marks 
(right field), Greg Lederman (third base), Chris Castillo (outfield), Gregg 
Sheren (infield), Chris Teich (infield) and Sean Boldt (pitcher). Of the group, 
five were regulars. And if that's not enough, Herman Merchan (utility), who 
excelled at St. Genevieve High and on the Panorama City Legion team, 
transferred to El Camino Real over the summer. Seeking places on the pitching 
staff are Corey Bromberg, Daniel Costa, Terry Morrow and Josh Massey. Maio's 
toughest sell? "I really believe that there are 15 teams in the Valley that can 
beat us. . . . The notoriety they received doesn't mean a thing now." Boldt, a 
junior transfer from Canyon, might be a key. McGuire, a hard-throwing 
left-hander, was effective during Legion play in late relief and would make an 
ideal closer. If Boldt falters, however, the UCLA-bound McGuire might be used 
in the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: This team has been tabbed by many -- including most of the coaches in 
the conference -- as the one to beat. Maio bristles at the thought. "Look at 
all the No. 1 teams who lose. Granada Hills in football, Chatsworth was ranked 
No. 1 in the nation (in baseball) by USA Today a couple of years ago and they 
didn't win it, USC lost to Northridge (in baseball)," he said. Are the players 
responding? "I think they're listening. I think I've made an impression." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tom Meusborn, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 21-7; 1st in league at 12-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: One of the most successful programs in the state, Chatsworth 
has won or shared nine consecutive league titles. The good news for Meusborn is 
that Chatsworth isn't favored to win the title this season. "It doesn't make 
that much difference to me," he said. "We're going to play them game to game, 
week to week. It won't make me happy to read that we're favored to win and it 
won't make me mad if we're not favored." Right-hander Reed McMackin, part of 
the Chancellors' starting rotation a year ago, returns after posting an 8-2 
record with a 4.02 ERA. Left-hander Danny Rodriguez, a standout on the junior 
varsity last year, is the probable No. 2 starter. Mitch Root, who will start in 
center field, will be the closer. Soly Maya (first base), Nestor Martinez 
(second), Tommy Lee (shortstop) and Adam Pearlman (third) all played for the 
junior varsity in 1989. Outfielder Rodney Bloom and catcher Mike Mancuso are 
returning lettermen. Scott Carpenter is scheduled to play in right. "When you 
look at the roster, you see we have 11 seniors," Meusborn said. "We're older 
than most teams, but experience-wise, we're sort of green." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I think we have some good pitching," Meusborn said. "With Rodriguez 
and McMackin, we'll be in pretty good shape." Chatsworth is strong up the 
middle with Mancuso, Martinez, Lee and Root. But there is a preponderance of 
new names. Derek Wallace, Eric Johnson, Jason Evans and Rich Aude -- all of 
whom were both drafted and received scholarship offers -- have graduated. 
Perhaps Meusborn will soon find out the true strength of the Chatsworth 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Taft 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Rich McKeon, 3rd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 16-11; 2nd in league at 11-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: McKeon is left to sort through what remains of a 
senior-dominated team that a year ago gave Chatsworth a run for the league 
title. Returning starters include Benji Belfield, a shortstop-relief pitcher 
who had three saves and was 4-3 with a 4.94 ERA. Belfield also ranked among the 
team's offensive leaders with seven extra-base hits and 15 RBIs. Brett Reisner 
(.246, 10 RBIs) returns in the outfield. Jamie Zeichick, a reserve last season 
after having off-season shoulder surgery, will start in the outfield and bat 
fourth. The pitching staff is deep but untested. Battling for starting berths 
are senior left-hander Ryan Revel, sophomore left-hander Cory Jacobson, junior 
right-hander Eddie Soto and sophomore right-handers Sean Collins and Michael 
Krasner. Carey Wilbur, a varsity reserve last season as a junior, will start at 
catcher. Sophomore John Erganian will play first base, freshman Warren Stewart 
and sophomore Matt Allison are battling it out at second, and freshman Brandon 
Witkow and Krasner are doing likewise at third. Darnell Hendricks, a speedy 
junior, will start in right. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I'm hoping that we'll have a combination of leadership and youth," 
McKeon said. McKeon also might have to rely on team speed to manufacture runs 
if the offense falters, a possibility given the experience of the team. "We 
probably have the quickest outfield around," he said. "We may rely on team 
speed in the top of the order." The team has more pitching depth than in the 
past, but experience is nil. Only Belfield has pitched at the varsity level. 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jim Smith, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 3-13; 4th in league at 3-13 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Smith is frank about the Hunters' chances. "We've basically 
got no pitching," he said. Senior left-hander Doug Van Horn, ineligible last 
season, is the only player certain to see time on the mound. Ineligibility has 
ravaged the team. "We have 11, maybe 12 kids out," he said. "We lost five kids 
to grades." Mike Bruce, a returning starter, will catch. "He has a real good 
arm," Smith said, which makes Bruce a possible pitching candidate. Returning 
lettermen Curt Sazzman and Valentine Douglas are waging a war for the nod at 
shortstop; the loser will play elsewhere in the infield. Doug Kreider, a 
returning starter, will play at third. Mike Lewis returns in the outfield. Greg 
Hurst also will play in the outfield. Leo Roldan is a possible starter at 
second, and Scott Blemker and Van Horn are expected to split time at first. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "The only thing we did decent in winter league was field the ball," 
Smith said. "We faced some pretty weak pitching and didn't do too well against 
that." Prospects don't look good, but Smith remains upbeat. "We'll have fun," 
he said. "But I think it's going to be a long year." 
</P>
<P>
VALLEY PAC-8 CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
Mid-Valley League 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Wayne Sink, 26th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 8-12; 3rd in league at 6-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: A team of vast experience appropriately will play for Sink in 
his 26th and final campaign as head coach. Nine returnees, headed by 
outfielders Bob Bookatz and Danny Larson, will be counted on for power. Bookatz 
batted .420 as a junior. Larson led City players in triples with six. Also 
coming back is senior infielder Justin Bass, who batted .343 in '89. The list 
of veterans also includes catchers Seth Rosenzweig and Marc Feder, pitchers 
Josh Brown and Jason Mansfield, probable leadoff hitter Ruben Flores and 
infielder-pitcher Matt Mowry. "It's a good nucleus to work with," Sink said. 
Players up from the junior varsity who will play key roles include first 
baseman Mike Belasco, first baseman-pitcher Noah Kirshbaum, left fielder Mike 
Malki and outfielder Adam Kallen. Brown and Kirshbaum are the right-handed 
starting pitchers and Mansfield is the lone left-handed starting pitcher. Mawry 
should pitch some short relief. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Sink is open in evaluating his swan song. "What we have is 
experience," he said. "And the rest is up to them. They could have a great 
season if they're motivated. But I can't go out there and hit that curveball." 
The primary goal, Sink says, is the playoffs. But he would like to build from 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Kevin Campbell, 5th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 11-11; 1st in league at 8-8 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Monroe begins this season with something most teams would 
love to have: a veteran pitcher. Sean Henson is a senior who ranked fourth 
among Valley-area City pitchers last season with a 2.08 earned-run average in 
64 innings. Henson also will play first base. Other returnees include shortstop 
and leadoff hitter John Langley, power-hitting outfielder Jeff Rubell and 
outfielder Jim Rose. Joining Henson in the rotation will be a pair of 
sophomores: Christian Ascencio, who doubles as a first baseman, and Adrian 
Loverich. "One of those two will have to be a starter," Campbell said. The rest 
of the lineup is solid. San Fernando transfer Mario Gonzalez is a junior left 
fielder with good speed. Seniors Fran Espinosa and Chad Majers will play second 
base and third base, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: With Henson, Monroe has a proven winner on the mound. "Obviously, 
right now the question would be who will be our No. 2 starter," Campbell said. 
Defensively, the coach likes what he sees. As far as run production, Campbell 
pegs that as a gray area. "We need to improve our offense," he said. "If we can 
get the ball in play, we'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bill Gordon, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-10; 2nd in league at 7-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The biggest news so far during Gordon's short stay at Van 
Nuys is, unfortunately, bad: Returning all-league senior shortstop Lorenzo 
Morales suffered pulled ligaments in his arm and is wearing a cast. "Hopefully, 
he'll return in three to four weeks," Gordon said. "I say hopefully. He's our 
best kid." In the meantime, Gordon looks to other returnees for leadership. 
Junior third baseman Hector Alvarenga is a letterman who will play shortstop 
until Morales returns. Seniors Martin Ramos (first base) and Carlos Gonzalez 
(outfield) also will start. The rest of the team is dominated by juniors, 
especially the pitching. The top two starters are 11th-graders Tony Gonzalez 
and Jayme Jimenez, a pair of "junk-ballers," according to Gordon. Morales, when 
he returns, will relieve. Juniors David Gomez and Jesus Enciso join Gonzalez in 
the outfield. Rare seniors in the lineup include second baseman Carlos 
Gutierrez and catcher Marcos Espino. A positive note for Gordon has been the 
emergence of sophomore Patrick Alvarado, who "is looking really good" at third 
base, according to Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Gordon is cautiously optimistic. "We want to be in every game," he 
said. "But our primary goal is the playoffs." While Morales is gone, Gordon 
will miss him like a soldier pining for home. In the meantime, Gordon looks 
ahead with a bright eye. "We've got to at least let them know that they've been 
in a ballgame," he said. "We have the makings of a pretty darn good team." 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Stone, 12th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 4-14; 4th in league at 1-14 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Stone is nearly positive that this year's team will fare 
better than last season's largely because of the emergence of steady -- albeit 
green -- pitching staff. A pair of sophomores -- Jesse Yeomans and Bebo 
Granello -- will start on the mound. Two football players -- Robert Reynoso and 
Mike McCarthy -- will provide relief. Reseda's run production will be aided by 
veterans, notably junior Louis Vanacore, who batted .460 to finish third in the 
Valley-area City batting race. He is joined by ex-football players Joe Tushnet, 
a shortstop-center fielder who will bat first and provide speed, and Tuti 
Rodriguez, a first baseman who will bat fourth. "I'm expecting those guys to be 
real solid .300 to .400 hitters," Stone said. The team's best player, according 
to Stone, is freshman David Barbares, a shortstop who won't join the team until 
he's academically eligible in 10 weeks. "He's gonna be a good one," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: One thing is for sure, according to Stone: "We're going to be a lot 
better than last year. Last year, we had no pitching. This year, we're in 
better shape. This year, we'll be there in the seventh inning." The big 
variable, the coach says, will be the Regents' run production. "It's a matter 
of offense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
East Valley League 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Gary Donatella, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 19-4; 1st in league at 14-2 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Sylmar lost three top pitchers from last season's City 
semifinalists but that shouldn't stop Donatella's team from again making noise. 
Leading the way is Joe Contreraz, a senior third baseman who batted .351 last 
season and was second among City area players in doubles with eight. Contreraz 
will team with junior pitcher-outfielder Dereck Orneles in the heart of the 
order. Orneles can run, swing the bat and pitch, according to Donatella. 
Joining Orneles on the mound will be junior James Encinas, the team's top 
pitcher. Seniors Gonzalo Hernandez and Danny Garcia also will pitch along with 
sophomore Jimmy Lemos. Leadoff hitter David Romero is a senior outfielder. 
UCLA-bound football player London Woodfin will provide power (he hit .343 last 
year) when he returns in early April from arthroscopic knee surgery. Shortstop 
Roberto Garcia is sure-handed. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Sylmar has the makings of another fine team. What this year's team 
lacks in quality pitching, Donatella said, it makes up for in quantity of 
reliable pitchers. "Pitching is the key," he said. Scoring runs should be 
little problem with Contreraz, Orneles and Woodfin. Said Donatella: "We're 
going to be around the top." 
</P>
<P>
Poly 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jerry Cord, 15th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-9; 3rd in league at 11-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Six returning lettermen join a group of talented young 
players, a mix that bodes well for the Parrots. Cord will look to senior 
right-hander David Giatti, whose strong junior season was cut short by arm 
trouble that still hounds him. In 46 innings, Giatti led Valley-area City 
pitchers with a 1.22 ERA. "He's been throwing," Cord said. "But who knows how 
he'll come back?" Joining Giatti in the rotation will be senior right-hander 
Eddie Castellanos, who doubles as a designated-hitter. "We're counting on those 
two to be mainstays," Cord said. Junior pitchers, including Rodrigo Dorame and 
Raul Torres, will get a chance to pitch. Other leading returnees are position 
players. Senior shortstop Gabe Chavez and junior outfielder Jonathan Campbell 
are powerful hitters. The top of the order includes second baseman Roy Lozano 
and leadoff hitter Will Molina, a center fielder. Much of the youth comes from 
the 1989 Encino Pony League World champions: sophomores Steve Chavez (catcher), 
Jesus Perez (outfielder) and Francisco Flores (first baseman). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Poly has a legitimate shot at the title, but much depends on Giatti's 
recovery. "We're not gonna make a lot of mistakes defensively," Cord said. "We 
can make contact and score runs. The pitching is the only question. Somebody 
has to step forward." 
</P>
<P>
Grant 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tom Lucero, 14th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 16-5; 2nd in league at 12-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Talk about youth: Grant has two returning lettermen, and one 
of them is still playing basketball. That leaves senior second baseman Steve 
Pelote as the team's lone returning starter when play gets under way. 
Accordingly, Pelote will be counted on for big things. He batted .368 and drove 
in 25 runs last season. The other returnee is pitcher Billy May, a reserve 
forward on the basketball team. Lucero's No. 1 pitcher will be junior 
right-hander Gary Rosoff. Junior soccer player Holvik Castro pitched well in 
last year's playoffs. More youth can be found in sophomore right-hander Tony 
Kuper, a transfer from Antelope Valley. The lineup is somewhat shrouded in 
mystery at this point. Senior catcher Steve Gordon, junior second baseman 
Brandon Long and junior outfielder Shane Williams figure to bid for attention. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The football and basketball teams already have won league titles, 
placing the onus on Lucero's group to follow suit. Lucero says that the goals 
are there -- "Obviously, we want to win the league title. We always shoot for 
that." -- but the bodies remain in question. "Having just two returners makes 
it difficult," he said. "It's not like the past where I could rely on a Rodney 
Beck or a Javier Delahoya. We're trying to find the right combinations. We're 
so young and so competitive. There's some enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Marty Biegel, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 3-13; 4th in league at 3-13 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The first name Biegel mentions when discussing the team uad 
is senior shortstop Eric Martinez. "He's got All-City potential," he said. 
Biegel also praises No. 3 hitter and football star Mike Lewis. Two pieces of 
the puzzle will not report until after the basketball season: first baseman 
Harry Marks and leadoff hitter-center fielder Duane Braxton. "Duane's my table 
setter," Biegel said. "He's got great speed and he's a great defensive 
outfielder." Biegel's top two pitchers are right-handers Sammy Ciaramarilo and 
Craig White, a junior varsity basketball player. The outfield contains good 
fielders in Nelson Pichardo and Ozzie Collins. Second baseman Carlos Olmos, an 
Orel Hershiser lookalike, according to Biegel, along with infielders Adrian 
Padilla and Charlie Lee will see playing time. Three are vying for the 
catcher's job: Steve Macias, Livan Cartaya and Ivan Guillermo. Jose Ortiz also 
could squeeze in some playing time for Biegel. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "We'll go as far as our pitching carries us," Biegel said. "We will 
score runs, that I know." And with Biegel, the ebullient New Yorker at the 
helm, there is no shortage of enthusiasm. "The kids have been absolutely 
beautiful in their accepting of a new guy on the block," he said. As for the 
league race? "We'll be competitive," the coach assured. 
</P>
<P>
NORTHERN CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
Northeastern League 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo Hills 
</P>
<P>
COACH: David Richard, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 12-12; 3rd in league at 9-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: For the first time, the Dons will have an on-campus baseball 
diamond. And despite having just one returning varsity player, Richard might 
have carved out a respectable team to play at the new facility too. "Whenever a 
new guy comes into a program, they always say it'll take a year," said Richard, 
20, a walk-on and former junior varsity coach at Marshall. "But I told the 
kids, 'Let's start now.' There's no reason to shine this year off." Pat 
Hernandez, who starts at third base, is the lone returning letterman, and he 
will be expected to anchor an infield of considerable inexperience. First 
baseman Stan Hessinger, second baseman Larry Gouger and shortstop Pat Eubanks 
all are sophomores. There are two sophomores in the outfield, Matt Ward and Ray 
Medina. Richard calls Ward, "the one to watch." Senior Jeff Martinez starts in 
left. The pitching staff, which Richard calls his main concern, consists of 
right-handed seniors Chad Runnels and Scott Boudreaux and junior right-hander 
John Bishop. "If we get the pitching taken care of, we'll be OK," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Verdugo Hills played well in a scrimmage against Van Nuys on Tuesday, 
which made Richard feel a lot better about the big picture. "We've come a long, 
long way," he said. "I'm really impressed with the work ethic. Everybody has a 
great attitude." Richard has successfully cleared the first hurdle -- 
recruiting key young players from the student body. Whether the older players 
can contribute in uncertain; last season, the junior varsity did not win a 
game.

CREDIT UNION OFFICIALS DENY BANK REGULATOR'S ALLEGATION OF PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Credit union executives Wednesday denied a federal banking regulator's 
contention that the nation's credit unions have "a lot of the symptoms that the 
S&amp;Ls had" before the recent wave of S&amp;L failures. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, a federal banking regulator, fired the latest salvo in the 
growing war between credit unions and bankers Tuesday when he told an American 
Bankers Assn. gathering that credit union executives aren't being truthful by 
claiming that their insurance fund is stronger than the insurance fund that 
covers savings accounts held by bank and S&amp;L customers. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution 
Trust Corp., also suggested that the fast-growing credit union industry is 
investing in areas in which it lacks expertise. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Stephens, president of San Diego-based Mission Federal Credit Union, which 
has 75,000 members, described Seidman's remarks as proof that bankers, and 
banking regulators "want to destroy us. They see us growing . . . with a 6% 
share of total consumer savings, and they want that business." 
</P>
<P>
Bankers have watched with envy during the past decade as credit unions became 
one of the nation's fastest-growing financial service sectors. Assets at the 
nation's 15,086 credit unions stood at $203 billion on Dec. 31, 1989, up from 
$64.2 billion in 1979. Membership has soared to 60.4 million, up from 41.4 
million in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Karbon, a spokesman for the Madison, Wis.-based Credit Union National 
Assn., on Wednesday agreed that credit unions have enjoyed dramatic growth. 
"That growth has been controlled growth and wise growth," Karbon said. "There's 
no reason to be worried about credit unions' health and safety." 
</P>
<P>
"Far more banks and S&amp;Ls than credit unions have closed in recent years," 
said Karbon, who predicted that the General Accounting Office and the U.S. 
Treasury will document the credit unions' financial strength in current 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Credit unions believe their growth is directly tied to the wave of expanded 
services that have been added to meet customer demand. Besides their 
traditional car loans, many credit unions now offer credit cards, checking and 
saving accounts, individual retirement accounts and home loans. Some offer 
loans to small business operations and others offer basic stock-brokerage 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Credit unions also point to customer satisfaction surveys that show credit 
union members to be extremely satisfied with how they are served by credit 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
But bankers view those expanded services as an encroachment on their 
traditional turf. They also maintain that credit unions enjoy an unfair 
competitive advantage through their long-standing exemption from paying federal 
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Credit unions have escaped unscathed when past congresses were eliminating tax 
exemptions. But Stephens and other credit union spokesmen acknowledged 
Wednesday that bankers will be pressing hard during the coming year to 
eliminate the tax exemption for credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
"Bankers have always been after our tax status, but we're a financial 
cooperative, and our earnings go back to our members, Stephens said. "So what 
do they want to tax? To us, it seems that they've pretty well busted up the 
S&amp;L industry, and now they want to take us apart." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their remarkable growth during the past decade, credit unions still 
play a relatively small role in the financial services industry. "Citicorp is 
larger than all the credit unions combined," Stephens said. "We're really not 
that big, with just 6% of personal savings." 
</P>
<P>
But, wary of bankers' intentions, credit unions are asking their 60.4 million 
members to let Congress know that "anything they do will be remembered during 
the next election," Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
Karbon expects more pressure during the next year to "streamline and 
consolidate the existing regulatory system" by combining the credit union's 
deposit insurance fund with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which last 
year absorbed the financially troubled Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Credit union industry executives will fight to retain their historical customer 
base, said Tena Lozano, a spokeswoman for the Pomona-based California Credit 
Union League. 
</P>
<P>
Credit unions have faithfully served "customers that banks weren't interested 
in" when federal legislators created the credit union industry during the 
1930s. "Now, suddenly, they're interested," Lozano said. 
</P>
<P>
But Stephens argues that increased market share isn't the only reason that 
bankers are attacking credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the only financial organizations with the chance of giving them a run 
for (consumers') money," Stephens said. "But banks have had tremendous losses. 
They have terrible problems with LBOs (leveraged buyouts) and foreign loans. 
They're trying to take the pressure off of themselves" by attacking credit 
unions.

GUGGENHEIM DEAL LEAVES PANZA'S CALIFORNIA ART IN PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York's Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation may have acquired the lion's share 
of Italian Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo's contemporary American art collection 
last weekend, but very little of his coveted California art was included in the 
arrangement, the count revealed in an interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I retain ownership of the largest part of the California art, about 80 works 
of Light and Space art plus some new work I acquired in the past two years," 
the indefatigable 67-year-old collector said from his New York hotel. "I have 
always been interested in having the part of my collection that includes 
California artists in California. I hope this will become true one day, but it 
is a question of finding the right sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"If a sponsor will pay for a building, I will make a gift for such a project to 
keep the works all together and have them in California." 
</P>
<P>
Former hopefuls who thought the Guggenheim purchase had made them also-rans 
brightened when apprised of this new twist. "I would never foreclose on such an 
idea," said County Art Museum Director Earl A. (Rusty) Powell. "I'm glad the 
door is still open." 
</P>
<P>
Museum of Contemporary Art Director Richard Koshalek said that if the 
California works remain available, he would like to "explore and discuss" their 
acquisition. In 1983, Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art purchased Panza's 
80-work Abstract Expressionist and classic Pop compendium for $11 million to 
form the core of its permanent collection. 
</P>
<P>
For the last decade, Powell, Koshalek and virtually every other museum director 
in California hoped to obtain Panza's collection of several hundred works of 
Minimalist and Conceptual art of the '60s and '70s. Widely praised as the 
finest private holding of its type, it was particularly attractive here because 
of heavy representation of so-called California Light and Space art. The style 
is regarded as among the most original in contemporary art and involved the 
talents of such innovators as Robert Irwin, James Turrell, Doug Wheeler, Eric 
Orr and Maria Nordman. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always personally regretted that this amazing holding has not found a 
home here," said Henry Hopkins, director of the Frederick R. Weisman Collection 
and former director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins thought he detected a shift in Panza's conditions. "He seems to have 
moved from a previous position where he wanted first a long-term loan followed 
by a purchase, to a new posture, where he is willing to make a gift in exchange 
for a building. I would still hope we could affect this as a possibility. The 
art program of the Santa Monica Art Commission or the expanded Newport Harbor 
Art Museum seem like possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Korn, who heads the Santa Monica Art Commission, confirmed that "during 
the past year or so," he and Panza discussed the possibility of installing the 
California works in a hangar-like building that would be constructed at the 
Santa Monica airport but termed the negotiations "speculative and 
inconclusive." 
</P>
<P>
Panza has held an extraordinarily large number of such discussions with museum 
professionals throughout Europe and America, displaying great zeal and idealism 
in regard to his collections. However, only one deal was actually cut prior to 
the Guggenheim arrangement, the sale to MOCA. According to one expert, those 
works are worth as much as $100 million today and are unavailable at any price. 
</P>
<P>
A consistent Panza profile emerges from accounts given by art administrators 
who have dealt with him. Ever polite, attentive and interested, he pursues 
negotiations to the point of practical action and then "it all just sort of 
evaporates," said one frustrated suitor who asked not to be named. "It's like 
punching taffy." 
</P>
<P>
Panza became a player on the Los Angeles scene when artist Robert Irwin 
introduced him to MOCA in 1981. Panza approached the county museum's receptive 
Powell in 1985. Talks snagged on Panza's insistence that his room-filling 
installation works be kept together and on view. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, realizing this was a physical impossibility for his museum, then put 
together an informal consortium of MOCA Director Richard Koshalek, Hugh Davies 
of the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art and Hopkins, who then directed the 
San Francisco museum. The idea was to forge an arrangement whereby Panza's 
works would rotate among the four museums with some prominently on view in each 
place. The proposal was never accepted or rejected by Panza. 
</P>
<P>
The Guggenheim agreement includes more than 300 works. About half the art, by 
such key figures as Brice Marden, Robert Ryman, Donald Judd and Richard Serra, 
will be purchased by the institution over six years for an unrevealed price 
believed to be in the tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Works that are physically movable will come to rest in the Guggenheim's 
spiraling Frank Lloyd Wright building on Fifth Avenue, but insiders are 
wondering how the museum will pay for the purchase and where it will house the 
work. Guggenheim Foundation director Thomas Krens did not return calls from The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of the acquisition will be a gift to the museum from Panza and will 
include the buildings and land of his estate in Varese, outside Milan. It 
houses many space-gobbling installations by the Californians and such other 
luminaries as Dan Flavin, Sol LeWitt and Walter de Maria. The estate will 
become a public museum operated through an endowment from the local Italian 
government and administered by the Guggenheim. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, which is known to have a longstanding interest in increasing 
its presence in Europe, has a museum in Venice, the Peggy Guggenheim 
Collection.

<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan testified in a videotaped deposition released 
today that he "never . . . had any inkling" that White House aides were 
secretly helping arm and advise the Nicaraguan Contras at a time when Congress 
had banned such aid. 
</P>
<P>
And he said, "No one has proven to me" that profits from secret arms sales to 
Iran were diverted to the rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government in 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan testified as a defense witness in the forthcoming Iran-Contra trial of 
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter. U.S. District Judge Harold 
Greene allowed the former President to give a videotaped deposition in Los 
Angeles last Friday and Saturday but barred reporters from attending. 
</P>
<P>
A transcript of that testimony was released today after Bush Administration 
officials said it did not pose any national security problems. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said he "assured everybody that we would have to abide by the law" 
during the congressional ban on Contra aid. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had any idea that a Poindexter aide, Oliver L. North, was giving 
the Contras military advice and logistical support, Reagan said: 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that I had never . . . had any inkling that we were guiding their 
strategy in any way." 
</P>
<P>
That statement came under cross-examination by Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter is scheduled to go to trial March 5 on charges of obstructing 
congressional inquiries into the sale of U.S. arms to Iran and covert 
Administration support for the Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan also testified under oath that he never authorized Poindexter to 
obstruct congressional inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair or to destroy 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
The former President said repeatedly under cross-examination by Webb that 
Poindexter never told Reagan that he planned to lie to Congress or to destroy 
documents sought by Iran-Contra probers. 
</P>
<P>
"At any time, did John Poindexter ever tell you that he had in fact obstructed 
or impeded any congressional committee inquiry into events relating to the 
Iran-Contra affair?" Webb asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," Reagan replied. 
</P>
<P>
"At any time, did he ever tell you that he had actually destroyed any records 
or documents related to the Iran-Contra affair?" Webb replied. 
</P>
<P>
"No," the former President said. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said he was never told that North had destroyed Iran-Contra documents, 
an act for which the former National Security Council aide was convicted of a 
felony last year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his dealings with North, Reagan said: "I didn't ever have any 
extensive contact with him. I heard about him a great deal and reports on him 
and so forth." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan acknowledged that he supported the solicitation of donations from 
foreign governments and others who could help finance the Contra effort. 
</P>
<P>
Although the law banned direct U.S. military aid to the rebels, Reagan said, 
"there wasn't any restriction on . . . informing others as to how they could 
help, things of that kind. And that I did approve." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan also testified that he wasn't aware that money was being diverted from 
the Iran arms sales to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"I was only aware finally that we got our 12-million-2," Reagan said, referring 
to the $12.2 million the U.S. government received for providing weapons to 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"May I simply point out that I had no knowledge then or now that there had been 
a diversion, and I never used the term," the former President said. "And all I 
knew was that there was some money that came from some place in another 
account, and that the appearance was that it might have been part of the 
negotiated sale." 
</P>
<P>
Webb asked: "To the extent that there was in fact a diversion of proceeds, did 
you in any way approve or authorize that while you were President of the United 
States?" 
</P>
<P>
"For heaven's sake, no," Reagan replied. "And when I was once asked about that 
extra money and said if it was an added sum to the purchase price, what would I 
do, I said I would have given it back." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "No one has proven to me that there was a diversion." 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, all I know is that some sum of money over and above the 
$12.2-million purchase price appeared in a Swiss bank account in which it was 
said that account had been used on another occasions (sic) to provide help to 
the Contras," Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
"And to this day, I still with all of the investigations that have been made, I 
still have never been given one iota of evidence as to who collected the price, 
who delivered the final delivery of the weapons . . . whether there was ever 
more money in that Swiss account that had been diverted someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
"I am still waiting to find those things out and have never found them out," 
Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and 
two counts of making false statements in connection with the Iran-Contra 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, he is accused of covering up from Congress North's secret 
assistance to the Contras and knowledge by government officials of a 1985 
shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter's lawyers sought Reagan's testimony in an attempt to show that the 
President approved of his national security adviser's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Greene ordered the release of a transcript of Reagan's eight hours of 
testimony but barred the news media from making copies of the videotape for 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
In his order, Greene rejected arguments by Poindexter and Reagan for delaying 
the release of the testimony.

DECISION ON LANDFILL DELAYED

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Regional Planning Commission today delayed a decision on the 
proposed expansion of the Sunshine Canyon landfill near Granada Hills because 
of incomplete environmental studies. 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris Industries, which operates the 230-acre dump north of Granada 
Hills, has proposed an expansion to include 542 acres of land in unincorporated 
county territory. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted 4 to 0 to delay making a decision after Deputy County 
Counsel Charles J. Moore advised members that BFI needed to conduct more 
thorough studies of alternative landfill sites in the county and on property 
the firm owns in the city of Los Angeles adjacent to the existing landfill. 
</P>
<P>
County planners, who urged commissioners to decide the issue today, said it 
would take up to two months to complete additional studies.

QUAYLE, KENNEDY BECOME UNLIKELY FELLOW TRAVELERS

Lest anyone doubt that politics makes strange bedfellows, Vice President Dan 
Quayle announced today that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) will accompany him 
to the March 11 presidential inauguration in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, champion of the Republican right, held a photo session with Kennedy, 
symbol of the Democratic left, to announce that Kennedy will be in the official 
U.S. delegation to the inauguration of Patricio Aylwin. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows the bipartisan commitment to the advancement of democracy in Chile 
and the Western Hemisphere," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin was elected Dec. 14 as an opposition candidate after 16 years of 
military rule under Augusto Pinochet, the army general who came to power in a 
1973 coup that ousted the elected government of Marxist Salvador Allende. 
</P>
<P>
The inauguration will take place in Valparaiso, a port city 75 miles west of 
Santiago, where Pinochet is building a new capital. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, who co-sponsored the Job Training Partnership Act with Quayle when the 
latter was a senator from Indiana, said he was "delighted" to be chosen for the 
delegation, which by tradition would have bipartisan representation. 
</P>
<P>
"The restoration of democracy in Chile has been something which the American 
people have felt extremely deeply about over a long time," Kennedy said. "This 
has been an extremely painful process, and I think it's another indication of 
the winds of change that are taking place in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle used the photo session in the Old Executive Office Building next door to 
the White House to present his "longtime friend" Kennedy with a candle-lit 
pastry to mark his 58th birthday, 258 years to the day after the birth of 
George Washington.

A southeast Bulgarian woman has given birth to a girl with two heads, the 
official news agency BTA reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The baby, delivered by Cesarean section, is well and feeding normally, said the 
news agency, quoting doctors at the Chirpan hospital where she was born. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency reported that the surgeon who delivered the baby said a second, 
partially formed head was growing from the head of the otherwise normal infant 
in what the doctor described as a "well-known malformation in the medical 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
"The second head has no ears, eyes or nose but has its own brain," Dr. Peter 
Vulkanov was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The report did not say when the infant was born or whether surgery was planned 
to remove the second head.

BAKER WARNS SANDINISTAS ON BEHAVIOR; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: SAYS AN ELECTION VICTORY ALONE WOULD NOT NORMALIZE RELATIONS. 
MANAGUA MUST END SUPPORT FOR EL SALVADOR REBELS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today that even if Nicaragua's 
ruling Sandinistas win Sunday's election, the United States will improve ties 
with them only after a sustained period of "good behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Testifying to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Baker said the United States 
will not necessarily accept the election as fair, even if neutral observers 
such as former President Jimmy Carter and former Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson 
certify the results. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States must reserve unto itself the right to make its own judgment 
about whether that election is free and fair," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to assume there is a Sandinista victory . . . it's very 
important before we talk about normalizing relations with that government that 
we see a sustained period of good behavior in terms of refraining from 
subverting their neighbors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has repeatedly charged that the Managua government is shipping arms 
to left-wing insurgents fighting the U.S.-backed government in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the election campaign had not been totally clean and opposition 
candidates and poll-watchers had been intimidated and their funds blocked. 
</P>
<P>
In his prepared statement to the committee, Baker hailed what he said were 
major U.S. foreign policy triumphs in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"These last two weeks have registered major advances in the President's foreign 
policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are measurably closer today to a Europe whole and free. . . . We have taken 
important steps toward controlling chemical weapons and a START (strategic arms 
reduction) treaty. And working with our allies, we are also moving forward in 
the war against drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Baker was able to bask in the unanimous praise of committee members at his 
recent achievements in arms control -- an unusual occurrence for a secretary of 
state testifying before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In his wide-ranging review, Baker insisted that the "two plus four" forum 
worked out last week to handle security aspects of German reunification 
adequately protected the interests of Germany's neighbors not included in the 
six. 
</P>
<P>
The plan envisages the foreign ministers of East and West Germany, plus 
Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States, meeting shortly after 
next month's East German election to discuss unification. 
</P>
<P>
But Poland has demanded to be included in the group and other states bordering 
Germany are unhappy at their exclusion from the decision-making forum.

<P>
Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel was whirled around Manhattan today at a 
pace similar to that of his country's breakneck revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Havel met for breakfast at Gracie Mansion with Mayor David Dinkins and 
playwrights Edward Albee, Wendy Wasserstein, Arthur Miller, novelist Kurt 
Vonnegut and producer Joseph Papp. 
</P>
<P>
It was Havel's first visit to the Big Apple since he attended the off-Broadway 
opening of his play, "Audience," 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the only year I had a passport," said Havel, who went from jail to 
become the first non-communist president of Czechoslovakia in more than 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
He told Dinkins that he spent "a wonderful evening" Wednesday on a tour of 
Manhattan's East Village pubs with Czechoslovak film director Milos Forman. 
</P>
<P>
"There was the same atmosphere, the same young people and the same music as in 
Prague," he said. "There is something international about these kinds of 
places." 
</P>
<P>
After breakfast it was off to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where Havel, 
followed by an entourage of reporters and Secret Service personnel, made a 
quick 45-minute tour. 
</P>
<P>
Havel said he was eager to see paintings by Jackson Pollock, Roy Lichtenstein 
and Andy Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
Havel then made stops at the house of Cardinal John O'Connor, and the Helsinki 
Watch human rights group to receive two separate awards. 
</P>
<P>
Havel told the audience of more than 100 at Helsinki Watch that he had been 
trying for a long time to go to Moscow to discuss human rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Some things have changed. Now I have an invitation from (Soviet President 
Mikhail S.) Gorbachev," Havel said. "I will speak with him Monday and if you 
want I will greet him for you." 
</P>
<P>
The former dissident playwright, who spent more than five years in jail, looked 
amused and surprised by the crowd of journalists who followed him from point to 
point.

U.S. CLAIMS JAPAN IS NOT DOING ENOUGH TO CUT TRADE SURPLUS

U.S. officials today accused Japan of not doing enough to reform deep-rooted 
business traditions and economic behavior that contribute to Japan's 
$49-billion trade surplus with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
After the first of two days of trade talks, members of the U.S. delegation 
complained that Japanese plans to help ease the trade imbalance "hadn't gone as 
far as we hoped." 
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to note that some progress has been made. But frankly, 
much more needs to be done," said a member of the U.S. delegation, who briefed 
reporters on condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade negotiators are under heavy pressure from Congress to demonstrate 
progress in the 9-month-old talks, which are aimed at changing deep-rooted 
factors in both economies that contribute to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The $49-billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan accounted for 45% of 1989's 
$108.58-billion U.S. deficit.

Japan is offering a tax break to Japanese companies if they donate money to 
U.S. hospitals and support other philanthropies in an effort to counter 
mounting American hostility to Japanese investments, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times said in a story from Tokyo that the offer was discussed 
during a meeting of 300 top business executives summoned to the Foreign 
Ministry last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Chamber of Commerce has recently begun distributing copies of a 
handbook with advice to Japanese companies in America on how to participate 
effectively in U.S. communities and local charities. 
</P>
<P>
The publication, "Joining In! A Handbook for Better Corporate Citizenship in 
the United States," notes that "it is important in American society to take 
credit for good works accomplished."

GREENSPAN NOT WORRIED ABOUT RISE IN PRICES

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that while he was surprised 
by certain aspects of January's sharp jump in consumer prices, he was not 
worried that inflationary pressures are accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, appearing to present the central bank's semiannual report to 
Congress, was questioned at length about his views on inflation in light of 
Wednesday's government report that consumer prices shot up by 1.1% in January, 
the biggest monthly increase in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The January increase translated into an annual rate of 14.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, 
asked Greenspan whether such a sharp jump in prices would force the Fed to 
change its new forecast that consumer prices will rise by between 4% and 4.5% 
this year, slightly lower than last year's 4.6% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that he felt comfortable with the Fed's forecast although he 
conceded that some of the specific components of the January price surge were 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"As best as we can judge, while the rate of inflation is higher than we would 
like, there is no evidence that it is accelerating," Greenspan said. "While I 
did not like the statistic published (Wednesday), it did not give me any great 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
In his prepared testimony, Greenspan repeated comments he made Tuesday that he 
believed a reversal in the sharp January jump in prices is under way. He cited 
evidence showing that price increases in the last half of 1989 were 
"appreciably lower" than in the first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the Fed expects the economy to be sluggish this year, growing at 
an anemic rate of 1.75% to 2%. That would be the weakest performance since 1984 
and far below the Administration's expectations for the year.

BUSH SEEKING LIMITS ON PRODUCT LIABILITY; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: COMMERCE OFFICIAL TELLS SENATE PANEL THAT CHANGES IN STANDARDS ARE 
NEEDED TO MAKE U.S. BUSINESS COMPETITIVE IN WORLD MARKETS.

The Bush Administration today challenged Congress to help American businesses 
compete in world markets by enacting a law limiting their legal liability for 
their products. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are serious about addressing our nation's competitiveness, we must 
address the excessive burdens placed on American business by our current 
liability system," said Wendell Wilkie II, general counsel for the Commerce 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkie's comments came as the Senate Commerce consumer subcommittee today 
considered the first nationwide product liability law, which in past years has 
failed to win committee approval. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkie said a federal law would make the rules for doing business "clear, 
consistent, uniform and predictable" and reduce "transaction" costs related to 
liability lawsuits involving potentially dangerous products. 
</P>
<P>
Transaction costs are attorneys' fees and other court costs associated with 
product liability lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 survey of business administrators by the Conference Board, an 
organization of business executives, showed that 40% of U.S. businesses said 
product liability had a "major" impact on their operations, Wilkie said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), chairman of the Commerce Committee, armed 
with a recent report by the General Accounting Office, disputed Wilkie's 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
Hollings said the study by Congress' investigative arm showed most punitive 
damages awards are overturned on appeal by businesses of product liability 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
"This goes to the heart of transaction costs," Hollings said. 
</P>
<P>
The participants in today's hearing skirted the linkage of the Bush 
Administration's backing of the bill with the debate over blocking development 
of new birth control products, including the French abortion pill. 
</P>
<P>
A leading consumer advocate contends Administration officials, in arguing for 
such a law, are citing a government study that criticizes legislative and 
regulatory obstacles to U.S. production of RU486, the so-called abortion pill. 
</P>
<P>
But David Beckwith, spokesman for Vice President Dan Quayle, said Wednesday 
that the Council for Competitiveness -- which Quayle heads -- "took no 
position" on whether existing laws create obstacles to the production of RU486 
in this country. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush called product liability standards a legislative priority in his 
State of the Union address.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced the recall today of more than 
a million cans of aerosol string streamers, warning that the party product can 
catch fire when sprayed near an open flame. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairwoman Jacqueline Jones-Smith said the voluntary recall by five 
companies is being conducted "because of several terrifying accidents that 
occurred when this type of product was sprayed near lit candles on birthday 
cakes and burst into flames." 
</P>
<P>
The aerosol cans, which are used like confetti at parties, are flammable 
because of the propellant they use, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The recall involves about 1.13 million cans sold nationwide in the last year 
for less than $5 a can. The aerosol cans have colored plastic caps indicating 
the color of streamer inside.

The Chicago Board of Health has proposed a ban on cigarette advertising on 
outdoor billboards, buses, trains and taxicabs, the Chicago Sun-Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted unanimously Wednesday to draft an ordinance that could be 
presented to the City Council as early as next month. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal came on the heels of a new federal anti-smoking proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Billboard companies said they will form an advisory council to negotiate 
voluntary restrictions on tobacco and alcohol ads around schools, as well as to 
guide anti-drug ad campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would cigarette companies spend money putting up billboards? They must 
feel it's effective advertising," board President Whitney Addington said. "I 
think it's such a health threat that the Board of Health has to fight it."

Talk show host Regis Philbin, who has ribbed pregnant co-host Kathie Lee 
Gifford about her burgeoning belly over the past few months, will get the 
tables turned on him. 
</P>
<P>
In what's being billed as a Day-In-The-Life of a Pregnant Man, Philbin on 
Monday will strap on a 35-pound "Empathy Belly," a device designed specifically 
for men to experience the severe discomforts of pregnancy -- including fetal 
kicks and pressure on the kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee," Philbin will 
wear his belly all day, not just during the taping. A camera crew will follow 
Philbin around New York as he attends business meetings, a power lunch with his 
agent at a prominent Manhattan restaurant and an afternoon piano lesson before 
going home. The footage will air Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first child for Kathie Lee, wife of ABC sportscaster Frank 
Gifford.

Long odds never bothered Sylvester Stallone's cinematic alter ego Rocky Balboa, 
but his fans have an uphill battle to keep Rocky's 8 1/2-foot bronze likeness 
atop the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you like to buy a prizefighter 8 feet high?" museum President Robert 
Montgomery Scott asked Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Scott wants the statue gone from the front of the museum when filming is done 
for "Rocky V," but the prop-turned-tourist-attraction is gaining supporters, 
including Mayor W. Wilson Goode. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a contract between the 'Rocky V' production group and ourselves that 
it will be removed on Saturday but they've been pushing pretty hard to keep it 
there," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky" creator Stallone had the statue made for the third movie in his series 
about a Philadelphia club fighter who makes it to the top. 
</P>
<P>
Goode said the statue represents "the struggle of so many people."

Heath's bitterness has never waned. He refused to serve under Thatcher and has

But he welcomed her in the Savoy Hotel Wednesday, and they chatted amiably 
among more than 500 guests marking Heath's 40 years in the House of Commons.

Heath said he was "very touched" that Thatcher had found the time to be there. 
But he found his old self quickly enough, criticizing the government for

Because a large convention of television executives is already booked, San 
Francisco has decided against bidding for the 1993 Super Bowl, Mayor Art Agnos' 
office announced. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco was one of four Western cities invited by the NFL to enter bids. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos said Wednesday in a letter to the NFL that San Francisco could offer only 
about half of the 11,500 top-grade hotel rooms required by the league for Super 
Bowl week in January of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos said the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau told him that 
hosting the Super Bowl then would be impossible because of the previously 
scheduled meeting of the National Assn. of Television Program Executives. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco hosted the 1985 Super Bowl, played in Stanford Stadium and won by 
the San Francisco 49ers.

PLAYERS FILING FOR ARBITRATION GET 82% PAY RAISES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball players who filed for arbitration had an average salary increase of 
$348,269 this year, according to an Associated Press survey. The 82% jump is 
the most since before collusion and will push the major-league average to about 
$600,000 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The 159 players whose teams agreed to arbitration had an average salary of 
$422,735 in 1989. Their 1990 average, including prorated shares of signing 
bonuses and other guaranteed money, will be $771,004. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the salaries of players in arbitration rose 70%, following a 65% 
rise in 1988 and a 35% increase in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Using an alternate method of calculation -- average annual values -- the 
increase was even sharper: 102%, the biggest rise since 1981. Many players have 
structured their contracts to take lower salaries this season because of fear 
of a prolonged lockout or strike. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight players in arbitration doubled their salaries, 21 tripled them, 
five quadrupled them, and Mike Bielecki of the Pittsburgh Pirates increased his 
fivefold, from $122,500 to $675,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bielecki's 451% increase was followed by Ruben Sierra's 355% jump from $357,500 
to $1,625,000 and Fred McGriff's 346% increase from $325,000 to $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistical comparisons with recent years, the average salary 
should rise to between $590,000 and $620,000 in 1990. The exact number will 
depend on which players make opening day rosters. 
</P>
<P>
Although 161 players filed, just 24 players had hearings; 14 won. Two players, 
Greg Minton of the Angels and John Candelaria of the Montreal Expos, were 
refused arbitration by their clubs and became free agents -- Minton re-signed 
with the Angels on Wednesday -- and the others reached contract agreements with 
their teams. 
</P>
<P>
Players won seven of 12 hearings last year, giving them a better than .500 
record in consecutive years for the first time since 1979-81. Owners still have 
a 164-139 advantage since the process began in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 winners this year increased their salaries by 141%, $373,179 to 
$900,357. The 10 losers increased their salaries by 106%, from $441,700 to 
$909,000. 
</P>
<P>
Collective-bargaining negotiations have deadlocked on the issue of arbitration 
eligibility. Players want the minimum service time rolled back to two years, 
where it was before the 1985 agreement. Owners want it to remain at three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Players with between three and four years' service, almost all in arbitration 
for the first time, did particularly well, the AP study found. Their average 
jumped 158%, from $192,957 to $497,178. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the salaries of players in arbitration for the first time increased 
by 137%. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two players who filed for arbitration got multiyear contracts this 
winter, up from 19 last year, 13 in 1988 and four in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Figures for the AP survey were obtained over the past two months from numerous 
player and management sources. They do not include any potential income from 
incentive bonus opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Eight Pittsburgh Pirates had hearings, the most for any club since the 1974 
Oakland Athletics.

A group that includes Minnesota businessman Harvey Mackay today expressed 
interest in negotiating for local investors to buy the Minnesota North Stars, 
whose owners have said they'll move the NHL team to the San Francisco Bay Area 
if a buyer cannot be found to keep it in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic that a deal can be struck to keep the North Stars in 
Minnesota, but this is far from a completed transaction," the group, which 
calls itself North Star Hockey Partners of Minnesota, said in a prepared 
statement released before a news conference late this morning. 
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Mackay called North Stars co-owner Gordon Gund on 
Wednesday night to tell him about a letter Gund would receive from the Mackay 
group. The statement said the letter "indicated an offer to open direct and 
serious negotiations for the purchase of the Minnesota North Stars by a group 
of local investors." 
</P>
<P>
Mackay also talked with NHL Commissioner John Ziegler and sent him a copy of 
the letter. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars have arena offers in Oakland and San Jose.

Right-hander Doug Drabek won his salary case today, earning a $775,000 pay 
raise and giving the players a 5-3 edge over the Pittsburgh Pirates in 
arbitration hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Drabek, who is 29-19 the last two seasons, will get $1.1 million this season 
instead of the Pirates' $750,000 offer. Drabek made $325,000 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Drabek was 14-12 with a 2.80 earned run average in 35 appearances, 
all but one of them starts for the fifth-place Pirates. He had five shutouts 
among his eight complete games and earned a save in his only relief appearance. 
He struck out 123 and walked 69 in 244.1 innings.

RACING Q &amp; A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE HIRSCH, DAILY RACING FORM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Which is considered the more difficult feat: winning the Triple Crown 
in the United States, when the three races are contested over a period of five 
weeks, or winning it in England, with the three races spread out over more than 
three months? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There is a divergence of opinion among professionals. Some feel the 
concentration of pressure involved in the American Triple Crown places a 
fearsome burden on a horse. Others feel it is more difficult to keep a horse in 
top condition for the longer period of time involved in the English Triple 
Crown. Suffice to say, both series are difficult to sweep. There have been 11 
winners of the U.S. Triple Crown since Sir Barton was the first in 1919. 
Affirmed, in 1978, was the last. West Australian was the first to sweep the 
English Triple Crown (the 2,000 Guineas, the Derby and St. Leger) in 1853, and 
15 horses have done it. The last was Nijinsky II in 1970, and he was the first 
since Bahram in 1935. The English Triple Crown does not seem to hold the same 
appeal for horsemen in that country these days as the American Triple Crown 
among horsemen in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am fascinated by the distinction made between races at a mile and a 16th 
and races at a mile and 70 yards. The two distances are so close together, for 
a mile and a 16th is a mile and 110 yards. Why do tracks offer both distances 
when they are almost the same thing? 
</P>
<P>
A: It is often a matter of psychology. The racing secretary is trying to 
attract the best possible racing material for his programs. Some trainers may 
feel that their horse doesn't have the stamina to stay a mile and a 16th but 
might be able to win at a mile and 70 yards. Department stores practice the 
same psychology by pricing items at $99, rather than $100. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When I handicap the races, I compare the best previous times of the horses 
in that race at the distance in question. Some of my friends discount the best 
time as having little significance. What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
A: "The quality of the race can make a difference," said Leroy Jolley, the Hall 
of Fame trainer who saddled Kentucky Derby winners Foolish Pleasure and Genuine 
Risk. "Cheap horses are not consistent and can turn in a good time one day and 
a slow time the next. In some instances they are favored by certain track 
conditions, or perhaps they can get an easy lead in some races and nurse it all 
the way. Good horses, on the other hand, hold their form longer, and if they 
run in fast time, they are more likely to run back in comparable time than 
cheap horses. Not all the time, but more often. Thus, in better races, the best 
times are probably more significant." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Like many others, I have read many stories and am concerned about the number 
of fractures occurring among our racehorses. Isn't it possible to alleviate 
this situation to some degree by feeding a heavier calcium diet to horses, thus 
building stronger bone? 
</P>
<P>
A: "In the absence of a marked deficiency of calcium in the body makeup, it has 
been proven to the satisfaction of most professionals that a high calcium diet 
is not effective in the prevention of fractures in racehorses," said the noted 
Midwestern veterinarian, Dr. Robert Copeian. "Levels of calcium above the norm 
are rejected by the body."

PREMIERE HANDICAP TO BE RENAMED FOR BILL SHOEMAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The $100,000-added Premiere Handicap at Hollywood Park was renamed the 
Shoemaker Handicap today in honor of the world's winningest jockey, who retired 
earlier this month at age 58. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker rode his final race at Santa Anita on Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's 47th running of the Premiere Handicap, Shoemaker won aboard 
Peace to register his 1,000th stakes victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Shoemaker Handicap, a one-mile race for 3-year-olds and up on Hollywood 
Park's turf course, is scheduled to be run April 29, four days after the April 
25 opening of the track's 1990 spring-summer meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker was aboard the winning horse in the Shoemaker Handicap six times when 
it was known as the Premiere Handicap. The race was moved to the turf course in 
1984. Before 1978, it was contested at six furlongs.

DETAILS OF 'MIRACLE ON ICE' FADE A BIT, BUT EMOTION STILL VIVID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT CALABRIA, NEWSDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
It was 10 years ago this week that the U.S. Olympic hockey team stuck its foot 
into the glass slipper and walked away with a gold medal at Lake Placid, a 
fairy tale if there ever was one, and boy, where does the time go? Herb Brooks 
looked so young and mean back then, and like his players, it's hard to imagine 
him ever growing old. And now Herb Brooks is 52. 
</P>
<P>
The legend of Lake Placid has aged, too, a few of the details growing fuzzy, 
the mind playing a few tricks. But the story endures because the kids from the 
United States did more than just capture a championship. They began the 
Olympics as long shots; they left as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
They wrote a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
These weren't high-priced superstars tooling around in Ferraris and hanging out 
at Elaine's. They were collegians and failed minor-leaguers giving it their 
best shot. The Soviets were big and powerful -- invincible, we all thought. 
Team U.S.A. was made up of youngsters from down the block who mowed your lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a meeting we had early on, after the team was picked," said Rob 
McClanahan, a center on the team and now a sales broker in Chicago. "Herb gave 
us a talk and although he didn't say this exactly, the message was something 
like, 'If we play very well, get some breaks, we could win a bronze medal. If 
we play over our heads, catch a huge break, we can get a silver. The gold is 
the Russians'. Forget about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
But it has been a long time, so every once in a while the memories become 
blurred. A guy will say, "Remember the night the U.S.A. beat the Soviets and 
won the gold medal?" And, of course, it didn't happen that way at all. The 
United States beat the Soviets all right, 10 years ago today. But it was two 
days later -- Feb. 24, 1980 -- that the Americans clinched the gold medal by 
defeating Finland. Odd, but that game is like a footnote now. 
</P>
<P>
"Know what?" asked Mark Johnson, who plays for the New Jersey Devils these 
days. "Everyone thinks we won the gold medal in the game against the Russians, 
except the people who were there." It's as if as long as they beat the Soviets, 
nothing else matters. 
</P>
<P>
But it does. Those upstarts from small towns like Grand Rapids, Minn., and 
Charleston, Mass., tossing their sticks in the air, Mike Eruzione collapsed in 
tears, Jim Craig wrapped in an American flag and asking, "Where's my father?" 
-- that was like something out of a TV movie. Naturally, it became one. If you 
happened to miss it, it was called "Miracle on Ice." 
</P>
<P>
"The movie?" McClanahan said. "To me, it was a little sappy." 
</P>
<P>
Like anything else, the movie exaggerated a few facts, ignored some others, and 
squashed eight months of practice, travel and competition into three hours in 
prime time. It came across like a real tear-jerker, all hearts and flowers. The 
fact is, the Olympians rode a bumpy path to Lake Placid. People forget that. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Americans arrived, they were exhausted and cranky from a 
nationwide tour. There was some squabbling. And the country really didn't take 
much notice of the team until the game against the Soviets, a story in itself. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets had demolished the United States, 10-3, in a pre-Olympic game at 
Madison Square Garden. So Brooks figured he'd better have something good to say 
to inspire his young players. 
</P>
<P>
The locker room was hushed when he stood up before the game, reached into his 
pocket and fished out a wrinkled slip of paper. And then he said: 
</P>
<P>
"You are born to be a player. You are meant to be here at this time. This is 
your moment." 
</P>
<P>
As speeches go, it was right up there with Knute Rockne telling Notre Dame to 
win one for the Gipper. But, it turns out, Brooks really hadn't been sure of 
what he wanted to say. He scribbled down a few notes and phrases and then kind 
of blurted them out, not exactly the way the story has been passed down. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks laughs about it now. "It just sort of came out the way it did," he said. 
"Let me tell you something, it was no Gettysburg Address." 
</P>
<P>
Let's just say it did the job. Johnson's shot with one second left in the first 
period pulled the United States into a 2-2 tie and the Soviets, panicking, 
yanked their famous goalie, Vladislav Tretiak. Behind in the third period, 3-2, 
the Americans fought back with goals by Dave Silk and Eruzione, won the game, 
4-3, and the fable began to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
The natural reaction was to think that the dispirited Soviets had nothing but 
contempt for the Americans. It also was natural to think the Americans loved 
sticking it to the Soviets, their being Communists and all. But as Eruzione 
said, "We were athletes, and to us it was an athletic event. We didn't think of 
it as a political event." 
</P>
<P>
That victory got the puck rolling. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Ken Morrow would go on to win four Stanley Cups with the New York 
Islanders after winning the gold medal and now is an assistant coach with the 
New York Rangers' farm team in Flint, Mich. Craig rebounded from a brief, 
checkered NHL career, eventually was cleared of criminal charges stemming from 
a fatal automobile accident, and currently is a sales representative in 
Brockton, Mass. Mark Pavelich, who always skated to his own beat, hunts and 
fishes in the Minnesota woods. 
</P>
<P>
But it's funny how things work out sometimes. Johnson and Viacheslav Fetisov, 
the great Soviet defenseman, are teammates now with the Devils. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of the Olympians, plus Brooks and assistant Coach Craig Patrick, rode 
the wave of popularity to careers in the NHL. For most of them, though, there's 
been nothing like the afternoon they beat the Finns, 4-2, for the gold medal 
while the crowd in Lake Placid chanted, "U.S.A.!" 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the line that everyone remembers is Al Michaels shouting: "Do you 
believe in miracles?" Now, the word "miracle" gets a lot of exposure, what with 
every game-winning ground-rule double immediately videotaped and immortalized. 
The Americans, all freckles and goose bumps, coming out of nowhere to beat the 
odds and win the gold -- that may not exactly qualify as a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
But it's close.

MICHAEL BOLTON, RONSTADT WIN POP GRAMMYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Bolton was named top pop male vocalist over the late Roy Orbison, the 
evening's sentimental favorite, and Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville were cited 
for best vocal by a pop duo as the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards telecast got under 
way Wednesday evening at the Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz great Miles Davis was certain of one award even before the three-hour CBS 
program began. Along with former Beatle Paul McCartney, the celebrated 
trumpeter was to be honored with a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis, who has won four previous Grammys, also picked up his fifth and 
sixth Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
During pre-telecast ceremonies -- in which 61 of the evening's 77 awards were 
announced -- Davis was saluted for best jazz instrumental performance by a big 
band during 1989 and for best jazz instrumental by a soloist, both in 
connection with his album, "Aura." 
</P>
<P>
The Recording Academy was also scheduled to give two posthumous Lifetime 
Achievement Awards during the telecast to singer Nat King Cole and pianist 
Vladimir Horowitz. Dick Clark was to be presented with a Trustees Award, for 
achievements in the non-performing side of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Grammy winners are chosen by the nearly 6,000 active members of the National 
Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, a nonprofit organization formed to 
represent all segments of the recording industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Raitt was one of the evening's other multiple winners. She was saluted 
for best female rock vocal and traditional blues recording, sharing the latter 
with John Lee Hooker for their duet on "I'm in the Mood." 
</P>
<P>
Other artists who received multiple awards included British soul-dance group 
Soul II Soul and composer-arranger Dave Grusin. 
</P>
<P>
Soul II Soul won the R&amp;B group vocal award for the single "Back to Life," 
and the R&amp;B instrumental Grammy for "African Dance," a selection from the 
group's "Keep on Movin' " album. The group, however, lost in the more-prized 
best new artist category to the duo Milli Vanilli. 
</P>
<P>
Grusin, winner of three previous Grammys, picked up three more. They were for 
the background score of the film "The Fabulous Baker Boys," instrumental 
arrangement for the suite from the film "The Milagro Beanfield War" and 
instrumental arrangement with a vocal for the rendition of "My Funny Valentine" 
in "'Baker Boys." 
</P>
<P>
The Traveling Wilburys, the veteran rock superstar quintet that was widely 
viewed in the recording industry as the betting favorite in the competition for 
key album of the year, were also honored during the pre-telecast portion of the 
program for the best group vocal in rock. 
</P>
<P>
The group consists of rock veterans Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Tom 
Petty and Orbison. 
</P>
<P>
Living Colour's "Cult of Personality" single was named best hard rock 
performance of 1989, shutting out the controversial Los Angeles-based hard-rock 
band Guns N' Roses. The latter group had been widely criticized for allegedly 
racist remarks in a song, "One in a Million," that was included in its "GN'R 
Lies" album, which was a contender in the hard-rock category. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 members from the Los Angeles chapter of the Guardian Angels, the 
self-styled crime fighters, marched in front of the Shrine on Wednesday, 
handing out leaflets that branded "One in a Million" as racist for its use of 
racial epithets, and New York rap group's Public Enemy's "Welcome to the 
Terrordome" as anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy -- whose "Fight the Power" single was a nominee in the rap 
category -- has been criticized by Jewish leaders and others for possible 
anti-Semitic attitudes since a controversial interview by Professor Griff, the 
group's former "minister of information," that appeared last May in the 
Washington Times newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Both Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns N' Roses, and Chuck D., the leader of 
Public Enemy, have denied racist or bigoted attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Connick Jr.'s victory in the male jazz vocal category Wednesday is likely 
to stir criticism from the purist wing of the jazz community that has tended to 
think of Connick primarily as a cabaret or pop singer. In picking up his first 
Grammy for his contributions to the "When Harry Meets Sally" film sound track 
album, Connick defeated past jazz Grammy winners Joe Williams and George 
Benson. 
</P>
<P>
Two names more commonly associated with pop and rock, Dr. John and Rickie Lee 
Jones, were also honored for best jazz vocal by a duo or group. They teamed up 
on a version of "Makin' Whoopee." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Ruth Brown, a star over the years in jazz, blues and rock fields, was 
named best female jazz vocalist for her album, "Blues on Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
The Pat Metheny Group was honored for jazz fusion performance for the fifth 
time since the category was initiated in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Chick Corea, who had won seven previous Grammys, was honored for best jazz 
group instrumental for his album, "Chick Corea Akoustic Band." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Brown was named best male R&amp;B vocalist, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's 
"If You Don't Know Me by Now" was named best R&amp;B song. 
</P>
<P>
In the country field, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's "Will the Circle Be 
Unbroken, Volume Two" was associated with three awards. The band itself won a 
Grammy for best group vocal, defeating the Judds, who had finished on top in 
this category two of the last three years. The band also shared a Grammy with 
Bruce Hornsby for best blue grass recording, while Randy Scruggs was cited as 
best country instrumentalist for his work on a song, "Amazing Grace," that 
appeared on the "Circle" album. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Crowell's "After All This Time" was declared best country song. 
</P>
<P>
The Indigo Girls' debut album was judged the top contemporary folk recording. 
The traditional folk Grammy was awarded to the Bulgarian State Female Vocal 
Choir, a group that had made a considerable pop splash during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Los Lobos was judged the best Mexican-American performance. 
</P>
<P>
The late actress-comedian Gilda Radner was honored for best spoken word 
recording for her, "It's Always Something." 
</P>
<P>
"Jerome Robbins' Broadway" was named best musical cast show album. 
</P>
<P>
In the composition categories, Carly Simon's "Let the River Run" (from the film 
"Working Girl") was named best song written for a movie, while Danny Elfman's 
"Batman" theme was voted best instrumental composition. 
</P>

JUDGE RULES FLAG PROTECTION ACT UNCONSTITUTIONAL

The law against desecration of the American flag passed by Congress last fall 
is unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled Wednesday in finding that four 
people who burned flags were exercising their First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for the flag to endure as a symbol of freedom in this nation, we must 
protect with equal vigor the right to destroy it and the right to wave it," 
Judge Barbara Rothstein said in her decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Burning the flag as an expression of political dissent, while repellent to 
many Americans, does not jeopardize the freedom which we hold dear." 
</P>
<P>
She ruled in the first constitutional challenge to the Flag Protection Act of 
1989, said David Cole of the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, 
which represented the four defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Haggerty, Jennifer Campbell, Darius Strong and Carlos Garza had been 
charged with burning a U.S. flag outside a Seattle post office shortly after 
midnight on Oct. 28, the day the flag protection law took effect. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed the law in response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that 
burning a U.S. flag is protected under First Amendment guarantees of free 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants pleaded not guilty and moved to have the charges dismissed on 
grounds that the act violates the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the flag desecration charge, each was charged with one count of 
destruction of U.S. government property. Rothstein was asked only to dismiss 
the flag desecration charges, which is what she did in holding the law 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The flag desecration and destruction of property counts each carry a maximum 
penalty of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wonderful," Cole said of the ruling. "I think the judge 
reaffirmed that the First Amendment means that people must be as free to burn 
the flag as they are free to wave it." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark Bartlett said the U.S. attorney's office, the Justice 
Department and the solicitor general will decide whether to take the remaining 
count of property destruction to trial or take the issue directly to the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The act provides for direct appeal to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Constitutional Rights planned to argue the same issue today in 
District Court in Washington, D.C., in a case involving three people who burned 
flags on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is likely that both cases will end up together before the Supreme 
Court.

of 43 musicians. Also, in addition to the performances listed, the opera will

THE RISE OF SOPRANO EALYNN VOSS DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
OPERA: AFTER AN AUSPICIOUS START, SHE RETURNS TONIGHT AS THE HEROINE OF 
PUCCINI'S 'TURANDOT' FOR OPERA PACIFIC AT THE ORANGE COUNTY PERFORMING ARTS

When last we saw soprano Ealynn Voss, she was one of the hopefuls who had 
turned up at Opera Pacific auditions for secondary roles, apprentices and 
chorus members nearly three years ago at Cal State Northridge. She was 
supporting herself then by scrubbing floors and cleaning houses in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Voss returns in triumph as the titular heroine of Puccini's "Turandot" 
for Opera Pacific at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a long journey, even though Voss had come to those 1987 auditions 
not as a rank amateur. She had understudied Ghena Dimitrova as Turandot for 
Michigan Opera Theater and Martina Arroyo in the same role for Dayton Opera 
Assn. (Both organizations are run by Opera Pacific's general director David 
DiChiera.) 
</P>
<P>
She also had the uncommon blessing of legendary soprano Birgit Nilsson, who 
described her, according to press material, as belonging "to the group of 
dramatic sopranos that is very rare today." 
</P>
<P>
But despite all, a career nearly didn't happen. Faced with the problems of an 
older artist trying to make a career -- Voss is now in her early 40s -- she had 
abandoned singing for several years. 
</P>
<P>
She had trained at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio in the early 
1970s, ventured a short stint in Europe, then came to UCLA to work with Jan 
Popper, director of the opera workshop program there. 
</P>
<P>
"But that didn't work out," Voss said in a recent interview at a Costa Mesa 
restaurant. "One thing led to another. It just didn't work out . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I started the governess work (in Malibu) and all that sort of 
thing. After a while, I just let singing go. And that probably was what was my 
saving grace because if I had been singing . . . I may not have been able to do 
what I'm doing now. I may have been burned out. Now there's the freshness, the 
enthusiasm that's there because now I'm coming at it in a different respect. 
Now I want to do it. Before I felt I had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Voss credits basso Giorgio Tozzi and his wife -- they met through a church in 
Malibu -- for getting her back on track. "They were so very gracious in helping 
me," she said. "They believed in me and basically gave me the encouragement and 
nurturing to convince me that I could have a major career, that there was no 
reason why I had quit." 
</P>
<P>
Now she is enthusiastic that she is at last earning a living through her 
singing. 
</P>
<P>
"I crossed that barrier after I did the Charleston 'Rusalka' at the Spoleto 
Festival," she said. "And then I went on and made the connection with Gian 
Carlo Menotti, who invited me to (sing the title role of) Strauss' 'Ariadne auf 
Naxos' in the Spoleto Festival in Melbourne, Australia. And from that moment on 
I was able to pretty much support myself, finally." 
</P>
<P>
But just as these major breaks were occurring, personal tragedy struck. While 
she was singing Turandot for Arizona Opera, her father suffered the first in a 
series of heart attacks. An only child, Voss moved back home -- a small town 
outside Pittsburgh -- last October to help her mother take care of him. He died 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a slow demise," Voss said. "A textbook case of everything (bad) that 
could possibly happen to a heart patient . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He never got to see me on stage, which I regret deeply, but I always had 
little tapes and things -- pictures -- from performances that I would show him. 
And I was grateful that before he passed away he was able to see some success 
coming my way." 
</P>
<P>
She is scheduled to sing Chrysothemis in Strauss' "Elektra" next season with 
the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, and other possibilities lie ahead. But she 
hasn't forgotten the difficulty of starting a career. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it is still hard for the older singers," she said. "I don't 
know if that's going to change. I've often thought if ever I'm able to be in a 
position in some later years, that maybe there's something I could do . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that people realize that it doesn't just happen. And I'm glad 
that I had the struggle that I had because I'm enjoying it now so much more 
than if it had been handed to me. And maybe that helps me as an artist, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Ealynn Voss will sing the title role in Puccini's "Turandot" for Opera Pacific 
at 8 p.m. today and at 2 p.m. March 4 at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, 600 Town Center Drive, in Costa Mesa. Lando Bartolini will sing Calaf 
today; Giorgio Tieppo will sing the role on March 4. Maria Spacagna will be Liu 
today; Katherine Luna, on March 4. Louis Salemno will conduct. Tickets: $20 to 
$55. Information: (714) 979-9000.

GROVE FESTIVAL FINDS MANAGING DIRECTOR; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: BARBARA G. HAMMERMAN, AN INSIDER, IS NAMED TO SUCCEED RICHARD A. 
STEIN, WHO IS TAKING OVER LAGUNA PLAYHOUSE.

<P>
The Grove Shakespeare Festival has named an insider, Barbara G. Hammerman, to 
replace departing managing director Richard A. Stein, who was hired earlier 
this month as chief executive of the Laguna Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Hammerman will take over the management of the county's third-largest nonprofit 
theater operation -- and the second-leading professional troupe after South 
Coast Repertory -- in the newly created position of executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Hammerman said Wednesday that she will give up her unpaid post as 
president-elect of the Grove board of directors but will retain a seat on the 
board in her paid managerial job. Stein was not a member of the board. However, 
his job was full time. Hers is not -- at least officially -- though her 
undisclosed salary is expected to match Stein's, she said, because "I am 
assuming the same duties." 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Yorba Linda resident will be responsible for the Grove's 
financial management, fund raising, marketing and public relations. She said 
she anticipates putting in "at least 30 hours a week and probably a lot more" 
at the theater, while also retaining "a working relationship" with the 
Tustin-based Community Foundation of the Jewish Federation of Orange County, 
which she has headed since June 1986 as executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be great," she said of her new appointment, which takes 
effect March 5. "I think the answer to whether (having two jobs) will succeed 
will come in the proof of the work." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas F. Bradac, the Grove's artistic director, said he is "extremely pleased" 
by the board's decision to hire from within, comparing Hammerman's elevation 
and Stein's departure to "a baseball trade" in which "both teams did well." 
</P>
<P>
"My concern was that getting somebody from the outside would take a three- to 
six-month search," Bradac said. "Breaking in that person in terms of learning 
the ropes in the county would have taken another nine months. Barbara already 
knows everybody in the county. She is well connected. She knows where the money 
is. She knows who's giving and who's not." 
</P>
<P>
Hammerman, who holds a law degree, was responsible for fund development and 
grant programs at the Community Foundation, which has assets of almost $5 
million, in addition to executive management. She has been a publicly elected 
member of the board of trustees of the North Orange County Community College 
District since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Baton Rouge, La., Hammerman has an undergraduate degree in theater 
arts from Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, La., where she grew 
up. She is married and has a 14-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
To adjust for the somewhat unusual, part-time arrangement at the Grove, she 
said she will collaborate with three outside consultants: 
</P>
<P>
* Judith Rosenthal, a certified public accountant from Laguna Beach and former 
chief financial officer of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, who will 
assist with fiscal management. 
</P>
<P>
* Dede Ginter of Ginter &amp; Assoc., a public relations firm in Fullerton, who 
will assist with promotion. 
</P>
<P>
* Patti Negrino, a marketing executive from Garden Grove, who will assist with 
marketing and development. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old Grove Shakespeare Festival, which has projected a 1990 
operating budget of $700,000, will produce a six-play, indoor-outdoor season 
from May to December at the 178-seat Gem Theatre and the 550-seat Festival 
Amphitheatre. Last year it had 2,600 subscribers.
