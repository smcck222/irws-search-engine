NOTED WRITERS VENT OUTRAGE OVER KHOMEINI

<P>
In a cry of outrage from the heart of the American literary establishment, a 
group of the nation's most prominent authors Wednesday condemned the Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran for ordering the execution of novelist Salman Rushdie 
and attacked booksellers for removing his controversial work. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the B. Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble chains reversed themselves, 
announcing that the book, "The Satanic Verses," once again will be available 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, about 150 people gathered to hear readings and discussion of 
Rushdie's work in an event sponsored by PEN Center U.S.A. West. Among the 
participants were feminist author Betty Friedan, futurist Alvin Toffler and 
novelist Lawrence Thornton. (Story on Page 16.) 
</P>
<P>
The two bookstore chains said an overwhelming majority of store employees had 
requested permission to sell "The Satanic Verses" and that President Bush's 
assurances that Iran would be held accountable for any attacks on U.S. 
companies had influenced the decision to restock the work. 
</P>
<P>
But the booksellers made it clear they were not endorsing Rushdie. "As has been 
the company's practice throughout its history, it makes no recommendations as 
to the worthiness or lack thereof of any of the books found on its shelves," 
said Richard Mulieri, a B. Dalton spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The reversal was a victory for the 41-year-old author, who is under heavy guard 
and in hiding in Britain, and for Viking-Penguin, his embattled publisher, 
which declined to comment on the chains' decision. 
</P>
<P>
Waldenbooks, which ordered Rushdie's novel not to be displayed last week, said 
it would continue to sell the book from existing stock on request. 
</P>
<P>
With readings from the controversial book, a march through rain-drenched 
Manhattan streets and a series of angry speeches, prominent U.S. authors 
rallied Wednesday in defense of Rushdie. While the authors met inside a 
Manhattan auditorium, protesters and supporters of the book shouted at each 
other across police lines. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an act of international terrorism against the life of the mind," Susan 
Sontag, president of the American chapter of PEN, the international writers 
organization, told the gathering in Lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
"This must be the largest hit contract in history," declared Norman Mailer. 
"Islam, with all its mighty virtues and vices, equal at the least to the 
virtues and vices of every other major religion, has now introduced a novel 
element into the history of theology. It has added the logic of the Syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
"One does not even have to belong to the Family (Mafia) to collect," he said. 
"One has only to be the hit man." 
</P>
<P>
The writers not only turned their ire on Iran, but scathingly attacked the 
nation's two largest booksellers and President Bush for failing to take 
stronger action against the ayatollah's death order. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Too Late, Too Little' 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush's statement, when it finally came, was dramatically too late 
and shockingly too little," charged Robert Caro, expressing the sense of the 
meeting. "We don't elect the bookstore chains to protect our rights. That's the 
function of the government." 
</P>
<P>
The President, at his news conference Tuesday, declared Iran's government "can 
expect to be held accountable" if Americans or American firms are hurt by 
Khomeini's campaign against Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
The author set off a firestorm in the Muslim world with his allegorical novel 
about Islam. In response, Khomeini ordered his execution and threatened action 
against Viking-Penguin. 
</P>
<P>
Both Rushdie and his wife, novelist Marianne Wiggins, sent word to the New York 
PEN gathering. 
</P>
<P>
"We writers are a dangerous breed and we always have been. Only fear can stop a 
book from being sold," Wiggins wrote, in a letter read by Sontag. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Courageous Monster' 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie's wife, who was forced to cancel a seven-city U.S. book tour for her 
own new novel, "John Dollar," urged the authors to read her husband's book. She 
labeled it "a colossal, unrepentant, courageous monster." 
</P>
<P>
"Rejoice in it," Wiggins urged her fellow writers. 
</P>
<P>
Packed into the second-floor loft on lower Broadway were such veterans of 
best-seller lists as Mailer and Sontag, Larry McMurtry, Joan Didion, Diana 
Trilling, Don DeLillo, Frances Fitzgerald, Gay Talese, E.L. Doctorow, Lionel 
Tiger, John Gregory Dunne, Robert Stone, J. Anthony Lukas and Tom Wolfe. 
</P>
<P>
As the authors castigated Khomeini, the debate over Rushdie's work raged 
outside. Across lower Broadway, about 25 of Rushdie's American-Muslim critics 
held up signs and shouted, "Ban the book." 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to protest. . . . The book contains language which is beyond the 
level of decency. The book uses language which is beyond common sense," charged 
Abdus Shakoor, the group's leader. 
</P>
<P>
"In 'The Satanic Verses,' Rushdie is not libeling an individual, he insults and 
libels a whole community. It is obscene," proclaimed pamphlets handed out by 
the protesters. "We Muslims believe that it is highly imprudent and 
inconsiderate for an individual to completely ignore the religious 
sensitivities of his fellow citizens while exercising his First Amendment 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
Across Broadway, long lines of literary aficionados waited in vain in the rain 
to get into the meeting. "Hands off Rushdie," chanted his backers. 
</P>
<P>
New York's day of literary protest began when more than 80 members of the 
National Writers Union demonstrated in front of Iran's U.N. Mission against 
Khomeini's death sentence. The pickets attempted to hand a protest letter to 
Iranian U.N. Ambassador Mohammed Mahallati before marching to Fifth Avenue, 
where they held rallies in front of the large bookstores refusing to stock 
Rushdie's book. 
</P>
<P>
"One, two, three, four -- Put the book back in the store!" the protesters 
chanted. 
</P>
<P>
But clearly, the meeting of authors was the high point of the day. Writer after 
writer rose before a blue and white PEN banner in front of the room to back 
Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not read any of his books and perhaps I never shall," said Trilling. 
"But the ayatollah has called for the murder of intellectual freedom everywhere 
in the world. What we passively accede to today will be forced on us tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry, who also owns four bookstores, was strongly critical of the chains. 
He said their decision not to stock Rushdie's book was "shameful and very 
regrettable." 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who run independent bookstores want to sell Rushdie's book. We're 
going to get as many copies of them as we can and pile them high in the 
windows." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Mailer, in an eight-page speech, who best summed up the mood of 
anger. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ayatollah Khomeini has offered us an opportunity to regain our frail 
religion, which happens to be faith in the power of words and our willingness 
to suffer for them," he said. "He awakens us to the great rage we feel when our 
liberty to say what we wish, wise or foolish, kind or cruel, well-advised or 
ill-advised, is endangered. We discover that, yes, maybe we are willing to 
suffer for our idea."

BUSINESS AND TERRORISM; 
</P>
<P>
DOES SAFETY OR PRINCIPLE COME FIRST? 
</P>

<P>
At Dutton's Books in North Hollywood, owner Davis Dutton had his full-time 
workers vote a few days ago to decide whether "The Satanic Verses" should be 
swept from the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Without hesitation, they voted unanimously to thumb their noses at the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his fundamentalist Islamic followers in Iran 
who have threatened to kill author Salman Rushdie and anyone associated with 
the publication of the book. The book, when copies were available, would be for 
sale at Dutton's. 
</P>
<P>
"They were most adamant in their espousal of free speech and First Amendment 
rights," Dutton said. "I was somewhat taken aback by the vehemence of their 
reaction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented Challenge 
</P>
<P>
Just as the U.S. government has insisted -- with notable deviations -- on a 
policy of rejecting the demands of terrorists, Dutton and many independent 
booksellers across the country have stood on principle in the wake of the 
unprecedented challenge against Rushdie's book. 
</P>
<P>
But for most large companies, the balance between taking a stand and defending 
their workers' safety in the modern age of terrorism is far more ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, security experts say it actually is the much-criticized reaction of 
the large bookstore chains, which cited fears for employee safety and initially 
rushed to pull Rushdie's novel from their shelves, that better typifies 
American business' response to terrorist threats. 
</P>
<P>
At the root of their wariness is not the fear of huge court verdicts if they 
fail to take precautions, experts say; attacks on employees by the world's 
growing supply of extremists are covered by, of all things, the workers' 
compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, concern for a firm's public image and its employees' morale has 
prompted employers to put security first and principle second when compromise 
can preserve the safety of the work force, even if that invites more threats. 
</P>
<P>
Not incidentally, most want to be seen as taking a morally responsible stance. 
</P>
<P>
"The safety of the individual is paramount," said Robert R. Kierce, a 
London-based security official for Trans World Airlines who is chairman of the 
terrorism committee of the American Society for Industrial Security, a national 
group of corporate security and safety officials. 
</P>
<P>
Some threats are shrugged off, usually without consequence. One study, Kierce 
said, found that of 50,000 threats against airliners, none was genuine. 
</P>
<P>
But if a threat materializes and those hurt or endangered can argue that all 
possible precautions were not taken, the impact on a business can be huge. 
</P>
<P>
Witness the debate over whether employees and passengers on Pan American World 
Airways Flight 103, blown up Dec. 21 over Scotland, should have been notified 
of threats aimed at flights from Frankfurt, West Germany, to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors of some of the 270 people killed after the plane exploded have argued 
that the airline or the U.S. government should have let all passengers -- not 
just workers in one or two American embassies -- know of the potential risks of 
taking such flights. Government and airline officials responded that the threat 
was too vague to justify broad notice. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, no company would want to find itself in the position of Hipercor, a 
store in downtown Barcelona, Spain. More than 30 people were hurt when a bomb 
exploded one afternoon in June, 1987. Employees said a warning had been called 
to the store two hours earlier, but managers decided to ignore it because many 
previous threats had gone unrealized. 
</P>
<P>
So most large firms, aided by costly consultants and armed with expansive 
contingency plans, adopt a policy of proceeding with an abundance of caution in 
the face of threatened bombings, kidnapings, assassinations or sabotage, 
specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Responsible to Employees 
</P>
<P>
"We have responsibilities to our employees," said Alan M. Nutes, a Wall Street 
stock brokerage security chief who heads the industrial security society's 
disaster management committee. 
</P>
<P>
Nutes said he would prefer to shut down his firm's trading floor and "take the 
hit of a client not being able to do some buys and trades, rather than having 
one of my employees killed by something going off." 
</P>
<P>
Legally, the company's exposure is not so great, attorneys say. If an employee 
is blown up on the job by a terrorist bomb, his survivors' only recourse is to 
the relatively limited pay outs of the workers' compensation system, just as if 
he'd lost his hand to a drill press or died in a ditch cave-in. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, passengers on an airplane subjected to attack can pursue civil lawsuits 
against an air carrier that may not have taken every step to prevent a 
hijacking, but the pilots and flight attendants cannot, said Matthew Finucane, 
director of air safety for the Assn. of Flight Attendants. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of an employer failing to take the proper precautions during the 
course of a flight, whether you're dealing with the weather or with a 
terrorist, you would be hard-pressed to get around workers' comp," Finucane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But many other considerations beyond the potential for huge lawsuits must be 
weighed as a company considers its response to a fanatic or criminal threat. 
</P>
<P>
Will ignoring a threat from Islamic extremists spur boycotts of the firm's 
products in Arab markets? Will shareholders back home rebel if a giant ransom 
is paid to free a captive executive? Will an employee ever again accept a 
foreign posting if the ransom isn't paid? What is the company's civic 
responsibility in the face of a threat? And what will the consuming public 
think, whichever course is taken? 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a balancing act," said Richard T. Guilmette, director of 
corporate security and safety for Prime Computer Inc. in Natick, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Many large companies have sought to minimize their chances of facing an 
extremist challenge by quietly developing plans to protect top executives. 
</P>
<P>
David L. Berger, a Los Angeles security consultant, said it is not unusual for 
executives based in the United States to be driven to work in bulletproof cars 
by chauffeurs trained in escape techniques. Their children may be escorted to 
and from school. Their homes may include a steel-lined "safe area" filled with 
food and communications gear that can serve as a haven against attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day in the lives of these executives is somehow pre-planned by these 
protective services," Berger said. "It's like having your own Secret Service. 
Then, when they go overseas, it gets worse." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, access to large companies' facilities has been tightened. High-tech 
devices check employees' fingerprints, shoot light beams into their eyes or 
listen to their voice patterns to keep intruders out. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller firms may not have considered the risks as carefully, experts note. At 
his North Hollywood bookstore, for instance, Dutton has only begun thinking 
about whether security needs to be tightened in the wake of his workers' 
decision to sell "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we should be prepared for some kind of an incident," he sighed. "I'm 
just hoping nothing will happen." 
</P>
<P>
(The B. Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble chains reversed themselves Wednesday and 
said they will restock the novel, but Waldenbooks said it would sell it to 
customers only on request.) 
</P>
<P>
When all the precautions have proven inadequate, however, one of the toughest 
decisions a company must make is deciding whether to invite further threats by 
responding to a terrorist demand, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Government policy is clear (if not always followed, as the Iran-Contra affair 
underscored): No negotiations with terrorists, because to do so simply 
encourages more threats. 
</P>
<P>
"Governments say, 'We have to protect our sovereignty and we can't be pushed 
around by gunmen waving Kalashnikovs," said Peter Cheney, vice president for 
North American operations of Control Risks Ltd., a London-based security 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Private industry, however, tends to place the safe resolution of an immediate 
threat first, leaving the longer-term ramifications to be dealt with later, 
Cheney and other experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, many large multinational companies keep funds on hand to ransom overseas 
executives. Airlines try to talk hijackers off planes. Employers evacuate 
buildings in response to even vague bomb threats. And consumer product firms 
recall huge batches of goods at the hint of tampering. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is never easy. "If you evacuate every time you have a bomb threat, 
the chances are you will have more bomb threats," said John D. Case, a security 
consultant in San Diego. "If you don't evacuate, you always have the problem of 
somebody actually doing something, and you have to live with that threat 
hanging over your head." 
</P>
<P>
Nutes knows well the pitfalls. When he was in the military, one of the 
installations at which he was responsible for security fell victim to 152 bomb 
threats in a single month. Over and over he ordered evacuations. But no bomb 
ever exploded. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out it was a 9-year-old girl who didn't want to go to school," Nutes 
recalled. "By reacting the way the person wanted us to, it just enhanced their 
will to do it more."

RETAIL PRICE RISE IS HIGHEST IN 2 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
GREENSPAN CALLS 0.6% JANUARY FIGURE DISTURBING; INTEREST RATE BOOST SEEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Consumer prices leaped forward 0.6% in January, the largest such increase in 
two years, the Labor Department said Wednesday in a report that rattled 
financial markets and raised the specter of higher interest rates as the 
Federal Reserve cracks down. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, alerting Congress for the second 
time in as many days to the perils of accelerating inflation, labeled the 
unexpectedly high jump in prices "disturbing" and "worrisome." He warned that 
the nation's economy may be faced with a no-win choice between still higher 
inflation and a serious recession if the central bank does not succeed in 
damping the price pressures now. 
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street, share prices tumbled from the opening bell and the Dow Jones 
industrial average ended the day down 42.50 points, apparently bringing the new 
year's rally to a halt. (Details in Business.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fed Likely to Act 
</P>
<P>
Investors apparently saw the price figures as strong new provocation for the 
Fed to push interest rates sharply higher to curb the surge, crimping economic 
growth in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"There is little doubt that inflation is rising," said Donald Straszheim, an 
analyst at the Merrill Lynch brokerage firm in New York. "The question now is 
not whether there will be worse inflation this year, but how bad the numbers 
become . . . . I think Greenspan knows the next step is a wage-price spiral and 
that's why he will keep tightening" credit. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.6% January consumer price increase, after two consecutive months of 
modest 0.3% rises, was the largest advance in the consumer price index since 
January, 1987, when it jumped 0.7%. More ominous, perhaps, was the fact that 
wholesale prices for the period, reported two weeks ago, moved ahead a full 
percentage point, almost certainly foreshadowing still more retail inflation in 
the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of that wholesale jump, economists had been prepared for an 
inflationary advance of about 0.5%. But a price surge of 0.5% outside the 
volatile categories of energy and food gave them particular pause. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not good . . . " said David Wyss, of Data Resources Inc., the 
Lexington, Mass., economic forecasting firm. "The mix that made up the number 
is worse than we expected." Wyss' firm now sees inflation at an annual rate of 
more than 5% this winter, tapering off only slightly later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Straszheim predicted that annual inflation could hit 5.5% to 6%. The rate for 
1988 and 1987 was 4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, in his second day of congressional testimony on the Fed's monetary 
policy, said a recent rise in wage costs was probably the reason that prices at 
the consumer level were beginning to climb more rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
"What is worrisome is the fact that there is a trend," Greenspan told a House 
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs subcommittee. He stressed the central bank's 
determination to fight inflation by trying to slow economic growth with higher 
interest rates. "The purpose of our policy is to make certain that trend does 
not continue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Danger of Recession 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan was blunt about the potential costs if the Fed's credit tightening 
fails to curb escalating inflation. "If inflation re-emerges, I think a 
recession will move up on us much more quickly than we can imagine," he warned. 
"And when it occurs, it will be a prolonged one." 
</P>
<P>
There were few redeeming features in Wednesday's Labor Department report. One 
was that several of the large increases in categories other than food and 
energy could be explained away as once-a-year price increases that most likely 
will not recur until next January. 
</P>
<P>
Among these, noted Stacy Kottman of the economic forecasting project at Georgia 
State University in Atlanta, could be the 0.8% increases in medical care and 
medical services. Both probably were magnified by annual increases in insurance 
premiums that click in during January. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, prices for new cars -- up 0.7% -- and auto financing charges -- up 
1.6% -- reflected the fact that special industry rebates for car and truck 
purchases lapsed in January. The rebates were largely reinstated by 
mid-February, suggesting that car price inflation, at least, will moderate in 
the next price report a month from now. 
</P>
<P>
"January is a time of year when you have price changes in quite a few 
services," Kottman said. "These won't continue at this rate as you go through 
the year, so we won't get this much inflation all year." 
</P>
<P>
But the broad range of the price trend was seen as alarming, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
The price of admission to theaters, movies, concerts and other performing arts 
increased 1.2% during the month, helping push the entertainment category up 
0.8%. Food prices rose 0.7%, driven primarily by steep, drought-caused advances 
of more than a percentage point for beef, pork and poultry. The price of motor 
fuels jumped 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, consumer price inflation was moving at an annual rate of more than 7% 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
Even without food and energy, the annual rate of inflation last month was about 
6%. So Wednesday's forecasts of inflation later in the year moderating to a 
range between 5% and 6% seemed at best cold comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Before seasonal adjustment, the consumer price index advanced 0.6 to 121.1 of 
its 1982-1984 base of 100, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods 
costing $100 during the base period would have cost $121.10 in January, 60 
cents more than in December. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles-Anaheim-Long Beach metropolitan area, consumer prices rose 
0.3% without seasonal adjustment, and, over the last 12 months, prices in the 
metropolitan area were up 4.8%, compared to a 4.7% increase nationwide.

Federal agents swept through Los Angeles' downtown jewelry district Wednesday, 
breaking up what they described as an international scheme in which more than 
$1 billion from cocaine sales was laundered for Latin American drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
At least 24 people, many of them jewelers, were charged here. Seven others were 
charged in New York and Florida. Authorities said the money-laundering scheme 
was the largest and one of the most elaborate of its kind ever uncovered in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles contend that for the 
last three years, jewelers allegedly involved in the ring quietly collected 
carton after carton of drug money packed like bricks and shipped by armored car 
from a web of contacts in Los Angeles, New York City and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counted on Machines 
</P>
<P>
In several back rooms of Los Angeles' downtown jewelry district, authorities 
said, the flow of drug money was so overwhelming that the cash -- which the 
merchants falsely reported as legitimate jewelry profits -- had to be counted 
on sophisticated high-speed machines. The money was then transported by 
couriers to various Los Angeles banks. 
</P>
<P>
Then, according to agents, the illicit money was wired to contacts in 
Montevideo, Uruguay, and Panama City, Panama, and used to export even greater 
quantities of cocaine to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A prosecutor said he spent months surreptitiously watching some of the suspects 
spend all day counting cash from drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, meanwhile, hailed the investigation as a major 
blow to international drug trafficking. "This Administration is committed to 
tracking down those who profit from all aspects of illegal drug trade," he said 
in a statement issued in Washington after the raids. "One way to do this is to 
deny the profits of the business to those who import drugs into our nation." 
</P>
<P>
More than 640 pounds of cocaine was seized in the raids. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of personnel from half a dozen federal agencies and local police 
departments began making arrests in the 13-month investigation, code-named 
"Operation Polar Cap," just as most merchants in the jewelry district began 
opening for business Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators simultaneously raided at least six locations in the district, 
causing traffic jams and moving with what stunned workers in the area described 
as SWAT-like precision. Scores of workers poured onto the sidewalks to watch as 
jewelers were led away in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
In all, authorities obtained arrest warrants for 28 people in Los Angeles -- 
many of them Lebanese and Syrian nationals -- five in New York and two in 
Miami. Eight of the suspects were still being sought late Wednesday. The 
suspects were expected to be prosecuted on charges of conspiracy to sell and 
possess cocaine and defraud the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
Agents identified one of the masterminds of the scheme as Nazareth Andonian, 
33, of La Crescenta, who, along with his brother, Vahe, operates Andonian 
Brothers Inc., doing business as Nazareth Jewelers, at 220 W. 5th St. 
</P>
<P>
The other alleged ring leader was identified as Northridge resident Wanis 
(Joseph) Koyomejian, 47, the owner of Ropex Corp., which has two ninth-floor 
suites in the Jewelry Mart Building. Ropex also has maintained offices in New 
York and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Russell Hayman, who is prosecuting the case, argued in 
court Wednesday that those accused in the case, especially Koyomejian, should 
be held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Hayman said the government had conducted "intensive electronics surveillance" 
on Koyomejian and the others, including court-authorized room bugs, telephone 
wiretaps and hidden video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"Your honor," he told U.S. Magistrate Ralph Geffen, "I have watched this 
defendant on almost a daily basis since September of 1988 counting money. . . . 
They spend their day counting money. That may be hard to believe, but in a 
billion-dollar money-laundering operation, that takes a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
Hayman argued that Koyomejian is a flight risk because he is not a U.S. 
citizen, holds a Syrian passport, travels abroad extensively, has been 
overheard discussing plans to flee the country and has Swiss bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Public Defender Peter Horstman pointed out that Koyomejian has no prior 
criminal record and has "substantial" family and community ties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Center of Scheme 
</P>
<P>
Geffen nonetheless ordered him detained without bail, calling him a "major 
factor in this alleged conspiracy of monumental proportions. . . . It appears 
it would take more than money to keep him in this country, given his importance 
to the scheme." 
</P>
<P>
A man answering the phone Wednesday at Koyomejian's home in Northridge said, 
"We have no comment about anything" and hung up. 
</P>
<P>
While several others arrested in the investigation also were ordered held 
without bail, Geffen released jeweler Hamyak Atayan, 54, of Encino, on $500,000 
bail. Atayan operates Atayan &amp; Sons Jewelers at 650 S. Hill St. 
</P>
<P>
Atayan's attorney, Erroll Stambler, denied that his client participated in any 
illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
According to court affidavits filed in the case, FBI agents first got wind of 
the scheme early last year, when informants in New York City tipped agents that 
money from cocaine sales in uptown Manhattan was being laundered through 
Andonian's business interests in New York. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, suspicious Wells Fargo Bank officials in Los Angeles 
notified federal authorities that the Andonian brothers had deposited $25 
million in cash over a three-month period, documents show. 
</P>
<P>
Agents found that both the Andonians and Koyomejian had allegedly doctored 
invoices to show that their cash flow was coming from jewelry sales to 
wholesalers. However, when investigators tried to contact those buyers, they 
discovered that many of them did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants operating near the Andonian brothers' Los Angeles shop said they had 
marveled over the past few years at how fast the business appeared to grow, but 
no one interviewed said they suspected illegal activities at the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Koyomejian's business neighbors, meanwhile, said they were unfamiliar with the 
company and rarely saw people at the offices, where curtains were generally 
drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Several jewelers expressed little surprise to see a major police action in the 
district, but said they were surprised at the reason. 
</P>
<P>
Most thought that the arrests had to do with a continuing investigation by the 
Los Angeles district attorney into "short weighting," or mismarking of gold 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, investigators with the district attorney's consumer fraud 
unit served search warrants on several jewelry business in the downtown 
district. They seized some gold jewelry to be tested for its purity, according 
to district attorney's spokesman Al Albergate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cause for Concern 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney launched the investigation after allegations that some 
businesses were advertising gold products as 14 karat in weight, when in fact 
they were 10 karat or less, Albergate said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, coupled with the money-laundering case, concerns many in the 
business who fear that upscale customers who frequent the market for its lower 
prices will become disillusioned and stop shopping downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Shapiro, president of the Diamond Club of the West Coast and a member of 
the board of the Wholesale Jewelers Assn., said most dealers in the district 
are responsible, law abiding and adhere to the jewelers' credo: 
"Responsibility, reliability and integrity." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles jewelry mart has grown rapidly in the last 12 years to become 
second only to New York in terms of annual sales -- estimated at more than $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Jewelry dealers occupied just a few aging buildings in the mid-1970s, but now 
an estimated 2,000 dealers fill more than a dozen major buildings along Hill, 
6th and 7th streets. 
</P>
<P>
In any one of these buildings, shoppers hear a cacophony of languages -- 
including Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Armenian, Persian and Eastern European -- 
in a business dominated by immigrants.

Washington contributed to this story.

EXON WILL VOTE NO, NUNN WAVERS ON TOWER SUPPORT

In a blow to John Tower's bid for confirmation as defense secretary, the 
second-ranking Democrat on the committee weighing his nomination announced 
Wednesday that he would vote against Tower. Also Wednesday, the panel's 
chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), sharply disputed President Bush's contention 
that Tower has been cleared by a lengthy FBI investigation into allegations of 
personal and financial misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
A senior White House official said Wednesday evening that Bush expects Nunn to 
vote against Tower, making the troubled confirmation "an uphill battle." Vice 
President Dan Quayle has been assigned to a last-ditch effort to round up 
pro-Tower votes while Bush is in Asia on a state visit. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.) said that, after reviewing hundreds of pages of FBI 
reports on Tower's drinking habits, "it is my considered judgment that we 
should look elsewhere for a secretary of defense." 
</P>
<P>
He said that while testimony had not proven conclusively that Tower currently 
has a drinking problem, "we can't take that risk for a man in that position. We 
need a 24-hour-a-day secretary of defense." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, meanwhile, dropped the strongest hint so far that he would vote against 
Tower's confirmation. He said that he has "continuing concerns" about the 
former Texas senator's fitness to serve as defense secretary and is awaiting 
additional documents from the White House before deciding how he will vote. 
</P>
<P>
But he strongly disagreed with Bush's statement Tuesday that the FBI had 
"gunned down" the numerous allegations against Tower. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the President's opinion. That is not my opinion," Nunn told reporters 
after a three-hour closed-door meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
The panel will resume meeting in executive session today, with a late-afternoon 
vote possible. 
</P>
<P>
Exon predicted a close vote in the committee, saying that many Senate Democrats 
are watching Nunn, the most respected voice on defense matters on Capitol Hill, 
for a signal on how they should cast their votes. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said that he hopes the panel can vote today and send the embattled 
nomination to the full Senate but he would not predict when the committee would 
receive the new material and conclude its debate. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has requested information about Tower's personal behavior in 
Geneva while he was chief of a U.S. arms control delegation there in 1985-86. 
According to sources, witnesses told the FBI that Tower dated women staffers 
while his wife was out of town, hurting morale, embarrassing the delegation and 
disrupting business and social engagements. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also is seeking data on an oil-rig investment that Tower made while 
he was still in the Senate. Published reports this week said that Tower was 
steered to the profitable deal by the father of a Texas man whom Tower had 
recommended for a federal judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said that the FBI's voluminous report on Tower allows "different 
interpretations" of the same facts and allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), the committee's senior Republican, said: "It is my 
judgment that reasonable men and women can look at those sets of facts and can 
have reasonable differences of opinion." Warner remains undecided on the Tower 
nomination and those familiar with his thinking say that he is agonizing over 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Warner is under strong White House pressure to vigorously back Tower and lead 
other Republicans in a united front. 
</P>
<P>
Tower served for 24 years as a GOP senator from Texas, retiring in 1985 after 
four years as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. His confirmation has 
been delayed by intense scrutiny of his alleged heavy drinking and womanizing 
and questions about his business dealings as a highly paid consultant to 
several major defense contractors after leaving the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn's and Warner's comments appear to presage a sharp party-line division in 
the committee when the Tower nomination finally comes to a vote. There are 11 
Democrats and nine Republicans on the committee and Democrats hold a 55-45 edge 
in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Comments from other committee members Wednesday reflected that split. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Timothy E. Wirth, (D-Colo.) said that he remains "deeply skeptical" about 
Tower's fitness to head the Pentagon. Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan said that 
Bush's characterization of the FBI report is "not an accurate description of 
that file." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans were generally supportive of the nominee's chances after reviewing 
the 140-page FBI report. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said that he has seen nothing in the report to 
disqualify the Texan from serving as defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been at this now for 10 weeks. We're starting to affect national 
security. This process could go on forever. We need a secretary of defense," 
McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.), a Tower supporter, urged a quick vote, saying: 
"How much more can we learn about him?" 
</P>
<P>
In the final hours before the vote, Vice President Quayle "is going to be 
trying to round up votes while Bush is out of the country," a senior White 
House official said. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said that the Armed Services Committee expects to receive a report today 
from a House panel that is conducting its own investigation of improper 
activities in the Geneva arms delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Berne Indahl, a State Department security officer who had been sent to Geneva 
in 1986 to investigate allegations of security breaches, told the House 
committee over the weekend that his inquiry has turned up allegations of 
personal impropriety against Tower, reportedly involving liaisons with two 
women staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the panel, said after the 
closed-door session with Indahl that the State Department "does have certain 
other relevant information on (Tower's) activities in Geneva." 
</P>
<P>
"This information has not been previously provided either to the subcommittee, 
the Senate (Armed Services) committee, the FBI or the White House," Dingell 
said. "We are requesting that information be made available to us punctually 
and promptly."

FPPC JOINS LAWMAKER IN URGING 8-BILL ETHICS PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state's often criticized political watchdog agency, the Fair Political 
Practices Commission, joined forces Wednesday with a crusading freshman 
legislator to propose a comprehensive package of ethics legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-bill ethics package, the most sweeping to be introduced in the 
aftermath of the FBI's investigation of Capitol corruption, would, among other 
things, ban the pervasive practice of legislators accepting expensive gifts and 
honorariums from special interests. 
</P>
<P>
FPPC Chairman John Larson told reporters that he believes the Legislature is 
finally "in the position to act" on political reform. He contended that 
lawmakers are not inherently unethical but are bedeviled by a system in which 
there is "a lot of temptation" to do wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for people to turn down things that are offered," Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Disclosure 
</P>
<P>
In addition to banning gifts and speech-making fees, the FPPC-backed bills 
would beef up financial disclosure requirements and lock the political 
"revolving door" that allows legislators and Administration officials to move 
between government and lobbying jobs. Top Administration officials and 
legislators could not lobby the Legislature for one year after leaving their 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also would close a loophole in the Political Reform Act of 1974 
that prevents prosecution of elected state officeholders involved in conflicts 
of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Two other bills included in the package but not yet endorsed by the FPPC would 
ban fund raising in non-election years and prohibit members of the State Board 
of Equalization from voting on tax cases involving campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the FPPC's legislative agenda is being carried by Democratic 
Assemblyman Ted Lempert, 27, of San Mateo, who won his seat last November by 
running against the Sacramento "system" -- even as his campaign was being 
partly underwritten by Assembly Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Larson and the FPPC would leave the fate of its ethics package to 
a first-term lawmaker with little clout underscores the difficulties faced by 
political reformers in the Capitol and the sensitive nature of the ethics 
debate itself. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Democratic leaders, particularly Speaker Willie Brown, want to give 
Lempert, who was the first Democrat in this century to be elected from his 
largely Republican district south of San Francisco, a chance to make good on 
his campaign promises to help reform the political process. 
</P>
<P>
But the leadership has given Lempert no assurances that any of his bills will 
pass. Moreover, Brown and other legislative leaders from both parties have 
taken liberal advantage of large speaking fees, free trips and gifts that would 
be banned by the legislative package. 
</P>
<P>
According to FPPC figures, the 120 members of the Legislature received nearly 
$3.2 million worth of gifts and honorariums in a three-year period ending in 
1977. Speaker Brown alone collected more than $161,000 in gifts and speaking 
fees during 1987, including expense-paid trips to Austria, Great Britain, 
Ireland and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"I've let (the leadership) know what my proposals are but they haven't given me 
a firm commitment one way or the other," Lempert sheepishly told reporters. 
"There has been a lot of talk, a lot of people saying this is the time to get 
something through. Hopefully we will be able to surprise some people." 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC's decision to adopt a high profile on the ethics issue follows a 
period in which it increasingly has been accused of dealing timidly with 
legislators. It also represents somewhat of a turnaround for Larson, who took 
office in 1986 convinced that the watchdog commission should spend more time 
educating politicians and less time investigating their activities. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Larson said he thinks the system has gotten out of control. "Most 
people who make $50,000 or $60,000 a year don't expect others to give them 
$1,000 gifts or $1,000 speaking fees," he told reporters. "It appears to the 
public that (special interests) are getting something for their money." 
</P>
<P>
A number of lawmakers have introduced their own ethics bills in hopes of 
softening the perception of wrongdoing triggered by the FBI's raid last August 
on the Capitol offices of four legislators and two aides. 
</P>
<P>
None of these bills will be set for a vote until the Assembly's Committee on 
Ethics makes its own recommendations, which is not expected until shortly 
before the Legislature adjourns this fall.

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST CALLS FOR REPEAL OF CAP ON SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth G. Hill called Wednesday for repeal of the 
voter-approved state spending limit and an increase in the gasoline tax. She 
also sharply criticized Gov. George Deukmejian's budget-balancing proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature's nonpartisan budget analyst, in adding her name to a growing 
list of officials calling for repeal of the limit, said the expenditure cap 
will "hamper the state's ability to provide the services needed to keep 
California's economy running efficiently and economically." 
</P>
<P>
Hill's comments on the limit and other issues came with release of her analysis 
of Deukmejian's proposed $47.8-billion state budget for the 1989-90 fiscal year 
that will begin July 1. Each year, the analyst's exhaustive survey becomes the 
"Bible" that legislative budget committees use in their own review of the 
governor's spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
Hill recommended that the Legislature submit to the voters a constitutional 
amendment that would repeal the spending limit. Such an amendment would be 
required, because it was the voters who originally placed the spending limit in 
the California Constitution in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Hill also recommended that the Legislature raise the gasoline tax six cents a 
gallon to correct what transportation officials say is a $4.5-billion deficit 
in the five-year State Transportation Improvement Program. Hill said the only 
alternative to raising the tax is cutting back on highway construction and 
maintenance, which she said would hurt the state. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to criticizing various Deukmejian spending proposals, Hill's budget 
review also accuses Los Angeles County officials of mishandling collection of 
child-support payments. 
</P>
<P>
The budget review says the state could have recouped more than $22 million that 
it paid out in welfare payments to impoverished children if Los Angeles County 
had done even an average job in collecting support payments. The county also 
deprived children who do not receive public assistance of $25 million in 
support payments they should have received from non-custodial parents, the 
analyst says. 
</P>
<P>
Hill says the state should step in and devise a three-year plan to improve the 
county's performance, which she said was the worst in the state. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Hill recommends a combination of cuts and increases in the governor's 
budget that would provide the Legislature with an additional $244 million to 
spend. Included in the recommendations are proposals to reduce expenditures by 
$191 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very tight budget," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gloomy Analysis 
</P>
<P>
Overall, this budget analysis is decidedly gloomier than those issued in recent 
years, with Hill saying state finances are in their worst shape since the 
recession wreaked havoc on government finances 1982. 
</P>
<P>
During a Capitol press conference, Hill repeated past warnings that the state 
would need an additional $1.6 billion in tax revenues if it wants to continue 
services it provided this year and rebuild the budget reserve to $1.1 billion. 
Deukmejian is insisting on a "prudent" budget reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The analyst said the state finished the last budget year on June 30 with a 
deficit of at least $200 million and added that "our current estimates indicate 
that a second deficit is now likely" during the current budget year. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian so far is the only major player in the budget process who has not 
acknowledged the deficit in last year's budget. Others who agree that there was 
a deficit, while disagreeing on how large it was, are state Controller Gray 
Davis, Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes and the state auditor general. 
</P>
<P>
Hill criticized many of Deukmejian's proposed budget moves, saying the governor 
and his advisers balanced the budget by making decisions that ultimately could 
prove costly to the state. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that Deukmejian's budget defers "virtually all preventive 
maintenance" on state highways for two years. Preventive maintenance costs 
about $5,000 per lane-mile, but it heads off "rehabilitative work which costs 
about $100,000 per lane-mile," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prison Criticism 
</P>
<P>
The analyst also said the governor's proposal to save money by delaying the 
opening of two new state prisons will intensify overcrowding at other prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Even Deukmejian's plan to partially finance county trial courts will end up 
costing counties more, Hill said, "because the increase in costs for 
state-required programs will outpace the increase in funding to be provided 
under the program." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the analyst criticized a Deukmejian Administration proposal to 
save $163.5 million in budget-year retirement costs by making a trade-off that 
will eventually commit the state to an additional $400 million a year in annual 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's proposed elimination of the Office of Family Planning, which 
provides abortion counseling and birth control information, would also be 
penny-wise and pound foolish, Hill said. By eliminating the agency, the state 
would save $36 million annually. But Hill said the program is cost effective in 
eliminating unwanted pregnancies, particularly for poor women who have to rely 
on the state for medical and other health and welfare services. 
</P>
<P>
Hill also warned that Deukmejian's decision to finance a state health-care 
program for poor Californians from cigarette tax receipts raised as a result of 
Proposition 99, the tobacco tax initiative, could backfire because the higher 
tax may discourage people from smoking. The initiative imposed a 25-cent-a-pack 
increase on cigarettes and comparable increases on other tobacco products.

CENTER THOUGHT UNLIKELY TO BE NAMED FOR KING

One day after the San Diego Board of Port Commissioners refused to rename the 
city's new $160-million harbor-side convention center after the Rev. Martin 
Luther King Jr., Mayor Maureen O'Connor said Wednesday that chances now are 
slim that the structure would be named for the slain civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around politics long enough to know that, realistically, you should 
not hold out much hope that the convention center is going to be named for 
Martin Luther King Jr.," O'Connor said at a press conference at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a San Diego black leader on Wednesday launched a campaign for a 
nationwide boycott of the convention center, which is due to open on Oct. 31. 
The Rev. George Stevens said he will try to pattern the boycott after a 
successful one in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
There, blacks and others were urged by community activists not to travel to the 
state because former Gov. Evan Mecham canceled a state holiday honoring King. 
The resulting protest cost Arizona significant convention business. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has been embroiled in controversy on the sensitive matter of a 
tribute to King. Two years ago, the City Council voted to rename Market Street 
as Martin Luther King Jr. Way. That decision was overturned by voters in a 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of changing the name of the new convention center maintained that it 
would confuse tourists and hurt the city's convention business. They said the 
new facility already was being billed to out-of-towners as the San Diego 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor expressed disappointment and surprise at the Board of Port 
Commissioners' 4-3 decision to propose turning the center's outdoor bay-front 
terrace into an "Avenue of Honors" and make King its first inductee. But 
O'Connor said that it may be time for the council to compromise on the issue in 
order to end divisiveness and racial animosity that has surrounded debate on 
the subject. The council has not yet scheduled new hearings on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vote on Renaming 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 10, seven members of the nine-member City Council voted for the name 
change. The council directed its three appointees to the Board of Port 
Commissioners -- a seven-member body composed of representatives of the five 
cities ringing San Diego Bay -- to vote for the renaming. 
</P>
<P>
Those three votes plus another from the appointee from National City, whose 
City Council also favored changing the name, seemed to assure a majority. But 
at a contentious commission meeting Tuesday, San Diego appointee Dan Larsen was 
the swing vote on the Avenue of Honors proposal. The commissioners never voted 
on the proposal to name the entire center for King. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen maintained that he had not changed his mind but that the Avenue of 
Honors proposal was something new and that the City Council "deserved the 
opportunity to take a look" at it. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista's representative on the commission, Robert Penner, proposed the 
Avenue of Honors. He said he was seeking a consensus on how to find a tribute 
to King. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District is building the new convention center, which the city will 
operate. Both must approve any name change. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wes Pratt, the only black on the council, called the Avenue of 
Honors "an inadequate compromise." Pratt, who represents the largely black 
southeast section of the city, said he would press the City Council to reject 
the new proposal and reaffirm naming the center after King.

ORTEGA TALKS WITH OPPOSITION ON NICARAGUA VOTE

<P>
Facing demands that he rule out his own candidacy and remove the army from 
politics, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega began meeting with opposition 
leaders Wednesday to negotiate rules for next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, expected to last several weeks, are the first step taken under a new 
agreement among five Central American presidents to close Nicaraguan rebel 
camps in Honduras in exchange for political reforms in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's Sandinista government is obliged under the accord signed last week to 
hold general elections by Feb. 25, 1990, and to amend its electoral law to 
assure an open and fair campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders said they will use the talks not only to seek specific 
changes in that law but also to press for constitutional amendments they 
consider necessary to compete on an equal footing with the Marxist-oriented 
government. 
</P>
<P>
One oft-mentioned demand would keep any president from being succeeded by 
himself or a close relative. This is meant to prevent a new dynasty like the 
four-decade Somoza family dictatorship that ended with the 1979 Sandinista 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Another demand would turn the Sandinista People's Army into a "national army" 
and end the ruling party's monopoly on political indoctrination among its 
85,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Sandinistas do not make a clear distinction between the party and the 
army and the state, they will keep their tremendous advantage," said Jose 
Antonio Bonilla, a spokesman for the 14-party opposition bloc. "If the army can 
vote, other parties should have a right to campaign within its ranks." 
</P>
<P>
In recent statements, Ortega appeared to reject those demands. Without 
declaring himself a candidate, he said that "reelection is no crime." At a 
Sandinista rally Tuesday night, he accused opposition leaders of seeking 
"anti-democratic" changes to stack the political process in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
"They put their hopes in the Contras or a Yankee invasion," Ortega told tens of 
thousands of supporters. "Now that they are left without those options, they 
are clinging to (demands for) constitutional reform, because what they want is 
simply for the people to step back and let them take over." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega met separately Wednesday with leaders of three parties, starting with 
Clemente Guido, the Conservative runner-up in the 1984 presidential election. 
That election was marred by the withdrawal of the main opposition coalition, 
which charged that the rules favored the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Ortega hinted at his willingness to make some narrow changes, 
such as lifting a ban on campaign funding from abroad. His aides said he might 
also expand the five-seat national electoral council, on which the Sandinistas 
now have three places, to give a broader range of opposition groups half of the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
While the president is obliged by last week's accord to give each party equal 
time on state radio and television, some opposition leaders said they will 
demand a television station of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The five-nation accord calls for international observers to monitor the 
fairness of the election throughout a four-month political organizing period 
and a six-month campaign. 
</P>
<P>
That gives Ortega two months to negotiate new election rules before the other 
four nations must meet their end of the bargain: to draft a plan by mid-May to 
disarm the idled, U.S.-backed Contra army and close its Honduran sanctuaries.

SALVADOR MILITARY CALLS REBEL PEACE BID A MARXIST PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A revised peace plan offered by Salvadoran guerrillas was described Wednesday 
by the Defense Ministry as part of a "sinister strategic plan of 
Marxism-Leninism," leaving only a faint hope for a negotiated end to El 
Salvador's nine-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The military's negative statement was seconded by a senior government official 
who is a major figure in the ruling Christian Democratic Party. "The plan 
obviously is fatally flawed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rejections came a day after leaders of El Salvador's 13 political parties 
met in Mexico with commanders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, 
the umbrella organization for the five Salvadoran guerrilla groups. 
</P>
<P>
Ending two days of talks in Mexico, the FMLN said it would accept the 
legitimacy of elections, negotiate a cease-fire and ultimately disband the 
7,000-man guerrilla army. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the guerrillas demanded postponement until July of presidential 
elections now scheduled for March 19, reorganization of the electoral process 
to guarantee free participation by the FMLN and its supporters, reduction of 
the army from 56,000 to 12,000 -- the level when the civil war began -- 
reorganization of security forces and prosecution of military personnel for 
human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
The military and President Jose Napoleon Duarte have maintained since the FMLN 
first proposed last month that the elections be delayed that any postponement 
past March would be an unacceptable violation of the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
That position, supported by the U.S. Embassy, deepened after the rebel 
proposals in Mexico for cutting the army and prosecuting military personnel for 
human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"While millions of Salvadorans clamor for peace and reject violence, death and 
destruction," said a Defense Ministry statement, "the FMLN, represented in 
Mexico by four terrorist leaders, is launching the sinister strategic plans of 
Marxism-Leninism in order to obtain power." 
</P>
<P>
Even Hector Silva, a leader of the Democratic Convergence, a coalition of 
socialist and leftist parties backed by the FMLN and already taking part in the 
elections, said there is no chance of delaying the vote. 
</P>
<P>
There is a slim chance, however, that the peace process can be kept alive. The 
representatives of the 13 parties who sent delegates to Mexico said they will 
recommend that the Duarte government and the army meet again with the FMLN 
leaders to discuss the rebel proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-backed government is unlikely to reject a call by more than a dozen 
political parties, including the ruling Christian Democrats, for talks because 
it does not want to take the blame for seeming to block peace efforts on the 
eve of elections. 
</P>
<P>
As a European diplomat put it, "The game is to get the other side to make the 
final break and take the blame for restarting the killing." 
</P>
<P>
He said the only hope is that further negotiations will develop a momentum of 
their own, with neither side wanting to appear at fault for a collapse of the 
peace effort. 
</P>
<P>
The talks would be the first between the government and rebels since 1987 -- 
and the first to include the political parties. Duarte held three rounds of 
negotiations with the guerrillas in the last five years, but none were 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
A European diplomat observing the talks said the U.S. response to the proposal 
will be the key. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that could make the armed forces come around would be if 
Washington says, 'We want this,' " he said. "But that is difficult for them to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, while showing flexibility at the negotiating table, flexed their 
military muscle in El Salvador to show that they are not dealing out of 
weakness. In recent days they have stepped up attacks and sabotage, blacking 
out electricity Wednesday in 40% of the country, including nearly all of San 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"The logic of the war continues while we make efforts for a peaceful solution," 
rebel commander Francisco Jovel, known as Roberto Roca, said. 
</P>
<P>
Freed reported from San Salvador and Miller from Mexico City.

CHANGING TIMES: MOSCOW YESHIVA OPENS

When Shimon Yusim began studying Hebrew clandestinely a year ago with a group 
of friends in a Moscow apartment, he knew he was taking a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Helin Lipskerov knew that she, too, was treading on dangerous ground when she 
bought a Torah five years ago on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
Those days of risk seemed to fade into the distance Wednesday as Yusim and 
Lipskerov attended an event they would once have thought miraculous -- a 
ceremony marking the opening of the Soviet Union's first legal yeshiva, or 
Jewish religious school, since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
"Praise the Lord, for He is good; this is a great moment for us," Rabbi Joel 
Poupko said in Hebrew to about 200 assembled Jews. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Understood Words 
</P>
<P>
Many did not understand a word he said, but the sound of the ancient language 
being spoken openly in Moscow brought a round of applause. 
</P>
<P>
It was an emotional moment for Poupko, whose grandfather was jailed in 1926 for 
conducting Jewish studies and trying to open a yeshiva. Poupko, his voice 
breaking, said, "We are fulfilling the duty of our forefathers." 
</P>
<P>
He read a message from Israeli President Chaim Herzog, who praised the 
inauguration of the yeshiva as "an opening of a small window." 
</P>
<P>
Times are changing quickly for Jews in this officially atheistic state. In 
recent weeks, B'nai B'rith, the international Jewish organization, opened a 
chapter here, a Jewish cultural center was permitted to open -- the first in 
more than 50 years -- and the Soviet Union gave visiting Israeli diplomats 
permission to use their embassy building, which was closed when Moscow and 
Jerusalem severed diplomatic relations 21 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We are at a critical turning point," said Yusim, 24, who wore a yarmulke, the 
traditional head covering, and carried a book entitled "Beginning Hebrew." 
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic about the future," he said. "But I also think that while we 
can, we Jews must gather closer together so we can stand strong against 
reactionary forces." 
</P>
<P>
Until very recently, religious studies were illegal in the Soviet Union. Hebrew 
teachers gave lessons so secretly that many Jews did not even know it was 
possible to learn the language here. When caught, teachers were often jailed on 
charges of espousing anti-Soviet propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
But under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Communist Party has eased 
religious restrictions in an apparent effort to eliminate an issue that has 
sparked angry exchanges with the United States and other Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev may see this as a way to improve international relations, but for 
Soviet Jews it has provided an opportunity to explore their Jewish history. 
</P>
<P>
"When I finished at the university and was trying to get work, I was turned 
down for several jobs and was allowed to know that it was because I was 
Jewish," said Lipskerov, 35, who now works as a pharmaceutical researcher. "I 
knew then that I did not belong with the Russian people, but I knew nothing 
about being Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to realize that I belonged nowhere. Now that things seem freer, I began 
studying Hebrew three weeks ago. My hope is to have a chance to explore my 
Jewish roots." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Years of Secret Effort 
</P>
<P>
Hanoch Teller, an Israeli who grew up in Stamford, Conn., and now lives in 
Jerusalem, said the founding of the yeshiva is the result of years of 
clandestine work. 
</P>
<P>
"Jews such as myself from abroad used to come in every several months to try to 
help organize it," he said. "Finally it has paid off." 
</P>
<P>
Eighty students have been accepted for the first classes, which will be taught 
by five rabbis, three from Israel and two from the United States. The Soviet 
government will provide stipends for the students, and other financial support 
will come from a group of Israeli and American philanthropists.

AT ISRAEL FORUM, PLO VIDEO URGES TALKS

The Palestine Liberation Organization made a novel effort to influence Israeli 
public opinion Wednesday by means of a videotape, shown at a Jerusalem peace 
symposium, in which a top PLO official appeals for direct talks with Israel's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
No one could remember a PLO official addressing the Israeli public in such a 
way, even in a closed forum. It was the latest development in a recent string 
of contacts between leftist, dovish Israelis and PLO sympathizers here and PLO 
members abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian speaker on the tape is Salah Khalaf, a deputy to PLO Chairman 
Yasser Arafat. Khalaf, who uses the code name Abu Iyad, is regarded as an 
inflexible hard-liner among PLO officials. 
</P>
<P>
"All security arrangements and guarantees can be discussed in direct meetings," 
Khalaf said. "Then, if we reach agreement, as I am sure we shall, we can take 
this agreement to an international conference where the entire world can be a 
witness to these security arrangements, so that not a single loophole will be 
left to spoil it." 
</P>
<P>
The offer appeared to put a new face on the PLO's demand that an international 
peace conference, under U.N. auspices, be convened to settle the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel has refused to talk with the PLO under any 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The Khalaf tape, smuggled into Israel via Paris from PLO headquarters in Tunis, 
was shown at a symposium organized by the International Center for Middle East 
Peace, headed by former Foreign Minister Abba Eban. Officers of the center 
declined to say who had brought the tape into Israel, except to say that it was 
a European member of the group's board. 
</P>
<P>
Khalaf seemed to go out of his way to assure his viewers that the PLO quest for 
a Palestinian state is not just a way to build a springboard to attack Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing," he said, "is that the two peoples, the Palestinian and 
Israeli, come to believe in the necessity of coexistence between the two 
states." 
</P>
<P>
He appealed for Israelis to see the PLO's implicit recognition of Israel as a 
bold and moderate step. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test of Courage 
</P>
<P>
"We would remind you," he said, "that just as you have some extremists, we also 
have many such people. However, the test of courage is when such extremism is 
countered head-on rather than surrendered to." 
</P>
<P>
Khalaf said that the PLO's national charter, which calls for the destruction of 
Israel, is open for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"Our covenant and yours can be discussed," he said, apparently refering to the 
Israeli declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the symposium featured another first: a Soviet expert on 
Middle East affairs making a public appearance in Israel. In the recent thaw 
between Jerusalem and Moscow, most cultural contacts have taken place in the 
Soviet Union. An Israeli basketball team recently played in Moscow and a pair 
of Israeli singers performed there. 
</P>
<P>
The Mideast expert, Andre Shouminkhin, called for a speedup in contacts aimed 
at ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and he said the Soviet Union could 
play a key role. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the Soviet Union, conflicts cannot be resolved easily, if at all," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In reference to reports from Washington that the Bush Administration sees a 
reduced role for Moscow in Middle East diplomacy, Shouminkhin remarked that "no 
one should impose any restrictions on Soviet participation in the settlement." 
</P>
<P>
"The greater the Soviet role, as well as the role of other outsiders in 
settling (this) particular conflict, I think, the better for everyone around," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shouminkhin pressed for inclusion of the PLO in any such talks. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," he said, "Without the PLO . . . peace cannot be achieved. You 
can go on postponing these negotiations, but if you really want an 
understanding you should begin."

Preparing to take over a troubled helm, retired Adm. James D. Watkins, the 
energy secretary-designate, Wednesday denounced what he said had been decades 
of misguided priorities within the Energy Department and vowed to instill 
concern for health and safety in those responsible for the nation's nuclear 
weapons complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now paying the price for this long-term cultural misdirection," Watkins 
told a Senate committee considering his nomination.

Watkins, a former chief of naval operations, said that officials managing the

</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, such vital safety lessons as the partial meltdown at the 
Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979 -- a watershed experience for 
operators of the nation's civilian reactors -- went virtually unheeded by 
officials in the Energy Department's weapons operations. 
</P>
<P>
At the nation's nuclear weapons facilities today, Watkins said, "there is 
little risk in being careless, little incentive to excel." 
</P>
<P>
The energy nominee, selected to head a department racked by disclosures of past 
shoddiness and burdened by the estimated $81-billion cleanup cost at the 
weapons facilities, devoted much of a lengthy opening statement to assurances 
that he would elevate concern for the environment to a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
"Fulfillment of the mission of our national defense and protection of the 
environment are mutually compatible objectives," Watkins declared, "and to 
think one must be sacrificed to fulfill the other is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Energy Secretary John S. Herrington similarly had sought to make 
concern for health and safety a higher priority within the agency's nuclear 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicts in Energy Dept. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the nation's three main weapons production facilities shut down for 
safety reasons, sharp conflicts have emerged in the department between cautious 
safety officials and production managers impatient to get the system back on 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Such divisions are far from resolved, Watkins indicated. Since his selection as 
energy secretary, he said, "I have learned enough about the defense program 
side . . . to know that there is an urgent need to effect a significant change 
in the deeply embedded 35-year culture." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins sided emphatically with those urging caution. When questioned about the 
shut-down reactors, he said that he believes it is important to restart the 
Savannah River Project in South Carolina, the nation's only source of tritium, 
a vital but perishable ingredient in nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But he sounded stronger concerns about delays in the construction of the Waste 
Isolation Project, a nuclear waste disposal facility in New Mexico, and opposed 
the reopening of any facility until the department is sure that it can "bury 
more (waste) than we're producing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confirmation Held Likely 
</P>
<P>
Senators complimented Watkins on his candor, and there seemed no doubt that the 
committee would recommend unanimously next week that the Senate confirm 
Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
But some, betraying a distrust of the Energy Department that is widely felt on 
Capitol Hill, worried aloud that he might abandon his outspokenness after 
taking office. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that you will keep the attitude that you have," Sen. Wendell H. Ford 
(D-Ky.) told him. 
</P>
<P>
Although Watkins' remarks focused chiefly on the nuclear weapons complex, the 
hearing called attention to the breadth of the challenges facing him. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, who has been charged by President Bush with developing a comprehensive 
national energy policy addressing a wide range of interests, must take sides in 
a number of contentious disputes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acid Rain Controversy 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are pitted against the domestic coal industry on the question 
of how best to respond to problems of acid rain and global warming. Others are 
debating the question of automobile fuel economy standards, with more stringent 
requirements supported by conservationists but opposed by U.S. auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, with U.S. consumption of foreign oil increasing, oil and gas 
interests are demanding anew that the Administration take further action to 
protect domestic producers. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins gave little indication of the tacks he might take in attempting to 
resolve such issues. But senators nevertheless offered sympathy for the 
enormity of the job. 
</P>
<P>
Given present circumstances, said Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), the 
committee chairman, stewardship of the Energy Department "is the most daunting 
management task that I think we've ever given to anyone in government."

REPORT ON WRIGHT SENT TO HOUSE ETHICS PANEL; 
</P>
<P>
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN SAYS IT MAY TAKE 3 WEEKS TO REACH DECISION ON CHARGES 
AGAINST SPEAKER 
</P>

<P>
A special counsel investigating misconduct charges against Speaker Jim Wright 
(D-Tex.) has completed a seven-month inquiry and delivered a final report to 
the House Ethics Committee, the panel announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) called the 12 members of the Committee 
on Standards of Official Conduct to a meeting today to discuss the panel's next 
step, but he said that it may take up to three more weeks to reach a final 
decision in the long-running controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The report was not made public, and the committee said in a statement that it 
would have no comment on the findings of Richard Phelan, a prominent Chicago 
lawyer who was retained to examine allegations first raised by House 
Republicans almost a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said that the committee will discuss scheduling of oral presentations by 
Phelan and by Wright's lawyer, Washington attorney William Oldaker, at today's 
meeting without discussing the substance of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Hear Arguments First 
</P>
<P>
Only after hearing the final arguments, Dixon said, would the panel begin 
deliberations on a decision in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say the committee won't make any determination on the issue until the 
week of March 13," Dixon told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he intends to allow the attorneys for the committee and Wright to 
take "as much time as they need" for arguments before the panel starts to weigh 
the evidence and issue its verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Under the committee's procedures, it could order a disciplinary hearing before 
making any recommendation for punishment if it finds that there has been 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proclaims His Innocence 
</P>
<P>
Wright, again proclaiming his innocence, said that Phelan's inquiry looked into 
40 years of his public and private life in a "thorough and exhaustive" way. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that he has no idea when -- if ever -- the report will be released, 
adding: "All that's in the hands of the committee, as it should be. . . . The 
sooner, the better, from my point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"I do know there hasn't been any violation of law, of House rules or any 
commonly accepted standards of ethics," the Speaker told reporters on the eve 
of the committee's first working session this year. 
</P>
<P>
Wright has been accused of violating ethical standards by pocketing $55,600 in 
royalties from his 117-page book, "Reflections of a Public Man," that was 
purchased in large quantities by his political supporters, including the 
Teamsters Union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Charges 
</P>
<P>
He also faces charges of using undue influence with federal agencies on behalf 
of two Texas oil firms and a savings and loan firm from the state. In addition, 
critics have cited his rent-free use of a Ft. Worth condominium belonging to 
the son of a long-time business associate. 
</P>
<P>
While the Speaker insisted that he is glad the committee had conducted what it 
terms a preliminary inquiry, the tenor of his remarks indicated otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"I supposed it would take about two weeks," Wright observed. "Eight months 
later, I'm most anxious for them to get it done. . . . Maybe, in a way, I ought 
to take it as a compliment, because if we hadn't been so effective (as Speaker) 
they wouldn't have been so determined, so intent, so passionately devoted to 
try and disrupt the leadership." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Republicans File Request 
</P>
<P>
While he mentioned no names Wednesday, Wright and his associates have accused 
Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) of sparking the demand for an investigation in a 
series of House speeches early last year. When the citizens' organization, 
Common Cause, endorsed the idea last May, Gingrich and 70 other House 
Republicans filed a formal request with the ethics panel for an inquiry into 
the Speaker's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, the committee's six Democrats and six Republicans voted 
unanimously to start the inquiry and appointed Phelan the chief investigator 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
At his own request, Wright appeared before the panel Sept. 14 and answered 
questions on his financial affairs for more than five hours. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has come under harsh criticism from fellow Democrats for his 
handling of a proposed 50% pay raise for members of Congress, federal judges 
and top officials of the executive branch of government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes Position 
</P>
<P>
While the original strategy of the House leadership was to let the pay increase 
take effect without a vote -- as the law allowed -- Wright apparently buckled 
under strong public pressure and distributed a survey to all House members 
seeking their views on the issue. He then proposed a trimmed-down 30% pay 
increase, together with a ban on payments for congressional speaking 
appearances. But opponents forced a vote on the original 50% pay raise, and it 
went down to overwhelming defeat. 
</P>
<P>
While House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) insisted that there was 
no significant erosion of support for the Speaker among Democrats, some party 
members said privately that Wright's popularity had suffered considerably from 
the debacle. 
</P>
<P>
If so, it could affect the intensity of his support from Democrats in any 
showdown over the outcome of the Ethics Committee case.

BUSH'S ETHICS PANEL BACKS BROAD BAN ON SPEAKING FEES 
</P>

<P>
Members of President Bush's ethics commission agreed Wednesday that senior 
officials of all three branches of the government should be barred from 
accepting fees for speeches and articles, regardless of whether they get a pay 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
"The evil of honoraria is so great -- from the appearance of a conflict of 
interest," former Atty. Gen. Griffin Bell said in proposing that the fees be 
banned. "People wonder who's paying all these honoraria. It undermines 
confidence in government." 
</P>
<P>
All eight commissioners concurred, although there was debate over whether the 
idea should be coupled with a recommendation for a pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative conclusions were reached at the third meeting of the panel, which 
Bush appointed to recommend ways of strengthening and standardizing federal 
ethics laws and rules. Final recommendations are due March 9. 
</P>
<P>
Under public pressure, Congress recently voted down 50% pay raises for top 
officials throughout the government, although that recommendation, from the 
Quadrennial Commission and Presidents Bush and Ronald Reagan, was coupled with 
a proposal that members of Congress stop taking honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the House and Senate may accept pay for speaking or writing about 
their congressional duties. The House allows members to receive honorariums 
amounting to no more than 30% of salary; in the Senate, the limit is 40% of 
salary. Members of both houses are paid $89,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Malcolm R. Wilkey, a former federal appellate judge, said: 
"I've observed excessive teaching and writing, basically to earn income." 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners also agreed that top officials in all three branches of 
government should have their outside incomes limited to 15% of salary or less. 
That is the current standard for the executive branch, but is lower than that 
used in Congress.

NORTH DENIED AIDING CONTRAS, CONGRESSMAN TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oliver L. North and two of his superiors at the National Security Council 
denied repeatedly to members of Congress in 1985 and 1986 that the White House 
was enlisting outside military aid for Nicaragua's rebels, the former chairman 
of the House Intelligence Committee testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The official, Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), was called by prosecutors as their 
first witness at North's trial to support charges that North, while a White 
House aide, sought to mislead Congress and obstruct congressional inquiries 
into U.S. policy on the Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Those charges form the core of 12 felony counts on which the retired Marine 
lieutenant colonel is being tried in the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said that North denied press reports that he was aiding the Contras 
during an August, 1986, meeting with members of the Intelligence Committee in 
the supersecret Situation Room in the basement of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the committee had received similar denials in writing from Robert C. 
McFarlane, who was former President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser 
in 1985, and, several months later, from McFarlane's successor, John M. 
Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane pleaded guilty last year to four misdemeanor charges of withholding 
information from Congress and is scheduled to testify against North. Poindexter 
is under indictment in the Iran-Contra case and is to be tried separately after 
North's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said that his panel began making official inquiries in 1985 in the 
wake of "a flood of press reports alleging that North was involved in assisting 
the Contras by raising money and providing military advice." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said that he wrote to McFarlane about the reports and McFarlane 
replied that he "took the charges seriously" because Congress had prohibited 
the Reagan Administration from funding, directly or indirectly, any further 
military operations by the rebel forces. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was in legislation written by Rep. Edward P. Boland (D-Mass.) and was 
commonly called the Boland Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane's reply, introduced into the court record, flatly denied the press 
reports, adding that "at no time did I or any member of the National Security 
Council staff violate the letter or the spirit of the law." 
</P>
<P>
In reply to a set of follow-up questions from the committee, McFarlane sent a 
second response which added that the NSC had not provided any assistance to the 
Contras "directly or indirectly," Hamilton testified. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know who wrote those responses?" John W. Keker, the associate 
independent prosecutor, asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not," Hamilton replied. 
</P>
<P>
Keker, in his opening statement to the jury Tuesday, said McFarlane will 
testify that North drafted the letters for him. 
</P>
<P>
Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has charged that, despite the denials, 
North and others were helping to raise money for Contra military operations 
from wealthy U.S. citizens and from friendly foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton rejected suggestions by North's attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., 
that congressmen could not be trusted with secret information about covert 
operations abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said that, by law, the President must notify both the House and Senate 
Intelligence committees of such operations in a timely fashion. He added that 
"we cannot fulfill our responsibilities unless we have accurate information 
from the executive branch." 
</P>
<P>
When the committee later met face to face with North to ask the same questions, 
"Col. North insisted he had not violated the Boland Amendment, that he was not 
assisting the Contras by raising money, that he had not provided any military 
advice to the Contras," Hamilton said of the 1986 meeting in the White House 
Situation Room. 
</P>
<P>
"I relied on what Col. North told me at the meeting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until three months later -- November, 1986 -- that Reagan went on 
national television to disclose the first details of the scandal, in which 
proceeds from the sale of arms to Iran were secretly diverted to aid the 
Contras.

IT'S NOIR-ON-NOIR DRESSING FOR GRAMMY NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At first, it looked like a giant funeral was taking place Wednesday night at 
the Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
But, no, it was just the Grammy Awards being passed out. 
</P>
<P>
Black was here, black was there, black was everywhere and on everybody arriving 
for the music industry's 31st ceremonial rites. And that included black 
tuxedos, black sequins, black feathered boas, black bolero vests, black gaucho 
hats and, of course, lots of black leather. 
</P>
<P>
So, naturally, some of the biggest stars echoed the noir-on-noir fashion 
statement. Kris Kristofferson, who evoked a huge roar from the crowd assembled 
outside the front door, was his usual sartorially elegant self in black jeans, 
black tuxedo jacket, black-and-white spotted vest and his de rigueur black 
cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
Singer-composer Thomas Dolby looked natty in a black top hat, while Little 
Richard, in silver studded black leather, indulged in motorcycle chic. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not everyone wore black and a few confident souls bucked the trend. 
Michael Keaton, who managed to dodge reporters, looked more like Cary Grant 
than Batman -- his newest movie role -- in a white dinner jacket. 
</P>
<P>
And country singer K. D. Lang opted for a city-slickened electric purple tux 
with studs. 
</P>
<P>
"Full House" actor John Stamos and Beach Boy Mike Love, arriving together and 
wearing the same black motif, announced that Stamos would accompany the Beach 
Boys on drums this summer on a syndicated TV special as well as make a tour 
together. 
</P>
<P>
British singer Samantha Fox, who wore hot pink streaks in her blond hair to 
liven up her black pants outfit, swore that "London has nothing like this." 
</P>
<P>
But no awards ceremony would be complete without a little bit of controversy. A 
Rolls-Royce convertible pulled up to the Shrine entrance with a big yellow sign 
on its side proclaiming: "Free the Godfather of Soul" (a reference to the 
jailed James Brown). 
</P>
<P>
Even Iggy Pop, considered the "Godfather" of punk, and usually flamboyant 
R&amp;B signer Pebbles looked downright boring in their all-black duds. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the AAA-list music stars, at least those who deigned to attend the 
Grammys, did not show up at the main entrance. Instead, they went around back 
to another less-public door. Except for their lack of imagination in their 
color choice, the Grammy guests showed once again that the music industry still 
has a lock on the cutting edge of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
There were sweaters substituting for tuxedo jackets, pouffed skirts and 
strapless bodices in every imaginable shape and size, along with lace gloves, 
gold lame and even -- for the men -- multicolored bow ties. 
</P>
<P>
In truth , the color most favored next to black was skin-tone. In their 
micro-minis, plunging necklines and bare midriffs, some women seemed to be 
trying for next year's Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. 
</P>
<P>
Said one appreciative man: "Now that's a fashion statement that's talking right 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his wife, Ethel, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley was not seen 
eyeing the well-dressed ladies, but he did follow the main fashion trend of the 
evening: He too came in black -- a no-frills black tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
And that smile on his face wasn't because he had dressed appropriately. It was 
because he didn't spy one traffic gridlock outside the Shrine on Wednesday, 
which bodes well for Oscar night March 29. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time, I got stuck at Adams and Hoover for an hour," the mayor said. "This 
year, coming over was a breeze."

A SHOW SHORT ON TALK AND LONG ON SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, Times Television Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's name was Grammy, three-plus hours of whammy. 
</P>
<P>
So from this critic, there'll be no slammy. 
</P>
<P>
Apologies to rappers. But Wednesday night's Grammy telecast on CBS was, well, a 
fast car, a speeding, careening, rocking, fast-clocking, racing, bracing sprint 
down a mostly smooth track that overshot its scheduled time slot by a mere 20 
minutes. Who cared? 
</P>
<P>
Bobby McFerrin's acceptance speech alone (when his "Don't Worry, Be Happy" was 
named song of the year) was probably more musical than two-thirds of this 
year's record releases. 
</P>
<P>
If past Grammycasts were sometimes on the cutting edge of ho-hum, this one took 
a hairpin turn toward the exciting and eclectic. 
</P>
<P>
Music purists may disagree. But as entertainment for the broad mass of viewers, 
the evening was a comparative festival of diversity that had just about 
everything. That included a range from Leontyne Price to rocking Metallica, 
whose robust number "One" may have provided a preview of World War III. 
</P>
<P>
Cracked host Billy Crystal: "That song was written by Steve Allen." 
</P>
<P>
The night had other funny lines from Crystal. It had funny looks, from Sinead 
O'Connor, who seemed to fuse images of boot camp and concentration camp, and 
from Michael Hutchence, who had that wet, 
throw-something-on-when-the-doorbell-rings-and-you're-in-the-shower appearance. 
</P>
<P>
It had vibrant, splashy production numbers with Luther Vandross and Linda 
Ronstadt, even if there wasn't a show-breaker like Michael Jackson to bring 
down the house inside Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
It had a smashing gospel ensemble, a booming Toni Childs and a socially 
conscious Tracy Chapman, who fulfilled the promise of her own lyrics to "be 
somebody." 
</P>
<P>
It had standing ovations, but also groans of disappointment in response to some 
of the winners. 
</P>
<P>
And, as usual with awards programs, there was at least one small moment that 
loomed big, this one McFerrin and Crystal's inspired bit reliving musical 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Of all major awards shows, it's the musical ones that are usually most tailored 
to TV, because they're performance-oriented and celebrate song, not chit-chat. 
</P>
<P>
The Grammycast, for example, was happily devoid of the awkward and vacuous 
scripted chatter by presenters that so often epitomizes awards shows. Nor were 
acceptance speeches long and windy. Instead, this was a night at the office. 
Everyone got down to business, and the show ran so smoothly that even its few 
fluffs were hardly noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Said McFerrin: "Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.

STATE INSURANCE DEPT. REJECTS PETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Insurance has turned down an administrative petition by 
the Proposition 103 campaign and a coalition of consumer groups asking the 
department to establish regulations under the initiative to limit insurance 
company rights to cancel or refuse to renew auto insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
Department lawyer James W. Holmes wrote the petitioning parties that in light 
of the state Supreme Court's review of the constitutionality of Proposition 
103, it would be "premature and precipitous" to define terms in the initiative, 
even though the high court has ruled that the cancellation and non-renewal 
parts of it are in effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Further, while the department intends to enforce vigorously the limitation in 
(the measure) on non-renewal and cancellation, we are not persuaded that formal 
rule-making is needed to accomplish that objective at this time," Holmes 
declared in a letter rejecting the petition filed Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
The groups had argued that Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie had "failed 
to act decisively" to define what some of the terms of Proposition 103 mean. 
Holmes called those assertions "inaccurate and outdated" in light of recent 
action the department has taken against companies, such as Travelers, for 
failing to renew auto policies.

CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS HIT PLAN TO CLOSE BASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL D. SHEAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six members of the California congressional delegation Wednesday protested the 
proposed closing of military bases in the state, charging that the action would 
not save money or serve national security interests. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying with 15 other congressmen before a House panel considering the base 
closings, the California representatives disputed the findings of the federal 
Commission on Realignment and Closure, which in December issued a list of 86 
military facilities that it said were an unnecessary burden on the federal 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way that we can justify accepting this report in total . . . if 
the savings are not there," said Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Highland), who defended 
George Air Force Base in San Bernardino County, one of the bases on the list. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also criticized the commission for failing to provide the data on 
which their recommendations were based. Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) declared 
that "the commission cannot support its recommendations in a way that can 
withstand scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation that created the special commission, Congress has until 
45 days after March 1 to vote down the entire list or allow the closings to go 
into effect automatically. The all-or-nothing arrangement was provided to help 
insulate the review from political pressures and prevent congressmen from 
attacking the list piecemeal to protect interests in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the high priority on reducing the federal budget deficit, House and 
Senate leaders have said it is unlikely that Congress will disapprove the list. 
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, the proposed closings, along with substantial 
scaling back at five others and "realignments" at 54 more, would save the 
federal government $5.6 billion over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Six military facilities in California have been targeted for closing. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's hearing before a subcommittee of the House Armed Services 
Committee, several protesting congressmen complained that repeated attempts to 
see material used by the commission were "stonewalled" by both the panel and 
the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he suspected that information on the facilities provided by the 
Defense Department was "misleading" and that the decision to close George AFB 
"may very well raise questions" about the validity of the rest of the 
commission's report. 
</P>
<P>
Posing a rhetorical question, Lewis asked: "When is it all right for the 
Department of Defense to lie to Congress?" 
</P>
<P>
Jim Abbee, a spokesman for the commission, said that "all the data" will be 
made available. Members of the commission will testify before the subcommittee 
next Wednesday about their findings. 
</P>
<P>
Abbee defended the report and said that he is "confident that the analysis 
process was not flawed and the data we worked with was accurate." He said that 
the commission has received "a lot of praise" from members of Congress and that 
it continues to stand by all of its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those testifying charged that the $5.6 billion in savings cited by the 
commission is too small to justify the closings, considering the bases' 
economic value to their communities and their contribution to national 
security. Others disputed the savings estimate altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"We contend that if the Presidio is closed, it will cost the taxpayers more 
money," said Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), protesting the recommended 
shutdown of 6th Army headquarters at the base of the Golden Gate Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said her figures show that it will cost an 
additional $26 million each year if the military facility is closed and if the 
site is operated as a historical site by the Interior Department. 
</P>
<P>
The commission projected annual savings of $74.1 million by closing the 
Presidio. 
</P>
<P>
Other California congressmen protesting base closings at the hearing were 
Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) and George E. Brown 
(D-Colton). 
</P>
<P>
The other California bases to be closed are Norton Air Force Base near San 
Bernardino, Hamilton Army Airfield in Marin County, Mather Air Force Base near 
Sacramento and the Navy's inactive Salton Sea Test Base.

INVESTIGATION CLEARS NAVY OF ABUSING DOLPHINS IN DEFENSE TRAINING PROGRAM

A federal investigation has cleared the Navy of charges that dolphins in its 
underwater defense training program were abused, it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-member team appointed by the federal Marine Mammal Commission reviewed 
170,000 dolphin training sessions in California, Hawaii and Florida and found 
evidence of "three isolated incidents of an animal being struck," a Navy 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"In all cases, the commission team found that prompt and appropriate action had 
been taken to discipline the trainers involved," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was requested after a former civilian trainer charged that 
dolphins were routinely beaten and malnourished and that many had died. 
</P>
<P>
Since the marine mammal training program was launched in 1960, hundreds of 
dolphins and sea lions have been captured and taught to retrieve equipment lost 
at sea or to fight off underwater saboteurs.

COUNCIL ASKS PROBE OF POLITICAL USE OF POLICE DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council called Wednesday for the Police Commission to 
conduct "a full investigation" into Assistant Police Chief Robert L. Vernon's 
use of a police computer to gather intelligence for use against political 
activist Michael Zinzun in a Pasadena city election. 
</P>
<P>
The council asked the Police Commission to "assure that such action will not be 
repeated" and also said an official apology to Zinzun is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon was reprimanded by Chief Daryl F. Gates after he used a police computer 
to gather data on Zinzun, a former Black Panther now running for the Pasadena 
Board of Directors. According to Gates, Vernon had used the computer to do 
research on Zinzun and had 156 pages of data printed with the intent of 
providing them to Zinzun's rivals. 
</P>
<P>
After being alerted to Vernon's actions by other department personnel, Gates 
said he intervened before Vernon could deliver the information. Gates has asked 
Vernon to repay the printing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Zinzun, a member of the Coalition Against Police Abuse, was a key figure in the 
1983 dismantling of the department's Public Disorder Intelligence Division 
(PDID), which had illegally spied on lawful citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon's activities were especially troubling in light of the PDID case, said 
Councilman Robert Farrell, author of the motion calling for an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Zinzun's name is in that computer. Why? He's not a criminal," Farrell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The council asked the police commission to report its findings.

Boyle Heights for Andrea Denise Garrett, 19, who was fatally shot Feb. 12 in 
Aliso Village housing project. The killing of Garrett, shown in insert, was 
linked to drug dealing in the area and has shocked many in the projects because 
she was pregnant with her third child. The fetus was buried with her. Because 
the shooting was gang-related, police officers monitored the service. MICHAEL

COST ESTIMATES SOAR FOR UPGRADING CITY'S SEWAGE TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials quietly warned the San Diego City Council this week that 
tentative cost estimates for upgrading the city's sewage treatment system have 
sharply increased, with the six options now under consideration, ranging in 
price from $2.4 billion to $4.2 billion, City Hall sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
If they hold up under further analysis, the new estimates would reflect an 
increase of hundreds of millions of dollars over the $1.5-billion to 
$2.4-billion projection that city officials have been using in discussions of 
the project during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
The new estimates reflect inflation, a sizable contingency fund and the added 
cost of water reclamation technology, which the council has committed itself to 
pursuing, sources said. Water reclamation involves an even more thorough 
cleaning of waste water than the "secondary sewage treatment" mandated by 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials cautioned that the new estimates are only tentative 
proposals that have not undergone thorough analysis by the Water Utilities 
Department and the city's hired consultant. Two sources said final cost 
estimates, expected to be ready for the March 28 meeting of the Metropolitan 
Sewer Task Force, could be lower.

No Cost Estimates Completed 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Manager Roger Frauenfelder, who oversees the upgrading of sewage 
treatment, said Wednesday that no new cost estimates have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a report that shows higher costs. We were going to try to get it 
together, but it just hasn't happened yet," Frauenfelder said. He said there 
would be no discussion of costs at a City Council workshop today at which the 
entire sewage-system upgrading will be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
But several City Hall sources said staff members shocked council members with 
cost estimates ranging from $2.4 billion for an option that does not include 
water reclamation to $4.2 billion for a plan that would pump treated effluent 
over the Laguna Mountains for agricultural use in the Imperial Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Four other options that differ in varying degrees from the two extremes would 
cost $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The figures were apparently released during a closed-session discussion of the 
sewer-treatment system upgrading Tuesday. Among the items on the agenda for 
that meeting was a discussion of the city's legal battle with the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the U. S. Justice Department and the state Regional Water 
Quality Control Board, all of which sued the city last July to force it to 
upgrade to secondary sewage treatment as required by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battling for Timetable, Cost 
</P>
<P>
The city has agreed to move to secondary sewage treatment, but is battling the 
federal agencies over the timetable and the cost. The agencies also want the 
city to pay fines for 1,814 sewage spills over five years. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of upgrading the sewage treatment system will be borne by the 1.5 
million users of the Metropolitan Sewerage System in cities throughout the 
county. It is unclear how much sewer bills would increase under the new cost 
estimates, but city officials estimated last year that a $1.5-billion to 
$2.4-billion upgrade could quadruple sewer users' bills. 
</P>
<P>
The average fee would rise from about $10.40 to nearly $40 a month in the next 
three to five years, officials said then. 
</P>
<P>
The cost to sewer users could be sharply reduced if Mayor Maureen O'Connor is 
successful in her efforts to win passage of federal legislation that would pay 
for 55% of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Options Down to 7 
</P>
<P>
Consultants have winnowed the city's options from 21 to seven -- the six 
treatment upgradings and a "no-project option" still favored by Councilman 
Bruce Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
All the options would upgrade the existing Point Loma plant to secondary 
treatment. Several others involve building more treatment plants in the North 
City area and the South Bay, along with smaller, satellite plants scattered 
about the city. Two of the options do not include water reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
Secondary sewage treatment removes 90% of solid waste from raw sewage before it 
is dumped in the ocean.

HE'S WILD ABOUT HELPING ANIMAL PARK; 
</P>
<P>
PATRON, 79, CONTRIBUTES THE CASH HE RAISES BY COLLECTING TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like a man who makes his living in the volatile markets of Wall Street, 
79-year-old Ernie Miller keeps a close eye on the price of commodities. 
</P>
<P>
In an instant, he'll quote you the going rate: Glass: 2 cents per pound. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper: $38 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
Aluminum cans: 28 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Miller doesn't deal with fancy metals like gold or silver and, unlike a broker 
who flashes cryptic hand signals, Miller earns his money the old-fashioned way: 
He digs it up. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, Miller -- who hobbles around with a cane -- has rummaged 
through garbage bins near his Ramona home and cashed in his recyclable goods 
for more than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
And every penny, he's given to the San Diego Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a digger," Miller said. "I dig around till I find a place that gives me 
the best price. The glass goes to a recycling center in San Marcos, the 
newspapers to San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Miller -- who's never met an animal that he doesn't like -- works hard to get 
the best deal for his favorite place, the Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful place. . . . I don't think there's anybody who's been there 
more often than me," said Miller, who has been going to the park twice each 
week since it opened in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"If you put animals in a cage, they don't feel like breeding or anything else," 
Miller said. "But get them to the park and they feel like, 'Hey, we're back 
home.' 
</P>
<P>
"I try to get the park before 11 a.m. That's when the bird show begins. At 
12:15 p.m., the elephant show starts," said Miller, who continued to recite the 
park's show schedule. "Occasionally, they'll change times on me, and I'll be 
standing around waiting for a show to start." 
</P>
<P>
It's a rare moment, however, when Miller stands around and does nothing. 
Plagued by an endless string of injuries and illnesses, Miller has only one 
lung and has lost feeling in both legs. 
</P>
<P>
Even the slightest exertion causes him to huff and puff, but nevertheless, with 
the help of a cane or metal crutches, he keeps to his recycling routine. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep working, I keep moving, I put in 10, 12 hours a day," Miller said. "At 
my age, you can't stop. I've seen too many people retire, and then they're dead 
within a year." 
</P>
<P>
Miller collects most of his recyclable goods from the four garbage trash bins 
that serve the 160-acre trailer park where he lives. The trailer park was the 
former Samagatuma Resort, a nudist colony that Miller owned and operated for 
more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
But Miller, like any scavenger worth his salt, finds treasures in less 
traditional spots, too. An abandoned bathtub behind a 
</P>
<P>
neighbor's trailer often yields a stash of 
</P>
<P>
aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
Miller hauls his day's finds back to a dilapidated shack for storage, and when 
he has collected enough, makes a trip to a recycling center. Boxes and boxes of 
crushed glass line one wall of the shack, bundles of newspaper and bags of cans 
cover the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to live in there (the shack) before it started caving in on me," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Miller, who stays on top of the recycling business, was getting 
ready to trade in his first batch of plastic milk containers. 
</P>
<P>
"They just started recycling plastic around here, so I figured I'd take 
advantage of it, too." 
</P>
<P>
He hooked his cane into a pocket and wrapped his arms around a plastic sack 
filled with the containers and shoved it into his battered 1969 Dodge van. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing gets great gas mileage . . . 8 miles per gallon," Miller said 
sarcastically. "That's why I don't go to the recycling center until I get a 
full load." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fateful Trip to Zoo 
</P>
<P>
He also uses the van, which is decorated with four San Diego Wild Animal Park 
stickers, to go see the wild creatures and chat with park personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's love affair with wild animals began many years ago, when he was taking 
a young girl -- a friend's daughter -- to the airport. A canceled flight left 
Miller with time to kill, so he took the girl to the San Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't know who had more fun," said Miller about the trip, which was to 
be the first of many. 
</P>
<P>
"He waves a $100 bill in front of my face about once a month," said Grace 
Mecklem, a clerk at the park. Mecklem, who handles membership accounts, has 
recorded Miller's donations over the years. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mecklem, Miller has contributed between $5,000 and $10,000, giving 
him "patron" status at the park, which makes him a lifetime member of the San 
Diego Zoological Society and gives him free admission to the park and the San 
Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
"He's here a couple of times a week," Mecklem said. "He's quite handicapped but 
that doesn't seem to slow him down. He's here so often, I think he knows the 
shows' dialogues by now."

METRO DIGEST: MAN GETS PROBATION FOR SHOTS AT OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Inglewood businessman who sat on a city commission and the mayor's 
anti-crime task force has been sentenced to five years' probation for shooting 
at an Inglewood policeman last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Avina, 40, who pleaded guilty last month to assault with a deadly 
weapon, was sentenced Tuesday by Torrance Superior Court Judge Hiroshi 
Fujisaki. The judge suspended a 6-year prison sentence, saying that Avina will 
be jailed only if he fails to abide by the terms of his probation. 
</P>
<P>
Avina was ordered to enter an alcohol rehabilitation program and abstain from 
drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the gunshot fired by Avina narrowly missed a patrolman who was one 
of several police officers who came to Avina's coin laundry on South Prairie 
Avenue to investigate reports of a disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Avina had drinking and marital problems that may have led to 
the confrontation with police. At the time, Avina was a member of Inglewood's 
Parking and Traffic Commission and Mayor Edward Vincent's anti-crime task 
force.

2 PORTS WEIGH PRESERVING LAGOON; COUNCILMEN ASSAIL 'BEING IN DARK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The possibility that the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach will preserve and 
develop a lagoon between Interstate 5 and El Camino Real in the San Dieguito 
River Valley received its first public airing Wednesday, amid some complaining 
by San Diego City Council members that they had been kept in the dark about it. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which has been quietly discussed in government and private 
circles for nearly a year, would have the two ports, which want to double the 
size of their facilities in San Pedro Harbor, offset the environmental damage 
they would cause there by developing -- at their expense -- a wetlands habitat 
just east of the Del Mar Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Final Site Undetermined 
</P>
<P>
The ports have not yet decided whether they want to target the valley for the 
project, and, if they do, they will eventually need the approval of a host of 
federal, state and regional government agencies, not the least being the city 
of San Diego. The ports are not expected to make a decision until summer. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the lagoon construction say it would fit hand-in-glove with a 
larger proposal, shepherded by both the city and county of San Diego, to 
develop a 43-mile-long regional park and wildlife habitat stretching from Del 
Mar to the foothills of Julian. 
</P>
<P>
Planning agencies have already identified the lowlands between the coastal 
freeway and El Camino Real as the most critical component to the park, and its 
development by the two port districts would be a windfall to the local park 
development. If the project is completed, the more than 500 acres being 
considered could end up in public ownership, providing the western gateway to 
the regional park. 
</P>
<P>
The ports' proposal surfaced Wednesday before the Public Facilities and 
Recreation Committee of the City Council at the request of Roy Collins, manager 
of the San Dieguito Trust, the largest of the private-property owners who would 
be affected by the plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer Against Hearing 
</P>
<P>
Collins' presentation was opposed by Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer, who said 
she is not only concerned that the public discussion might jeopardize private 
negotiations among her office, other city officials and the port districts 
about the plan, but also that the proposal should be aired by the council's 
Transportation and Land Use Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Public Facilities and Recreation Committee is chaired by Councilman Bruce 
Henderson, who at one time was an attorney representing the San Dieguito Trust. 
But he deflected criticism Wednesday that it was improper for him to chair the 
meeting during the presentation, countering that, because of the public 
hearing, he is keeping the discussions aboveboard and public. 
</P>
<P>
Two other council members welcomed the presentation because they had not 
previously known of its details -- and said they were bothered that Wolfsheimer 
indicated that she had been involved in private talks about the ports' 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what negotiations are going on," Councilman Robert Filner 
complained. "It sounds like there are private discussions going on that the 
council is not aware of." 
</P>
<P>
Added Councilman Ed Struiksma, addressing Wolfsheimer: "You're alluding to all 
sorts of things. We have no idea what you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Great Deal of Mystery' 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer conceded: "There seems to you all to be a great deal of mystery 
here." She explained that she and several city staff officials had met with 
property owners and officials from the port districts on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"All the information we'd normally give you is not ready to emerge," said 
Wolfsheimer, who also sits on a committee organized by the San Diego Assn. of 
Governments to coordinate the regional park proposal. "We don't want to discuss 
fair market value and negotiations" in public. 
</P>
<P>
But Filner and Struiksma said they were still confused by what negotiations 
Wolfsheimer indicated were being conducted. 
</P>
<P>
"I ask you not to get impatient," Wolfsheimer responded. 
</P>
<P>
Retorted Filner: "There's something about the process here that is bothering 
me. I don't understand the process in which we're interacting with the ports. I 
don't know by what criteria the city manager and the city attorney are even 
involved in negotiations. I don't know what policy you're working under." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer said the matter had come up briefly at an executive session last 
week, involving the possible acquisition by the city of private land in that 
same valley region. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion was not resolved except that an update report on the proposal 
will be presented to the committee when it meets March 8.

ENCINA SEWAGE PLANT TESTS CLEAN, BUT FISH CONTINUE TO DIE IN ITS OUTPUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No doubt about it -- far too many fathead minnows are floating belly up. 
</P>
<P>
It may not sound like a terribly pressing problem, but the deaths of these tiny 
fish have officials at the Encina sewage plant in Carlsbad mystified. 
</P>
<P>
Like other facilities throughout the region, Encina periodically dumps the 
minnows into special tanks to test the toxicity of the 20 million gallons of 
treated sewage it pumps into the ocean each day. 
</P>
<P>
Of late, the fish haven't been doing so famously. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to find out why, operators of the sprawling sewage plant, which serves 
about half of North County, agreed Wednesday to spend up to $74,000 for a 
private consultant to investigate what may be causing the toxicity problem at 
the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Although plant officials insist that the higher-than-normal toxic readings do 
not pose a health threat or environmental danger in the ocean, they remain 
concerned, noting that Encina is now exceeding state limits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Help From Tests 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Regional Water Quality Control Board when it meets on Monday is 
expected to slap the facility with an order requiring that the problem be 
corrected within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Encina officials have been particularly puzzled because tests for more than 150 
types of toxics and hazardous chemicals ranging from DDT to PCBs and heavy 
metals have come up below detectable limits, both for the raw sewage coming 
into the plant and for the treated effluent that flows into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
But minnows have all too often been dying off and turning keel up. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Graff, Encina general manager, said, "It could be that some normal 
chemical, something that's typically OK in the environment, is combining with 
something at the plant, and it's reached a level that these little minnows 
can't accept." 
</P>
<P>
The minnow test has been a staple at sewage plants for years. Researchers dump 
the minnows into test tanks filled with concentrations of effluent drawn from 
Encina. The 2 1/2-inch fresh-water fish are allowed to swim in the stuff -- 
about 10 per tank -- over a four-day period, then officials count the number 
that have survived. 
</P>
<P>
A mathematical formula is used to determine the survival rate. Over a month, a 
limit of 1.5 is deemed acceptable under state standards, but Encina has 
exceeded that limit during seven of the last eight months, with a high of 2.16 
in October. The lowest monthly reading, a 1.49 in November, just squeaked under 
the barrier. 
</P>
<P>
Graff said the numbers are not particularly lofty, but he remains resolved to 
find out just what's causing the plant to so regularly exceed the allowed 
limits. In the meantime, he argues, the ocean is not suffering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Believed in Plant 
</P>
<P>
"In discussing this with the regional board and operators of other treatment 
plants, we don't see any environmental problems at all," Graff said. 
</P>
<P>
If the regional board goes forward on Monday with an order for the plant to 
clean up the toxicity problem, Encina officials will be required to submit a 
report by mid-August recommending how the situation can be rectified. The plant 
must comply with the limits by the beginning of March, 1990, or it could face 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Graff remains confident that the problem is inside the plant, and is not being 
caused by some business or private entity illegally dumping toxics that find a 
way to Encina. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, there have been the negative readings on tests for heavy metals 
and other dangerous elements. Moreover, such hazardous materials typically 
wreak havoc with the normal treatment processes at a plant, an event that has 
not occurred at Encina. 
</P>
<P>
"We've checked what comes in our front door and what goes out our back door, 
and there's nothing there. We've also got a good handle on what industry is out 
there, and that doesn't appear to be a problem," Graff said. "There just may be 
some oddball chemical that we've not yet identified that's causing the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
After the high readings began to appear, Graff and other Encina officials 
expressed hope that a switch to a more intensive treatment process at the plant 
late last year would clean up the toxicity problem. 
</P>
<P>
But instituting the treatment, which involves sending every gallon of sewage 
through a bubbling basin where a biological chain-reaction chews up germs, has 
had no effect on the toxicity.

ASSAILANT KILLED BY POLICE OFFICER IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A man fatally shot by a San Diego police officer who said the man charged at 
him with a board was identified by authorities Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's spokesman said that Wayde Rex Pratt, 29, of the 2800 block of 
Judith Avenue in San Diego, died of a gunshot wound to his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Officer James E. Kremer was on patrol near Main Street and Saturn Boulevard on 
Tuesday when Pratt, who was on foot, blocked Kremer's path as Kremer drove 
toward him, a police spokesman said. Pratt, who was unemployed, walked toward 
the patrol car, and, when Kremer got out, began to yell, "You're not a police 
officer!" the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
After Kremer backed up and called for cover with his walkie-talkie, Pratt 
picked up a 2-by-6-inch board about 3 feet long and rushed toward the officer 
while holding the board above his head, police said. Kremer then drew his 
9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol and shot the man in the chest, killing him 
instantly. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said the shooting is being investigated and 
Kremer is on administrative duty as a matter of routine. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Mark Heacox, who Tuesday shot a man he believed was trying to run him 
over in a City Heights parking lot, also has been taken off field duty pending 
an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Bowman, 26, was in serious but stable condition at Mercy Hospital on 
Wednesday after surgery to remove a bullet from his neck. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the shooting occurred Tuesday afternoon after Heacox 
approached a car, which he had confirmed was stolen, in a parking lot at 
Modesto and Juniper streets. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car backed out of its parking space and gunned the engine as 
Heacox approached, police said. The officer fired two shots at the car, then 
dived out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspect drove out of the parking lot but pulled over soon 
afterward because he was bleeding heavily.

TALKING PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The guerrillas fighting to overthrow the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador 
have made their most dramatic effort so far to end nearly a decade of warfare 
in that country. President Jose Napoleon Duarte should reply quickly and 
constructively to the rebel proposal while the United States continues to 
encourage the nascent peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in Mexico with leaders from 13 Salvadoran political parties, 
representatives of the five guerrilla factions in the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front offered to lay down their arms and "incorporate ourselves into 
the nation's political life" if the government responds by changing the 
country's powerful military and security apparatus. In making the offer the 
rebels abandoned their longstanding demand that the 6,000 regular guerrilla 
fighters of the FMLN be integrated into the Salvadoran army as a precondition 
to peace. The proposal clearly caught Salvadoran political leaders by surprise 
-- and impressed them. Even a spokesman for the ARENA party, which has urged 
all-out war on the FMLN in the past, called the rebel offer "a transcendental 
step." 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in as many months that the FMLN has offered a dramatic 
concession totry to renew a long-stalled peace dialogue in El Salvador. In 
January it offered to take part in presidential and legislative elections 
scheduled for later this year if the government agreed to postpone the voting 
from March to September and guaranteed to protect candidates sympathetic to the 
rebels. The talks in Mexico were a result of that first rebel offer, which was 
initially rejected by Duarte as a sham. 
</P>
<P>
Only when the U.S. government, which pours about $1 million worth of military 
and economic aid into El Salvador each day, expressed interest in the 
guerrillas' first proposal was it taken seriously. The Salvadoran political 
leaders traveled to Mexico this week to further explore the rebels' election 
plan, but they returned to El Salvador with something even more substantial. 
Now it is time for Duarte and his government to respond. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly much remains to be discussed before peace can come to El Salvador. How 
will the rebels be disarmed, for example? And will El Salvador's powerful 
military caste be willing to accept the profound changes that the rebels have 
suggested? Will the generals reduce the army to 12,000 men, the number that it 
had when the civil war began in 1979, from the current level of more than 
50,000? Will they surrender the control of the Treasury Police, the National 
Police and other security agencies that have been the source of so much 
corruption and that harbor some of El Salvador's worst violators of human 
rights? And what of the rebel demand that several famous human-rights cases, 
including the murder of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, be investigated? 
</P>
<P>
The answer to those and many other hard questions regarding El Salvador's 
future can be answered only when Salvadoran government representatives sit 
across the negotiating table from the FMLN. It is time for that to happen, and 
the United States must use all its influence in El Salvador to guarantee that 
it does.

CONGRESSIONAL PAY RAISE

<TEXT>
<P>
I wish to reply to the column "Wright Crumbles in Panic Politics" by David S. 
Broder (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 12). I think the headline on this column is just one 
man's opinion because House Speaker Jim Wright showed great courage in taking 
the stand that he did on the vote for a pay raise. He showed great leadership 
in standing up to all those who wanted him to protect them, yet did not have 
the nerve to speak out so that the people could hear them. Shame, shame on many 
of our government workers. 
</P>
<P>
Now how can Broder say the American people are the long-term losers? We won. 
And, it makes me laugh when I hear the rebuttal that good people will not run 
for office or may think about resigning. Every time there is an election, we 
have many people running for the same office and spending thousands of dollars, 
sometimes much more than the office will pay. 
</P>
<P>
Wright did take the heat, both from his own colleagues and from the people at 
large, and that shows a very strong man. If his "buddies" even think about 
removing him from the speakership it will show how hypocritical they really 
are. 
</P>
<P>
It is time the people speak up again and demand another way for increasing the 
pay of lawmakers. The current method is ludicrous, and if attempted again there 
will be another outcry of the people.

DEATH AT THE CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dedicated psychiatric social worker, Robbyn Panitch, has died a violent death 
on the job at a Los Angeles County mental-health clinic in Santa Monica. She 
knew the dangers of working among the damaged members of society, but she 
continued to help -- as those in her profession feel called to do. For that 
service and the horrible sacrifice that it has entailed, her family and friends 
deserve the public's sympathy and respect. 
</P>
<P>
Random killing is common today in many urban areas, including Los Angeles. 
Murder can occur anywhere -- in a schoolyard, a Skid Row alley or a suburban 
home. But the social worker died in a mental-health clinic, and that means 
taking stock of the system to find some meaning deeper than the shock of the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
The central problem is that the state of California has backed away from its 
responsibilityto the mentally ill, one that neither it nor any state has 
handled particularly well. For decades states met the responsibility by putting 
the mentally ill in warehouses that they called hospitals. Community-based 
clinics were supposed to be an improvement, but, because there is neither money 
nor political leadership to support such programs, many of the mentally ill 
rarely receive help. Many also wind up living on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
It is the chronically mentally ill who need care most desperately. Some can 
function without risking harm to others or to themselves if they receive 
regular treatment. But they live in limbo, neither so gravely disabled that 
they can be committed for more than a few days to state hospitals nor legally 
entitled to care anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
The California Psychiatric Assn. is proposing legislation to make outpatient 
treatment mandatory for people in this group who respond to treatment but who 
lapse into old patterns of behavior unless they are in an organized, required 
program. 
</P>
<P>
For many people, though, even treatment that would come close to matching the 
original concept of community-based care in clinics will always come too late 
unless the state also provides a comprehensive, and costly, treatment and 
counseling program. The best time to begin treatment is in early stages of 
mental illness. But the people who need this early treatment, many of them 
teenagers, are the very ones who will suffer if several local mental-health 
clinics are closed because the state will not make the extra effort to come up 
with the $18 million that it will take to keep them open. Their illnesses will 
not necessarily get worse, to be sure, but the familiar, reassuring people who 
have helped them in the past will not be there when they encounter their next 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Vastly expanded public support for county mental-health programs is required to 
ease caseloads for therapists so that they can give the required attention to 
all patients instead of spreading themselves too thin trying to provide at 
least some help to all of them. No society can ever protect its every member 
from harm, but more money might allow local clinics not only to expand their 
ability to help but also to increase the security of those in charge of 
helping. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures on both the people treated by the mental-health system and those 
who work in it are tightening. For both professional and patient, increased 
public support can be a matter of life or death. Providing care for citizens 
unable to defend themselves from the private demons that they encounter day by 
day is a basic obligation of government. Since it has not been met, Sacramento 
must change -- or face the demons of basic failure.

TOWER AND ARMS LOBBY: TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT; 
</P>
<P>
THE NOMINEE MAY CLAIM A CONVERSION, BUT HIS ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM E. JACKSON JR., William E. Jackson Jr. is a senior fellow at the 
Fulbright Institute of International Relations at the University of Arkansas. 
From 1978 to 1980 he served as the executive director of the U.S. General 
Advisory Committee on Arms Control. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why reject John Tower for secretary of defense if President Bush values him so 
dearly? Why not accept Tower's pledges that he is, at 63, a reformed man in his 
life style, ready to carry out policy and procurement reforms quite at odds 
with his record as a U.S. senator of 25 years? 
</P>
<P>
It is written in the 50th Federalist that"if men were angels, no government 
would be necessary." That could be read to mean that if men were angels, there 
would be no need for a Senate check -- under the advice-and-consent clause -- 
on the nominees of Presidents. It is the constitutional duty of the Senate to 
stand in the middle of the road when the President sends a really bad 
nomination down Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
There must be certain boundaries of propriety, and not just simple legality, 
when it comes to nominations to high office. Nevertheless, the personal life of 
a nominee is relevant to a confirmation if, and only if, there is a pattern of 
behavior or a set of habits that cast doubt on his ability to carry out the 
responsibilities of the job. 
</P>
<P>
A history of alcoholism becomes a relevant consideration, therefore, and has 
been raised by Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and others. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there are other important considerations. Certainly Tower's great knowledge 
of defense issues and weapon systems is an important qualification. But, in a 
time of a severe budget crunch and defense contracting scandals, is it as 
important as management skills? Intangible qualities like discriminating 
judgment, probity, discretion and detachment must be weighed. 
</P>
<P>
Every secretary of defense since 1961 -- Robert McNamara, Clark Clifford, 
Melvin Laird, James Schlesinger, Donald Rumsfeld, Harold Brown, Caspar 
Weinberger and Frank Carlucci -- has brought different skills and experiences 
to the job. Yet there is one notable common thread in their backgrounds: Every 
one of them represented a greater detachment from the "defense culture" -- a 
more independent perspective -- than the current nominee. Tower has critically 
referred to the "culture of the building" (the Pentagon) and said that it has 
to be changed. The Senate should beware of conversions on the road to Damascus. 
Tower's entire record over three decades indicates that he is part of the 
problem, and not the solution. I refer to his membership on the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, representing one of the largest defense-contractor 
constituencies (Texas). It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that he 
seldom met a weapon system that he didn't like. While chairman of the committee 
in 1983 and 1984, he stonewalled attempts to reorganize the Pentagon and was 
identified with parochial service interests. It is a joke to describe him as a 
champion of weapons-procurement reform in those years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985-86 Tower chaired our delegation at the strategic-arms-reduction talks 
in Geneva, then turned around in 1986-88 to advise defense contractors on the 
possible effect of arms-control agreements on their business. 
</P>
<P>
It has been well documented that Tower lobbied -- for fees in the range of $1 
mil-lion -- for several major defense contractors like LTV Aerospace, Martin 
Marietta, Rockwell International, Textron and British Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
Tower told his confirmation hearing that he or his staff analyzed for the 
"senior management" of Martin Marietta the implications of START talks for 
"future product development" (like the Strategic Defense Initiative or the MX 
and Midgetman missiles). For Rockwell he provided "senior management" with his 
views on the future of the B-1 strategic bomber, and his staff analyzed the 
implications of arms negotiations on the future of SDI and the mobile 
Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
While insisting to the committee that "I gave value" to corporate clients, 
Tower denied giving "enlightened" advice on probable outcomes of the 
arms-control negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Tower was in a unique position to provide such time-sensitive advice to his 
corporate clients on highly secret negotiations involving the nation's 
strategic arsenal. Major cuts in the overall aggregate of bombers and missiles 
were being discussed in Geneva, in addition to a ban on mobile intercontinental 
ballistic missiles. Did he advise as to whether a proposal banning all mobile 
missiles was just a negotiating ploy? What actions did the contractors take in 
regard to adjusting their plans to focus on weapon systems likely to survive 
the cut in Geneva? 
</P>
<P>
It defies credibility to argue that Tower did not provide enlightened advice 
bearing on management decisions. 
</P>
<P>
During the presidential campaign, Nunn and Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) put the 
candidates of both parties on notice that public confidence in Defense 
Department nominees was absolutely essential: "It is imperative that nominees 
should have and should be seen to have the public interest as their only goal. 
Actions which call into question this commitment are unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
What example will be rewarded if Tower is confirmed? To be an interesting 
character is not sufficient reason to be secretary of defense.

POLICE CREDIT QUICK ARREST IN BANK ROBBERY TO COPTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man walked into an East San Diego bank Wednesday afternoon, escaped with $900 
cash and, less than seven minutes later, was apprehended with the woman who 
drove his getaway car, police said, crediting the arrest to the use of a new 
high-tech helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred at the Glendale Federal Savings &amp; Loan at 5998 El 
Cajon Blvd. Police said the man entered the bank about 4 p.m., placed a brown 
paper sack on the counter and demanded that the teller hand over the money. 
</P>
<P>
A bank official gave chase after the man left, but the suspect jumped into a 
1969 model car, which sped west on El Cajon Boulevard. Police said officers 
responded in heavy traffic by patrol car and with the use of the new Able 1 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said the officers who were driving got stuck in 
traffic at Fairmount Avenue and El Cajon. But the helicopter -- which the 
Police Department acquired about a year ago and uses in chases -- continued to 
track the car, whose driver tossed the bag of money out a window. It was 
quickly recovered by police. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 4 p.m., officers arrested Mark A. Constantino, 31, and Laurie 
Marie Carmack, 19. A 2-year-old girl in the car was turned over to the 
Hillcrest Receiving Home, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said officers were aided in the arrest by a dye pack that exploded while 
tucked in the crotch of the suspect's pants. Robinson said the bank teller had 
enclosed the pack in the bag of money. The pack sprays both tear gas and dye. 
</P>
<P>
After the arrest, Robinson said, the couple confessed to a robbery earlier this 
month in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said another robbery occurred about 2:35 p.m. Wednesday at the 
American Savings Bank at 770 Turquoise St. in Pacific Beach. The theft 
apparently was committed by a serial bandit whom police have nicknamed "the 
Traveling Man" because he always asks for traveler's checks. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said it is believed to be the 10th robbery committed by the man since 
January. 
</P>
<P>
The robber escaped Wednesday with $721.

DEFACING OF SYNAGOGUE;

<P>
JEWISH LEADERS SATISFIED WITH YOUTH'S SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jewish community leaders said Wednesday that they are satisfied with the 
sentencing of two San Diego teen-agers for vandalizing a San Carlos synagogue 
in what has been described as the worst crime against the local Jewish 
community in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Morris Casuto, director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said the 
sentencing of a 17-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl Tuesday to pay $135 each 
in restitution, serve 100 hours of community service and watch movies about the 
Holocaust "seemed appropriate," considering the age of the juveniles and the 
fact that they are first-time offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Lawrence Kapiloff "is providing these youngsters an 
opportunity to learn from their mistakes, and, if they do, the sentencing will 
have made sense," Casuto said. "If they become repeat offenders, it is highly 
unlikely the court would look on them with the same leniency." 
</P>
<P>
The two teen-agers and four friends drank a couple of cases of beer in the 
garage of a San Carlos home, drove along Cowles Mountain Boulevard on Nov. 13 
and spray-painted anti-Semitic messages and swastikas on the Tifereth Israel 
Synagogue and two nearby homes. The graffiti covered the outside of the 
synagogue, Rabbi Aaron S. Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
Casuto said that, in the 10 years he has been in San Diego, he has "not seen a 
Jewish institution so vandalized." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Learning From Past 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Jewish Community Relations Council of the United Jewish 
Federation of San Diego County said it is "important that the courts have 
responded in such a way as to teach these and all individuals the damage that 
is done from such acts of violence. Anti-Semitism and racism will not be 
tolerated in San Diego and throughout America. It is essential that we learn 
from our past, otherwise it will be repeated." 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old Los Angeles boy, who was convicted in the vandalism and linked to 
the white supremacist Skinhead movement, was ordered in December to perform 200 
hours of community service and pay about $135 to remove the graffiti, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Carlos Armour, who prosecuted the case. Three more 
teen-agers -- two girls and a boy, all 16 -- are expected to be tried in the 
next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the teen-agers were not linked to organizations in the Skinhead 
movement, but police have said that all conformed to the Skinhead "look," which 
includes shaved heads or close-cropped hair, tattoos and leather. 
</P>
<P>
Armour said he believes the 17-year-old boy sentenced Tuesday and the 
16-year-old sentenced in December should have been ordered to serve some time 
in Juvenile Hall. "It would have driven home a little more, just to show, to 
let them know, their freedom can be curtailed . . . that there is something 
they can lose." 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old boy was ordered to perform his community service hours at the 
Jewish Community Centers. The girl can serve her community service wherever she 
chooses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes for Mandatory Counseling 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Gold said he would like to see the youths receive mandatory counseling. 
"I would have hoped that part of their rehabilitation, so to speak, would be 
more than just watching a Holocaust movie. Even through counseling, it's hard 
to eradicate bigotry and hate when they are taught it as a youngster, but 
long-term counseling, like 20 to 30 sessions, and a report on their progress" 
would help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Defamation League, which monitors anti-Semitic activity, said hate 
crimes such as the defacing of the Tifereth Israel Synagogue have increased 
dramatically in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Diego, we have seen a very substantial increase, the difference between 
11 in 1987 and 33 in 1988, so statistically we're looking at a 300% increase," 
Casuto said. "While these numbers are obviously cause for concern, it is 
important that we place their validity in some sort of perspective," he said, 
adding that schools, police and other community members are dealing with the 
issue and trying to send a message that such hate crimes are not tolerated in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"But churches have also been vandalized, members of the Catholic community have 
been harassed, blacks, Hispanics and Asians have been harassed and beaten. . . 
. It is a community problem, not a Jewish issue," Casuto said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Education an Important Part 
</P>
<P>
Armour said education is an important part of the sentencing because most of 
the youths involved in the Tifereth Israel synagogue incident "aren't the kinds 
of people that you see on TV." 
</P>
<P>
"Involvement in these groups goes all the way from the hard-core to the 
'wanna-bees' on the periphery, who subscribe to some of the (white-supremacist) 
views out of ignorance as opposed to hatred, and they can still be worked 
with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The three remaining teen-agers will probably face similar penalties, Armour 
said, and, if any of the six violate their probation, they will face up to 
three years in Juvenile Hall or a Youth Authority camp. 
</P>
<P>
Adults convicted of defacing, damaging or vandalizing a place of worship with 
the intent to dissuade people from worshiping face a mandatory state prison 
term of three years.

SOCIETY'S FAILURE TO HELP THE SICK COSTS US MORE THAN OUR HUMANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL B. COBURN, Michael B. Coburn is a forensic psychiatrist in Van Nuys. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He walked into my office shaking from head to toe. He was supremely frightened, 
tense beyond words. With quavering voice and stumbling words he told me of his 
life of terror, of being raped by his father, of having no one except his 
confused and equally unstable wife, and of his attempts and continuing desire 
to die, to "put out the lights" and "not see the show," and his concern that 
he'd kill his wife first. 
</P>
<P>
He was not that unusual among the walking wounded. There are thousands of 
mentally ill men and women like him, and we are abandoning them to their 
private horror and in so doing abandoning any right that we have to call 
ourselves civilized human beings. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles and all over the country, emergency care, hospitals and 
mental-carefacilities are closing, services shrinking, funding drying up; 
personnel are laid off, and they see their talents and compassion waste away. 
</P>
<P>
"Money is tight," the governor says. "Budgets must be cut," the county 
supervisors say, and "Not in my neighborhood," we say. 
</P>
<P>
But the mentally ill do not cease to exist just because we cease to see them. 
They didn't go away when then-Gov. Ronald Reagan closed the hospitals. They 
didn't go away when federal funding for mental-health clinics disappeared; they 
didn't go away when Medi-Cal coverage and public housing and mental-health 
treatment in the prisons and public housing and infant nutrition and scores 
more programs were cut. They didn't go away; they just changed their shape. 
</P>
<P>
This man who was sent to me for an evaluation for Supplemental Security Income 
has nowhere to go, except to his disturbed wife whom he fears he will kill, who 
knows it, and who takes him in with her two children while provoking him by 
becoming pregnant by others. He is more afraid of becoming one of the homeless 
than he is of dying, or of killing. He isn't sick enough to get into a hospital 
again. And there is no place to keep him, no beds and no money. And very soon 
he will not even be able to get the barely adequate medication that he now gets 
from a county clinic; they are closing eight clinics. Money is tight. Budgets 
must be met. Not in my neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
He and others similarly impaired and similarly in pain will again change their 
shape. Some will be among the homeless; others will get sick enough to earn a 
hospital bed for a week, some will even stabilize and get well, and some will 
die. And some, many more than in the past, will lose control and end up in 
jail. Some will have only broken into a store or a car to sleep. Some will 
attack those who try to help, as happened in Santa Monica on Tuesday. And some 
will have killed a wife. 
</P>
<P>
In failing to treat and care for our wounded we not only fail them, we break 
every moral commandment. We fail ourselves, deaden our souls and endanger our 
very lives. And, oh yes, we end up costing ourselves -- in prisons, courts and 
hospitals -- much, much more money than if we had cared for them properly in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
So if humanity, morality and public safety aren't enough reason to do what's 
right, maybe saving money is.

A San Diego man who police suspect robbed an East San Diego apartment that was 
being fumigated died Wednesday at Villa View Hospital, a coroner's spokesman 
said.

<P>
Willie Davis, 40, was taken to the hospital in critical condition early Tuesday 
when he was found collapsed in an alley connecting 43rd Street and Van Dyke 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Davis entered a two-story apartment building in the 3700 block 
of 43rd Street about 2:20 a.m. Tuesday. The building was being sprayed with 
methyl bromide for termites. He fled the apartment shortly after entering.

HOLOCAUST 'DEBATE' IS FORUM FOR REVISIONISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prof. Robert Faurisson had a question for his audience. 
</P>
<P>
How many, the French professor wanted to know, had any doubts that the Nazi 
Holocaust of 6 million Jews is, in fact, nothing more than a hoax? 
</P>
<P>
The audience was silent. 
</P>
<P>
Heads swiveled as people looked to see who was willing to acknowledge publicly 
the belief that maybe the Nazis had murdered all those Jews, many of them in 
gas chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly a hand was raised, and another. 
</P>
<P>
The final count was five, out of an audience of about 200. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One-Sided Conference 
</P>
<P>
What was billed as a debate on the Holocaust on Tuesday in Torrance turned into 
a one-sided conference for people who call themselves "historical 
revisionists." The event was sponsored by the Committee for Open Debate on the 
Holocaust, a group with ties to the Institute for Historical Review, a group 
that formerly had offices in Torrance and asserts that the Holocaust is a 
fabrication. 
</P>
<P>
No spectators who believed unequivocally in the Holocaust showed up, nor did 
four speakers who were supposed to argue the case for the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
The militant Jewish Defense League, which had clashed with people attending an 
anti-Holocaust conference in Huntington Beach last weekend, stayed away as well 
under the belief that the debate had been canceled, according to Irv Rubin, its 
national chairman. "These people are scum," he said in an interview later. 
</P>
<P>
With the drama taken out of the event, the revisionists had only themselves to 
talk to. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approving Nods 
</P>
<P>
Among the statements that received approving nods: The numerous eyewitness 
accounts of gas chamber operations from concentration camp survivors have no 
value because the witnesses have not been cross-examined. At Auschwitz, what is 
identified as a gas chamber is in fact a mortuary that could not have been used 
as a gas chamber without killing guards and people in a nearby hospital. 
Instead of 6 million Jews dying, the true figure is no more than 300,000, who 
died from starvation, disease and Allied bombing. 
</P>
<P>
Also: Rather than being victims, Jews have made a flourishing industry of the 
Holocaust, and they control too much of the world's mass media. 
</P>
<P>
There were delighted smiles when one speaker declared that the name of Nobel 
laureate, Holocaust author and concentration camp survivor Elie Wiesel 
accurately stands for its translation into English -- "weasel." 
</P>
<P>
And laughter greeted the recounting of statements that the Nazis made soap and 
lubricating oil of the corpses of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Louk, head of the Torrance police intelligence unit, was on duty at the 
hotel in case trouble developed. Professionally impassive at the event, he said 
afterwards that he could not help being affected by the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were there and listened to those people laugh about how they disposed 
of body parts that were still quivering. . . . It was gross," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing that people could joke about atrocities." 
</P>
<P>
Louk said he also noticed that speakers never talked "about the bad things the 
Nazis had done." 
</P>
<P>
After the morning session, he said, he was surprised to see almost the entire 
audience return after lunch. "Those people are so fanatical," he said. "I am 
just glad that it went off without any problems." 
</P>
<P>
A number of audience members declared their belief that the Holocaust story is 
part of a Jewish-Communist conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testimony of 'No Value' 
</P>
<P>
Faurisson, a professor at the University of Lyons, said at the meeting that he 
places "no value" on statements from former concentration camp inmates if they 
have not been subjected to cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
Faurisson conceded that his cross-examination requirement is unusual but said 
it is justified because the accusation that the Nazis used gas chambers is so 
serious that it should be treated with legal, rather than historical, methods. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if this standard would not also invalidate much of what is known about 
Stalinist labor camps -- which many consider to be on a par with Nazi 
atrocities -- Faurisson said he has not studied the Soviet Gulag and is not 
prepared to say whether the camps were as bad as they are claimed to have been. 
</P>
<P>
Faurisson, an associate professor of literature, added that he had problems 
with accepting the writings of Alexander Solzhenitsyn about the camps because 
the Soviet emigre author and Nobel laureate is a novelist and not trained in 
historical methods. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the problem with drop-out speakers, conference organizers had trouble 
finding a meeting place. They changed the location twice, from the Tetelestia 
Christian Center to the Calvary Church of the Coastlands to the Quality Inn. 
</P>
<P>
The churches backed out after Louk called and explained that the Committee for 
Open Debate on the Holocaust is tied to the Institute for Historical Review, 
whose offices, formerly in Torrance, were fire-bombed in July, 1984, in what is 
still an unsolved case. Louk said he also told church officials that the Jewish 
Defense League had a record of confronting the institute. 
</P>
<P>
"You are liable to get caught in the middle for providing the facility," Louk 
said he told church officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jewish groups stayed away, they were not silent. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said it 
was a "sorry state of affairs" that the event attracted any news coverage. "I 
think those who call for a debate (on the Holocaust) deserve about the same 
attention as the Flat Earth Society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can classify revisionists into two camps. (Some) people . . . deny the 
Holocaust because they are more comfortable not believing the reality of the 
Holocaust. The second group says the Holocaust never occurred and, given the 
chance, they would like to finish the job." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rubin: "These people are dedicated Jew-haters. The tragic, reprehensible 
thing about this movement is they are mocking not only the Jewish people but 
America, because America fought Hitler." 
</P>
<P>
On the factual issues raised by the revisionists, Prof. Raoul Hilberg, author 
of the three-volume "Destruction of the European Jews," said in an telephone 
interview from Burlington, Vt., that the evidence of a Holocaust was 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"We deal at the outset with a disappearance of a lot of people," he said. While 
scholarly debate continues over the numbers, the lowest "responsible" figure is 
his computation -- 5 million, he said. Three million died in concentration 
camps, 1.3 million were shot and 700,000 to 800,000 died in ghettos, where 
policies of starvation led to death rates of 1.5% a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers Detailed 
</P>
<P>
Captured German documents, including railway records and a Gestapo report, 
detail the number of Jews deported to specific camps and the number of 
shootings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Explanations that deportees were taken to concentration camps for labor but not 
for killing do not wash, he said, because of the large number of Jews that 
German rail records show were taken to the camps. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no possibility that these camps were transit stations of 
some sort or places in which people were kept until the end of the war. As one 
German railway official said, otherwise Auschwitz would have become a 
metropolis." 
</P>
<P>
"We have the testimony of SS men, not just one but quite a few, not just from 
the Nuremberg trials, but from trials in 1960s, '70s and '80s," he said. "The 
SS testimony is absolutely explicit that people were put to death in gas 
chambers at Sobibbor, Treblinka, Belzec, Kulmhof and Maydanek, in addition to 
Auschwitz." 
</P>
<P>
He added pointedly that "in every one of the trials, cross-examination is built 
into the procedures. Most everything the SS has said was subject to 
cross-examination. SS people don't write books. If we had absolutely no 
testimony from Jewish survivors, we would still have that testimony and that 
picture." 
</P>
<P>
Hilberg said a report that an Auschwitz building could not have been designed 
as a gas chamber is correct but irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not the primary place for killing," he said. "The Germans blew up the 
gas chambers. . . . The ruins are still there. We do have two additional pieces 
of evidence. We have the floor plans for the gas chambers -- they are still 
around in the Auschwitz museum -- and aerial photographs retrieved by the CIA 
(showing the buildings)." 
</P>
<P>
The same sort of analysis refutes claims that the Germans were using the 
cyanide-based chemical Zyklon B for fumigation only, he said. The 
manufacturers' records shows that the orders sent to Auschwitz are far in 
excess of what is needed for fumigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the plans and the ruins, the testimony and the photos and they all 
coincide, reinforce each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Faurisson, the French professor, said at the revisionists' meeting that he is 
critical of Hilberg's work because it does not examine the evidence that the 
Holocaust did not occur. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Hilberg said that was like criticizing someone writing about the 
first trip to the Moon for not presenting the case that the trip did not occur. 
</P>
<P>
"It is no fun for me after 40 years of research to have to reiterate and 
reiterate," he said.

PORT OKS UNOCAL PACT TO RELOCATE TANK FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decade-long battle between San Pedro residents and Unocal came to a close 
Wednesday when the Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners approved an 
agreement that requires the oil company to dismantle its tank farm within five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal's San Pedro tank farm, on 22nd Street between a residential neighborhood 
and the new Cabrillo Marina, has long been criticized by residents who say it 
is a hazard to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The tank farm, which can hold up to 2 million barrels of crude oil, is used to 
store oil from tankers until it is needed at the company's refinery in 
Wilmington, on Anaheim Street near the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors have been complaining about the tank farm since 1976, when the oil 
tanker Sansinena blew up while it was loading fuel at Unocal's Miner Street 
terminal, not far from the tank farm. The explosion killed nine people and 
caused $21.6 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flores Joined Critics 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores -- who has been credited by 
residents and port officials for orchestrating Wednesday's agreement -- joined 
the critics in 1981, as soon as she was elected. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited, very pleased," Flores' harbor deputy, Ann D'Amato, said at 
the commission meeting Wednesday. "It's been a long haul, though." 
</P>
<P>
Unocal, which has to absorb costs of as much as $50 million to relocate the 
tanks, is also backing the agreement, but a company official did not seem 
nearly as elated about it as D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
"We're as satisfied as we can be, I think," said Nat F. Chavira, Unocal general 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Chavira said company officials have not yet picked a site for the relocated 
tanks. He added, however, that the Unocal refinery is a strong possibility. 
Once a site is found, the company will build a pipeline to the new tank farm 
from the Unocal tanker terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement approved Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor Department and Unocal will sign a "phase-out" lease to extend the 
oil company's current lease, which expired last July, to July, 1993. By then, 
the company must dismantle its tanks and restore the tank-farm site to its 
original condition. This includes removing any contamination that may have 
resulted from the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, the Harbor Department and the residents will not oppose the company's 
plans to build a pipeline to the relocated tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal's lease for the Miner Street terminal will be extended for another 30 
years, giving the company a valuable long-term commitment for that site. If, 
however, a so-called "energy island" for tanks and other hazardous facilities 
is completed within 20 years, the port has the right under the agreement to 
relocate Unocal there. 
</P>
<P>
This provision is an attempt to coordinate long-range plans for the energy 
island, announced by the Harbor Department in 1987, with the more immediate 
need to rid San Pedro of the Unocal tanks. The Harbor Department had initially 
planned to move the tanks to the island -- to be built by filling in part of 
the outer harbor -- when it is ready. But residents and Flores complained that 
such a relocation could take 10 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's meeting, Harbor Commission President Ira Distenfield 
acknowledged that community activists and Flores, who became involved in 
negotiations when the company's lease for the 22nd Street tank farm expired, 
had pushed the port into supporting the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
However, Distenfield said, the plan is a good example of how the port can 
resolve the "natural conflicts" between its industrial tenants and nearby 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We can achieve our purpose and do it with community concerns in mind," said 
Distenfield. "We all end up winners for this."

AMBUSH SHOOTING;

<P>
NURSE KILLED TRYING TO AID MAN ON STREET 
</P>

<P>
A private nurse who stopped her car in the hills above Studio City and 
apparently got out to help a man lying in the street was fatally shot Wednesday 
when the man stood up and pulled a gun, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made in the ambush killing of 40-year-old Lucille Marie Warren 
at Montcalm Avenue and Woodrow Wilson Drive in an exclusive neighborhood of 
hillside homes. 
</P>
<P>
Warren was shot at 6:45 a.m. while on her way home to Inglewood, police said. 
She had left a house on Montcalm where she worked as a night nurse. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said there were indications that she was the specific target of 
the fatal attack and may even have known her killer. Detectives are 
investigating whether Warren, who was divorced and lived with her two teen-age 
children, was involved in any personal disputes that could have led to the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't appear to be a random encounter," said homicide Detective Mike 
Coffey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Motive Unknown 
</P>
<P>
While the motive for the shooting was unknown, police said, the killer may have 
been in the street because he knew that Warren was approaching and would stop 
if she thought someone needed help. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a nurse," said Lt. Ron LaRue. "If you knew she was a nurse, you could 
find a way to make her stop. The suspect was lying in the street and she 
stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Warren had been working at the home in the Montcalm cul-de-sac at least two 
months, police said. Officials of a Van Nuys-based registry of nurses, through 
which police said Warren was referred to jobs, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives would not name the person for whom Warren worked. Los Angeles real 
estate records list the large, gated property where police said she cared for a 
patient as belonging to Miklos Rozsa, 81, a composer and three-time Academy 
Award winner for the musical scoring of films. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing her night's work, Warren was leaving the cul-de-sac when she 
stopped at Woodrow Wilson Drive after seeing the man in the middle of the 
street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gun Pulled From Clothing 
</P>
<P>
When Warren got out and walked toward the front of the car, the man stood up 
and pulled a handgun out of his clothing. Police said they do not know whether 
the pair spoke before the man fired several times at Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Warren was hit by gunfire at least twice, including once in the head, and fell 
mortally wounded in the street, police said. One other shot hit the windshield 
of her car, which eventually rolled into an embankment on the other side of the 
street. Police said the gunman ran to a car parked nearby and sped away. The 
victim was not robbed. 
</P>
<P>
A resident called police on a car phone after seeing the woman in the street. 
Coffey said several residents saw parts of the crime and provided police with 
descriptions of the gunman, his car and the sequence of events. 
</P>
<P>
Warren was taken to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, where she died at 
10:48 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
As police cordoned off the area, residents gathered nearby or watched from 
their windows. Police said the shooting, which occurred near a corner house 
owned by artist David Hockney, was unusual in the quiet, affluent neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Violence is getting common all over the city," said a man who declined to give 
his name. "People pay a lot of money to get away from it but it doesn't always 
work." 
</P>

PICUS PUSHES PLAN FOR INTERCHANGE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moving to head off opposition to a proposed Woodland Hills freeway interchange 
project, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus said Wednesday that there is 
"strong, broad-based community support" for the $40-million project. 
</P>
<P>
Picus warned that the long-sought Valley Circle-Mulholland interchange to the 
Ventura Freeway will never be built unless state and city transportation 
engineers believe they can construct something that will handle future traffic 
in the fast-growing Woodland Hills and Calabasas areas. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate that traffic, transportation officials say, the project must 
include a secondary east-west bridge over the freeway linking Ventura Boulevard 
in Woodland Hills with Calabasas Road in Calabasas and a widened north-south 
bridge at Valley Circle Boulevard 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the secondary freeway "flyover bridge" have claimed it would 
funnel heavy traffic into the Old Town village of Calabasas. They also oppose 
off-ramp designs that call for the paving of land behind the historic 
145-year-old Leonis Adobe. 
</P>
<P>
Project foes have scheduled a meeting for 7 p.m. tonight at El Camino Real High 
School, 5440 Valley Circle Blvd., to discuss their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said that recent revisions in the flyover bridge plan would prevent heavy 
traffic from clogging Calabasas and would eliminate the need to widen two-lane 
Calabasas Road. She said the project has the support of state Sens. Ed Davis 
(R-Valencia) and Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and of City Councilman Marvin 
Braude.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ANDRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Customs and drug-enforcement agents arrested an 18-year-old Yuma, Ariz. man as 
he tried to enter the United States at the Andrade border crossing with 638 
pounds of cocaine, Customs officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the largest cocaine seizure to date at Andrade, Customs officials estimated 
the shipment had a street value of $25 million. Andrade is near the Colorado 
River, 55 miles east of Calexico. 
</P>
<P>
Officers of the Customs Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration 
arrested Ricardo Encarnacion, a U. S. citizen, on suspicion of importation of a 
controlled substance and failure to declare the substance. 
</P>
<P>
A Customs inspector stopped Encarnacion at the border Tuesday when he noticed 
that the floor of the Chevrolet Suburban he was driving appeared higher than 
normal. Inspectors found 263 cellophane-wrapped packages -- containing about a 
kilogram of cocaine each -- under the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Encarnacion could be sentenced to life in prison and fined $4 million if he is 
convicted under federal statutes, Customs officials said. He was being held in 
Calexico, where he was to be arraigned by a local magistrate.

LA VENTA INN NOMINATED AS HISTORIC SITE BY COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
La Venta Inn, a stately hacienda-style hospitality center and Palos Verdes 
Estates' first structure, was nominated as a state point of historical interest 
Tuesday by the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination comes four months after owners of the 66-year-old inn, popular 
for weddings and banquets because of its history and its spectacular ocean 
view, began advertising the three-acre estate for sale for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the operators of the inn, not its owners, who applied for the 
historical designation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all very concerned. Everybody around here is concerned" that the inn 
might be demolished after its sale, said Bob Eskridge, whose family has 
operated it for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Eskridge said he has pursued state historical site status since October, when 
inn owners offered the estate for sale in an advertisement that proclaimed it 
"Palos Verdes' most historic building site." 
</P>
<P>
He interpreted that to mean that the old inn would be demolished and replaced 
by up to three single-family homes, which city officials confirm is allowed by 
the property's zoning. 
</P>
<P>
A building designated a state historical point of interest acquires limited 
protection against demolition because an environmental report listing other 
alternatives is required before it can be razed, according to the state Office 
of Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
La Venta Inn is owned by three daughters of the late Peg Schnetzler, who 
Eskridge said bought the estate in 1947. They could not be reached for comment, 
but a spokesman for them said Eskridge misinterpreted the October advertisement 
and that no protection is needed for the inn. 
</P>
<P>
The advertisement was intended to convey that the estate "is the site of the 
most historic building in Palos Verdes," not that it is a building site, said 
real estate agent and spokesman Bob Brown. "The value of that property is that 
it's such a piece of history. It's one of a kind. It's kind of like buying a 
Van Gogh painting." 
</P>
<P>
Brown acknowledged, however, that numerous developers had expressed interest in 
the estate as a building site for luxury homes. But he "could not guarantee" 
them that they could build, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my understanding that the property cannot be developed or altered. I 
think the city would be very upset if someone tried to alter that building," he 
said. "Certainly, it's the intent of the (owners) to retain it as the landmark 
property of Palos Verdes." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Gralow, a Palos Verdes Estates councilwoman, said demolition of the inn 
would not be popular with the community. "It is very special," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It is Gralow's position, however, that the value of the site might be so high 
that new construction is reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be lovely to be able to preserve that whole open site," she said, 
"but I don't see how it could be economical for the property owner to maintain 
it as it is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50-Foot Tower 
</P>
<P>
The inn was built in 1923 as a luxurious sales office for the housing tract 
that is now the city of Palos Verdes Estates. Prominent Los Angeles architect 
Walter Swindell Davis won an award for its design, which includes a distinctive 
50-foot tower. 
</P>
<P>
Its significance has grown over the decades as generations of area families 
have visited it for occasions as routine as club meetings and as special as 
high school banquets and weddings, several area residents said in interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Burrell, a Rancho Palos Verdes developer interested in the area's history, 
said whoever buys the site should "keep it just the way it is. Improve it a 
little, but keep the concept, because it's such a great place. I'm a developer, 
yes, but I'm also someone who had his football banquet there as a kid." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Dyda, a founder of the Rancho de los Palos Verdes Historical Society, said 
his group supports Eskridge's application to the state because the inn was the 
first building completed on the peninsula. The inn was designated a historical 
site in 1978 by the society not long after it was founded, Dyda said. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, it would be a very substantial loss," said Dyda, a former Rancho 
Palos Verdes councilman. "And as a community we use it for a lot of civic 
activities. People can make an argument that you can do that in another 
facility. But it's the history of the place -- the fact you can go there and 
realize how it all began -- that adds to its value." 
</P>
<P>
Eskridge said that whatever happens to the inn if it is sold, it is worthy of 
historical recognition by the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we had a bride whose mother was married here and whose grandmother 
was married here," he said. "That signifies the longstanding relationship the 
building has had with this community." 
</P>
<P>
The state Historical Resource Commission is expected to consider the nomination 
at its next meeting, in May.

HOME LOAN PACT IN JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hermosa Beach Councilwoman June Williams said Wednesday that she now opposes an 
agreement with City Manager Kevin B. Northcraft under which the city would loan 
him $250,000 to assist him in buying a home in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a public relations disaster," she said. "I was surprised by how 
strongly people came out against this." 
</P>
<P>
Williams joined Mayor Jim Rosenberger and Councilman Chuck Sheldon last week in 
approving, 3 to 2, Northcraft's request for the loan, which would have come 
from the city's $8-million investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Roger Creighton and Etta Simpson had voted against the loan, 
and Williams' change of mind likely means that the loan offer will be withdrawn 
at the City Council meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said she still thinks it would be a good idea for Northcraft, who has 
a house in El Segundo, to live in the city where he works. And, she said, the 
terms of the proposed loan, including a 120-day cancellation provision, 
adequately protected the city against loss and carried a higher interest rate 
than the city normally receives from its investments. 
</P>
<P>
"But a lot of mistaken notions started circulating and the thing got out of 
hand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Going ahead with the loan now, she said, would create bad feelings that would 
make it hard for the city manager to work with the public. Northcraft was hired 
about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said about 10 people told her they opposed the loan. "If even three 
people call you in a small town like this, you'd better watch out," she said. 
Hermosa Beach has a population of about 20,000.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST: CHEVRON REFINERY LEAK SOILS CARS; 
</P>
<P>
LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An estimated 200 people may have found the finish on their cars marred by 
cleaning solvent that spewed into the air after a mechanical failure at 
Chevron's El Segundo refinery, a company spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Spackman said a tube in a heat exchanger ruptured Monday, causing steam to 
mix with the solvent. The mixture dissipated into the air, and a "light mist" 
fell over a seven-square-block area, primarily in Manhattan Beach, he said. The 
incident lasted no more than 10 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron distributed leaflets about the incident, Spackman said. People were 
told to contact refinery officials to have their cars cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
The company isn't sure but thinks an ordinary wash and wax will remove the gunk 
from vehicles.

JACK OF ALL ACCOLADES;

CLARK HAS ARRIVED, AND THE PADRES ARE REALLY GLAD TO SEE HIM

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Lutticken, age 22, catcher, looked over at the locker and covered his 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"How can I tell him that I used to sit with his fan club in the right field 
upper deck at Candlestick Park?" he asked. "Do I just walk up and tell him, 
'Hey, I used to be a member of Jack the Rippers?' " 
</P>
<P>
Mark Grant, age 25, pitcher, looked over and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know he used to be my favorite player, even though I was also a player? 
On the same team?" he asked. "Talk about a little bit of intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn, age 28, star, looked over that the locker just a couple of steps 
from his locker and dropped his voice: 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here seven years, I've seen a lot, and yet when he walked in that 
door this morning . . . I was whispering, 'There he is, there's Jack Clark, 
there's the man." 
</P>
<P>
The reaction at the Kroc Complex clubhouse Wednesday could not have been more 
opened-mouthed had Jack McKeon walked up in a Liz Claiborne original. It was as 
if none of the Padres really believed it would happen: Jack Clark has become 
one of them. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived at the park in a blue-and-black designer sweatsuit early Wednesday 
morning. He was one of the last two players to depart some 7 hours later. In 
between, in the first full-squad Padre workout, he didn't do much more than 
just be Jack Clark. There was the stern expression, the funny batting stance, 
the heavy trot. But for now, for a team in search of an aura, that was enough. 
</P>
<P>
"His presence," Grant said, "really does do something." 
</P>
<P>
In the clubhouse, it caused many of the team's youngsters to tentatively 
approach him for a handshake. On the field, it meant four television cameras 
were constantly hounding him for a closeup, and more early-spring fans than 
anyone could remember followed him around for a peek. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, it caused Clark to shrug. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no pressure -- all I'm supposed to do here is what I can do," he said. 
"I'm capable of hitting the ball like nobody else. Not long, but hard. That's 
not bragging, I've just been blessed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a role player, just like all of us are role players. My role is to slug." 
</P>
<P>
As in 25 or more homers five different seasons. As in 100-plus RBIs twice. By 
comparison, the Padres have had a player hit more than 25 homers just once in 
the past nine seasons. They have had a player accrue more than 100 RBIs just 
twice in the club's 20-year history. 
</P>
<P>
These statistics blinked through the Padres' minds when they made the trade 
last Oct. 24 that brought the four-time All Star here along with pitcher Pat 
Clements from the New York Yankees for pitchers Jimmy Jones and Lance McCullers 
and outfielder Stanley Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have the one guy who, if you're down one run, it ain't nothing, 
if you're down two runs it ain't nothing," pitcher Ed Whitson said. "You got to 
have the kind of guy where, if the pitcher makes a mistake, the game is over, 
you win. We haven't had that guy before, but now we do. 
</P>
<P>
"Take it from me, because I've faced him . . . if the pitcher makes a mistake 
on Jack Clark, you ain't going to find the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson then made the rather unorthodox announcement that he would rather not 
pitch to Clark again, not even this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want me to pitch him batting practice, they better let me get behind a 
screen," Whitson said. "If not, I'm going to throw him a whole lot of strikes 
in the dirt. He's one of only two hitters who ever made me afraid that the ball 
is going to come up the middle and take my head off. He swings so hard, you can 
actually hear the bat going through the strike zone. Sounds like woosh -- 
somebody swinging a wire hanger through the air." 
</P>
<P>
If Clark's first day as a Padre was any indication, Whitson won't need to worry 
just yet. Clark displayed pudge both around his middle and in his swing and, in 
general, had the look of a man in need of about 42 days worth of fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, when asked about his shape, he smiled. And then he explained that he's 
trying to stop a trend: When it comes to his regular seasons, auto races have 
gotten off to cleaner starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure people looked at me today and said, 'Why did they trade for this 
guy?" Clark said. "But I used to come to spring training in great shape, all 
gung ho and everything, and then lose it all in the last week before the season 
and start out hitting .150. I've had my share of climbing out of the cellar. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I take my time, get ready slowly. I don't need to play every inning of 
every game down here. A couple of innings here, then a couple of more innings, 
and then finally, I get it going by the last 10 days of camp. I use spring 
training for what it is, training." 
</P>
<P>
For Clark, there is also the matter of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a cracked this or a ruptured that, he has failed to play as many as 
100 games twice in the past five years and missed the 1987 World Series when he 
was with St. Louis because of an Achilles tendon injury. He feels the pains may 
have been caused by too much work too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be ready to go hard when it counts," said Clark, 33. "And it doesn't 
count here. I don't want to get hurt here and miss six weeks. If I'm getting 
hurt, I'm going to make sure it's when it means something." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Padres were convinced that just Clark being there meant 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine," John Kruk said from his locker stall as his teammates were dressing 
to leave. "Me sitting here and watching Jack Clark and Bruce Hurst walking 
around the same clubhouse. It's enough to . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Whoa, said Clark. If teammates want to make him a leader, he said, they had 
better understand one thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Leadership is letting everyone know that we are all role players, none of us 
different, just with different roles," Clark said. "I can't ask anybody else to 
be me, and I don't want to be anybody else. And we all should feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'm making good money ($2 million for each of the next two seasons), but 
I'm getting that money whether I hit a homer or not. I'm paid the same whether 
I have great statistics or not. All of us have one job -- to do what it takes 
to win. Anything, everything. All of us are the same, all of us need each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rhetoric, at least on Wednesday, Jack Clark didn't need to say 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was a day for just looking at him," Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Besides Jack Clark, the remaining four Padre position players reported to camp 
on the requested day Wednesday, bringing the number here to 42, with one 
notable absentee: pitcher Eric Show. He did not recover from the flu in time 
for this workout, as most expected, and now apparently won't show up until 
Friday after having his physical examination in San Diego today. That will be 
six days late, not too desirable for a man the Padres hope will be their 
opening day starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres held another one of their typically bizarre press conferences, this 
to introduce Tal Smith, the club consultant who will be a sort of an acting, 
acting general manager until a club president is hired following a search by 
Smith's consulting firm. Smith admitted that, "There isn't any job title, I'll 
just be filling in, pinch-hitting, as long as necessary." Basically, Smith will 
be pushing paperwork that can't be handled by Manager Jack McKeon, who will 
still make all the deals and do the other general manager stuff, per his 
agreement with Padre owner Joan Kroc last September. Smith was appointed now 
because McKeon is on the field all day and can't handle everything. Smith will 
also be working with Dick Freeman, the Padres' "acting president," which should 
set some kind of record for front office instability. "I think the situation is 
self-explanatory," said Smith, giving him the early lead for the most debatable 
quote of the spring. He then explained: "The Padre front office has to be 
reorganized, there has to be a CEO appointed, and any other determinations will 
be made by him. I will be here until that CEO is appointed." 
</P>
<P>
Among other national media types here, Sports Illustrated is working on a 
possible cover piece on the Padres . . . McKeon met with John Kruk early in 
Wednesday's practice and told him to, "Take it easy on the knee, don't rush 
anything, don't try to come back too fast," according to Kruk. The right 
fielder underwent arthroscopic surgery in late January and has not fully 
recovered. His obvious limp and his difficulty running, along with a gain of 
several extra pounds, has lessened his trade value with the Atlanta Braves, who 
would need him if the swap for Dale Murphy could be pulled off . . . McKeon 
talked with Braves' General Manager Bobby Cox Wednesday morning and reported 
that Cox told him, "I don't know what to do." According to McKeon, Cox is still 
holding out hope of trading Murphy to the New York Mets, whose deal with the 
Seattle Mariners has suddenly taken a turn for the worse. If the Mets and 
Braves get together, look for the Mariners and Padres to attempt to do 
something involving pitcher Mark Langston and outfielder Mickey Brantley of the 
Mariners, and catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. and a starting pitcher for the Padres. 
The Mariners want Show, but McKeon will offer somebody else.

AZTECS GET A LIFT, END LOSS STREAK AT 3 GAMES

<TEXT>
<P>
If a victory over a two-year-old Division I basketball program can have much 
meaning, then maybe some good will come out of San Diego State's 93-78 victory 
over Florida International at the San Diego Sports Arena Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Because if there was ever a team that needed a boost, it was the Aztecs. Losers 
of three in a row and 10 of their past 12, the Aztecs were thankful for any 
victory, even one against a program that as a recently as two years ago was 
playing teams such as Palm Beach Atlantic and opened this season against 
Florida Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
"This game came at a good time, and if we can win Saturday night (against U.S. 
International) maybe we can have a little momentum going into our trip (next 
week) to New Mexico and Texas El Paso," said junior guard Tony Ross, who scored 
a season-high 25 points before fouling out with 2:07 left. "These games could 
be the most important of the season because they can give us a little boost 
going into the conference tournament." 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say any of the Aztecs would confuse a victory over the Golden 
Panthers (9-16) with one against any member of the Western Athletic Conference, 
but at this point of what has become a disappointing season for the Aztecs 
(11-14), any hopeful sign is encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't pretty, but we'll take it," said reserve guard Rodney Jones, who 
scored a season-high nine points. "We needed something to go our way." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs established control early behind the shooting of Ross, who scored 
nine of his 25 points in the first 5 minutes. Ross took advantage of a 
man-to-man defense that left him unguarded for several layups and long-range 
jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get out of league, teams don't have a long time to scout you, and 
they leave shooters open," SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg said. "You turn him 
loose, and he is going to score. We did a good job getting him the basketball, 
and he did a good job getting it into the hole." 
</P>
<P>
Ross was one of four Aztecs, but the only starter, to score a season high 
against the Golden Panthers as Brandenburg used the game to substitute freely. 
Much of that was out of choice, but quite a bit was out of necessity. Four 
Aztecs fouled out, including three starters -- center Mitch McMullen, power 
forward Sam Johnson and Ross. 
</P>
<P>
For McMullen, it was his ninth disqualification, third in his past four games 
and his earliest of the season. McMullen fouled out with 11:18 to play with six 
points and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The numerous substitutions made for some unusual combinations. At one point the 
Aztecs were playing with two walk-on guards -- William Dixion and Kevin 
Honaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to give some guys who haved played much some playing time," 
Brandenburg said. "At some times our combinations were kind of strange." 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg hardly appeared worried about it all. He kept starters Shawn Bell 
and Michael Best on the bench even with Florida International as close as 10 
points in the final 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But the Golden Panthers were never able to get much closer. The loss was only 
their third in the past nine games. They had revived their season after a 1-13 
midyear swoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs' 93 points were the most since a 102-88 victory over UC Irvine, but 
the crowd of 1,768 was the worst since 1,529 attended a New Year's Eve victory 
over Vermont and the third worst in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not at our sharpest," Brandenburg said. "We got out to an early lead 
and just (traded baskets) for most of the night. The one good thing was we had 
a chance to play a lot of the younger players."

Seeking to rebound from a dismal season, St. Genevieve High hired Cal State

Lovett replaces Kevin Kane, who resigned last fall after posting a 1-8 record, 
including an 0-4 mark in San Fernando Valley League play. Lovett, who teaches 
science at Alemany High, will join the St. Genevieve teaching staff in the 
fall.

St. Genevieve Principal Rudy Trujillo announced the hiring, saying that Lovett 
has the qualities to restore glory to a sagging program. Since 1966, the 
Valiants have won three Southern Section titles and twice were runners-up. 
</P>
<P>
"St. Genevieve is turning its athletic program around and football is central 
to that," he said. "We've been a credible athletic school for many years and we 
don't want to lose that. The football program needs to be revitalized and Mark 
has the charisma and the know-how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Lovett, 34, is a former Valley-area standout, starring as a tailback at El 
Camino Real High from 1970-71 and then winning three varsity letters at Arizona 
State from 1972-76. He was selected the Sun Devils' most valuable player his 
final year. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel more confident going into a dead program rather than one that's 
established," said Lovett, a member of the CSUN staff the past three years. "I 
told the kids, 'You've been waiting four months for me and I've been waiting 
forever for you, so let's get started.' I'm pumped." 
</P>
<P>
After a brief career in a semipro league in Seattle, Lovett returned to the 
Valley and assisted Skip Giancanelli, his high school coach, at El Camino Real 
from 1981 to '85 before joining the Northridge program. 
</P>
<P>
A glowing recommendation from Giancanelli helped Lovett land the St. Genevieve 
job.

RUMORS ARE FLYING THAT STAR BANNING BACK SPARKS IS RUNNING TO NEW SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is football star Derek Sparks leaving Banning High School? 
</P>
<P>
That was the rumor circulating on the Wilmington campus Wednesday regarding the 
All-L.A. City running back who gained fame as one of the state's top sophomores 
last season by rushing for 1,394 yards and 15 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks has not attended Banning since the spring semester started Feb. 6 and is 
in Texas with his mother, according to Sparks' grandmother, who lives in 
Wharton, Tex. Neither Sparks nor his mother could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
While Banning officials said they were under the impression that Sparks would 
play for the Pilots next fall, sources say he plans to transfer to another 
Southern California high school. 
</P>
<P>
Here is what is known: 
</P>
<P>
* Sparks is scheduled to appear Tuesday at First Church of God Christian School 
in Los Angeles as part of a "role model" program for eighth graders, according 
to Principal Feager Pertilla. 
</P>
<P>
* Pertilla said a man who identified himself as Eric Sparks, the football 
player's uncle, asked the school's permission to have news media present when 
Derek appears. 
</P>
<P>
"I said it would be OK," Pertilla said, "as long as it doesn't disrupt my 
school." 
</P>
<P>
Pertilla said she does not know any member of the Sparks family. The idea to 
have Derek participate in Tuesday's program came from a student at the school 
who apparently knows Sparks, Pertilla said. 
</P>
<P>
Banning football Coach Joe Dominguez was surprised by the latest episode 
involving one of his best players. 
</P>
<P>
"I just assumed he was going to officially return here," he said. "He hasn't 
officially checked out of school, but he probably is. The kid didn't miss a day 
of school in the fall semester and now he's missed 2 1/2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I saw him was the last day of the fall semester. As far as I 
know, we treated the kid fine. The last time I talked to him he was thrilled 
about being here. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is that we're going to continue to have a fine team here with or 
without him. We're not built around one person." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, who guided Banning to an 11-3 record and the L.A. City 4-A final in 
his first season as head coach, said Sparks lived with his uncle Jerome in a 
Wilmington apartment after moving from Texas after the ninth grade. He said the 
elder Sparks has since given up the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think his two uncles are controlling his life," Dominguez said. "I think 
sometimes parents or guardians are frustrated athletes, and this gives them a 
chance to run with the football, so to speak. I think that might be the case 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Eric nor Jerome Sparks could be reached.

NEW COACH AND A ROCKING UPSET OVER NO. 2 ARIZONA SHOW TOROS ARE READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS KAISER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In collegiate baseball, the rank and file of the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. has often fallen in behind Cal Poly Pomona. The Broncos have won six of 
13 CCAA titles since 1976, including last year's crown. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, though, there may be changes, especially at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
Last year the Toros finished conference play 10 games below .500 after winning 
back-to-back titles in 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A new coach, George Wing, has taken the place of Andy Lopez, who moved to 
Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
This is Wing's first coaching position at a four-year college, but he brings a 
winning record from the community college ranks. His Cosumnes River College 
team in Northern California went 30-17 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Wing takes over a team stocked with solid returning talent and top community 
college transfers. The Toros, off to a 3-4-1 start, could shake up the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
CCAA rivals have warning: Dominguez Hills opened the season two weeks ago on 
the road with a rocking 12-4 upset over Arizona, ranked second nationally, 
though the following day the Wildcats reversed the blowout, 18-4. The Toros 
opened the CCAA last weekend by knocking off Pomona, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
How well the Toros, 19-30 last season and 10-20 in the CCAA, do depends largely 
on pitching. 
</P>
<P>
An early indicator of success was senior Rick Davis' victory over Arizona. 
Davis, who was recruited to pitch but had converted to shortstop, threw a 
complete game, gave up five hits and struck out 11 in his pitching debut. In 
three starts he has struck out 40 in 29 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Davis got help against Arizona from who figure to be leaders at the plate. Last 
year third baseman Ruben Jauregui hit .408 to lead the CCAA, and outfielder 
Lenny Hokanson hit .286 and set a school record and nine triples. In two games 
at Arizona, Hokanson delivered six RBIs and Jauregui collected five hits. 
</P>
<P>
"We swing the bat well. I don't have to worry about that," Wing said. "The CCAA 
is usually known for strong hitters, but we have pitching too, if we can stay 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good, from freshman to senior, about the pitching staff. That's going 
to be our key." 
</P>
<P>
The Toros' No. 1 pitcher is sophomore right-hander Charlie Plumley, from Palos 
Verdes High and UC Berkeley. Besides Plumley and Davis, Wing said, the staff 
has not been firmly established. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills' top reliever is senior Dave Haggard. The right-hander was 4-4 
last year with a 3.13 earned-run average. The top left-handed reliever is John 
Gutierrez, who was 7-2 last season at Cosumnes River. 
</P>
<P>
Junior lefties Armando Gomez and Ron Veazey figure to pitch in middle relief. 
</P>
<P>
When he isn't pitching, Davis will return to shortstop. "It will be a 
trial-and-error type of thing," Wing said. "We'll have to wait and see how much 
he can handle." 
</P>
<P>
Infield starters include two former Leffingwell High players at catcher. The 
primary duties fall on senior Mike McCarthy, who hit .280 last season for the 
Toros, but sophomore Dwayne Fowler will also get playing time behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Damon Neidlinger returns to first base, his most comfortable position, 
after filling in most of last season at second when the infield was hit with 
injuries. Wing said junior Adrian Rodriguez has earned the starting spot at 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Hokanson will platoon in left field with sophomore Vic Fresca, probably joined 
by juniors Robert Campbell in center and Bill Keep in right. Campbell is 
battling with Marty Williams, a transfer from L.A. Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
"What impresses me most about this team is the character they display," Wing 
said. "They are not going to roll over and die."

RUSH, VALLEY OVERWHELM GROSSMONT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Grossmont College Coach Randy Robinson pleaded with his Lady Griffins to get 
downcourt and stop the Valley College offense. 
</P>
<P>
A formidable task indeed, considering the quickness and strength of the Lady 
Monarchs, who are ranked fifth in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Robinson's urging, Valley powered to an impressive 90-70 victory over 
Grossmont of El Cajon in the opening round of the junior college state 
regionals Wednesday night at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Tisa Rush, a freshman guard from Kennedy High, led the way for Valley (28-3) 
with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Rush had a frustrating first half, connecting on only two of eight shots from 
the field, but she warmed to the task in the second half after Coach Doug 
Michelson told her to keep shooting even though the shots weren't falling. 
</P>
<P>
Rush's performance drew mock hatred from Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson walked up to Rush after the game and told her, "I hate you, Tisa," who 
had a confused look on her face. 
</P>
<P>
"I really hate you. You killed us and I hate the way you played," he said. 
"Really I hated the way you played because you destroyed us, but I want you to 
know you did a great job," Robinson continued with a smile and a big hug for 
Rush. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous in the first half but I settled down and concentrated later on," 
Rush said. "I feel confident now because everybody did a good job." 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs, besides Rush, were just too much for the Griffins, second-place 
finishers in the Pacific Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Valley had five scorers in double figures, and a strong bench contributed 24 
points to make things easy for the Western State Conference Southern Division 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a drop-off when we put in our substitutes," Michelson said. "We 
plan on going 10 deep in every game and it really makes us strong." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the bench of Grossmont (17-11) produced only five points. Guard 
Karen Boisvert was the team's only offensive weapon, but a good one, scoring a 
game-high 34 points. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Rumfola scored 16 points, Shaggaro Lattin added 15 and Sandrine 
Rocher came off the bench to score 13 for Valley. Ruth Aguilar had a game-high 
11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very satisfying to see our balanced scoring tonight," Michelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Valley forced 20 Grossmont turnovers and outrebounded the Griffins, 48-36. PAUL

WHEATCROFT AND CSUN SUBMERGE WAVES, 5-4

<P>
Right-handed pitcher Wayne Helm of Pepperdine was the featured attraction for 
professional scouts, but Robert Wheatcroft of Cal State Northridge all but 
stole his show Wednesday in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Wheatcroft, a senior right-hander, pitched Northridge to a 5-4 nonconference 
victory over the Division I Waves and earned high marks from two Baltimore 
Orioles scouts who were in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Helm (1-2) and Wheatcroft (4-0) dueled until the ninth inning, when Chae-Ho 
Chong hit a two-run home run to cap a four-run rally that gave CSUN a 5-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves (4-6) closed to within a run on Richard Barnwell's two-run homer to 
left in the ninth, but Wheatcroft retired the next two batters to seal the win. 
</P>
<P>
"Pepperdine is a legitimate Division I team and we are not going to play better 
teams than this," CSUN Coach Bill Kernen said. "This is the biggest win for 
this team by far this year." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (7-1) has won three consecutive games against Division I opponents 
going into its California Collegiate Athletic Assn. opener at Cal State Los 
Angeles on Friday. RALPH NICHOLS

TOROS CAGERS BATTLE FOR HOST HONORS IN CCAA

The Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball team can secure its playoff 
future with a pair of victories this week. 
</P>
<P>
Wins over visiting Cal State Bakersfield tonight at 7:30 and Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo on Saturday night at 8:05 will assure that the Toros will play host to 
the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. postseason tournament March 4-5 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills (18-7) is tied with UC Riverside (21-4) for the CCAA lead at 
10-2. If the conference race finishes in a tie, the tiebreaker would come down 
to each team's record against Bakersfield, which is in third place. Riverside 
lost at Bakersfield last week, so a pair of Toro wins over Bakersfield would 
put the tournament in Carson. PAUL McLEOD

TOROS KATHY GOGGIN SCORES ON THE COURT AND IN THE CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In elementary school Kathy Goggin was so tall she played on boys basketball 
teams and towered over the lads. 
</P>
<P>
She entered the seventh grade as a precocious redhead at 5-foot-9 and by the 
time she got to Long Beach Wilson High School was "not huge, just a thick" 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Goggin, now 6-3, will lumber onto the basketball court at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills for the last time Saturday night, the fourth-ranked rebounder and 
ninth-highest scorer in the school's history. She is one of the few students to 
complete four years of basketball at Dominguez Hills, and school officials 
acclaim that she is their first Rhodes Scholarship candidate. In the fall 
she'll enroll in a doctoral program at USC. 
</P>
<P>
But soon she'll face life without basketball, a scary part of the game that all 
athletes reach. 
</P>
<P>
"The big void," is what Dominguez Hills Coach Van Girard called it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a time when the future seems frightening to a 22-year old senior who 
admits to being "a big baby" when it comes to everyday things. 
</P>
<P>
"I have led a sheltered life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball is a great equalizer that teaches young people to overcome 
obstacles, according to Girard. In Goggin's case, her love for basketball came 
despite discomfort in both knees, a dislocated shoulder, surgery to correct 
tumors on toes and bone spurs in both feet. She overcame those obstacles, so 
Girard suggests she'll adjust to "the real world." 
</P>
<P>
"She already has the knowledge and ability to be successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that life without basketball won't mean a little adjustment. Early on she 
discovered that playing a sport was an easy way for a plump freckle-faced kid 
to win a little respect. 
</P>
<P>
"By high school it was no easy picture for me," she said of her increasing 
height, which often drew rude comments. "Going through that made me stronger. I 
believe I can handle just about anything now." 
</P>
<P>
Goggin says she has had an average career, playing on a series of teams from 
high school to college that had difficulties finishing .500. This season Goggin 
has had a disappointing time. She averages only 8.6 points and 5.6 rebounds a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had the productive year I would have liked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Girard, a successful high school coach completing his first-year at Dominguez 
Hills, feels Goggin did not get the proper training during her college career. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had had her for four years I feel her statistics would have been much 
more impressive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goggin, however, isn't so sure. "I am not a phenomenal player," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She has been phenomenal in the classroom, however. At Wilson she received just 
one grade below A. It was a borderline B that came as a sophomore in a Spanish 
class. At Dominguez Hills she has fared almost as well, posting a cumulative 
3.895 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not brilliant," she said. "I just work hard." 
</P>
<P>
Goggin received quite a bit of attention in high school, ironically, she says, 
because of her height. Her college choices boiled down to UCLA or Dominguez 
Hills. UCLA wasn't interested in her as a basketball player so she chose 
Dominguez Hills because "I wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
Four years later she has become one of the school's brightest spokespersons and 
its most vocal critic. Because the enrollment is small for a state college, she 
said, class sizes allow for a more personal relationship between instructors 
and students. 
</P>
<P>
Because the school has ethnic diversity and a wider age span of students, she 
said, she came across a variety of viewpoints in class. 
</P>
<P>
She has criticized the school for not publicizing its strong points, a sore 
point with administrators. She feels she has not received enough attention as a 
Rhodes scholar candidate, a fact she feels would bring added credibility to a 
state college that has a bad rap as an inner-city dead end. 
</P>
<P>
Goggin had a slight interest in medicine when her sister, Jill, then 23, gave 
birth to her second child about three years ago. Jill asked Kathy to be her 
delivery room coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a phenomenal experience watching that baby being born," Kathy 
said. "It got me interested in health-related issues." 
</P>
<P>
Goggin plans to earn her doctorate in clinical psychology with the hope that 
she can lead a movement that will bring full-time psychology departments to 
major hospitals handling the terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
Goggin picked at a blueberry muffin during breakfast the other day at a Long 
Beach restaurant. Weight, like height, has been a constant in her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just the Goodyear Blimp in hiding," she joked. 
</P>
<P>
She was contemplating the answers to questions about her life after basketball. 
Among her worries, she said, would be the little things in life. 
</P>
<P>
"This may sound stupid," she said. "But I haven't paid rent in my life. How do 
you get a telephone anyway? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the conversation sounded serious enough, but somehow it was hard to 
believe that Goggin would have trouble surviving -- with or without basketball 
-- when she faces her real world.

In another baseball game: 
</P>
<P>

TOROS GET 1 HIT, SCORE 7 RUNS, TOP RIVERSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills needed only one hit to score seven runs in the 
seventh inning in a 7-1 victory Wednesday over UC Riverside at Toro Field. The 
victory improved the Toros' record to 2-0 in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. and 4-4-1 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Davis pitched a three-hitter and struck out 13 to improve to 3-0. The 
senior right-hander has struck out 53 batters in 38 innings. Davis took a 
no-hitter into the sixth inning. The only run he gave up was a leadoff homer in 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros, who had only four hits, struck back in the bottom of the seventh 
with help from the Highlanders. Riverside's Doug Pierce, working on the 
shutout, walked the first two batters, then loaded the bases with an 
intentional walk following a sacrifice. A squeeze brought home the tying run, 
and catcher Mike McCarthy followed with a two-run single. An error, another 
squeeze and a wild pitch brought in the final runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros will play their annual alumni game Saturday at 1 p.m., then resume 
CCAA play Monday at home against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

ROMEO MAKES MOST NOISE IN FINAL; 
</P>
<P>
SHE BEATS SILL FOR CHAMPIONSHIP OF LPBT TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When the bowling ball leaves Aleta Sill's hand, it pops like a champagne cork. 
</P>
<P>
Sill, from Dearborn, Mich., came ever so close to having a reason to pop open 
the real thing at the conclusion of the Ladies Professional Bowlers Tour 
tournament at Kearny Mesa Bowl Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
It would have happened if champion Robin Romeo of Van Nuys hadn't uncorked so 
many strikes in the championship match of the stepladder finals. Romeo busted 
the pins and excited the crowd from the first frame, striking seven times to 
defeat Sill, 215-190, and win $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to be aggressive," said Romeo, who now has nine career titles 
after also winning two weeks ago at Canoga Park. "Coming from the first spot, 
that's the only way you can go out there and win." 
</P>
<P>
Romeo was seeded first after match play with 8,970 pins, ahead of San Diego's 
Wendy Macpherson (8,850) and Judy Soutar (8,822) of Leawood, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Sill, who earned $2,500 for second place, won three matches to reach the 
finals, if not always in picturesque fashion. 
</P>
<P>
She was solid in defeating Leanne Barrette of Oklahoma City, Okla., 211-173, in 
the second match. Then, after beating Soutar, a 29-year veteran, in the third, 
Sill won a ragged battle of splits and open frames against Macpherson, the 
hometown favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Macpherson got an early indication of what was ahead when she left a pin for an 
open first frame. She smiled and shook her head afterward but was soon shaking 
her head without the smile. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no clue where to stand, where to play," Macpherson said. "How much 
confidence do you have if you haven't gotten a strike (going into) the 10th?" 
</P>
<P>
Evidently not enough. Sill closed with three spares and a strike to take a 
narrow, 157-150 victory. Macpherson earned $2,000 for third. 
</P>
<P>
The night soon belonged to Romeo, who opened the championship match with two 
strikes. They were not the kind where a pin wobbles several times before 
dropping. These were "see you later" strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Romeo looked as confident as the score indicated. Wearing sunglasses to cut the 
glare from the television cameras, she was cool throughout, leaving just one 
open frame, after the match had pretty much been decided. 
</P>
<P>
She wore the sunglasses at Canoga Park, too. They may look somewhat strange, 
she says, but the results suit her just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the TV monitor and said, 'Oh, God. I can't believe how funny I look,' " 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Are the shades intimidating to others? 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows?" Romeo said. "They might be." 
</P>
<P>
Sill's problem wasn't the sunglasses. She wasn't confident after a shaky 
morning round that included scores of 164, 166 and 170. She entered the 
stepladder seeded fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I already had it in my mind that I was going to bowl my one match and be done 
with it," she said. "It was really, really weird." 
</P>
<P>
But she got by with what little she had until Romeo came along. Romeo had a 
4-hour wait before she was able to perform. She knew by the earlier scores she 
probably wouldn't have to bowl a top game to win. 
</P>
<P>
"'I didn't expect her to shoot a 250 game at me," Romeo said. "When I got the 
double, it got my adrenaline flowing." 
</P>
<P>
Barrette advanced to the second match against Sill with a 207-166 victory over 
Jeanne Maiden of Solon, Ohio.

DAVE DISTEL: RIGHT OVER THAT NEXT HILL, IT'S A MILLION MILES AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Normally, the expression "so near and yet so far" has a negative connotation. 
It means getting close to success, yet failing. It goes hand-in-hand with "wait 
till next year," and those words epitomize the frustration of not quite getting 
it done. 
</P>
<P>
And so I present to you a deliciously different twist on being so near and yet 
so far away. 
</P>
<P>
I will stay within the world of sports but spin mildly rather than wildly off 
in a different direction. I will take you to a world far from drug abuse, 
arbitration, cheating, firings and the stupidity of million-dollar contracts 
for playing children's games. 
</P>
<P>
What's wonderful about this world so far away is that it is so close. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Thoreau would love the place. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Fonda would find it golden. 
</P>
<P>
Doane Pond. 
</P>
<P>
It was nestled in a valley surrounded by pines and oaks at the end of a meadow 
brown with grasses waiting for the warmth of spring to kick them to life. 
</P>
<P>
It looked to be the kind of place you would not expect to find unless you took 
a 10-hour drive to the Sierra or maybe a two-day drive to the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
But there it was, little more than an hour northeast of Escondido up on the 
shoulder of Palomar Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of place you take your kids, your dog and a book. I don't have 
a dog, and it just so happens that my son took me, which was nice. Eric is 24, 
an age when it seems parents and children occasionally change roles, and the 
children share experiences they have had. 
</P>
<P>
Not that it mattered, but the object of this excursion was to impress our wives 
with the notion that we really could catch fish. Thus far, through most such 
journeys to conventional places such as Jennings, Hodges and Miramar, we had 
returned home with lame excuses about the temperature, water conditions, time 
of day and our after-shave conspiring to keep our stringers empty. (I think the 
instructions were still attached to my stringer.) 
</P>
<P>
And so we traveled northeast out of Escondido, accompanied by a mutual friend 
named Norm McNett. We passed through Valley Center and the Rincon Indian 
Reservation on a morning made gloomy by gray clouds. We passed signs offering 
baby cockateels, oranges, appaloosas, lemons, bunnies, paintings, avocadoes and 
assorted dogs. We passed beyond where I thought civilization ended. It seemed 
the Salton Sea was about to be spread below us over the next hill. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, we eventually passed into and through the clouds on a winding mountain 
road. We climbed until patches of snow showed up in the shady spots along the 
side. 
</P>
<P>
We passed into another world. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 9 a.m., we pulled into a parking lot inside Palomar Mountain 
State Park. 
</P>
<P>
"This is it," Eric said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful," I said, and it was. "But where is the pond?" 
</P>
<P>
It was so small that it was hidden by a small knoll at the end of the parking 
lot. One other car was in the lot. 
</P>
<P>
As we organized our gear, eight deer came out of the woods behind us, trotted 
nonchalantly across a small meadow and disappeared into the trees on the other 
side. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good sign," Eric said. 
</P>
<P>
"We catch fish when we see deer," Norm said. 
</P>
<P>
Since I had never seen deer at Jennings or Hodges or Miramar, I understood why 
I had never caught a fish at any of those lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Eric and Norm are quite serious about this business. The money they have spent 
on all the latest gimmicks to fool fish would probably feed a group of 20 at 
the nicest seafood restaurant in town . . . with a few bottles of Pouilly 
Fuisse. 
</P>
<P>
It amused me, however, to learn of the time Eric whipped his rod backward to 
cast toward some reeds and looked upward to see Norm's hat sailing toward his 
target with the lure hooked in its brim. That was my idea of a highlight clip 
for Fishing Follies. 
</P>
<P>
I crested the knoll with no thought of actually catching a fish. The little 
pond, maybe 100 yards long and 60 wide, was gray-brown because the cloud cover 
had literally caught up with us. It looked like a place for Tom Sawyer and 
Huckleberry Finn, if they had been lucky enough to live near such a place. 
</P>
<P>
And it was cold. I was wearing a knit cap I had bought for the Chargers' 
playoff game in Cincinnati in 1982 and the heaviest jacket I could borrow. I 
was not going to be tinkering too much with changing lures or hooks either, 
because my hands were like frozen fish sticks. 
</P>
<P>
We settled in, warming when the clouds blew away and shivering when they came 
back. The changing extremes in temperature actually became part of the charm. 
It could only be quite like it was at a pastoral mountain pond. 
</P>
<P>
That a succession of trout found what we were offering inexplicably 
irresistible added to an outing that did not really need piscatorial success to 
be delightful. 
</P>
<P>
One particular fish hit my bait energetically and seemed determined to complete 
his meal and stay exactly where he was. He twisted and turned until I almost 
had him ashore, when he jumped from the water, did a Greg Louganis and 
virtually spit the hook into my lap. 
</P>
<P>
"So near and yet so far," I said to Norm. 
</P>
<P>
And then I thought: What a perfect description of the whole experience. 
</P>
<P>
On Doane Pond.

SERRA GIRLS BEAT GRANITE HILLS ON PENALTY KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a sudden-death round of tie-breaking penalty kicks, forward Andrea Gormican 
scored the winning goal as Serra defeated Granite Hills, 1-0, in the first 
round of the San Diego Section 3-A girls' soccer playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see a game won like that," Serra Coach Laurie Berger said. "I'd 
rather have a goal." 
</P>
<P>
Berger said the game was scoreless in regulation because of missed 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"Granite Hills played a good tough game but couldn't score," Berger said. "They 
were very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Serra (9-8-4), which will meet San Dieguito Saturday, went undefeated in the 
Eastern League (7-0-3). 
</P>
<P>
Granite Hills finished 10-6-6.

Torrey Pines 6, Castle Park 0 -- Center forward Danielle Napoli scored two 
goals for Torrey Pines (14-4-2), which took advantage of a defensive mistake to 
take a 2-0 halftime lead. Castle Park finished 10-7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel 1, Helix 0 -- Junior forward Nicole Hall scored 8 minutes into the 
game to give Mt. Carmel (11-7-6) the victory over Helix (7-9-3). Goalkeeper 
Heather Petterson had her 14th shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Poway 1, Hilltop 0 -- Poway's Kyle Clark scored with 15 minutes left off an 
assist by Alison Gibson. Goalkeeper Wendy Kevan had a save for Poway (14-4-5). 
Hilltop is 12-5-2.

By the time La Jolla center Kyle Kupiec, the Vikings' potent scoring mainstay, 
fouled out, it was already too late. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista had already silenced Kupiec and the rest of Vikings on the 
way to a 75-67 victory Wednesday night in the second round of San Diego Section 
Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
For the Longhorns, winners of eight of their past 10 games, the upset of the 
No. 5-seeded Vikings was a matter of hustle and listening to RBV Coach John 
O'Neill at halftime, when they were down, 36-30. 
</P>
<P>
"I just talked about how hard we were playing, how we were just falling asleep 
and that we still were only down by six," O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla (15-9) jumped out to a 17-14 first-quarter lead and extended it to 
30-21 -- its largest lead of the game -- with 3:51 left in the second quarter 
as Kupiec scored 12 points and David Berteaux added nine. 
</P>
<P>
But RBV (14-13) came out in the second half and began playing its game, 
employing the kind of penetrating offense it had relied on all season. 
</P>
<P>
"Our game isn't geared to set up, we're not a good half-court offensive team," 
O'Neill said. "We started penetrating the lane and making some very good 
decisions out there." 
</P>
<P>
RBV took its first lead, 45-43, with 2:50 left in the third quarter on a 
three-pointer from Jay Beyler. 
</P>
<P>
But the tone was set when Brad Grubaugh passed inside to Greg Porter, who score 
on a layup for a 66-63 lead with 2:17 remaining and fouled Kupiec out in the 
process. Porter's free throw pushed the lead to four. 
</P>
<P>
"That play really changed the game," O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
Said La Jolla Coach Rick Eveleth: "A lot of it was our lack of being able to 
stop their penetration and their hustling to the loose ball. We didn't do that. 
We started sitting on defense, and they took advantage of that." 
</P>
<P>
Kupiec scored 12 of his 20 points in the first half, and scored his last points 
on a layin to pull La Jolla to 60-53 with 4:05 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But Eveleth said Kupiec staying in the game wouldn't have mattered. 
</P>
<P>
"The game was pretty much over when he fouled out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Fellars led the Longhorns with 18 points. Darryl Parker added 17 for RBV.

<P>
MEDIATION: A NEW WAY TO AVOID COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you've ever been involved in a lawsuit, on one side or the other, there was 
probably a time when you said to yourself -- "There's got to be a better way." 
</P>
<P>
Whether your legal fight is about a late rent payment to your landlord, a 
dispute with the local cleaners who ruined your expensive tuxedo, or an auto 
dealer who doesn't agree with your interpretation of a car warranty, spending 
money on lawyers and wasting time in court hearings can be frustrating. To all 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
If the emotional and financial costs of the battle are wearing thin, it's 
probably time you considered mediation, or alternative dispute resolution, as 
an option. 
</P>
<P>
Mediation is not for all kinds of legal disputes. It works best when the 
financial stakes are not excessive and when the parties know each other or have 
some reason, such as a continuing economic relationship, to want to work out a 
solution. Landlords and tenants, consumers and merchants, neighbors, family 
members (trying to work out a divorce settlement) and small employers and their 
employees are groups that may find mediation a good alternative to court. 
</P>
<P>
Even some large corporations are experimenting with mediation as a way to 
reduce the extremely high legal expenses associated with complex or highly 
charged litigation. Mediators do not reach a decision on their own and then 
tell the combatants what they have decided. Mediation is a process in which the 
parties to the dispute participate in reaching a decision through consensus. It 
is not based on legal precedents, except to the extent a mediator may discuss 
how a court might resolve an issue, but it is based on common sense, good 
judgment and compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Mediation is usually less expensive than the judicial process and can be used 
before or even during the middle of a lawsuit, if all sides agree. 
</P>
<P>
Dispute Resolution Services Inc., a nonprofit corporation sponsored by the Los 
Angeles County Bar Assn., sponsors numerous mediation programs. Its community 
mediation programs, open to the public, operate in several Southern California 
offices to serve the following locations: Santa Monica/West Los Angeles, 
Pasadena/San Gabriel Valley, Compton, South Bay, and the West Hollywood/Beverly 
Hills/Fairfax area. For more information, call (213) 450-5252. 
</P>
<P>
The community mediation programs have been very successful, says Lauren Burton, 
the DRS executive director. Sixty percent of those who contact DRS about 
mediation use the services, and of those, 84% have their disputes resolved. 
More than 95% of those interviewed 30 days after the mediation said they were 
very satisfied with the agreement reached during the process and could perform 
their part of the bargain with little or no difficulty, according to Burton. 
</P>
<P>
DRS also sponsors mediation and settlement programs for people who are 
currently embroiled in a Superior Court lawsuit in the Los Angeles Central 
District, in any Municipal Court action in Santa Monica, or in an eviction case 
in the Los Angeles Municipal Court. For more information about these court 
programs, call (213) 974-8913. 
</P>
<P>
If you live in Los Angeles County and have a dispute with your attorney about 
fees or any other matter, you can have that dispute mediated by the 
Attorney/Client Relations and Fee Arbitration program administered by DRS. 
Telephone (213) 627-2727. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the Dispute Resolution Center is located at 146 N. Grand St., 
Orange. The telephone number is (714) 633-4956.

This is the seasonal prime time for developers to pitch time-shares -- those

such locations as Palm Desert, Lake Tahoe or Aspen, welcome to time-share time. 
</P>
<P>
If you go, expect pressure sales tactics from most agents, and by all means be 
prepared to ask a lot of questions about what they're offering. You'll probably 
be sorry if you don't. 
</P>
<P>
For openers, don't look at a time-share as an investment in real estate -- 
owning 1/52nd of something isn't much. Basically, you're buying a hideaway or 
vacation place. The best thing a time-share can provide is a way to save money 
on your vacation and insure against vacation inflation in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The average time-share in the United States is for a week and costs $7,500, 
according to several industry sources. So, if you plan to use it 20 years, 
that's only $375 a year, considerably less than most hotel rooms in resort 
areas cost for a week today. Projected against future hotel costs, you could 
save a big bundle of money. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, in addition to that $375, you'll have to add whatever you will be 
paying for your loan, also property taxes and maintenance fees each year. 
</P>
<P>
The latest trend in time-shares is something called "fractional ownership," 
offering the buyer a larger piece of the property pie, perhaps a quarter share, 
so that he or she owns it for 13 weeks a year. Quarter shares cost a lot more 
-- from about $20,000 to as much as $100,000 at a fancy resort in the Virgin 
Islands -- and may appeal mostly to retired persons and self-employed people 
who have the time to spend in them. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what kind of time-share you are thinking of buying, "it should be 
looked at as vacation ownership, not as a real estate investment," said 
Stephany Madsen, vice president of the Washington-based American Resort and 
Residential Development Assn. and executive director of its Vacation Ownership 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Madsen cautions, you "shouldn't expect to receive what you paid 
for it if you want to sell it." Industry analysts report that some time-share 
owners turn a profit when their properties are sold, but the majority do not. 
</P>
<P>
If you decide to go for your prize and take a look at the resort, it's "buyer 
beware," according to Mark Boyle, a Chicago attorney who works with the Resort 
Property Owners Assn., a consumer-oriented group that frowns on the 
"you've-won-a-prize" style of promoting resorts or condos. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, a prospective owner's best defense is to "know what you're buying 
and who you're buying it from," Boyle said. "It's tough to find out if it's a 
legitimate operation," he added. "You have to be a tough consumer and really 
make them tell you what you're buying." 
</P>
<P>
Boyle counseled that prospective buyers should not sign anything on their first 
visit, even though salesmen will most likely try to pressure them into it. Most 
states have laws giving the buyer three to 10 days to change his or her mind 
after signing a contract to purchase a time-share. In California, it's a 
three-day period. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle advised that if you're interested in the time-share you take the contract 
and a copy of the deed of property home with you and study it carefully or have 
a lawyer look it over before you agree to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll high-pressure you, pop champagne and everything, but if they say 
'today's the day' and won't let you have a copy of the contract and deed to 
study, walk away," Boyle said. "If it's not there tomorrow, you didn't miss 
anything." Be sure, too, to check with your accountant on the structure of the 
loan for the time-share to make sure you can write off the interest on your 
taxes. The tax laws concerning second homes and time-shares have changed 
dramatically since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Typical time-shares are usually based on a fixed period -- say, a week in March 
every year for 20 years. But there are the floating kind -- meaning you can 
choose a week during a certain time period each year or that you may have the 
use of a different unit every year. 
</P>
<P>
But, you also need to know what kind of time-share you're being offered: a 
deeded property with fee simple ownership, meaning you actually own 1/52nd of 
the property itself and should have a title insurance policy with it, or a 
"right-to-use" plan under which you don't own the property, only the 
opportunity to use it yearly for a specified time. These types of time-shares 
also can be called "club membership" or "vacation license" ones. Remember, you 
will pay yearly maintenance fees for both the deeded and right-to-use ones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Right-to-Use' Cheaper 
</P>
<P>
"Right-to-use" arrangements are usually cheaper than ownership, because you're 
not buying the property. And, with right-to-use contracts, the building will 
return to the developer or seller after a certain number of years. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever kind of time-share you may be considering, make sure you know who the 
developer is and if he or she has a good track record in time-share properties. 
Check out the company that will be managing the property and find out if its 
track record has been good or bad in terms of maintenance, repairs and 
replacement. You don't want your week to be the one the company picks for 
painting or cleaning the carpet or the drapes. 
</P>
<P>
You also don't want to buy a time-share under construction and then find that 
the developer doesn't have enough money to finish it. So, get a written 
commitment from the seller that the facilities will be provided as promised. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure you know what all your obligations and costs in buying and maintaining 
any unit will be. 
</P>
<P>
You also would be wise to see if the time-share resort belongs to a vacation 
exchange whereby you can trade your time-share with someone else. For example, 
one in Palm Springs for one in Aspen or the south of France. 
</P>
<P>
Many exchange companies are doing a brisk business because people don't want to 
go the same place for their vacation every year and enjoy the option of 
trading, according to Renee Spencer, director of corporate communications for 
Resort Condominiums International, the world's largest vacation exchange. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resort Exchanges 
</P>
<P>
"Most resorts do belong to exchanges now," Spencer said. However, for consumers 
who wish to trade time-shares, there is an additional fee -- vacation exchanges 
charge a yearly fee and a set price per week of exchange. 
</P>
<P>
RCI, for example, has a yearly subscription renewal fee of $59 per consumer and 
charges $79 per week of exchange per unit for domestic exchanges; $99 for 
international ones. 
</P>
<P>
It also has a "fair exchange policy," meaning it will only exchange like units. 
That's why, Spencer explained, consumers buying condos or time-shares "should 
be sure they know the seasonal designation and occupancy specification of the 
week they are purchasing." Thus, Spencer explained, "we wouldn't exchange a 
unit with occupancy for sleeping six people for one that sleeps only two. If 
you have one that sleeps only two, you can only exchange it for a two." 
Likewise, in most cases, you wouldn't be able to trade an off-season week in 
the desert in August for an in-season one in Tahoe in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
What about selling your time-share if you don't want it anymore? The prospects 
aren't all that good. According to the latest newsletter of the Resort Property 
Owners Assn. "between 200,000 and 300,000 time-share owners have listed their 
property for two years or longer without being able to resell." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the time-share you buy at a popular resort during the prime vacation 
season will trade or sell faster and better than one in an obscure location in 
the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
If you already have a time-share and want to sell it or are considering buying 
one, you might want to check out Time-share Auction '89, the annual Los Angeles 
time-share auction, sponsored by Tri West and run by Piatelli Co., on June 11 
at the Los Angeles Convention Center. For more information, call (213) 823-1200 
in California, or (800) 423-6377 from outside the state.

TRAPPED IN ANOTHER LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
KAY SMITH, IDEAL MOM, HAD RUN FAR AND HARD. IN THE END, SHE COULDN'T ESCAPE HER 
PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
JESSUP, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She stares out the window past twin 12-foot fences topped with razor wire, 
watchtowers manned by armed guards, steel electronic gates, past the stand of 
hardwoods, the nearby men's prison and up the road. 
</P>
<P>
It's dusting snow, cold, bleak. Just over the hill, a 10-minute drive if she 
could just drive out of here, and she would be home in her split-level house 
with a devoted but baffled brood: her husband, Ray, two teen-age sons. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Smith was the very model of a Severn, Md., housewife and working mother, so 
perfect that no one around here can believe she was once a hard-drinking, 
pill-popping criminal with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
But for a decade, until her capture last spring, she was a fugitive from a 
South Carolina mill town. She had been imprisoned for a string of armed 
robberies until she walked away from work release and disappeared. Her first 
husband was a convicted killer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dark Secrets Come to Light 
</P>
<P>
These were secrets Kay Smith buried deep as she recast her life. Over the 
years, she had become a doting mom to her two boys and foster daughters. She 
ferried her sons to school and sports, took courses at Anne Arundel Community 
College. As a real estate agent for Gary Hart Realty in Glen Burnie, she sold 
house after house -- $1 million in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
Who could have suspected that she really was an outlaw named Pamela Rodgers? 
</P>
<P>
Kay Smith wore subdued suits and slacks, a bare wisp of Max Factor. In her 
home, she warned her sons about drinking. She spurned even a glass of wine, and 
politely insisted that friends take half-empty bottles home after parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine for the life of me how this woman could do anything remotely 
resembling what happened," says Bill Cashman, who coached her sons in track at 
Old Mill High. "She'd ask me what I thought about her sons' grades, their 
sports performance, the people they hung around with. Her family was always 
first." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, she managed to keep it together as she lived in fear and hid her past, 
even from her husband. "I just wanted to get my boys through school," she says, 
"then I was going to straighten it all out." 
</P>
<P>
But detectives disrupted her plan last May. And when they came for her, she had 
run so long and hard, she barely knew the woman, handcuffed and under arrest. 
All at once, she again was Pamela Rodgers -- the woman she thought she had left 
behind. In three months, she was on her way back to prison in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Christmas, a routine interstate swap allowed her to serve out the 
rest of her 12-year sentence for armed robbery near home. She found herself in 
this stark red-brick campus, the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women. 
</P>
<P>
"At least I don't have to carry that terrible secret any more," she says, 
wrapping a sweater about her to ward off the chill. Suddenly she looks 
panicked. "Oh, God, I'm so sorry my sons were cheated." 
</P>
<P>
She wears a purple prison jumpsuit, works in the prison library, clips recipes 
and frets about her family. Figuring "someday they'll want honest answers," she 
writes letters she never mails. 
</P>
<P>
Based on her record of violent crime and escape, Kay Smith was classified by 
Maryland prison officials as a security risk. So she awaits the outcome of 
early release pleas -- by her reckoning she could be here until March, 1993, 
unless authorities grant an unlikely pardon, premature parole or work release. 
</P>
<P>
Family and friends have canvassed the community, collecting at least 3,000 
signatures petitioning South Carolina's Pardon and Parole Board for leniency. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying she ought to get a medal, but she's paid her debt to society," 
argues John Hassett, a former prosecutor, who took her case for expenses only. 
</P>
<P>
In South Carolina, former prosecutor Dick Harpootlian took up her cause too 
saying, "I take other cases for money. Kay's case is among those I take because 
I believe in the folks." 
</P>
<P>
But sniffs Jim Anders, the South Carolina prosecutor who put Kay Smith back in 
jail: "Don't make me cry. If we cut slack for her, we encourage people to 
escape." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Gilbert, Kay Smith's mother, says of her daughter in a telephone interview 
from Greenville, S.C.: "If people could just understand what brought her to 
this point. She was just a woman desperate to have her kids, who was terrorized 
by bad men." 
</P>
<P>
Kay Smith was born Pamela Annette Gilbert on Oct. 1, 1951, the second of six 
children raised by a trucker and a grocer's daughter in the Blue Ridge 
foothills of Greenville, S.C. She remembers her father's belt, his guns, his 
whiskey, his temper. 
</P>
<P>
Her father declines to discuss the past, but other family members confirm her 
memories; her mother recalls stepping in to take "many of those licks." 
</P>
<P>
"I watched him whip her . . . when she was just 15 months old," says her 
grandmother, Mary Hinton, 83. 
</P>
<P>
Kay says of her father: "He just didn't know how to show affection. I can't 
remember ever hearing him say 'I love you.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Kay was a 10th-grader, she dropped out and took a job at a convenience 
store, where she met stock boy Danny Rodgers, another dropout. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I didn't love Danny," Kay reflects. "I married him to get out. I 
thought I could make it work." 
</P>
<P>
She was 16. 
</P>
<P>
Bouncing between Rodgers' modest family farm in Cullman, Ala., and her hometown 
in Greenville, they moved into a dinky Greenville trailer. 
</P>
<P>
"First time I ever saw him slap her," Kay's mother says, "I hit him back. He 
said, 'You hit me,' and I said, 'You hit my daughter.' So he informed me, 'It's 
not your daughter any more; it's my wife.' " 
</P>
<P>
They moved to Florida, where Danny found construction work at Disney World, but 
preferred hanging out. Danny Jr. was born Dec. 17, 1969, as Pam was learning 
fast about her mercurial husband, who relished "playing with guns and knives, 
very nice one day and the next day beating the heck out of you." 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, out of work, he ran off with a neighbor's wife, she says. So 
Pam headed home again, hired on the midnight shift as a cotton mill weaver. 
Danny returned, but she refused to make up. 
</P>
<P>
Then, one night, when she was at work, he snatched the baby and ran, a tactic 
he repeatedly used to keep her in line. And it worked: She kept going back to 
him. "It was the only way to keep my baby," she says. Another son, James, was 
born in September, 1972, but life was only getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
Kay moved home to Greenville and in 1973 won temporary custody of the boys. 
Rodgers stalked her, she says, and one day showed up and fired a pistol into 
the roof of her trailer. Days later, he snatched the boys again. Only this time 
Pam couldn't find them. 
</P>
<P>
"She had dreams he'd drowned them because he swore he'd do it before he'd let 
her have them," her mother says. "She woke up at night screaming and fell into 
drugs and alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
She boxed up their toys, reminders of her "failure," and dumped them at 
Goodwill. She reported her husband to the police, but no one offered any hope. 
</P>
<P>
She found a kind of solace at the Little Darling, a Greenville bar that drew 
hustlers such as Arthur Broome Jr., a distant cousin. 
</P>
<P>
She was 22. 
</P>
<P>
Broome was 43, owned a tile company, but never seemed to work. He promised to 
help track her boys, and she moved into his trailer -- a place police say 
attracted the local criminal fringe. Broome, she says, had money, and drugs to 
kill her pain. 
</P>
<P>
Life was going badly for her. During the 1974 Masters golf tournament, she 
drove to Augusta, Ga., to hang out with a bar mate -- a former hooker, she 
says. A man approached them at a local restaurant. They began flirting. 
Suddenly, she says, she was under arrest for possessing amphetamines and 
soliciting an undercover cop for prostitution. Police records suggest that case 
was never prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back home, Broome was teaching her how to use a gun -- and 
everything a country girl needed to know about stickups. Together they held up 
stores in the Greenville area. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really care if I got caught," she says. "I thought if I got in enough 
trouble, Danny would tell me where the boys were. I wasn't thinking straight." 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 14, 1974, they hit Paces Jewelers just before closing. Pulling a 
pistol from a large black bag, she ordered customers to the floor and grabbed 
18 watches and $400 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Because witnesses had caught her license plate numbers, police easily tracked 
her to Broome's trailer, where both were arrested. But she got out on bail, 
and, high on uppers, hit a liquor store alone. Later, she drove the rolling 
countryside for hours, realizing she would never get her sons back now. She 
went home and gobbled pills to end it all, then raced to find her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'Mama, I took a handful of pills and I'm gonna die,' " her mother 
recalls. "I called an ambulance, they pumped her stomach and took her to the 
state hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers got the news at his California apartment, where he had taken the boys. 
He phoned, invited his wife to join him and try again. Ignoring bail rules 
against leaving the state, her mother put her on a plane. "I had to do it to 
save her," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
Danny began knocking her around, but for the first time, she fought back. When 
she called the police for help, Danny told them his wife was a bail jumper from 
South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives flew her home, where she pleaded guilty in state court to five armed 
robberies. In October, 1975, she drew a 12 1/2-year sentence. Broome got 25 
years; Kay wound up in Columbia's women's prison. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers filed for divorce and won permanent custody of the children, but in 
March, 1977, he shot a man in California for which he was convicted of 
second-degree murder and sentenced to five years in prison. The boys, 6 and 8, 
were dispatched to live with his family in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Pam, who was told Danny was in a hospital, was being a model inmate. After 18 
months, she made work release and labored in a printing plant. But she fell off 
the wagon on the job -- using pills and whiskey, she says. And she feared 
further setbacks would let Danny keep her children forever. There was only one 
way out: Take a walk. 
</P>
<P>
With six or so months left to serve, in January, 1978, she hitched as far as 
Glen Burnie, Md., rented a room, took a job as a waitress in a Greek diner. To 
avoid confusion with a waitress named Pam, she became Kay Smith. Days later, 
just after midnight, a short, balding trucker plopped down, spied the sad-eyed 
brunet in a white apron and fell in love. 
</P>
<P>
She was crying. A cook was screaming at her. The trucker asked her name. 
</P>
<P>
"Ray and Kay," Ray Smith joked. "Pretty neat. We ought to get along fine. We 
got the same names." 
</P>
<P>
He was gentle, optimistic. He told her he had two daughters by a woman he never 
had married, that he was lonely on the road and looking for a co-pilot. At 
quitting time, she threw down her apron and climbed aboard his snorting '74 
Peterbilt. 
</P>
<P>
High in the cab, hauling steel and furniture over the next three months, they 
became friends. Ray talked of a hardscrabble life, raised by grandparents in 
the West Virginia hollows. She was amazed: He had suffered, yet was so happy. 
Kay hedged about her past. 
</P>
<P>
After three months on the road, he proposed marriage at the Truck Stop of 
America in Knoxville. Her dilemma was right out of some country song: How could 
she let someone she loved marry an outlaw with a fake name? She had forged a 
birth certificate, gotten a Social Security card and a Maryland driver's 
license. "There was no right answer," she says. "So I just decided to block out 
the past." 
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1978, Ray's family and drinking buddies, about 500 in all, crowded 
into a Pasadena, Md., church, and went from there to a dance hall. "I was 
happier than anyone could be," he says. "I knew she loved me." 
</P>
<P>
Kay was determined to change her life. That Christmas, gambling on her former 
in-laws to keep her secret, she drove to Alabama with Ray to see her boys. 
</P>
<P>
Studying on the road, she passed a high school equivalency exam, enrolled in 
Anne Arundel Community College, began driving on her own. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the Smiths bought a three-bedroom house in Severn, outfitting bedrooms 
for the boys. Life without them still drove her into the bedroom with a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
When Ray drew the line over her drinking, she found a therapist in Baltimore, 
and her story tumbled out for the first time. She looked inside, read Norman 
Vincent Peale, tried biofeedback and stopped drinking. 
</P>
<P>
She made friends, becoming close to neighbor Cathy Moore, a divorced mother who 
once rescued her dog. When Moore's daughter left to live with her father in 
Wyoming, Kay "reassured me," she says. "I wondered, 'How come she's so smart 
about life?' " 
</P>
<P>
On one visit to Alabama, she learned her former husband was in prison. But she 
knew there was nothing she could do to get her boys back without giving herself 
away. 
</P>
<P>
And there was nothing she could do when Danny got out, remarried, reclaimed the 
boys and resettled in his new wife's hometown, Boise, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
But she stayed in touch, sent money, opened local charge accounts for the boys, 
saw them at Boise's Flying J truck stop on trips west. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she hired a Baltimore attorney to square her past. But he reported 
there was no record, raising her hopes. Only later did she discover her name 
had been misspelled in the search. 
</P>
<P>
She grew more concerned for her sons. They had told her that Danny had 
recruited them to steal from the Salvation Army to furnish his yard sales. 
Then, in January, 1985, James attempted suicide; young Dan got into a fight 
with his father. One night, James sneaked out for a ride with a teen-ager who 
wrapped his car around a telephone pole, killing the driver. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers threw in the towel. "Come get them," he told his former wife. "They're 
yours." 
</P>
<P>
She flew west the next day to claim them before he changed his mind. Back in 
Severn, the boys made friends quickly, reveled in their rooms, Reeboks and new 
jeans. When Ray wheeled in, they sat grinning at the kitchen table. For the 
first time, he saw Kay was happy. Curfews were set; grades improved. It was a 
"Leave It to Beaver" home, they liked to say. 
</P>
<P>
She seized on real estate as a way to sock away money for college. 
</P>
<P>
But she remained haunted by the past and present. In 1987, her former husband 
was charged again with murder for shooting a 21-year-old Boise man over a drug 
deal, chopping him into 13 pieces and dumping them into a reservoir. Now he was 
calling collect from jail; he wanted to see the boys, afraid he might get the 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
After Rodgers was convicted last March, an Idaho pre-sentencing investigator 
ran a routine computer check of his former wife, discovered she was a fugitive 
and alerted South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
But the investigator, puzzling over an unlisted Maryland phone number in the 
killer's wallet, dialed it. He reached James, who confirmed his mother's maiden 
name and her hometown without knowing what he had done. 
</P>
<P>
Now police had the tip they had been after. The phone rang and when she 
answered, it was Danny. "I guess we're in the same boat," he said. "They know 
about you." 
</P>
<P>
She was numb, near hysterics. 
</P>
<P>
Without alarming the boys, she hinted she "might have to go away for a little 
while" and phoned her attorney, who suggested she find a criminal lawyer. She 
found Hassett. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on May 10, 1988, a patrolman knocked on her door. After her arrest, with 
handcuffs on, she turned white, broke into tears. "It's been 10 1/2 years," she 
said. "Why now?" 
</P>
<P>
Ray was loading in New Jersey when he got the word. The boys were in school. 
The next day, out on $25,000 bail, she told the boys the rest of the story, 
then sat down with Ray, alone. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me everything," he says. "She was crying. She said, 'I hope this 
doesn't break us up. I love you so much.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now the house feels empty. Danny, a well-mannered 6-footer who has briefly 
curtailed college to work in a hospital billing department, cheers on James, 
who takes his anger out on a punching bag and works to stay afloat at Old Mill. 
Most Saturdays, they visit their mother for an hour in a communal room at the 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
With Ray on the road, working double time to pay the bills, friends like Pam 
McLane, an Old Mill senior, drop by to fix dinner, help clean up and remember 
Kay. 
</P>
<P>
As for Kay herself, "there wasn't any freedom for the last 10 years, not for 
anyone with a conscience," she reflects on this bleak Maryland winter day. "You 
overcome depression, drinking and negative forces, but you're not free. I was 
21 when it happened. I made a terrible, terrible mistake. I feel horrible about 
it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But, she adds, "I am not Pam Rodgers any more. I just don't want my children 
destroyed. That's my sense of urgency. Why destroy a family when it's on the 
verge of changing the cycle?"

JACK SMITH: WAXING POETIC OVER THE WAIL OF THE COYOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My insistence that coyotes have a right to eat, too, has brought a flood of 
support for that cunning creature. 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Kemper of Glendale lives on a hilly slope back of Forest Lawn, and 
over the years, she writes, the proliferation of houses on the heights has 
driven the coyotes down to hunt domestic animals and scavenge fallen fruits and 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I wish them luck. I should think in this era of a million laws and 
municipal codes and home owner associations and Big Brother in all of his 
unlovely guises that everyone would identify with the coyote, that symbol of 
harassed individualism. I know I do." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Peate of Westlake Village thinks my word howling is inadequate to describe 
the coyote's song: "Indeed, I don't think one word could describe the sound 
they make. There is a variety of noises -- a series of short barks; a 
chattering chich-chich-chich sound; a high-pitched wailing and screaming; and 
when they're in pursuit of their prey, a combination of screeching and 
cackling, followed by the most daunting sound of all -- abrupt silence." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Kelley of Canyon Country writes that coyotes have taken so many of their 
cats that they have finally given up on cats, "and are enjoying the now 
proliferating quail, mockingbirds, doves, jays, hummingbirds, sparrows and 
miscellaneous 'tweety-birds.' " 
</P>
<P>
She encloses a poem written by her 80-year-old friend, Emma Lent: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I hear you, out in the windy darkness 
</P>
<P>
Hurling your challenge against the wall of night 
</P>
<P>
Defying traps and poisoned bait and guns 
</P>
<P>
Taunting the house-bound dogs 
</P>
<P>
I hear you. I applaud your affirmation 
</P>
<P>
Freedom and hunger are better than chains 
</P>
<P>
And a mess of pottage 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Kelley also encloses a prize-winning short story she wrote for children, 
telling of their last surviving cat, Cleopatra, who outwitted the coyotes for 
eight years, until a flood washed out her runways and hiding places and she was 
finally caught. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Collier of La Habra grew up in the mountains "where their nightly 
serenade was a normal, if not somewhat mysterious and deliciously frightening, 
part of my childhood experience." 
</P>
<P>
To retain that experience she has written what she calls a "written photograph 
-- something I could always have should the time ever come when their cry faded 
altogether." 
</P>
<P>
The beseeching cry 
</P>
<P>
Of the coyote 
</P>
<P>
Reaches out across the city night 
</P>
<P>
Begging me to remember a once was 
</P>
<P>
When the only accompaniment to his song 
</P>
<P>
Was the soft breath of the wind in the leaves 
</P>
<P>
And the only light to his path 
</P>
<P>
Came from a compassionate moon floating 
</P>
<P>
Amidst far away worlds 
</P>
<P>
As gently I was coaxed towards sleep 
</P>
<P>
By lyrics which enfolded me in all the mystery of creation 
</P>
<P>
Delving deep inside me 
</P>
<P>
To touch the furthermost borders of my soul 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Such poetic sentiments tend to offset the meaner view of reader Bruce Lowry: 
"Of course coyotes do not have to eat. Coyotes have a perfectly logical 
alternative. They can become extinct. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hal G. Evarts of La Jolla quotes a passage from "The Yellow Horde," a novel 
written in 1921 by his father, Hal G. Evarts Sr: "He listened to the first 
night sounds of the foothills. A coyote raised his voice, a perfect tenor note 
that swept up to a wild soprano, then fell again in a whirl of howls which 
carried amazing shifts of inflection. . . . Wild music to the ears of most men, 
the song of limitless horizons freighted with a loneliness which is 
communicated to man in a positive ache for companionship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It moved Collins to quiet mirth . . . the first clamorous outburst of the 
night. He read in it a note of deep-seated humor, the jeering laughter of the 
whole coyote tribe mocking the world of men who had sworn to exterminate their 
kind. 'The little yellow devils!' Collins chuckled. 'Men can't wipe 'em out. 
There'll be a million coyotes left to howl when the last man dies.' " 
</P>
<P>
There are rogue coyotes. Dell Kendall of Glendale chastises me for doubting 
that coyotes carry off small children. She reminds me that a little girl was 
seized from her doorstep and killed by a coyote in Glendale only a few years 
ago, and that the story was widely publicized. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure that girl's family can hardly sympathize with my sentiments about 
coyotes. All I can say is that children are not as much in danger from coyotes 
as from drive-by shootings.

YOUR WHEELS: DIM LIGHT MAY BE WARNING TO REPLACE THE ALTERNATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have a 1979 Buick Regal with very low mileage -- 30,000 miles. A 
couple of months ago, the generator light would not go completely out. It 
stayed on with a very dim light at any speed. The battery still seems to have 
enough charge to start the car and keep the lights bright for night driving. 
How long would this condition have to continue before a problem develops? -- 
G.W.K. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The alternator and related parts of the charging system are probably 
putting out a positive charge, but it may not be adequate in the long run or 
during periods of heavy electrical usage. 
</P>
<P>
The charging system is rated at about 65 to 70 amps, but with the dim light 
showing on the indicator, it might be putting out only about 45 amps. In some 
cases, that might be adequate, but not under a heavy load. 
</P>
<P>
If you use the rear window defroster, the heater blower, the headlights and 
other accessories, you may drain the battery. If the drain is severe enough, 
the next time you try to start the car you won't have enough charge. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is most likely a failure in the alternator's rectifier or diodes, 
which are supposed to prevent current from flowing in the wrong direction. The 
dim light that you see is an indication of that problem, though it could also 
be other parts, including the voltage regulator. 
</P>
<P>
It is still possible to replace only those parts by taking apart the 
alternator, but the labor charge at most garages to fix the alternator would be 
higher than to simply replace it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I sometimes experience trouble shifting the manual transmission of my Nissan 
Sentra into reverse. I have to try a couple of times, and sometimes I really 
have to force it into gear. I don't hear any gears grinding, and it doesn't 
matter whether the engine is hot or cold. What is the problem? -- A.R. 
</P>
<P>
A: The reverse gears on almost all manual transmissions do not have 
synchronizers, which I have discussed in previous columns. They are devices 
that allow gears to be shifted even while they are in motion. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of reverse gears, the car must be fully stopped and the clutch 
pedal must be fully depressed to shift. In order for these gears to shift when 
they are stopped, the teeth come to sharp points. The teeth on most forward 
gears have flat points. 
</P>
<P>
The reverse gears need the points so that when two gears come together, the 
teeth can smoothly mesh together. If they were not pointed, the gears might get 
stuck on the flat portion and not mesh. 
</P>
<P>
The problem you describe can result from damage or abuse of the reverse gears 
that caused their pointed ends to be torn off. For example, if you shift into 
reverse while the car is in forward motion, you can shear off the points. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much you can do about the problem, except to tear open the 
transmission and replace the gears. You can possibly live with the problem by 
being careful. You shouldn't try to force the transmission into reverse, 
because that will probably damage it even more. If it absolutely will not go 
into gear, pull forward a few inches and then try to get into reverse. By 
moving the car, you may get the flat portions to align correctly. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a 1982 Honda Accord with a little over 32,000 miles. The problem is 
that every few days when I start the car in the morning, it will hit on only 
three cylinders. After driving a few miles, it clears up. What's causing this? 
-- J.P. 
</P>
<P>
A: One of the spark plugs is probably misfiring. Instead of the spark jumping 
from the tip of the plug to the side electrode, the spark jumps out to the base 
of the plug. Sometimes, this condition is caused by a crack in the ceramic 
insulation. 
</P>
<P>
Even without a crack, once a spark plug misfires, it will do it again. It is 
more common when a car is driven only on short trips and the engine doesn't get 
a chance to fully warm up. If you have put on only 32,000 miles in six years, 
your car probably never fully warms up. A simple tuneup and new plugs should 
clear up the problem.

CRUSHER LENDS CAN RECYCLERS A HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For recyclers, a new hand-operated compactor for aluminum cans called the 
Crusher is now available nationwide in retail home centers, drug and discount 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for Pacific Fabrication Inc. in Rancho Cucamonga, 
which makes the device, the wall-mounted Crusher "will easily and safely crush 
12-and 16-ounce cans for efficient recycling, transporting and storage." It is 
constructed of heavy-gauge steel and has a white baked-enamel finish. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail price for the Crusher is $19.95. Currently, you can find it at 
Ace Hardware, True Value Hardware stores and some Longs Drug Stores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
European Massager 
</P>
<P>
There's a new non-electric massager from Europe that may interest athletes and 
exercise buffs. Available for several years in West Germany, it's now being 
sold nationwide through a distributor in Lomita. Endorsed by professional 
golfer Bernhard Langer and Jimmy Kim, gold medalist in martial arts at the 
Seoul Olympics, the Dermapoints massager is a roller -- consisting of 20 wheels 
with 560 silver-plated points -- mounted on a rod with a plastic handle. The 
idea is to roll it over the area where you're experiencing muscle pain to 
increase the blood circulation and stimulate the skin. For best results, 
company literature recommends using Dermapoints "regularly, eight to 15 
minutes, up to twice a day," while also suggesting that consumers consult with 
a doctor for proper diagnosis of any injury. 
</P>
<P>
According to a manufacturer's representative, the product is FDA-approved for 
sale in the United States and may be advertised as a device that "temporarily 
relieves pain due to fatigue or overexertion, relieves tired muscles and 
increases blood circulation in the area where it is applied." 
</P>
<P>
Dermapoints comes in two sizes: Model 100 with the single roller at $110.45, 
and Model 200 with double rows of rollers at $148.72, including sales tax and 
shipping costs; C.O.D. is an additional $2. To order with MasterCard or Visa 
call (800)-325-8477 in California or (800) 343-9803 if you live out of state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Game Serves as Alarm 
</P>
<P>
There's something new for kids that children and parents may both like. It's a 
sound device -- a weapons-noise simulator for games played on bicycles -- that 
also serves as a bike alarm. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-ounce unit can be easily attached to bicycle handlebars and produces 
four noisy sounds for make-believe bike battles -- a rocket launcher, machine 
gun, laser blaster and a death ray. When you push the buttons, FIRE WHEN READY 
emits tones like the sound effects from "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
But it also can be programed as a motion-detector alarm -- activated by 
pressing the alarm button after locking the bike with a chain lock. It does 
scream if someone is tampering with the bike, and only the bike's owner -- who 
programmed it with a code by pushing a combination of numbers -- can deactivate 
the alarm. 
</P>
<P>
At suggested retail of $14.99 to $19.99, it is available nationwide at K mart 
stores and some Longs Drug Stores. In the Los Angeles area you also can 
purchase it at Mr. G's Expressions stores, Lehr &amp; Black gift shop in 
Beverly Hills, Cycle World in Northridge and Buddy Brown Toys in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs for the Times 
</P>
<P>
If you need a special sign for a birthday party or garage sale or want to make 
a big personalized greeting card, you might try a new sign-making kit that will 
create a sign in a few minutes by using a standard copy machine. 
</P>
<P>
Bosses might not appreciate your using the office machine, but you can take the 
kit -- composed of 8x5-inch letters, numbers, punctuation marks, a dollar sign 
and a heart -- to your nearest copier shop and do it yourself, even in color 
letters. Two letters fit on one copy page. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs pennies per letter," said the kit's designer, Bill Baltz, a sign 
painter for 20 years. "I got a lot of requests for paper signs, but my 
customers were usually shocked when they found out how much sign painters 
charge, and usually they wanted the sign immediately . . . I kept trying to 
figure out a way they could make their own signs quickly and cheaply." 
</P>
<P>
The sign kit comes with a plastic carrying pouch, easy instructions and hints 
for better sign making. After copying the letters on individual sheets of 
paper, you simply tape the copies together on the back. To order, for $5.95, 
plus $1.05 for same-day, first-class shipping, write: Bannerman, 23 S. Fairview 
Ave., P.O. Box 1261, Goleta, Calif. 93117. LYNN SIMROSS

SHACOCHIS HITS, MISSES IN 'NEW WORLD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, Times Book Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Next New World by Bob Shacochis (Crown: $16.95; 209 pages) 
</P>
<P>
There is a difference between what a writer chooses to write and what he or she 
cannot help but write. Even with a gifted writer, the difference shows. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Shacochis, who won a National Book Award three years ago for "Easy in the 
Islands," has come out with a new collection of short stories. A divide seems 
to run down it, marking off two very unequal parts. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the stories, possessing various degrees of imagination and gracefulness, 
seem, nonetheless, to be almost exercises in a variety of genres, voices and 
locales. The seventh, "Celebrations of the New World," all but burns on the 
page, clamoring to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the six deal with old people so near death that they inhabit a kind of 
ghost-ridden border territory. In "Les Femmes Creoles," two ancient sisters on 
a derelict Caribbean plantation lie in bed and receive, imagining them to be 
lovers, a vagrant soldier from a colonial occupying force, and a black 
guerrilla. 
</P>
<P>
In "Where Pelham Fell," a retired army officer in his 80s drives perilously 
about the Virginia countryside, accompanied by ghostly detachments of the 
Confederate Army. A farmer gives him two sacks of bones; the old colonel tries 
to put them together in his shed, while his wife dozes inside the house. Dying, 
the colonel hears the bones rattle, summoning him to lead them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Contrived Air to Them 
</P>
<P>
The quality of this pair is as delicate and haunting as their subject, yet they 
have a contrived air to them. The haunting is an effect achieved, not grown. 
</P>
<P>
Two other stories depict men late in middle-age, with illusions at sunset, and 
delusions not yet at moonrise. The caretaker in "Stolen Kiss" has fantasies 
about the woman who spends summers in one of the beach houses he looks after. 
He finds a lip-mark imprinted on a post of her porch; he kisses it and paints 
it over. 
</P>
<P>
In "Picture of the Week," a former beatnik whose companion has just died of 
cancer sells the Caribbean property they had settled in, and prepares to return 
north, "to enter, like the millions before him in these times, the draft of 
cooling current." Both stories provide recipes for a kind of bitter-sweet jolt, 
but not the jolt itself. 
</P>
<P>
Another pair of stories -- one about a Galveston harmonica player who loses his 
girlfriend in grisly fashion, the second about a Cape Hatteras waterman who is 
identified as a Nazi war criminal after catching a record-size fish -- are 
melodramatic and flat. A pastiche about Shakespeare playing Hamlet's father's 
ghost is flatter still. 
</P>
<P>
"Celebrations" stands in shining and welcome contrast. Its setting is the 
meeting of two disastrously different families, a year or two after the son of 
one family and the daughter of the other have married. 
</P>
<P>
The husband's family -- he is the narrator -- are well-to-do Midwesterners who 
arrive for the reunion in a small flotilla of station wagons, campers and 
Cadillacs. "They are clean and slow, responsible and readily impressed," the 
narrator says of his family. 
</P>
<P>
The wife's family, which lives in Philadelphia where the reunion takes place, 
is Lebanese-American. The dinner is cross-cultural comedy; the visitors nibble 
fearfully at the platters of tabbouleh and skewered meat. Gloria, the 
Midwestern mother, tries to civilize things by placing tiny marshmallows stuck 
with American Flags on each plate. 
</P>
<P>
But the ethnic chaos is only background. Bernie, the host, is a retired 
professor who is developing Alzheimer's disease; he flickers tragically between 
awareness and absence. Rosie, his decisive and energetic wife, is nearing a 
decision to commit him to a nursing home. The dinner puts Bernie and his 
condition on display for their daughter, Lorraine, and her husband, the latter 
reflects, so that they will be able to reassure Rosie: "Yes, you're doing the 
right thing." 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is treated acutely but with tenderness. The entire story, in 
fact, is both unsparing and compassionate. Comedy and awfulness jostle each 
other, particularly when Bernie's brother, Joachim, flies in from Mexico and 
turns out to be as unstable as the host. 
</P>
<P>
The two old men flare up, wander, return, and generally exacerbate the 
dinner-table disaster. In between storms, they hold hands and tell stories 
about their childhood. And at the end, the addled pair retreats into a closet 
to smoke cigars. The narrator joins them, and after awhile, so does Lorraine 
and the baby she's nursing. 
</P>
<P>
It's absurd, and entirely right. Life designs closets to help us bear what we 
can't bear. I suspect that Shacochis' closet will open onto a future novel.

<P>
Brandy Snyder, a 21-year-old acting student, is looking for a job to pay off 
debts exacerbated last weekend after a fire marshal closed her play. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, a senior at United States International University, had directed a 
weeklong production of the three-person comedy "The Lady and the Clarinet" in 
rented space at the Progressive Stage Company in the Old City Hall building 
</P>
<P>
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night was the last scheduled performance in the run that Snyder had 
bankrolled with $800 of her own money and a $600 loan. She had expected her 
efforts to pay off that night when a Los Angeles director was in the audience, 
as well as a professor from San Francisco whom Snyder wanted to see the work. 
Critics from two local newspapers also attended. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:30 p.m., half an hour into the 1 1/2-hour performance, fire inspector Don 
Waldman walked in and ordered Snyder to close the show or be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said she was upset that the Fire Department had not closed the theater 
at 433 G St. either before or after the show; still, she didn't fault them, 
because Waldman told her he had warned the Progressive about fire violations 
"hundreds of times." 
</P>
<P>
"This was my first venture out, and it was very upsetting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department spokesman Bob Zepeda said Tuesday that two exits are required 
for the second-floor performance space whenever more than 10 people are in the 
theater, which seats between 45 and 70. Officials said no one has been fined or 
cited. 
</P>
<P>
Progressive plans to shift its presentations to the ground floor this weekend, 
where the Fire Department has said 49 people can safely be seated. The 
department Wednesday approved the use of the upstairs space for rehearsal and 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
Zepeda said the department had been concerned about the situation for months, 
but that Saturday was the first night an inspector had been on duty during a 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
However, Progressive's producing director, Carlos X. Pena, said that, although 
fire officials had told him Saturday they wanted the safety of the theater 
improved, they had no intention of shutting it down. 
</P>
<P>
Pena said the Progressive can't build another exit because the Old City Hall 
building is labeled a historic site. 
</P>
<P>
Since its opening, the Progressive has been a haven for small theater groups in 
search of affordable space. 
</P>
<P>
Pena said the Progressive will be back on schedule Tuesday, when it presents 
the second play in the Teatro Meta's Latino Play Festival in the downstairs 
space.

An international art dealer suspected in the theft of millions of dollars worth 
of oil paintings was found dead in his London, Ontario, apartment in an 
apparent murder-suicide, Canadian police said Tuesday. Superintendent Don 
Andrews told the Associated Press that the bodies of Peter Nixon, 58, and his 
wife Evelyn, 55, were found Monday in the bedroom of their apartment and were 
believed to have been dead about a week. A handgun was also found. Andrews said 
Peter Nixon was at the center of an international investigation into the theft 
of 20 oil paintings stolen from two British homes -- one in England and one in 
Scotland -- in 1981 and 1982. He said both the Canadian and British police, as 
well as the FBI, had been involved in the investigation. Twelve of the 20 
paintings, some of which date back several centuries and are valued at more 
than $10 million, have been recovered in Europe, the United States and 
Canada.Shauna Snow

CBS Entertainment has announced it will replace the Wednesday night series "The 
Equalizer" with "Jake &amp; the Fatman" at 9 p.m. in mid-March. But the network 
says that "The Equalizer," starring Edward Woodward as a former CIA-type turned 
nag, will return after a "hiatus." There will be nine more episodes available 
in its current 22-show run after it departs with the March 8 broadcast. Shauna

A former Mississippi sheriff has filed an $8 million libel suit against the 
makers of the film "Mississippi Burning," claiming he was portrayed unfavorably 
in the film. "They have sure done some terrible harm," the former Neshoba 
County sheriff, Lawrence Rainey, 65, told the Associated Press on Wednesday. 
"Everybody all over the South knows the one they have playing the sheriff in 
that movie is referring to me." The lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District 
Court at Meridian charges defamation of character, libel and invasion of 
privacy, attorney James G. McIntyre said. Rainey, who now works for a 
black-owned security guard service, was sheriff at the time of the 1964 
slayings of three civil rights workers near Philadelphia, Miss. The deaths 
prompted an FBI investigation that led to conspiracy charges being filed 
against 18 men, including Rainey, who was later acquitted. The movie, an Orion 
Pictures release starring Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, is a fictional account 
of the slayings of Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman. It has 
been criticized by some civil rights activists who say it maligns blacks and 
portrays the FBI agents as heroes. Rainey said the film falsely portrayed his 
activities and attitude during the period and had wronged the people of Neshoba 
County. Rainey said that both he and his employer had been "catching some 
playback" from those who had seen the film. Orion's in-house attorney in New 
York, John Hester, said Wednesday that he was not aware of any papers being 
served to the company. Shauna Snow

"You have to make movies that span the generational gap and that can appeal, 
across the board, to people in college and to people like my father," says 
Thomas E. Rothman, the new 34-year-old senior vice president of worldwide 
production for Samuel Goldwyn Co. "The demographics now say that the baby 
boomers are aging -- over 30% of the audience is over 40 now. You've got to 
make films that cross the demographics." Rothman is joining Goldwyn from 
Columbia Pictures, where he has been a vice president for two years. He takes 
his new post April 3. Shauna Snow

A CRASH COURSE IN EARLY PHOTOGRAPHY AT THE GETTY 
</P>

There's nothing quite like watching the birth of a new technology and figuring 
out what wonderful things you'll be able to do with it. When photography was 
invented in 1839 -- by a Frenchman and an Englishman working independently, as 
so often happened in the history of science -- it offered the chance to see the 
world with new eyes, in great and small detail. 
</P>
<P>
"Experimental Photography: Discovery and Invention," at the J. Paul Getty 
Museum (to April 2) gives viewers a taste of the strangeness of this new 
medium, and the hits and misses that occurred when people tried it out. The 
first in a yearlong series commemorating the 150th anniversary of photography, 
the exhibit also offers a crash course in the differences among the early 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The daguerreotype process, invented by Joseph-Nicephore Niepce (and named after 
his death by his partner, architectural draftsman Louis-Jacques-Mande 
Daguerre), created a single, highly detailed image on a silver-plated sheet of 
copper. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, William Henry Fox Talbot had figured out how to make what he called 
"photogenic drawings" by placing objects on paper treated with light-sensitive 
silver salts and exposing it to sunlight. As quietly awesome as a holy relic 
brought back by a pilgrim, the tiny, dark, irregularly shaped image of a corner 
of flowered linen cloth that Talbot made (probably in 1835) is one of the very 
first images of the world made on paper without the use of ink or paint. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't pursue this discovery -- or announce it to the world -- until 
1839, when the daguerreotype was officially unveiled in Paris before a huge 
crowd of scientists, artists and the curious public. 
</P>
<P>
Jolted into action by the competition, he got back to work and invented the 
calotype, which made it possible to produce paper negatives more swiftly, 
thanks to a battery of chemicals. Meanwhile, astronomer Sir John Herschel was 
devising the cyanotype process, which used iron salts to create blue 
photographs from paper negatives made without a camera. Unlike the 
daguerreotype -- passe by midcentury -- these processes allowed for multiple 
copies of the same image. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few years, a number of men and women with scientific or 
artistic backgrounds, lots of patience and access to the special formulas and 
ingredients looked around for outdoor (i.e., sufficiently well-lit) subjects to 
photograph. Lace, botanical specimens, neighborhood views and interesting local 
characters were early favorites in this era of naive and enthusiastic 
experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
A scrap of handmade lace in a photogenic drawing negative by Talbot looks 
almost like a living organism seen under a microscope: a network of minute 
holes with almost imperceptible differences in shape -- a miraculous design 
rendered strikingly complex in the places where two layers of lace accidentally 
double up. 
</P>
<P>
Anna Atkins -- a serious amateur botanist whose father, a curator of natural 
history at the British Museum, was a friend of Herschel -- assembled an 
ambitious cyanotype catalogue of underwater plants, each rendered as a flat 
white design on a blue background. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot's early triumphs also included a delicately detailed image of an oak 
tree and a view from the window of a hotel in which the photographer 
serendipitously caught a sliver of light on the shutter of a building across 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
Scotsmen Robert Adamson, who ran a calotype studio, and David Octavius Hill, a 
landscape painter, teamed together to produce calotype portraits and tableaux, 
some curiously undisciplined (a group of lounging Newhaven fisherman, some 
indifferently turning their backs to the photographers), some painstakingly 
posed in the fashion of Victorian paintings (three women unconvincingly making 
a show of great interest in a letter). 
</P>
<P>
Hippolyte Bayard, a French civil servant, chose his stocky self as a major 
subject, photographed amid carefully arranged groupings of everyday objects 
which, says exhibit curator Weston Naef, contain symbolic meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Stymied at not being able to shoot indoors, Bayard tried setting up a table and 
chairs outdoors so two women could pretend to be busy with their needlework as 
if ensconced as usual in their parlor. 
</P>
<P>
Bayard was also on hand to register the way the Rue Royale and Place de la 
Concorde looked after the 1848 uprising in Paris that overthrew the 
constitutional monarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The next wave of photographic maturity would bring Roger Fenton's battlefield 
scenes of the Crimean War, Carlton Watkins' views of Yosemite and Julia 
Margaret Cameron's dreamy literary tableaux -- all to be unveiled at the Getty 
April 11 in "Experimental Photography: The First Golden Age."

MEAT LOAF; 
</P>
<P>
MEAT LOAVES HAVE GONE MODERN WITH REDUCED FAT AND CALORIES WHILE RETAINING 
OLD-FASHIONED FLAVOR. 
</P>

Whoever would have thought that meat loaf, that ubiquitous budget-watcher's 
catch-all for leftovers, would make a list of trendy foods at any time? Yet, 
that's the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
When 72 Market Street, one of L.A.'s better-known restaurants, first put their 
meat loaf (definitely not a home for leftovers) on the menu several years ago, 
they really started something. Oddly enough, although one might expect such a 
simple, homey food to go out of style after a brief fling as a star in the 
fad-filled world of Los Angeles' restaurants, meat loaf has retained a solid 
hold on its place in both restaurant and home menus. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly why is certainly a good question. Maybe having trendy restaurants give 
approbation to such a plebeian dish has given a lot of closet meat-loaf lovers 
the assurance they needed to admit that they like it. Or perhaps it's because 
meat loaf is a familiar food in this country of meat-and-potato eaters. Or it 
could be simply that it's easy to make a good meat loaf. 
</P>
<P>
Meat loaves today only partially resemble the old-fashioned loaf that grandma 
used to make. She used inexpensive, high-fat ground beef, onions, whole eggs 
and bread crumbs as the base for her meat loaf, adding bits and pieces of 
leftover vegetables for flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Modern cooks, intent on lowering the fats and cholesterol (to say nothing of 
calories) in their diets, as a rule make these meat mixtures of ground turkey 
or very lean ground beef or pork. Egg whites frequently are substituted for 
whole eggs and, often, oats are substituted for the bread crumbs to increase 
fiber content. All of these simple but effective culinary tricks -- designed to 
reduce the fat content of meat loaf yet leave the flavor intact -- can be 
adapted to almost any meat loaf recipe. 
</P>
<P>
One of the nicest things about making a meat loaf is that it's difficult to 
ruin one, provided you use good ingredients to begin with. As with any food 
that is based on a combination of ingredients blended together, it is advisable 
to do the mixing with a light hand. And to my mind, meat loaf is truly a "hands 
on" mixture. Using a fork or spoon to combine the amount of ground meat needed 
with all of the other ingredients with is a frustrating experience. I, for one, 
much prefer to plunge into the mixing bowl with my impeccably clean hands and 
lightly, but thoroughly, blend the raw ingredients together with my fingers 
before gently patting them into loaf form. It may not be a neat procedure, but 
it is remarkably soul-satisfying -- and it works. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the meat loaf recipes that appear here are designed for entertaining. 
The pinwheel meat loaf mixture filled with mixed vegetables, for instance, 
makes a wonderful buffet offering for a crowd. And the Italian Meat Loaves, 
which resemble country terrines, can be served as appetizers for a small dinner 
party. Or they can simply be a hot main dish for a cozy twosome. 
</P>
<P>
Serious cholesterol watchers will find the turkey meat loaf a tasty, worthwhile 
dish, while those addicted to Mexican flavorings will like the Mexican meat 
loaf. 
</P>
<P>
Most of today's recipes will serve six to eight hungry souls. That's because 
meat loaf is not something that works really well when prepared in a small 
quantity. If you have a small family or are single, to obtain optimum flavor 
it's better to blend a relatively large amount of meat and other ingredients 
together, and then divide the mixture into meal-size portions before cooking. 
Cook and freeze the extra portions for future meals and relax in the knowledge 
that you have several good meals stashed in the freezer for those nights when 
there's no time to cook or you simply aren't in the mood.

ABOUT WINE: VINTNERS SEE LESS FEDERAL REGULATION AS ANSWER TO 'WHAT'S IN A 
NAME?'

Opus One, Dominus, Trilogy and their brethren now have an umbrella name to 
connect them: Meritage, a word that years from now its backers hope will be 
widely accepted as defining a super-premium wine made from a blend of the 
traditional Bordeaux grape varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Meritage is the name selected by a group of 31 wineries that staged a 
nationwide contest late last year to come up with a designation for the new 
premium blends of wines springing up all over California. The name was 
announced here this week. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of naming a premium wine with a proprietary name is a relatively new 
phenomenon, but it's clearly a major trend in premium wine. It marks the third 
wave of wine designations in the United States and is an attempt to get out 
from under government restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The Meritage Assn., the group backing the concept, is hoping consumers across 
the country, and worldwide, will see the value in having a term to define the 
concept of super-premium blended wine. 
</P>
<P>
The drive to come up with a designation was spearheaded by Augustin Huneeus, 
president of Franciscan Vineyards in the Napa Valley, a winery that had 
produced a super-premium blended red wine similar to that made in Bordeaux, but 
it had no unique name to call it. 
</P>
<P>
Huneeus discussed the problem with a number of winery executives and then 
realized that a "universal proprietary" designation, one that all wineries 
could use, was the perfect answer. So he joined with other wineries (among 
those at the first meeting were Merlion and Meridian) and a number of 
appropriate-sounding terms were suggested. None sounded right. 
</P>
<P>
Then Dick Graff of Chalone Inc., whose Sonoma County winery, Carmenet, makes 
such a blended red wine, joined the group. He suggested a nationwide contest to 
name the emerging category of wines, with a prize of about 50 cases of the 
blended wines. 
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1970s when Joseph Phelps Vineyards produced California's first 
super-premium blended wine from the Bordeaux grape varieties and used a 
proprietary designation on it, California wine producers have eagerly sought a 
way to make a better wine without the varietal labeling limitations placed on 
them by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
One of those restrictions says that any wine labeled as a varietal wine (named 
after the grape from which it is made) must have in it at least 75% of the 
grape named on the label. Thus, a Cabernet Sauvignon you buy today must be 
composed of at least 75% Cabernet grapes. 
</P>
<P>
And since varietal wines were the best wines California made, there were 
virtually no super-premium wines that were generic. 
</P>
<P>
Before the rule was boosted from a 51% minimum varietal content in 1983, 
wineries had the flexibility to add in a greater percentage of Merlot, Cabernet 
Franc or Petite Verdot -- other Bordeaux varieties and close cousins of 
Cabernet Sauvignon -- to make a better wine. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in 1972, rains hit the vineyards of the Napa Valley before 
harvest and the Cabernet suffered. The earlier-harvested Merlot, however, 
survived better, and many wineries made a better wine than they might have made 
by blending in Merlot. That year, Sterling's Ric Forman chose to make his 
Cabernet fully 40% Merlot and the wine was one of the stars of the vintage. 
</P>
<P>
By 1973, however, public pressure was building to boost the minimum content in 
varietal wine to 75%, and the first official proposal to that effect was made 
in 1975. The gears of bureaucracy were inexorably grinding to make 75% the 
minimum in varietal wines. 
</P>
<P>
Wineries complained that any such move would remove colors from their palette 
that permitted blending artistry in the making of great wine. But the foes of 
51% minimum content in varietal wines argued then that under those laws, a 
Cabernet could be 49% swill. 
</P>
<P>
The 75% rule then in the works would clearly have little effect on wines like 
Chardonnay, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, which usually were not blended. But 
the new rule handcuffed makers of wines from the Cabernet varieties, which 
often were better when blended. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of a rule change, Phelps blended a wine in 1974 that was 
intended to be an annual blending statement. That wine was called Insignia. It 
was a courageous decision, but it left Phelps with a marketing problem since 
outside a few sophisticates, few people knew what the wine was all about. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, other premium Cabernet blends were added to the list; and in 
1977, Robert Mondavi and the late Baron Philippe de Rothschild certified the 
trend when they announced a joint project to produce a top-quality 
Bordeaux-styled wine blended from the traditional varieties. 
</P>
<P>
The first vintage of that wine, then named Opus One, became the prototype 
premium blended wine to which all the others are compared. And there followed a 
half dozen other similarly named and similarly blended wines including the most 
recent, Christian Moueix's Dominus. 
</P>
<P>
A problem existed, however. Marketing such wines to new consumers wasn't easy. 
In each case, the new consumer would say "What's in it?" and indirectly, the 
question carried the often unspoken question of "Why is it so expensive?" 
</P>
<P>
So a category was needed in which to place this growing number of wines, which 
incidentally also includes white wines made like the great white Graves of 
Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
A century ago, the California wine industry was in its infancy, struggling to 
make decent wine. It had few real thoughts of competing with the great wines of 
France, but producers here couldn't sell their wines unless the public had some 
vague idea about the style of wine they were making. 
</P>
<P>
So California wine makers unabashedly adopted the names of European wine 
regions for the names they placed on their labels. Most wines were labeled 
things like Chianti, Sauterne, Rhone, Burgundy, Chablis and Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
But the names generally meant nothing. In Burgundy, a red wine is made entirely 
from the Pinot Noir grape. In California back then, a Burgundy was simply red 
made from whatever happened to be handy. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there were no controls over how such generic wine was blended; one 
winery's Chianti could be light and fresh, another's could be dark and 
brooding. 
</P>
<P>
A few wineries (Beaulieu and Inglenook among them) made wines from the premium 
grape varieties and boldly called them by their varietal names even before 
Prohibition. It was a statement of quality, and the wines did command higher 
prices than their neighbors. However, varietal naming of wines didn't catch on 
until after Prohibition ended in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the mid-1930s, when Wente Bros. adopted varietal names, that 
they began to catch on. Frank Schoonmaker, president of Wente's marketing 
company, was pleased with the idea, and he encouraged the winery to do it 
across its line. And Schoonmaker promoted the idea that varietal wines were 
better than generics. 
</P>
<P>
That set the tone for the second wave of wine marketing -- in which the 
specific varietal character of the wines could be expected by the names on the 
label. No longer did buyers of California wine have to guess whether a Burgundy 
was a dark wine or a light one. They could buy wines called Pinot Noir and have 
some assurance that the wines at least had the same heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Varietal naming remained the mark of the highest quality wines for the four 
decades that followed, but as blending various varieties became a way to make 
an even better wine than a varietal wine, a new way to designate the wine was 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
But it also became clear that the public wasn't willing to pay a lot of money 
for a wine designated "red table wine" or "claret." So proprietary names began 
to be used to signify the higher quality of the wine. 
</P>
<P>
When the number of such wines was still small, it wasn't difficult to find 
names for them, and thus we see such disparate terms as Mosaic (from the De 
Lorimier winery), Montage (The Christian Brothers) and Le Meilleur du Chai 
(Rombauer) adorning prestige blended wines. 
</P>
<P>
But the fear was, said Huneeus, that before long the number of proprietary 
names needed will exceed the ability of the language to support them. Moreover, 
all those names will be different and there will still be no name for the 
category of wines into which they fit. 
</P>
<P>
"Today there are about 30 wineries that are considering making a premium 
proprietary blend that have not yet coined a proprietary name," said Huneeus. 
He said that if all 30 wineries used different terms, not only would confusion 
reign, but there still would be no overall term to describe the category. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope Meritage will reduce the myriad of proprietary names that are 
springing up," he said. "It recognizes the fact that California wine makers now 
know that the best possible wines they can make are the blends of these 
(Bordeaux) varieties, and I hope it will get us off the fixation of varietals." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of such typically unblended wines as Chardonnay, "the varietal 
designation is fine; but unquestionably, the varietal designation is not enough 
in the case of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. There the case is 
quite different. The marriage is usually quite beautiful, better than any of 
the varieties on their own." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, such as with Franciscan's, a wine now will be named Meritage. In 
other cases, such as with Opus One and Dominus, the name of the wine will 
remain unchanged, but retail shop owners and restaurateurs may now refer to 
them as being part of the class of wines called Meritage wines. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a much more focused definition than 'red table wine,' " said Huneeus. 
</P>
<P>
Meritage also will be used to define a blended white wine that is based on the 
French model of Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc, two varieties that many wine 
makers feel are much better when blended than when left by themselves. 
Concannon Vineyards has a 50-50 blend of the two white Bordeaux varieties that 
is exceptional and needed a special category in which to fit. 
</P>
<P>
"We are also hoping that Meritage will help to reestablish the beautiful 
possibilities of blending Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon," said Huneeus. He said 
such wines may be marvelous in terms of quality but that reside in what he 
called "a no-man's-land" in terms of image. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, Sauvignon Blanc sales have dipped in the United States, and 
Huneeus said he saw Meritage white wines as "maybe Sauvignon Blanc's last 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
The Meritage Assn. will control which wineries use the name on its labels. 
Huneeus said the association "will not certify or police quality. All we will 
do is set the standard" for what a Meritage wine is. 
</P>
<P>
That brief definition is that Meritage wines must be blends of the traditional 
Bordeaux grape varieties -- Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petite 
Verdot, Malbec in the case of the red wine and Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon and 
Muscadelle du Bordelais in the case of the white. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a winery applying to use the term on the label must declare that the wine 
is a top-of-the-line wine and that it will not be denominated as a varietal as 
well as Meritage. 
</P>
<P>
Among the wineries in the association are Lyeth; Phelps; Glen Ellen; Konocti; 
Iron Horse; Flora Springs; Dominus; Meridian; Vichon; Beringer; Concannon; the 
Hess Collection; Keenan; Pine Ridge, and Rombauer. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of the contest -- and the only prize -- was Neil Edgar of Newark, Calif. 
He is the assistant manager of the Alpha Beta supermarket in Foster City and he 
buys wine for the store. His prize is a 10-year vertical collection of two 
bottles each of all the Meritage wines of the member wineries, approximately 50 
cases of top quality wines.

YOU ASKED ABOUT . . .: CORRECT METHODS FOR MEASURING BROWN SUGAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: When a recipe calls for brown sugar, is it always packed into the 
measuring cup or spoon? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes, brown sugar should be packed into measuring cups and spoons with 
your fingers until even with the rim. The packing should be firm enough so when 
the measuring tool is inverted, the brown sugar is released and holds its 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
Q: After using liquid pectin successfully for many years, I decided to try the 
powdered kind after a relative told me she preferred it. The results for me 
were more like a disaster. I have several jars of orange marmalade that would 
have to be eaten with a spoon. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any way I can salvage this, such as cooking it slowly for a long time 
or adding more pectin? I hate to throw away this good fruit and sugar and would 
appreciate any help you can give me. 
</P>
<P>
A: According to the University of California Agricultural Extension Service 
pamphlet "Making Jellies, Jams and Preserves," too-soft jellies sometimes can 
be improved by recooking. You might have success with orange marmalade using 
their method, recooking only four to six cups at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Measure the jelly to be recooked. For each quart of jelly, measure one-quarter 
cup sugar, one-quarter cup water and four teaspoons powdered pectin. Combine 
pectin and water. Boil, stirring constantly to prevent scorching. Add jelly and 
sugar. Stir thoroughly. Bring to a full rolling boil over high heat, stirring 
constantly. Boil mixture hard for one-half minute. Remove from heat, skim, pour 
into hot containers, and seal. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that powdered pectin should not be substituted in recipes 
developed for liquid pectin and vice versa. This may have been the cause of 
your original problem.

THE BUTCHER: SHOULDER CUT TRIMS BILL AT MEAT COUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you want to save money at the meat counter, you must get to know "chuck." 
Chuck is not the name of any particular friendly and generous butcher. It is 
rather the name of a large part of a beef carcass. For some reason unknown to 
me, the front shoulder of the beef animal is called the chuck. Every other 
animal in the world has shoulders -- lambs have shoulders, veal have shoulders, 
pigs have shoulders. Beef have, instead, chucks. 
</P>
<P>
The chuck makes up about 26% of the total carcass weight and, for the most 
part, has been considered a less-tender part of the animal that generally 
requires long-slow-moist-heat cooking. That there is a lot of it and that it is 
generally considered tough and less desirable have made the chuck a problem for 
the beef industry for years. 
</P>
<P>
Butchers have traditionally had to discount the chuck in order to move it. That 
has made it a good value for consumers throughout the years. If you have, as 
grandmother seemed to, plenty of time to make stews and pot roasts using 
long-slow-moist-heat cooking, the chuck is a cut that can save plenty of money 
on meals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well-Rounded Chuck 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, according to a recent study conducted at South Dakota State 
University, you might not even need much time to save a lot of money with 
chuck. Some chuck muscles from today's leaner younger beef cattle, it was 
found, are tender enough to do all kinds of things with besides pot roast. 
</P>
<P>
The research was funded by the Beef Industry Council, the South Dakota Beef 
Council and the California Beef Council for the purpose of discovering if the 
chuck might not have potentially greater value if sold as individual cuts 
rather than as one cut with several muscles. The result of the study was 
reported in the Journal of Food Science. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists studied the eating characteristics of 34 muscles/muscle groups 
within the forequarters of 16 Angus steers of similar genetic and nutritional 
background. They determined the fat and lean content of each, as well as the 
chemical characteristics of the connective tissue, the component largely 
responsible for the chuck being less tender. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What's in It for You? 
</P>
<P>
What the research indicated was that if the beef industry could develop 
fabrication and processing techniques to allow easy and cost-effective 
separation of the muscles of the chuck, its value could be significantly 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
So what does this mean to you? Two things. First, you can be sure that the beef 
industry is going to be working overtime to find ways of taking the chuck apart 
so the parts can be sold to you for more money. And second, if you're willing 
to do a little cutting-up in the kitchen, you can take a chuck apart yourself 
and do all kinds of wonderful things with the meat. You don't have to be a 
scientist -- or even a butcher -- to take a chuck apart, and the results can be 
surprisingly rewarding both in terms of good food and money saved. 
</P>
<P>
After reading about the South Dakota study, I decided to do my own. I went to 
the market and picked up a three-pound piece of boneless chuck roast. I would 
like to have found one with the bone in, they are always a better buy, but 
those are getting harder and harder to find. They must have found some way to 
cross those critters with jellyfish; they don't have any bones anymore. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Lean Is Left 
</P>
<P>
At home, I took it apart. It was more a matter of simply pulling it apart 
rather than any skilled knife work. The individual muscles are separated by 
connective tissue and they come apart rather easily. Then, by carefully 
trimming away all fat and silvery connective tissue, you are left with several 
pieces, some large and some small, of solid lean meat. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know the names of the muscles that I cut from my chuck. I don't know 
which, if any, was the Brachiocephalicus or the Longissimus dorsi or the 
Triceps brachi. But it was not difficult to tell, even without cooking, which 
were the more tender. Those with a finer texture, some almost like velvet, are 
apt to be more tender than the muscles with a coarse stringy look to them. 
</P>
<P>
Try this quick beef stew Italiano. It takes less than 30 minutes and tastes 
like you cooked it all day.

NEW SEAFOOD PRODUCTS REACHING THE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent advances in technology have inundated the seafood industry with new and 
different fishery products. 
</P>
<P>
The changes were evident at Seafare '89, a trade show held last week at the 
Long Beach Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the progress is resulting from aquaculture, or fish farming, now well 
established in more than a dozen countries. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the success of these ventures, industry observers said, was the 
announcement at the conference that Norwegian salmon farms will produce 100,000 
metric tons of the prized fish in 1990, or 25% above this year's level. 
</P>
<P>
The increase comes at the same time that the Norwegian government indicated it 
plans no direct subsidies for the fish farmers, a development, along with the 
production increases, that's likely to reduce the cost of their high-quality 
product on the world market. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwegians are far and away the leaders in salmon ranching, with more than 
half the world's total. But other nations are expected to increase their 
production of the fish as well, particularly those firms in the Canadian 
province of British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The cumulative effect of these efforts, including those that simply release 
hatched salmon into the sea, has pushed total tonnage of aquacultured salmon to 
equal that of the ocean- and river-harvested, or wild, varieties. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the number of farmed salmon has proliferated to such an extent that 
Seafood Leader magazine, the convention sponsor, held an official tasting of 
product from nine countries. 
</P>
<P>
These and other changes in the seafood industry brought 12,000 people to the 
three-day trade show, which featured seminars and 600 exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights of the event included the debut of an edible, tropical 
seaweed, giant Australian farmed crayfish and the reintroduction of hoki, an 
exotic-sounding New Zealand whitefish. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat afield of fish farming, but still compatible with those firms racing 
to cultivate foodstuffs from the ocean, is a Honolulu-based company that is 
raising a popular seaweed variety used by Hawaiians and other South Pacific 
islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Spencer, of Hawaiian Marine Enterprise, said he began cultivating the 
intricate bunches of red, sphere-like clusters six years ago as the natural 
supplies were depleted by over-harvesting. "Most people view seaweed as soft, 
slimy and heavy in flavor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sea vegetable, as Spencer's product is labeled, is crisp in texture, flavored 
somewhere between celery, cabbage and green onion, with a salty aftertaste. 
However, the salty taste, a condition of seawater, can be removed by rinsing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Hawaii the seaweed, or gracilaria in Latin, is quite common. It is used as a 
pickled vegetable, in salads, as a garnish or in a traditional Hawaiian dish 
called poki, which is a mixture of raw fish, such as tuna, and other 
seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer said the seaweed, available in red or green colors, is very popular 
among chefs but is also being sold in Honolulu-area supermarkets for about 
$3.50 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
As is the case with the fish farmers, Spencer realized there would be a market 
for sea vegetables as local supplies of the weed dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
"For many years, the Hawaiians used to pick off bunches of the seaweed, but 
still leave a little clinging to rocks and tide pools so it would continue 
growing. But in the last 30 years, other Pacific Islanders (such as Samoans) 
realized the plant's commercial value, over-harvested and denuded the whole 
sides of some (Hawaiian) islands. We saw that happening six years ago and began 
cultivating it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fish farming is by no means limited to ocean species. One promising aquaculture 
product is the recent work of the Australian Crayfish Industries. The firm 
exhibited, for the first time, its version of this fresh-water shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
Those expecting tiny, finger-sized crustaceans were surprised to see the 
product measure several inches in length and actually resemble jumbo shrimp or 
small lobsters in meat content. And to emphasize the point, the Denver-based 
firm that will market the Australian crayfish in this country adopted 
Freshwater Lobsters as its corporate name. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen tons of the crayfish will be marketed in 1989 in both fresh and frozen 
forms. The company hopes to more than double the total next year, but is 
already claiming that "demand greatly exceeds supply." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the farmed fish, the number of exotic species is also expanding. New 
Zealand interests are now heavily promoting hoki. 
</P>
<P>
Importers, namely Fletcher Seafoods in Seattle, hope to position hoki with 
other popular white fish, such as haddock and cod, but at a lower price. The 
firm-textured fish is the latest in a series from the South Pacific, the most 
recent success having been orange roughy.

LET'S EAT OUT: OLD-TIME ELEGANCE PREVAILS AT WINDSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ah, the Windsor. Remember the Windsor? I had almost forgotten the Windsor 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old landmark restaurant was, and still is, a hangout for downtown 
business moguls. Its days as a romantic hideaway for Hollywood stars are over, 
but I can see a yuppie revival. 
</P>
<P>
I've yet to find a more romantic, cozy place that would qualify. The ambiance 
is tawny and sultry with its soft lighting, walnut and mahogany panels and 
soft-leather semi-circular booths, a throwback to the '40s when they were 
designed for intimate tete a tete. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the fast-disappearing art of tableside service, you'll not find it 
better or more perfected anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
And I left all that for the ice-cold, high-tech and newfangled nouvelle that 
wooed me away from the Windsor over the last decade? Well, I'm back. 
</P>
<P>
I decided to visit the Windsor again because I have rediscovered Continental 
cuisine, which I think of as truly American. Continental cuisine, which graced 
the finest tables in fashionable American restaurants and home dining rooms, 
was the cooking of France, Germany, Italy and Britain translated for the 
American palate. Meat and potatoes done with flair. And it stuck. Continental 
cuisine is, in my humble opinion, the best-liked, most appreciated and most 
comforting cuisine for the American palate. 
</P>
<P>
So there I was at the Windsor, going back in time. There were the circular 
booths, the tawny cast, the cozy, comfortable place I left back in the '70s, 
when we often celebrated family birthdays at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
And there was Ben Dimsdale, the owner and visionary, whose name deserves to be 
engraved in the culinary hall of fame for having brought everlasting style to 
the Los Angeles restaurant scene throughout the years. The energy oozing from 
Dimsdale is hard to miss. It's in the air, on the menu and in the rapid-fire 
movements of his staff. No sloughing off here. 
</P>
<P>
There was Antoine, the captain extraordinaire who can tell you when Belgian 
endive is in season, how sauces Bearnaise and morel (mushrooms) are made, and 
whether you should order the chicken Kiev or veal Oscar, the stroganoff, the 
steak Diane, the grenadine of beef tenderloin, the beef Wellington, the 
chateaubriand bouquetiere or the veal cordon bleu, because, you'll want them 
all. But he'll tell you. And you can bet you'll be happy. 
</P>
<P>
Any waiter or captain who wonders what intuitive, wise, professional service is 
all about should make a point of observing Antoine, who too should be ensconced 
in the culinary hall of fame as a model for generations to come. 
</P>
<P>
When Dimsdale stopped at our table (as he does with all customers) to ask how 
things were, he mentioned that the menu may be too large. It is, but why change 
it now? The menu is a period piece worth studying just for the sheer joy of it. 
Reading it makes my heart jump. 
</P>
<P>
At dinner, you can run down the 25 appetizers, which include old favorites such 
as marrow Bordelaise, whose sauce is a work of art. Rarely, if ever, have I had 
better, even in France. Hearts of palm vinaigrette, oysters Rockefeller, 
seafood cocktails are on the same list. The onion soup au gratin is the kind 
that you'd expect grand'mere used to make, filled and brimming with fragrant 
melted cheese. Potage St. Germaine (cream of pea soup) and the cold 
vichyssoise, standard on all Continental menus, are also on the soup list. 
</P>
<P>
As for the salads, good heavens, what a list. There is a Caesar salad that is 
prepared at tableside as it should be -- with a flourish. There is an excellent 
wilted spinach (the best I've had so far) with gorgeous, fat spinach leaves and 
a superb dressing. The Belgian endive vinaigrette is an excellent choice at the 
moment, because, says Antoine, endive are in season. "It is best to order 
vegetables in season," he said. That's a lot better advice than you hear from 
"hi, I'm Chuck, your friendly waiter," who doesn't know a Belgian endive from a 
putty knife. 
</P>
<P>
There is an old-fashioned Louis salad on the lunch menu, and another Windsor 
variation. The lunch menu has a group of fabulous sandwiches too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fish Fresh Daily 
</P>
<P>
Like all well-rounded Continental menus, you have a pasta section to study. 
These are standard classics: spaghetti Caruso, Bolognese, marinara, linguine 
all vongole and fettuccine Alfredo. But I'll bet you haven't seen a spaghetti 
Tetrazzini on a menu lately. The Tetrazzini is a layered dish of spaghetti, 
turkey breast and mushroom-sherry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
All the fish, says Antoine, is purchased fresh daily. And I believe him. The 
broiled swordfish maitre d'hotel sang, which, for someone who spurns fish, is 
saying much. And I can't wait to try the lobster thermidor, which is, and has 
been, a Windsor specialty. 
</P>
<P>
Among the fowl you have chicken a la Kiev with sauce perigueux (truffle), 
prepared at its classic best. The dish could not have been as good during the 
time of the Czars in Russia, when the dish (they say) was used as a means of 
transmitting secret information within the plump rolls of chicken. The butter 
oozes out at first bite. 
</P>
<P>
There is a duckling with wild rice and a deviled turkey breast with brandied 
peaches. There is also a turkey Marco Polo (made with broccoli and ham in a 
cream sauce), which circulated heavily, I recall, during the '40s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Remember veal Cordon Bleu? Remember veal Oskar, made with asparagus and 
tomatoes? There is a veal chop with spinach en croute (in a crust) and a 
Milanaise, which is precisely classic. A veal piccata saute with lemon and 
capers is worth its relatively low price ($20). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prices Memorably Lower 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the prices are memorably lower than you would pay at an equally fine 
restaurant. No entree, whether fish, fowl or veal is priced more than $25 or 
$48 for two. Most are in the $16 to $18 range. 
</P>
<P>
If you love red meat, you've come to the right place. You'll find your 
favorites, including pepper steak, tournedos, rack of lamb, mixed grill, Vienna 
roastbraten, plus the organ meats, which most people reserve for restaurant 
dining: lamb kidney saute, calf's liver saute with apples, onions and bacon, 
and sweetbreads. A New York steak sandwich fills you up, and pork chops are 
priced right too. 
</P>
<P>
I heartily suggest you save room for dessert. The desserts are the old classics 
that are fast disappearing from the restaurant scene. Crepes Suzettes and 
cherries jubilee are prepared tableside. My favorite, peach Melba, named after 
the Australian Nellie Melba, whose operatic career flourished during the turn 
of the century, is a sky-high creation in a huge iced bowl with fabulous 
chocolate sauce streaming down fat peach halves. 
</P>
<P>
The chocolate souffle was slightly disappointing, only because I expected it to 
be better than the ones I so enjoy at the Moustache Cafe and the Bistro. The 
baked Alaska was gorgeous to look at, but slightly dry. Order either dessert 
when you order your entree. 
</P>
<P>
And, ah yes, the coffee. It's superb. The cafe diable for two is especially 
romantic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

THE VEGETARIAN: RICE PUDDING IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR BREAKFAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANA SHAW, Shaw is free-lance writer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The windows were what sold me on my tiny cabin in the hills, and if cold winds 
keep coming, those windows just might drive me out. It's gotten to where I'm 
wondering if trading in some major household appliances would cover the bill 
for the heat that's seeping away through the seams of my skylights and glass 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, I'm preparing hearty dishes that require hovering over a hot stove, 
such as this ricotta-rice concoction with fresh applesauce. Sweet enough to 
serve as dessert, there's ample nourishment from fiber-rich wehani rice, milk 
and cheese to pass this pudding off as breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RICOTTA-RICE PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
1 cup low-fat ricotta cheese 
</P>
<P>
1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup raw sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons grated lemon or orange peel 
</P>
<P>
1 cup cooked wehani rice or medium-grain brown rice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup currants or raisins 
</P>
<P>
1 extra large egg 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1 cup Fresh Applesauce 
</P>
<P>
Beat ricotta cheese with hand mixer until smooth. Place in medium saucepan and 
stir in milk, sugar, lemon peel, rice and currants. Stir constantly over medium 
heat until mixture becomes creamy, about 20 minutes. Do not boil. Remove from 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg in bowl. Add 1/4 cup rice mixture and stir well. Pour egg into 
pudding. Stir over medium heat until mixture sets, about 2 minutes. Remove from 
heat and stir in vanilla. Let stand at least 30 minutes before serving. Top 
with warm Fresh Applesauce. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Wehani rice is nutty, slightly smoky-flavored brown rice hybrid, 
medium-grain, dense and chewy, and available in gourmet and health food stores. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh Applesauce 
</P>
<P>
2 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and sliced 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup apple juice (preferably thick kind, not from concentrate) 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons maple syrup 
</P>
<P>
Dash cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
Steam apple slices in apple juice in small covered skillet until mushy. 
Transfer to blender or food processor. Add maple syrup and cinnamon. Process 
until smooth. Serve warm over rice pudding. Makes about 1 cup.

MUSEUM PLAN FOR LANTERMAN HOUSE OKD BY LA CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA TURNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of deliberation, the La Canada Flintridge City Council voted 
Tuesday night to use the historic Lanterman House as a museum, cultural center 
and organ recital facility. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the plan in a 4-0 vote despite homeowners objections that 
converting the 74-year-old Craftsman-style mansion into a museum would increase 
traffic and lower the value of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We've listened well," Councilman Warren Hillgren told the homeowners. "The 
Planning Commission has listened to concerns of neighbors and set up conditions 
that I think will give you reasonable protection. It's a worn-out expression 
saying 'Trust us,' but that's what you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner representatives later threatened legal action to block the plan, but 
city staff members said they believe that it meets all zoning requirements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debated for a Year 
</P>
<P>
More than a year of debate over the future of the Lanterman House culminated in 
a public hearing last week at which some residents praised the museum plan. 
However, those near the house, in an upscale neighborhood north of Foothill 
Boulevard, protested vehemently. 
</P>
<P>
The council postponed a vote when opponents questioned the legality of a 
conditional-use permit for the project and the adequacy of an environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney representing homeowners near the Lanterman House said at the 
hearing that the proposal was inconsistent with the city's general plan and 
zoning codes, and that the environmental report did not sufficiently examine 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"The council must apply the letter and rule of the law," attorney William D. 
Ross said. "And there are very technical and substantive provisions that must 
be followed. The opponents are questioning what can be called the 'trust me' 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
But city officials said Tuesday that the environmental report adequately 
examined alternatives and that the permit was consistent with the general plan. 
</P>
<P>
Community Development Director Bill Campbell said conditions placed into the 
proposal by the Planning Commission will protect the neighborhood. The 
conditions would control the hours the facility is open and the number of 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
In the first of two actions, the council voted 4 to 1 to certify the 
environmental report. Councilman Ed Phelps voted no. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to use the issues raised in the appeal as a road map to resolve this 
controversy," Phelps said. "A lot of alternatives still need to be addressed 
besides whether the EIR is adequate, which, quite frankly, I do not believe it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
In a second vote, the council approved the conditional-use permit adopted 
earlier by the Planning Commission. Phelps, who owns a house near the Lanterman 
estate, did not participate in discussion or voting on the permit because of a 
possible conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I could never vote to have that house destroyed," said Mayor Joan Feehan. "The 
house is a real place for real people. I hate to think the history we're going 
to leave our children is McDonald's and Jack in the Box." 
</P>
<P>
Disgruntled homeowners near the Lanterman House said they plan to pursue the 
issue in court. 
</P>
<P>
"They're forcing us to litigate," said Wayne Collins, whose balcony overlooks 
the house. "The points our attorney raised are valid points, and they failed to 
address any of them." 
</P>
<P>
The house on Encinas Drive has been the subject of public debate since the 
death of Lloyd Lanterman in 1987. Lanterman, the last survivor of the family 
that founded La Canada Flintridge, willed his home to the city several years 
ago with the stipulation that it be used for civic or community purposes. 
</P>
<P>
After Lanterman's death, the council considered using the house as a city hall 
and cultural center, but those plans were shelved after strong objections from 
homeowners. Then the proposal was made to convert the estate into a museum, 
cultural center and organ recital hall. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city received a $500,000 grant from the state's Historic 
Preservation Grant Program for restoration of the house as a museum. 
</P>
<P>
City officials did not say when work would begin.

STUDYING FOR PEACE;

<P>
WORLD UNIVERSITY MARKS 15TH ANNIVERSARY AMID OJAI'S SPIRITUAL DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The psychology of miracles is taught every Tuesday night at a Main Street 
storefront in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
For World Peace 101, students must trek up to the main campus in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Both are offerings of World University, a degree-granting institute where 
students learn academic subjects alongside the three Rs of New Age 
spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
"Peace is not a gift from heaven. It is a condition we have to generate by our 
thoughts, by our desires, by our aspirations," said President Benito F. Reyes, 
who founded World University in Ojai with his wife Dominga in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15th Anniversary 
</P>
<P>
The school, which will celebrate its 15th anniversary this weekend with a 
two-day conference, aims to promote spiritual growth and harmonious relations 
among individuals. If enough people participate, this process will eventually 
lead to world peace, Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
What brought an urban academic from Manila to Ventura County? 
</P>
<P>
Reyes said his spiritual leader in the Philippines chose Ojai because it was 
destined to become "the new Athens of the New Age," referring to the Greek city 
where philosophy and wisdom flourished more than 2,500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And, clearly, Ojai is a magnet for spiritual groups of all stripes, from the 
Theosophical Society to Kratona to Meditation Mount. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes had never heard of Ojai, but being a dutiful apostle, he moved there in 
1974 armed with "100% faith and zero funds," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
A goodly number of philanthropists have jumped on his Peace Train since then -- 
including early benefactors who raised $180,000 in 1976 to buy a jumble of 
downtown buildings that once housed the City Hall, jail and courts. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, one class meets in a courtroom, another in the jail. Reyes 
occupies the former mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not for long though. When longtime Ojai resident Mima Porter died last 
year, she willed the school her 10-acre, emerald-green estate just outside 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expansion Under Way 
</P>
<P>
Reyes plans to use the land for classrooms, a dormitory and possibly a museum. 
Expansion is also under way in Ventura, where World University began offering 
classes last month for those attracted to spiritual enlightenment but not a 
drive to Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
The university is also launching a Center of Compassion that will feed 100 
needy people each month, and it is considering a New Age psychological 
laboratory and an institute of advanced studies in consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Reyes plans a program geared to senior citizens -- whom he calls 
"our noble citizens" -- and one in journalism ethics that would teach aspiring 
reporters to write from a global, humanitarian viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our students have gone down there and taken classes, and they've 
enjoyed it," said Joan Halifax, a cultural anthropologist and president of the 
Ojai Foundation, a non-traditional school in the Upper Ojai Valley. "Reyes is 
well-educated and an excellent orator and teacher." 
</P>
<P>
There is also some cross-pollination between World University and local 
Matilija Junior High School. Assistant Principal Steve Olsen, who is mayor of 
Ojai, said World University professors teach astronomy classes for gifted 
students at the junior high. 
</P>
<P>
The school also has exchange programs with other non-traditional institutes 
worldwide, including Zoroastrian College in Bombay, India; the Assn. of 
Religious Psychology in Tokyo, and Koh-E-Nor University in Santa Monica, which, 
according to its newsletter, is "dedicated to instruction in the practical 
application of the spiritual teachings of the mystical traveler." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buyout Offer 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the Japanese corporation that recently visited World University 
and asked Dominga Reyes if it could establish an affiliation with the school or 
buy it outright. 
</P>
<P>
"We have our spiritual work to do here. World University is not for sale," 
Dominga Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
The Reyes -- who are both 75 and live in Upper Ojai -- have a long history of 
involvement in educational endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Reyes was named founding president of the first free college in the 
Philippines -- Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila -- which means the University 
of the City of Manila in Tagalog, the main Filipino dialect. 
</P>
<P>
He is also a two-time Fulbright scholar who has lectured throughout the United 
States on spiritual and philosophical issues. 
</P>
<P>
But Reyes refuses to rest on his metaphysical laurels. He tirelessly promotes 
World University, still teaches there and has authored about two dozen books, 
including "1,000 Sonnets for God" and "Education for World Peace," in which he 
explains his role as educator. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the mind-makers; we are the engineers of attitudes; we are the 
architects of beliefs; we are the builders of men . . . and that indeed is a 
serious task," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
So far, World University has handed out 65 bachelor of arts and master's 
degrees in philosophy, psychology and religious studies. That is in addition to 
35 students who have earned vocational certificates in fields that range from 
astrology and meditation to spiritual ministry. Tuition is $40 per unit, and 
100 students participate in small seminars that range from five students to 
about 18, said Dominga Reyes, the dean of students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Accredited 
</P>
<P>
World University is licensed by the state Department of Education to grant 
degrees, but has not received accreditation from the Western Assn. of Schools 
and Colleges, an independent accrediting agency. 
</P>
<P>
One avid convert is 54-year-old Susan Wilson of Azusa, a registered nurse 
studying for her bachelor's degree in psychology. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been looking for years for a body of knowledge I'd be interested in 
putting my time and money into, and this is it for me. It has the right blend 
of spirituality and academics," said Wilson, who stays at the World University 
dorms during the week and commutes to Azusa on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
And unlike some of Ojai's more experimental institutes, World University is not 
all crystals and channeling. 
</P>
<P>
For every meditation class, there are such academic offerings as English 
composition, quantum mechanics and basic psychology. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the College of World Peace, which in 1987 began offering courses 
on the psychology of peace, peace education, peace techniques, family peace, 
peace ethics and meditation for peace. 
</P>
<P>
Every Friday, the student body prays 15 minutes for world peace. 
</P>
<P>
The Reyes predict that their university will last 1,000 years. And they read 
fateful significance into the words of Theosophist Fritz Kuntz, who in a 1927 
essay foretold a "world university" that would guide those who come to the Ojai 
Valley seeking spiritual enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
And so it has come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Olsen will issue a proclamation honoring World University for 
enriching the lives of the city's residents and visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a well-rounded community that accepts all sorts of educational, 
philosophical and religious groups," Olsen said. "And they fit in well with the 
Ojai spirit."

SCHOOLTEACHER ON CAMPUS TURNS INTO ELVIS ON STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
During the week, Raymond Michael Hebel puts 138 antsy pre-adolescents through 
the restrained paces of choral music at Chaparral Middle School in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
But when school's out, Hebel, 35, dons long sideburns and stage makeup, steps 
into his expensive costumes and trots out into the spotlight as Raymond 
Michael, putting on his hit show, "Elvis -- His Legend's Still Alive," which 
has played to screaming audiences from Las Vegas to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe I am making a living at this," Hebel said with a slight smile. 
"Personally, I don't think anyone can fill Elvis Presley's shoes, but the 
response I get is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
So is the story of how he first got it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, he was a student at what is now California Lutheran University who was 
thinking about becoming a music teacher or a football coach. At that time, he 
was asked to take part in a campus show put on by hypnotist George Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp told Hebel that he was no longer himself, but the king of rock 'n' roll. 
With that instruction, Hebel began to belt out "Blue Suede Shoes." 
</P>
<P>
According to people who attended the show at the Thousand Oaks campus, the 
crowd went wild, creaming, jumping up and chanting, "El-vis! El-vis!" 
</P>
<P>
"The hypnotist got together with the students before the show to make sure 
everything would go smoothly," said Frederick Bowen, a Cal Lutheran speech and 
communications professor, "and Ray probably told him at that time he was a 
singer. But they were hypnotized, no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
Because of Hebel's attachment to Cal Lutheran, he is presenting his show there 
at 8 p.m. Friday to raise about $100,000 to restore a turn-of-the-century ranch 
house on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
The structure, a Ventura County Historical Landmark, houses the school's music 
department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dream of Light Opera 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his performance under hypnosis, Hebel was not a Presley fan. His 
only exposure to Presley was through his older sister who, he said, would drag 
him to the singer's movies, and a college roommate who was always singing "Blue 
Suede Shoes." He dreamed not of churning out chart-busters, but of becoming a 
light opera star such as Gordon MacRae. However, that changed after his fateful 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"My voice teacher was Gert Muser, a former soloist for the Vienna State Opera. 
He had set up a deal for me to go to Germany to study, but after my performance 
as Elvis, he came to me and said, 'I don't want you to go overseas. You can 
make a lot more money doing Elvis.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hebel believed that he could learn to like Presley. In the beginning, he 
received a lot of help from friends, including Bowen, and another professor, 
Don Haskell. 
</P>
<P>
Haskell rounded up videos of Elvis in concert and set Hebel to work studying 
everything about him, from his smooth ballads to his gyrating hips. 
</P>
<P>
There have been a lot of changes in Hebel's show since he first started almost 
17 years ago. After Presley died in 1977, Hebel did not do it for several 
months because he thought that it was in bad taste, but when so many 
impersonators "began coming out of the woodwork, they did some distasteful 
things. I had a lot of requests for my show, so I went back to it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tribute to Him' 
</P>
<P>
"When I first began, I would do chunks from one of Elvis' albums, really as if 
I were Elvis. But now I do a tribute to him. I don't like saying I'm an 
imitator because that has a negative connotation. Instead, I refer to myself as 
'an Elvis illusionist.' 
</P>
<P>
"I market myself particularly to amusement parks, but I'm not an Elvis fanatic. 
My feeling is that people pay to see me and I want to give them their money's 
worth. I wouldn't do anything like those male strippers that imitate Elvis. I 
wouldn't send my kid to see a show like that. I talk about his life style -- 
sort of like a history lesson. That must be the teacher in me," he said with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Hebel said he began to change his show after he did a stint in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the major stars came and watched me. They advised me to bring out my 
own personality in the show." Hebel said he now "goes in and out of Elvis" 
during the performance. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Hebel played at Knott's Berry Farm -- selling out 173 of 174 
performances -- a record that will probably stand for years, according to Gary 
Salisbury, the park's entertainment manager. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Fills Definite Need' 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt he's one of the top Elvis impersonators," Salisbury said. 
"But we hired him to reach that portion of the population that relates to 
Elvis. He fills a definite need out here and he does a good job at it. He 
doesn't pretend to be Elvis. I've seen many Elvis acts and some of those people 
really believe they are Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
Hebel, a 25-year resident of Moorpark, is booked into Knott's this summer, 
beginning June 17 and running five days a week, three shows a day, through 
Sept. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his popularity, Hebel said, it is his teaching and life style offstage 
that keeps his feet on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, 'Why teach?' The answer is because I want a respectable life. 
I once did a stint at the Silverbird in Las Vegas, and the next day I was 
teaching a special education class. Talk about bringing your feet down to the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teacher's Salary 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, a public school teacher's salary doesn't pay all the bills. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers I work with all have two to three jobs. It's a shame because they 
could be spending the time they are working at other jobs creating ideas for 
teaching. I don't know any that live high off the hog," said Hebel, who is 
married and has a 16-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
As for a singing career as himself, Hebel said he has tried it, even doing 
opera, but there is little money and less gratification. 
</P>
<P>
"As Elvis, I play major showrooms, do major venues. I work to full houses. But 
that would not happen if I were me. If I want to, I can perform an opera 
gratuitously and walk away and say, 'Yes, I can do it.' But I would be playing 
to an empty house."

STATE VERIFIES TOXIC WASTES IN SOIL OF DUNES PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent tests by the state Department of Health Services at an Oxnard 
subdivision have confirmed the presence of petroleum-based contaminants in the 
soil, officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
However, the tests would not have been necessary had the department not lost 
portions of data from tests conducted in 1986, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Marxen, a department spokesman, said the loss could possibly be blamed on 
frequent changes in the department staff testing for toxic wastes at the Dunes 
subdivision, which was built in an area used as an oil field dump in the late 
1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Only one member of the department's staff -- toxicologist Lou Levy -- has been 
on the project for more than a year, Marxen said. In the past year, the project 
manager has changed three times, with a fourth project supervisor to assume the 
post next week. 
</P>
<P>
Without the lost information, which details how the soil samples were collected 
and treated, results from the 1986 tests were not considered scientifically 
valid, said Tim Miles, who will be replaced as project manager by Pauline 
Bararseh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Corrected 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way to tell if samples taken by us and the county of Ventura were 
valid," Miles said. The most recent soil samples have corrected the problem, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation is unlikely to boost the confidence of Dunes residents, who have 
complained that government officials have been slow to respond to their 
concerns about petroleum-based contaminants first detected in 1985 by a 
building contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good example of why it's taken them three years to do nothing," said 
Paul Dolan, a leader in a lawsuit by Dunes residents against the state, the 
city of Oxnard, the oil companies that used the dump, several real estate 
agents and the company that developed the subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
Marxen admitted that the loss was "sloppy." But neither he nor Miles would 
characterize the recent tests as superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
The recent soil samples, which were collected Jan. 18 and 24, were valuable in 
confirming what was already known about the site, they said. The tests detected 
most of the same contaminants that were previously found. However, they did not 
find benzene, the only known carcinogen detected so far at the subdivision of 
about 100 lots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Official Release 
</P>
<P>
Geological surveys conducted last week and in December were also consistent 
with past research, Miles said in advance of a community meeting Wednesday at 
which the department's conclusions would officially be released. 
</P>
<P>
The surveys, in which scientists used radar and electromagnetic equipment to 
map the boundaries of the waste, found that soil contamination has been 
confined to an area known to have been occupied by three oil sumps, Miles said. 
The area covers about 20 lots or portions of lots. 
</P>
<P>
The soil tests found metal, barium and several petroleum-related compounds, but 
preliminary research has not found any contaminants in the air or in pipes 
carrying water into Dunes homes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way for this to hurt people as long as they aren't digging into 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dolan complained that the department issued the same assurances three years 
ago. "We deserve a more conclusive response," he said. "We're talking about the 
lives of people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full Investigation 
</P>
<P>
Department officials say they will pursue a full site investigation, which is 
expected to cost between $500,000 and $600,000 and would begin as soon as 
funding is available. 
</P>
<P>
They said $100 million from a 1984 bond measure to clean up toxic waste 
statewide has been depleted, adding that they are trying to persuade 
legislators to earmark additional money. 
</P>
<P>
However, funds set aside for administrative expenses might be used for part of 
the Dunes investigation, Deputy Director David Willis said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials had expected to complete the investigation by January, 
1990, but now believe that it may be delayed by "months or a year," Marxen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation would determine whether the contaminants, which are from 1 
1/2 to 8 feet below the surface in 4- to 5-inch-thick bands, have leached into 
ground water or vaporized into homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Air Samples 
</P>
<P>
Two previous air samples have not detected vaporized contaminants at levels of 
concern, Miles said. In one test of 25 homes, for instance, the highest level 
of gas detected was at one-third of the amount that would result from lighting 
a gas range, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials plan to use more sensitive equipment in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Also in an attempt to improve their investigation at the Dunes, the department 
plans to employ a team approach, in which the eight staff members at the site 
share information. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, only the project manager has had an overview of the department's 
efforts in the area, and the project managers either have either been promoted 
from the Dunes post or, in Miles' case, left to travel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to compile the information so that there's some sense of history 
to the site," Marxen said. "In the past, there was no continuity."

SUSPECT PLEADS INNOCENT IN ASSAULT ON WOMAN, 77 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The second of two Arizona men accused of kidnaping, severely beating and 
stabbing an elderly La Canada Flintridge woman pleaded not guilty last week in 
Glendale Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Edward Keeling, 20, was arraigned Thursday on charges of robbery, 
kidnaping for the purpose of robbery and attempted murder. He and Randall J. 
Countryman, 18, are charged in connection with the July 8 kidnaping of 
77-year-old Eloise Purdy, who survived. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they hope to try Countryman and Keeling together. 
</P>
<P>
Keeling was extradited last week from Arizona, where he had been held since 
July when Arizona authorities arrested him and Countryman on suspicion of 
possession of a stolen vehicle. The two men were spotted driving Purdy's 1988 
Cadillac Seville.

BACK AT WORK AFTER BYPASS SURGERY;

<P>
POLICE CHIEF HAS HEALTH ON AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale Police Chief David J. Thompson returned to his desk this week, three 
months after suffering a heart attack and undergoing double bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
He was 25 pounds lighter and, he said, determined to live healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he has given up chili hamburgers and French fries, walks 2 1/2 
miles each morning and has cut back on sweetened coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a learning experience," said the hard-driving Thompson, 58, a 
self-described workaholic who climbed through the ranks in a 34-year career 
from foot patrolman to chief of Glendale's 260-member department. 
</P>
<P>
"I had all the poor habits and didn't listen to advice," he admitted. "I didn't 
watch my diet and I didn't exercise. I was a typical executive with a 
high-cholesterol problem." 
</P>
<P>
Named chief seven years ago, Thompson worked 56 hours a week, skipped breakfast 
and ate on the run when he was not attending a civic group's lunch. 
</P>
<P>
During a luncheon meeting of the La Canada Flintridge Chamber of Commerce on 
Nov. 3, Thompson felt chest pains and nausea. He drove himself to a Glendale 
hospital, then was transferred to the cardiac unit of the Hospital of the Good 
Samaritan in Los Angeles, where he underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Lord's Help' 
</P>
<P>
The gray-haired Thompson credits his survival to "the good Lord's help and a 
cardiologist," Dr. Michael Stark. He said he has spent much of his time since 
"learning how to stand upright after they sewed me up." 
</P>
<P>
The chief spent about five weeks of his recovery period with his wife June on 
the Oregon coast, where he fished for salmon and reflected on his life style. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a hands-on person," Thompson said. "But I need to get my hands off and let 
other people get involved." He said he plans to delegate more jobs and share 
the public speaking. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he became eligible for retirement with full benefits two years 
ago but has no immediate plans to exercise his options. 
</P>
<P>
The chief said he will retire "when I decide." 
</P>
<P>
Slimmed down from 200 pounds to 175, the 5-foot-10 Thompson said he has a full 
agenda. Following a luncheon meeting with Citizens for Law and Order on 
Tuesday, he was working on departmental organizational changes for next year. 
He said downtown traffic and gangs were foremost on his mind -- along with 
salt, a forbidden food for which he has not found a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
"Health food," he said, "makes me sick."

HOUSING TOO EXPENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Denise Hamilton's Feb. 9 article, "Easing the Squeeze," really hit home. 
</P>
<P>
Our family moved to California from Albuquerque, N.M., 10 years ago. Like the 
others in your article, my father received a job offer he couldn't refuse. 
</P>
<P>
My parents sold their home, which was middle-of-the-road but comfortable, to 
move to California -- and not be able to afford a shack. My sister followed. 
Now our neighbors and friends are selling and moving to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
My sister can't raise a family of five in her three-bedroom home and can't 
afford to move up. So she's moving away. I don't have two incomes to support a 
house, so I'm renting mine out and moving away also. 
</P>
<P>
My parents are retiring here by themselves, with the family and neighborhood 
moving away. Is Ventura doomed to become a retirement community?

MUMOLO CAN ONLY RELIVE MISS IN HIS MIND

It's probably best that the fans stood when they did. Otherwise, Dominic Mumulo 
might still be in front of his television, remote control in hand, reviewing 
the layup that wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Mumulo, a junior forward at St. Francis High, missed a left-handed layup 
against La Canada with five seconds to play last Wednesday as the Golden 
Knights lost their first-round Southern Section 3-A Division basketball playoff 
game, 64-63. However, Mumulo says, the shot was no gimme. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to go up with my right hand but I thought I probably would have 
gotten stuffed so I switched to my left," said Mumulo, who was hardly a goat in 
the game after scoring 16 points. "I shot it and the ball seemed to get caught 
in the corner of the rim and it didn't quite get over. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't something that really depressed me but it was something I could have 
made. Anybody on the team could have made it." 
</P>
<P>
Mumulo's father videotaped the game but failed to capture much of the fourth 
quarter because fans were on their feet. The fact that the painful moment 
wasn't saved for posterity bothers Dominic. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to see it," he said. "I wanted to see how we unfolded." 
</P>
<P>
Falcon flop: In its 96-66 loss to Rio Mesa in the second round of the Southern 
Section 4-A Division playoffs Friday, the Crescenta Valley basketball team made 
three of 14 free throws. Despite those miserable numbers, though, the Falcons 
trailed by just two at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
"We were feeling good, knowing that we weren't shooting free throws that well," 
Coach John Goffredo said. "We were thinking, 'Geez, we can win this thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
That thinking didn't last long: Crescenta Valley was outscored, 26-10, in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Goffredo, however, can take heart in the fact that next season, for the first 
time in his 11 years as coach, Crescenta Valley will have three returning 
starters: Forwards Bruce Jacobson and Paul Matijasevic and guard Lamar 
Breeding.

FOOD PARK PLANS IN GALLERIA WIN APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday approved a $1.8-million renovation 
and expansion of the Glendale Galleria Food Park to expand eating areas and 
provide outside dining. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new food service area will feature a colorful theme emphasizing 
California recreation and increase seating capacity by more than half, said 
Barbara Knight, acting redevelopment director. Present seating capacity is 350. 
</P>
<P>
A portion of the expansion will occupy space once held by Ohrbach's department 
store, which closed in July, 1987. Most of the space already has been converted 
into smaller shops. 
</P>
<P>
Agency approval is required for any renovation in the downtown redevelopment 
area exceeding $50,000, Knight said.

AFTER SUCCESSFUL SURGERY, BROWN READY TO LEAD THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chuck Brown of Thousand Oaks High had some nervous moments this week, but it 
had nothing to do with his girls' basketball playoff game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Brown underwent surgery to remove a blockage from an artery to his heart Monday 
at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks. He was released Tuesday 
and will coach the Lancers against Buena in a Southern Section 5-A Division 
quarterfinal at Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling really good," Brown said. "It wasn't painful. I was awake for the 
operation and I watched the whole thing on a TV monitor." 
</P>
<P>
The surgery performed on Brown is called angioplasty. Doctors inserted a tube 
into an artery in Brown's right leg and pushed it toward his heart. A balloon 
that is inserted in the tube expanded to open up the artery. Doctors removed 
two blockages. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he first felt a tightening in his chest during the Thousand Oaks 
holiday tournament in December. His doctor recommended that Brown take a 
treadmill test after the symptoms reoccured two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought my chest hurt because it was cold," Brown said. "When they 
discovered some abnormalities, I decided to have it further examined and then 
have the operation." 
</P>
<P>
Brown has been given a diet to cut down his cholesterol intake and will have to 
exercise more. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the players will be excited about that," he said. "Every time the 
players take a lap, I'll have to run with them." 
</P>
<P>
Talking up a victory: Thousand Oaks (23-4) has not beaten Buena (21-3) in five 
tries and tonight's game will be a rematch of last year's Southern Section 4-A 
Division quarterfinal game. 
</P>
<P>
Buena, the Channel League champion and the third-seeded team, has been forced 
to shuffle its lineup to compensate for a rash of injuries. Joannie Weinerth, 
who successfully moved from off-guard to point guard, leads the team in scoring 
with a 19.4 average. Mindy Huskey, a 5-foot-8 forward, has been the Bulldogs' 
most improved player and has averaged 13.9 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks, the Marmonte League champion, features Shani Smyth, Amy Chandler 
and Michelle Palmisano, a freshman who is the younger sister of former Buena 
standout Teresa Palmisano. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams received first-round byes and posted easy victories in the second 
round. Buena defeated Arroyo Grande, 59-34, and Thousand Oaks was a 68-53 
winner over Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks advanced to the quarterfinals for the first time last season 
before losing at Buena, 44-30. The Lancers are confident the outcome will be 
different this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad they've been talking about going out and beating Buena," Brown said. 
"We have been pretty much intimidated by them in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Record setters: Simi Valley point guard Keira Irwin recorded 14 assists in two 
playoff games last week to increase her season total to a school-record 163. 
Kate Templeton held the previous mark with 150 assists during 1980-81 season. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin needs three assists to set a school record for most assists in a career. 
Kristie Sterbens, who plays for Moorpark College, had 299 when she played at 
Simi Valley from 1984 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin gets a chance to do just that when Simi Valley (16-11) plays at Don Lugo 
(21-6) in a 5-AA Division game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Climbing the scoring ladder: Senior guard Shannon Solway has an outside chance 
to become Simi Valley fifth-leading all-time scorer. Solway needs 55 points to 
pass Paula Cooper. Cheri Graham is the school's all-time leading scorer with 
1,381 points. Solway scored 45 points in the Pioneers' two playoff games and is 
shooting 50% from the field (20 for 40). 
</P>
<P>
"She's been phenomenal," Simi Valley Coach Dave Murphy said. "The whole team 
has been shooting well. We're doing more than just posting up and making 
layups." 
</P>
<P>
Solway has the fourth-best scoring total in a season with 396 points. 
</P>
<P>
Graham had the two best seasons with 692 points in her junior year and 689 as a 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
Cut man: Buena Coach Joe Vaughan has spent so much time recently patching up 
his players that he's considering a career change. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Huskey hit her forehead on the tooth of teammate Jennifer Goodwin 
and needed stitches to repair a gash over her left eye. 
</P>
<P>
Against Brea-Olinda, Weinerth fell and bit through her lower lip. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking about becoming a fight doctor," Vaughan said. "The money those 
boxers make, they could use someone like me." 
</P>
<P>
Raging Regents: The Lancers are not the only good girls' basketball team from 
Thousand Oaks. La Reina (19-5), which won the Tri-Valley League, also has 
reached the quarterfinals and will play host to Twentynine Palms (19-5) 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The Regent lineup features a freshman, a sophomore, two juniors and a senior. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran of the group, Amy Alarian, averages 12.1 points and 6.5 rebounds a 
game. The 6-3 center has made a verbal commitment to attend Baylor next season. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Sasha Scardino leads the team in rebounding with an 8.5 average and 
sophomore point guard Heidi Heini has averaged six points and 3.6 assists. 
Junior Teri Fasching leads the team in steals with a 3.7 average and junior 
forward Heather Freeman is second in scoring (11.9) and rebounding (8.0). 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most balanced team I've ever had," Coach James Roach said. "It's 
been exciting to watch them come together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Not ready to pack yet: The St. Bonaventure boys' basketball team reached the 
playoffs for the fourth consecutive year and has won at least one postseason 
game for the third year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Clara knocked the Seraphs out of the playoffs with a convincing 77-53 
victory in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Marc Groff said he was pleased with his team's success, but worries that 
his program may never be good enough to compete with the likes of Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
"I've finally come to the conclusion that I don't like the new playoff format," 
Groff said. "I don't blame Santa Clara for competing in 2-A Division. But we 
need a few more athletes to compete with teams like that. We're a 1-A team 
competing in a division that's above our heads." 
</P>
<P>
Twist of fate: Teresa Palmisano, a former Buena High player who leads the Cal 
women's basketball team in scoring and rebounding, is expected to miss another 
week because of a badly sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Palmisano, who twisted her ankle in a recent game against Arizona State, is 
averaging 15.8 points and 8.9 rebounds a game. The 6-1 forward is shooting 
52.3% from the field and has converted 30 of 42 free throws (71.4%). 
</P>
<P>
Masters to meet on the mat: Robbie Cook and Tony Flores of Rio Mesa High and 
Delfino Ochoa of Hueneme earned Southern Section 3-A Division wrestling titles 
Saturday at West Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
Cook won the 132-pound class, Flores won at 191 and Ochoa was the champion at 
119. 
</P>
<P>
Each qualify for the Southern Section Masters Meet on Friday and Saturday at 
Fountain Valley High. Also qualifying were Ventura's Dana McCown (126) and John 
Atherton (98), Oxnard's Sual Juarez (105) and Buena's Chad Pisors (145). 
</P>
<P>
Dos Pueblos won the 3-A team championship; Rio Mesa was third. 
</P>
<P>
Leaping in the right direction: Chris Royers, a 6-4 freshman center for the 
Ventura College women's basketball team, averaged 15.5 rebounds this season to 
lead the Western State Conference. Royers is also one of the main reasons the 
Lady Pirates had the No. 2-ranked offense in the WSC. 
</P>
<P>
"She really is kind of awkward and gangly, but she has progressed a lot from 
where she started this season," Coach George Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura finished 19-10, 8-5 in the WSC.

ALL 3 COUNTY JC TEAMS TO BEGIN PLAYOFF ACTION IN MEN'S BASKETBALL

The Moorpark College basketball team had taken a wait-and-see attitude about 
making the playoffs all season. So it came as no surprise to Coach Al Nordquist 
that the Raiders were still waiting to find out about a postseason berth after 
finishing their regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
To Nordquist's relief, the wait ended Monday when Moorpark earned a berth to 
the Southern California regional junior college basketball playoffs after 
finishing 16-14, 6-8 in the Western State Conference. Ventura and Oxnard also 
made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Compton, the 11th-seeded team, plays host to 22nd-seeded Moorpark in a 
first-round game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark qualified for the playoffs for the first time in three years despite 
losing its last four games, including a 100-93 double-overtime loss to Ventura 
College on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had a good chance and I felt like we deserved to go to the 
playoffs," Nordquist said. "I think our overall record was good enough to get 
us in and our schedule was tougher this season." 
</P>
<P>
For Nordquist, who started the season with 11 new players on a 13-man squad, 
making the playoffs was especially gratifying. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with the way this team came together and played all year," 
Nordquist said. "We basically have players who are very average. There are no 
real superstars on this team." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders will make good use of their week off before the playoffs start. The 
time off will allow more time for freshman guard Bruce Watson's injured hand to 
heal. Watson, who averages 16 points to lead Moorpark in scoring, returned to 
the lineup against Ventura after missing two games because of a cut index 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce will be ready," Nordquist said. 
</P>
<P>
Compton (20-10, 10-4) placed second in the Southern California Conference. 
Sophomore forward Jerry Morgan is averaging 19.8 points a game to lead the 
Tartars in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard was in an even more uncertain position coming into this season than 
Moorpark. Coach Remy McCarthy took over a Condor team that finished 7-22 and 
won only one of 14 conference games last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Condors (19-11, 9-5) finished second in the WSC Northern Division behind 
Ventura, which has a first-round bye. Tenth-seeded Oxnard plays host to 
23rd-seeded Cypress (13-16, 5-7 in the Orange Empire Conference) Saturday at 7 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Condors' improvement, McCarthy is not satisfied at just making the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"With Oxnard not having a good season last year, you can look at making the 
playoffs as a victory," McCarthy said. "But I don't want to look at the 
playoffs like that. We can't be satisfied with just getting there. I want to 
win two or three." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Mike Price is averaging 19 points a game to lead Oxnard in scoring. Randy 
Carter is second at 18.4 points and is the Condors' leading rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress finished in a four-way tie for third in the Orange Empire Conference 
after losing its last three games. Andre Lamoureux, a 6-9 freshman forward, 
leads the team in scoring and rebounding. Lamoureux and Mike Varos, a 5-8 
guard, are each averaging 12.9 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress, which has won two state titles since 1977, is shooting 74% from the 
free-throw line. Ian Donnelly has made 95% of his free throws to lead Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, the WSC Northern Division champion, does not begin its state title 
quest until next week after drawing a first-round bye. The fifth-seeded Pirates 
(27-5, 12-2) will play the winner of the Rancho Santiago-Citrus game. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates advanced to only the second round of the state playoffs last season 
before losing to Palomar. Ventura won the 1986-87 state title. 
</P>
<P>
Six teams from the WSC advanced to the playoffs. The state finals will be held 
March 9-11 at Santa Clara University.

BUSH STARTS ASIA TRIP, SEES IT AS WAY TO BOOST U.S. ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ANCHORAGE, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush began a six-day Asian journey Wednesday to demonstrate that "we 
intend to stay a Pacific power" at a time of increased Soviet activity and 
shifting diplomatic currents throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
But even as he stressed the strength of U.S. ties in Asia, he gently prodded 
Japan to play a greater role in the common defense of the Far East, and 
pointedly ignored a celebration of U.S.-Soviet neighborliness taking place in 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The trip to Japan, China and South Korea was planned around the funeral Friday 
morning of Emperor Hirohito, the last of the World War II leaders, whose rites 
and burial are bringing representatives of 159 nations, including about 60 
heads of government or state, to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
But it also provides the President Bush an opportunity in the early days of his 
administration "to reaffirm that the United States plans to play a strong and 
affirmative role as an Asian power," and that its influence in the region is 
not declining, said Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, speaking to Alaskans assembled in a massive hangar at Elmendorf Air Force 
Base in Anchorage while Air Force One was refueled nearby, said that even as 
the United States reviews its relations with the Soviets, in the Middle East 
and in Latin America, "We don't ever want to take our friends for granted, be 
they China, be they Japan, be they Korea." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, things in the Pacific seem to be going reasonably well," said the 
president, who is being accompanied on the journey by his wife, Barbara. "But 
we are a Pacific power and this visit will demonstrate that we intend to stay a 
Pacific power." 
</P>
<P>
In the U.S.-Chinese relationship, he said, "There is something more than 
symbolism. That relationship is fundamental in any foreign policy equation of 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"Alaskans understand that America is as much a Pacific nation as it is an 
Atlantic one -- and that the Pacific region is of great and growing importance 
in international affairs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saluting the strength of the U.S. relationship with all three countries he will 
visit before returning to Washington Monday, Bush said he seeks by his trip to 
Tokyo to show his respect for Japan as "a valued ally and a fellow democracy." 
</P>
<P>
However, in other remarks, there was a hint of the undercurrent of tension that 
often marks U.S.-Japanese relations. 
</P>
<P>
In written answers provided to questions submitted by the Kyodo News Service of 
Japan, the president acknowledged "Japan's continued and steady progress in 
improving its defense capability," long a point of prodding by the United 
States. But he offered the reminder that "there is still room for greater 
improvement, especially in the area of sustainability" -- the crucial military 
ability to maintain long supply lines from home bases to units operating in the 
field, or in the case of Japan, at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft told reporters Tuesday that in the meetings with Prime Minister 
Noboru Takeshita, Bush would raise the question of how Japan can increase its 
contribution, "whether it's through their own defense expenditures, whether 
it's through helping mutual allies with security." 
</P>
<P>
The new national security adviser accompanied the President, along with 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
In his Anchorage remarks, Bush said that in China, he hoped "to build on the 
friendly, stable and enduring relationship that now exists." 
</P>
<P>
He described South Korea as a nation "where democratic institutions are gaining 
strength each day." 
</P>
<P>
"At each stop, I aim to strengthen key relationships with our friends and 
partners in the Pacific region," the president said. 
</P>
<P>
In at least one respect, however, the Bush administration has been moving 
slowly to develop its ties to the region: The president has yet to formally 
send to the Senate his nominations of U.S. ambassadors to Japan, China and 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bush made no reference to the evolving Soviet interest in the 
Pacific, or to the emerging contacts between Alaskans and residents of the 
Soviet Far East across the narrow Bering Strait. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, in a message directed to the sizable contingent of U.S. military forces 
personnel stationed in the far north, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"Make no mistake about it -- the importance of your task. Alaska's strategic 
position -- at the point where the Far East, the Western Hemisphere and the 
arctic meet, is proof enough that the missions you perform here are vital to 
our national security." 
</P>
<P>
"You are the forward edge, the cutting edge, if you will, of our national 
defense. We rely on you to keep the watch, to hold the line," he said. As a 
sentry along the polar approach to the rest of the United States, Alaska is 
home to Air Force, Navy and Army Bases, whose missions include continental 
defenses against bombers, anti-submarine warfare, and intercepting Soviet and 
Chinese communications. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Bush paid his 90-minute visit to Alaska at the mid-point of his 
15-hour, 7,050-mile journey from Washington to Tokyo, 90 Soviet visitors were 
paying a week-long visit, staying in local homes, fielding questions at public 
schools, and celebrating the more open borders in a region of the world where 
distrust and hostility had reigned. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials said the center of the activities was too far away to 
allow Bush to take part during his brief stop. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two years, U.S. officials have been watching with interest as the 
Soviets have paid ever greater attention to the Pacific, beginning with a 
speech Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev delivered in July, 1986, in 
Vladivostok. At that time, he touted the "considerable opportunities . . . in 
the Far East and in the Pacific" for "peaceful, good-neighborly relations and 
for mutually beneficial cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and efforts to pull 
Vietnamese troops out of Cambodia have led to a sharp improvement in 
Sino-Soviet relations and the announcement in early February that Gorbachev 
would visit Beijing, probably in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects of the Sino-Soviet summit loom large in the politics of the 
region, just as the start of the Bush Administration has left Asians curious 
about the future of U.S. policies. 
</P>
<P>
The President's decision to visit China before Gorbachev gets there, said one 
U.S. official, demonstrates to the Chinese "that the American commitment is 
real." 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to feel Bush out. The Chinese don't have a very good feel for 
these (new) people," said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

TRACY CHAPMAN SCORES BUT MISSES A GRAMMY RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tracy Chapman was derailed Wednesday in her bid to become the most honored 
debut artist in the 31-year history of the record industry's Grammy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
The singer-songwriter, whose folk-flavored tales about society's underclass 
scored critical and commercial triumphs in 1988, won Grammys for best new 
artist, contemporary folk recording and female pop vocal. 
</P>
<P>
But Chapman lost to Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy" in the best song 
category, eliminating any chance that she could break the record of five 
Grammys set in 1980 by Christopher Cross' debut album. 
</P>
<P>
The folk award was among 61 announced during a pre-telecast ceremony at the 
Shrine Auditorium, site of the nationally televised event sponsored by the 
6,000-member National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists who picked up multiple awards during the pre-telecast affair were 
Anita Baker, best female rhythm and blues vocal and best rhythm and blues song; 
the Irish rock band U2, saluted for rock group vocal and music performance 
video; Robin Williams, children's recording and comedy recording; Robert Shaw 
and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, classical album, orchestral recording and 
choral recording, and Sir Georg Solti, opera recording and chamber music. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with his best song victory, McFerrin's award Wednesday for best male 
pop vocal was his seventh Grammy citation since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The country mother-and-daughter team The Judds were honored for best country 
vocal by a duo or group for their recording of "Give a Little Love." It was 
their fourth victory in that category in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
The late Roy Orbison won his second career Grammy, cited for his country vocal 
collaboration with k.d. Lang on a remake of his own '60s hit, "Crying." 
</P>
<P>
After accepting the award for her husband, who died of a heart attack on Dec. 
6, Barbara Orbison said backstage, "Roy was so fortunate to have felt the love 
of the fans and the whole world before he passed on." 
</P>
<P>
On a lighter note, veteran blues man Willie Dixon, whose win in the best 
traditional blues recording category was his first Grammy ever, quipped to the 
press backstage, "Better late than never. I give in and I give out, but I don't 
give up." 
</P>
<P>
As the pre-telecast awards were announced inside the auditorium, about 350 fans 
waited outside the Shrine, hoping to catch glimpses of the recording stars as 
they entered the building. Unlike the Oscars, where film personalities make a 
big splash by entering the building through the front door, most of the 
performers and big-name guests at the Grammys enter the building through a 
backstage area that is blocked off to fans. 
</P>
<P>
Once the telecast began inside the hall, Chapman's quest to break Cross' 1980 
record provided the most drama. (The record for most Grammys in a single 
evening was eight, a mark achieved in 1984 by Michael Jackson.) 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's pop female vocal award was the first award announced on the program, 
and the singer accepted the Grammy with the same shy, retiring manner that 
characterizes her concert appearances. She later returned to the stage to be 
acknowledged as the best new artist. 
</P>
<P>
Until her Elektra album was released last spring, Cleveland-born Chapman, now 
24, was little known outside the club circuit in Boston, where she was living 
while attending Tufts University. 
</P>
<P>
Because the stark realism in her themes -- many of which deal with such 
subjects as welfare mothers and children victimized by racism -- is so far from 
the upbeat, dance-minded music that has dominated Top 40 radio station play 
lists in recent years, Chapman's album was considered a commercial long shot 
when it was released. 
</P>
<P>
But the reaction was dramatic: glowing reviews and album sales of more than 2 
million. Chapman climaxed her remarkable year by co-starring with Bruce 
Springsteen and Sting on Amnesty International's worldwide "Human Rights Now!" 
tour last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Her most popular song, "Fast Car," was a look at a woman's struggle to break 
free of emotional and economic bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The single was up Wednesday for best record. Chapman was also nominated for 
best album, song and new artist. 
</P>
<P>
Though the music academy has made great strides in recent years in reducing 
criticism for being out of touch with "cutting edge" elements in pop music, 
there was one embarrassment Wednesday when three nominees in the newly 
established rap category said they were boycotting the show because the rap 
award was not included among the 15 awards announced during the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
Will Smith, the Fresh Prince of rap duo D. J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh 
Prince, said at an afternoon press conference in West Hollywood: "We're not 
anti-Grammy. Our problem is with the 1989 Grammy Awards show. It's like you go 
to school for 12 years and they give you a diploma, but you aren't allowed to 
walk down the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we got F's through school; we got straight A's," he said, 
referring to the group's artistic and sales credentials. The duo's latest 
album, "He's the D. J., I'm the Rapper," has sold more than 2 million copies. 
Also not attending the ceremony: rap nominees Salt-N-Pepa and L. L. Cool J. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, D. J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince won the rap award. 
</P>
<P>
First time winners in jazz included Take 6 (group vocal), Betty Carter (female 
vocal), Michael Brecker (solo instrumental). Others winning Grammys for the 
first time included Carlos Santana (rock instrumental), Bill Monroe 
(bluegrass), Shadowfax (new age recording), Roberto Carlos (Latin pop 
performance), Ziggy Marley &amp; the Melody Makers (reggae). 
</P>
<P>
Repeat winners: Robert Palmer, named best rock vocalist for the second time; 
Amy Grant, female gospel performance, her fifth award; Larnelle Harris, male 
gospel performance, fifth award; David Sanborn, pop instrumental, fifth award; 
Robert Cray Band, contemporary blues recording, third award. 
</P>
<P>
"Into the Woods" was judged best musical cast show album, while Mike Post's 
"The Theme From L.A. Law" was named best instrumental composition. "The Last 
Emperor" was voted best album of original musical score written for a motion 
picture or television. Phil Collins' "Two Hearts" was named best song written 
for a motion picture or television. 
</P>

A 91-year-old woman wandered away from her San Francisco home and spent four 
days on the streets without food or water before a state transportation worker 
saw her walking under a freeway overpass and took her to a local police 
station. Dirty, tired and dehydrated, Modesta Montez Curiel "drank about a 
gallon of water just like that," Police Officer Alan Siegel said. Police said 
the 100-pound woman had apparently slept in nooks below the overpass about a 
mile from her daughter's home after becoming disoriented and lost.

Several dry winters and a series of fires are believed to have sent coyotes in 
record numbers onto Solano County ranchlands in search of prey, according to 
landowners. Richard Emigh, owner of one of the largest sheep ranches in the 
area, said coyotes have killed about 60 of his lambs, worth a total of $10,000. 
County agricultural officials said the animals caused an estimated $44,000 in 
damage to livestock and equipment in 1986-87, the last period for which figures 
were available. That figure is $7,000 more than the previous comparable period. 
It also is expected to grow for the next year.

A Philippine commission tracking the wealth of former President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos, his family and associates said it filed graft and corruption charges 
against Marcos' brother-in-law. The Presidential Commission on Good Government 
said it filed criminal charges against Benjamin Romualdez, younger brother of 
Marcos' wife, Imelda, for having amassed about $280,000 by holding four 
government posts at the same time for 10 years. In the first criminal case 
filed against a Marcos relative, Romualdez is also facing civil charges in 
connection with the recovery of the estimated $10 billion alleged to have been 
plundered by Marcos during his 20-year rule. However, the whereabouts of 
Romualdez, who fled to the United States when Marcos was overthrown, is not 
known.

A 17-year-old boy killed by an Escondido police officer after the two allegedly 
struggled for the officer's gun was shot 14 times, according to a San Diego 
County coroner's autopsy report. The Police Department had said Robert Scriven 
of Escondido was shot at least 11 times, based on the number of bullets 
recovered during the autopsy. Officer Martin Hewlett had chased the car theft 
suspect into a field on Jan. 2. The two fought, with Hewlett ending up on his 
back with the Scriven over him, according to police reports. Hewlett fired 15 
rounds from the semi-automatic weapon that carried 16 bullets, police said. 
Scriven's death sparked a controversy because of the number of times he was 
shot. The district attorney's office is reviewing the case, which is customary 
when a police officer is involved in a fatal shooting. The Escondido Police 
Department will do its own review.

Capt. Alexander G. Balian, ending his testimony at his court-martial in the 
Philippines, said that any Navy captain who encounters refugees at sea in the 
future "would be stupid" if he doesn't pick them up. Balian, 48, is charged 
with dereliction of duty for failing to rescue a group of Vietnamese refugees 
last June 9 in the South China Sea who later resorted to cannibalism before 
being rescued by Filipino fishermen after 37 days at sea. In the wake of that 
incident, Vice Adm. George W. Davis Jr., then commander of the Pacific fleet, 
sent a letter telling captains that assisting those in distress in peacetime 
takes precedence over any other commitment. Balian alluded to that directive in 
saying it would be "stupid" to pass up refugees.

The AFL-CIO will hold "Worker Memorial Day" ceremonies in several cities across 
the country on April 28, the 18th anniversary of the Occupational Safety and 
Health Act, to pay homage to the thousands of workers who have been killed or 
injured or contracted diseases on the job each year. Among the sites of rallies 
will be Henderson, Nev., where two people were killed and 250 injured in a 
mammoth blast that leveled a plant making rocket fuel last year; Bridgeport, 
Conn., where 28 workers were killed in the collapse of a high-rise building 
under construction in 1987, and Cincinnati, which is near an Energy Department 
nuclear fuel processing plant where workers daily face the possibility of 
exposure to radioactive materials, said Margaret Seminario, the AFL-CIO's 
health and safety director.

Officials in San Joaquin County and the Santa Clara Valley are taking steps to 
reduce water use in the face of continuing drought conditions that have lowered 
reservoir levels. In San Joaquin County, a local water emergency has been 
declared, and officials say rationing may be ordered later if voluntary 
conservation fails. In the Santa Clara Valley, water district officials warn 
that they may reduce or suspend pumping ground water if water customers do not 
cut back their use by 45%. The threat -- immediately criticized as too drastic 
-- was issued in an unprecedented drought response plan adopted by the Santa 
Clara Valley Water District. "What (the water district) is recommending sounds 
as dangerous as the drought," San Jose Vice Mayor Blanca Alvarado said. About a 
dozen cities and private water companies in the Santa Clara Valley get part or 
all of their water from ground water sold by the Santa Clara Valley Water 
District.

REPORT SEEKS CHANGES IN TEACHING OF SCIENCE, MATH

There has been a chorus of warnings that the United States suffers from poor 
math and science teaching. Now America's largest scientific organization has 
come forward with a plan for reform. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that "America has no more urgent priority," the American Assn. for 
the Advancement of Science envisions "sweeping changes" in the way Americans 
learn science and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
A report, "Science for All Americans," to be released today in Washington, is 
the first phase of that effort. Prepared by the National Council on Science and 
Technology, which is sponsored by the science association, it lays out the kind 
of education Americans will need, at minimum, to live and work effectively in 
the 21st Century. Three other recent reports have already highlighted the 
education deficit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rated Lowest 
</P>
<P>
"A World of Differences" by the Educational Testing Service assessed 24,000 
13-year-olds in six nations. It showed South Koreans leading in math skills, 
followed in order by Ireland, England, Canada and Spain, with the United States 
trailing. A University of Michigan survey of first- and fifth-graders in 
Chicago and Beijing found Americans doing significantly worse in math than 
Chinese students. 
</P>
<P>
The National Research Council, representing the National Academies of Science 
and Engineering, assessed American math education and found it seriously 
wanting. Its "Everybody Counts" report warned starkly: "Wake up, America! Your 
children are at risk." 
</P>
<P>
The National Council on Science and Technology said, "It will take a shared 
national vision of what Americans want their schools to achieve" to remedy this 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
That is what this new report is all about. In it, the 26 members of the 
National Council recommend a common education core on which to base curriculums 
from kindergarten through high school. They start by defining their educational 
goal of scientific literacy. It includes: 
</P>
<P>
* "Being familiar with the natural world and recognizing both its diversity and 
its unity. 
</P>
<P>
* "Understanding key concepts and principles of science. 
</P>
<P>
* "Being aware of some of the important ways in which science, mathematics and 
technology depend upon one another. 
</P>
<P>
* "Knowing that science, mathematics and technology are human enterprises and 
knowing what that implies about their strengths and limitations. 
</P>
<P>
* "Having a capacity for scientific ways of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
* "Using scientific knowledge and ways of thinking for individual and social 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
The council wants schools to teach old subjects in new ways that emphasize the 
connections rather than the boundaries between different areas of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"Transformations of energy, for example, occur in physical, biological and 
technological systems, and evolutionary change appears in stars, organisms and 
societies," the report notes. 
</P>
<P>
It says science education should emphasize ideas and thinking skills at the 
expense of specialized vocabulary and memorized procedures. This echoes the 
National Research Council's views on math education. The National Research 
Council also gives priority to thinking skills and to grasping mathematical 
concepts that transcend computation, which is done mostly by machines. 
</P>
<P>
The new goal-defining report is the first phase of a long-term program called 
Project 2061. That's the year Halley's comet returns. The science association 
organized its National Council on Science and Technology in 1985, when the 
comet last appeared, and named the program in its honor. 
</P>
<P>
The program's second phase will develop experimental curriculums in selected 
school districts over the next few years. Project director F. James Rutherford 
said that San Antonio, San Diego and San Francisco districts have already 
agreed to participate. 
</P>
<P>
The final phase will be an effort extended over a decade or more to spread the 
new science and math education throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The American Assn. for the Advancement of Science is an umbrella group to which 
most American scientific and science education societies belong. Its 
geographically and professionally diverse membership is expected to help 
implement this program nationwide.

President Bush, on his visit to Beijing this weekend, will meet with Cambodian 
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk on efforts to end the country's 
decade-old guerrilla war, diplomatic sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, after attending the funeral of Emperor Hirohito in Japan, plans to make a 
40-hour visit to China, and then stop for several hours in South Korea on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who arrives Saturday afternoon in Beijing for a hectic series of meetings 
with Chinese leaders, will stay in a villa at the Diaoyutai state guest house 
on Beijing's west side. Sihanouk is currently staying at the same guest house 
in a villa nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk, the former Cambodian leader, heads the three-faction resistance 
coalition that has fought a guerrilla war against Vietnam since the Vietnamese 
invaded Cambodia in December, 1978, and installed a puppet government in Phnom 
Penh.

FAILURE TO NAME CENTER FOR KING RAPPED

<P>
Some City Council members Wednesday criticized the Port Commission's refusal to 
consider naming San Diego's new convention center for the Rev. Martin Luther 
King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the commission avoided a vote on renaming the convention center, 
instead voting 4-3 to endorse the idea of an Avenue of Honors at the facility 
as tribute to King and others. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand that they wanted to find a compromise," City Councilman Wes 
Pratt said. "But what they did simply begged the question. They should have 
addressed the issue first and then moved on the compromise." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Insufficient Tribute' 
</P>
<P>
"The Avenue of Honors idea is an insufficient tribute in light of what we were 
trying to do," said Pratt, the only black member of the council. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise proposal will be sent for consideration to the City Council, 
which voted 7-2 last month to rename the center the San Diego Martin Luther 
King Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Any change in the name of the $160-million San Diego Convention Center name 
must be approved by the Port Commission as well as the city because the Port 
District owns the land where the center is being built. Completion is set for 
October. 
</P>
<P>
The city has struggled with a way of honoring King since voters in 1987 decided 
to strip his name from a downtown street and return it to its original name, 
Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor Maureen O'Connor, said she was "very 
disappointed in the port's vote . . . (and will do) whatever is necessary to 
keep the community from becoming more divided." 
</P>
<P>
If council members again recommend naming the entire facility after King, the 
matter will return to the Port Commission. One commissioner who backed the 
proposal by Chula Vista colleague Robert Penner said he will change his vote 
and support renaming the center if that happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I will support whatever the City Council decides to do, but I think they 
deserve the opportunity to discuss this (port) proposal," Commissioner Daniel 
Larsen of San Diego said. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen, who previously said he would support the council's action, explained 
that he was persuaded to change his position by a petition and letter-writing 
campaign opposing the renaming of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
While King would be the first person inducted into the Avenue of Honors, the 
proposal calls on officials of the Port District and San Diego city and county 
to develop a process for selecting others. 
</P>
<P>
The Port Commission decision upset many of the city's black leaders, including 
the Rev. George Stevens, who afterward called for an informal boycott of the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Those opposed to changing the center's name, however, called the port's 
counterproposal a fitting compromise to an emotionally charged issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased," said Robert Pruett, leader of the Citizens to Keep the 
Name San Diego Convention Center, which presented commissioners with a petition 
signed by 4,769 people. 
</P>
<P>
The group has also threatened to initiate a referendum drive to reverse the 
name change if it is ultimately approved by the port and city.

COUNTY ADMITS ERROR IN VEHICLE PACT; 
</P>
<P>
KEY ELEMENT OMITTED IN CONTRACT FOR REPAIRS WITH PRIVATE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials admit they erred in drawing up a key section of 
their biggest-ever privatization contract, a mistake that could lead to loss of 
control over costs on the $50-million motor vehicle repair contract, The Times 
has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The cost-control section that was to have set limits on repair costs was 
inadvertently omitted from the contract awarded last July to Holmes and Narver 
Services Inc. of Orange, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the Board of Supervisors, county officials had promised 
that Holmes and Narver Services would be required to absorb the costs of 
repairs per vehicle up to certain agreed upon amounts no matter how often the 
vehicle went in for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
But, because of an oversight, specific limits were never written into the 
contracts. As a result, whereas the contractor agreed to make repairs of up to 
$1,500 per vehicle, there is no contract language specifying whether the 
ceiling amount applies to one trip to the garage for a given vehicle or to 
indefinite repair jobs for the life of the five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attempt to Save Money 
</P>
<P>
One reason for awarding a contract was so the county would know from year to 
year how much vehicle maintenance costs would run. But with no clear contract 
obligations spelled out on the question of repeat repair work, the overall 
price tag for maintaining the county's 6,500 vehicles is cast in doubt. One 
justification for turning the work over to private enterprise was that it would 
save the county money. 
</P>
<P>
Though the county has suffered no cash losses so far, its contracting omission 
should immediately raise danger flags, according to the head of a trade 
association representing firms doing business with government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Engebretson, president of the Washington-based Contract Services Assn. of 
America, termed the cost-control section in the Los Angeles County contract 
"very poorly written" and said such errors can lead to costly conflicts between 
government and private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime a government entity does not make its specifications clear, it creates 
problems," Engebretson said. The cost-control section of the county contract 
with the vehicle maintenance company "needs to be cleaned up," he added. 
</P>
<P>
County officials at first insisted that the cost-control language existed in 
the contract or other documents. After searching their files, however, they 
conceded that it had been left out. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only mistake we made," said Jerry Lee, deputy director of the 
county's Facilities Management Department that negotiated the contract. He 
added, "It hasn't been an issue to date." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gray Area' 
</P>
<P>
Whether the company can bill the county more for multiple repair jobs, said Lee 
McIntire, vice president of Holmes and Narver Services, is a "gray area." 
</P>
<P>
Similar contract confusion exists for accidents to county vehicles. Holmes and 
Narver Services is supposed to absorb the first $2,500 in damage repair costs. 
Again, the county meant it to apply each time a vehicle was damaged, but 
officials neglected to write that into the contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Material' 
</P>
<P>
William F. Stewart, deputy chief administrative officer, said he wishes that 
the contract had clearly spelled out the terms but the issue "is not material 
at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the contract difficulties, the county has been beset by major backlogs 
of vehicles tied up for repairs ever since Holmes and Narver Services began 
work Oct. 1. Overall, the backlog has often been worse than when county workers 
did the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have given the private firm until Wednesday to meet contract 
terms for both the backlog and installation of a computer system for tracking 
the vehicles and work performed on them. Officials said they have already begun 
estimating fines due the county from Holmes and Narver Services for failure to 
meet contract conditions.

<P>
The three conservative members of the Board of Supervisors who have backed 
privatization programs could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The two liberal members were predictably critical. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation Sought 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, an opponent of turning the automotive repairs over to 
private enterprise, has asked the board to consider ordering a full 
investigation of the contract when it meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
But Hahn and the board's other critic of the contract, Chairman Ed Edelman, 
have repeatedly been outvoted by the three-member conservative majority on 
privatization issues. 
</P>
<P>
"You get what you pay for," Edelman said Wednesday. "I have great doubts about 
contracting out in general. The employees you get are not as qualified (as 
county workers) because you pay them a lot less." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Edelman said, even as board chairman he does not feel the 
departments keep him well informed on problems that arise. Under pressure from 
the board's majority to find work that can go to private industry, Edelman said 
when trouble arises with contractors, department heads "don't want to raise the 
flag of distress."

CITY TO TEST 6 SITES FOR PICKUP OF LABORERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council agreed Wednesday to create six alternative hiring 
sites for day laborers as part of a six-month pilot project to get the 
immigrant workers off street corners. 
</P>
<P>
If the pilot project is successful, the council also agreed to create hiring 
sites in each of the city's 15 council districts in what would be the nation's 
most sweeping effort to regulate itinerant immigrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants rights groups hailed the decision and praised Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores for withdrawing a proposed ordinance that would have banned day 
laborers from soliciting work on city streets. Many unanswered questions 
remain, however, as to how the program would actually work. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said thousands of men look for work on Los Angeles streets each 
morning, an increase since the 1986 federal immigration law made it illegal for 
employers to hire undocumented immigrants. Council members said they have 
received complaints about the workers from residents and merchants in Pacoima, 
Koreatown, West Los Angeles and other parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Great Start' 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great start, a model program" said Father Tom Smolich of the Dolores 
Mission and coordinator of an adopt-a-corner program to organize day laborers 
throughout the city. "We're glad that there is this positive sense of helping 
people, rather than arresting people and running them off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Flores last month proposed a ban on workers soliciting employment on street 
corners after Harbor City residents and merchants complained about groups of up 
to 100 men blocking streets and harassing customers. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants groups argued that the proposal would violate the workers' 
constitutional right to freedom of assembly and deprive them of their 
livelihood. But after meeting with representatives of the Coalition for Humane 
Immigrants Rights of Los Angeles and other groups last week, Flores agreed to 
withdraw the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that a complete ban would work because it would just move people 
to other areas," Flores said at a press conference before the council meeting 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
She then asked the council to establish two alternative hiring sites, one of 
which would be in Harbor City. But Councilman Joel Wachs called for setting up 
six hiring sites during a six-month trial period and a total of 15 sites if the 
trial program is successful. His proposal was adopted on vote of 15 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
Other council members praised Flores for reaching a compromise that would 
address community complaints while allowing the immigrants to solicit work. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo said the workers "are not out there just to commit 
crimes (or) to be on welfare; they're out there to look for a day's work," 
while Councilman Richard Alatorre called the proposed trial program "a fair 
compromise on a difficult issue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consultant Needed 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's action calls for the Community Development Department to hire a 
consultant to conduct a study of sites where the day laborers could look for 
work away from the dangers and problems of the street. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Flores' office said that it would be at least four weeks 
before the hiring sites could begin operating. The council offered no criteria 
on how to select the sites, or whether neighborhood groups would have a veto. 
The council allocated $90,000 in general funds for the program. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative hiring sites for day laborers were created last year in Costa Mesa 
and Glendale, where about 50 workers gather in search of employment each 
morning at a Catholic Youth Organization preschool. The Costa Mesa site is open 
only to day laborers with work permits, while all workers can look for work at 
the Glendale site, regardless of their immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said before the council meeting that the workers at the pilot sites 
would not be asked if they have work permits. "The sites will be open to anyone 
who is looking for work or workers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More May Be Needed 
</P>
<P>
Father Smolich said that more hiring sites may be needed eventually because 
there are thousands of men looking for work in the city. "To deal with it 
properly is going to take more than a few alternative sites," he said. "I hope 
the city is going to talk with the various organizations that have been 
involved with the day laborers. I know that we're all willing to help." 
</P>
<P>
The council took the action after a 90-minute public hearing in which a dozen 
Harbor City residents and merchants complained that the day laborers had become 
an intolerable nuisance in their community. 
</P>
<P>
"We've become prisoners in our own neighborhood," said Kay Kaplan, who 
complained about men gathering on the front lawn of her home. 
</P>
<P>
"Any car that comes to the intersection is completely surrounded by people," 
said Steven Tillack, owner of an auto restoration shop on Pacific Coast Highway 
near Normandie Avenue. "The numbers have increased dramatically over the past 
few months." 
</P>
<P>
About 40 day laborers also attended the council meeting, most sitting quietly 
in benches at the rear of the council chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to thank Mrs. Flores for recognizing her mistake," Gabriel 
Valdes, 22, a native of Mexico, told the council through an interpreter. Valdes 
said he represented workers who seek shelter at the Dolores Mission in East Los 
Angeles. "We will protest any law that will violate our rights," he said.

6 INJURED IN BLAST AT GRAPHICS FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six people were hurt late Wednesday afternoon when a cylinder of gaseous 
ammonia apparently exploded at a West Los Angeles graphics firm, forcing the 
evacuation of the 2000 block of Pontius Avenue. Two of the injured had facial 
burns but none of the six were seriously hurt, according to city firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Five employees and a policeman were hurt when fumes sprayed from a 4-foot 
cylinder after it either exploded or lost a valve at Westlake Graphics. 
Neighboring businesses were evacuated and the block was roped off about an hour 
while a hazardous materials team from the city Fire Department cleaned up the 
scene.

SUIT AGAINST CHURCH TAKEN TO HIGH COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Tujunga couple who contended in a lawsuit that a Sun Valley church is guilty 
of "clergy malpractice" in the 1979 suicide of their son have appealed the case 
to the U.S. Supreme Court, their attorney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Allen P. Wilkinson, attorney for Walter and Maria Nally, said a petition was 
filed Tuesday asking the Supreme Court to review the suit, whose claims were 
rejected by the California Supreme Court in November. 
</P>
<P>
The family maintains that Grace Community Church pastors, who were providing 
24-year-old Kenneth Nally with spiritual counseling for his depression, should 
be held liable for his suicide. But the state Supreme Court ruled Nov. 27 that 
church pastors should be "free from state-imposed counseling standards." 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson said that the constitutional right of religious freedom should not 
protect a church and its pastors from responsibility in counseling members. 
</P>
<P>
David A. Cooksey, an attorney for the church, said he had not seen the petition 
filed with the high court, but maintained that the case involves state and not 
federal issues. "With the U.S. Supreme Court we have now, I don't think it will 
touch this case," Cooksey said.

NURSE STOPS TO AID MAN, IS FATALLY SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 40-year-old private nurse who stopped her car in the Hollywood Hills, 
apparently to help a man she saw lying in the street, was fatally shot 
Wednesday when the man got up and pulled out a gun, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made in what police described as the ambush killing. The nurse, 
Lucille Marie Warren, was shot at 6:45 a.m. in an exclusive section of Woodrow 
Wilson Drive. She was on her way home to Inglewood after leaving a house where 
she was working as a night nurse, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said there were indications that the woman may have known her 
killer. Detectives were investigating whether Warren, who was divorced and 
lived with her two teen-age children, was involved in any personal disputes 
that could have led to the shooting, Detective Mike Coffey said. "This doesn't 
appear to be a random encounter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the killer may have been lying in the street because he knew Warren 
was approaching and would stop if she thought someone needed help.

POWER OUTAGE HITS DURING RUSH HOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of Pasadena was without electricity for up to two hours Wednesday night 
during a power outage that apparently was caused by a faulty switch controlling 
a main high-voltage transmission line, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The outage affected about 80 percent of city residents and knocked out traffic 
lights through a large swath of the city at the height of rush hour. Police 
officers were stationed at major intersections to direct traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Bruce A. Linsenmayer said police received scores of calls, but none 
amounted to anything serious. 
</P>
<P>
"No injuries, no traffic accidents, nothing -- and it happened right at prime 
time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
David C. Plumb, general manager of Pasadena's Water and Power Department, said 
the switch shut down a 230-kilovolt transmission line for just a few seconds. 
But the power loss caused a chain reaction that disrupted other power lines 
connected to the system. 
</P>
<P>
Plumb said the department is still unsure what caused the switching problem. 
</P>
<P>
Workers began restoring power soon after the lines shut down and had power back 
to all homes by 6:45 p.m. There are approximately 50,000 homes in the city.

EDDIE IS READY;

<P>
MURRAY HAS A NEW LEASE ON LIFE AT DODGERTOWN THIS SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

VERO BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His first day of spring training, and a World Series hero was reminded anew of 
the fleeting nature of fame. Batting practice was about to begin Wednesday 
morning in Holman Stadium, centerpiece of Dodgertown, but there was Mickey 
Hatcher, preparing to take a hike to an auxiliary diamond. 
</P>
<P>
"Skip, we'll be over at our field in the Everglades," Hatcher informed Manager 
Tom Lasorda as he clambered through the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the area code?" Hatcher said, repeating Lasorda's shouted question and 
triggering a ripple of laughter from the tourists in attendance. "We don't have 
one. No phones. No electricity." 
</P>
<P>
On this sun-kissed day, Hatcher was resigned to being a sideshow, a Stuntman in 
waiting. All eyes this morning were on the newest Dodger: Eddie Murray, No. 33 
on scorecards yet to be printed, a prodigal sultan of swing come home at last. 
</P>
<P>
Mustachioed and muscular, with only the trace of an expanded waistline, Murray 
picked up one of his 35 1/2-inch, 34-ounce bats and eased into the batting cage 
for his first cuts as a member of a big league team that doesn't wear Orioles 
on the bills of its caps. 
</P>
<P>
"Bunt two," Murray called to Bill Russell, the Dodger coach who was pitching 
this round of batting practice from behind a protective screen. 
</P>
<P>
Russell nearly froze in mid-delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to bunt?" Russell said. "You bat fourth and you're going to bunt 
two?" 
</P>
<P>
Even Murray had to chuckle at the absurdity of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I want you to know I haven't bunted in 12 years," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
And he didn't begin Wednesday, either. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dempsey, familiar with Murray's act from Baltimore, where they were Oriole 
teammates for 10 seasons, leaned on one side of the cage, a mischievous gleam 
in his eye. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to let every pitcher in the National League know that Eddie Murray 
thinks they're wimps," Dempsey loudly announced. "Then, when they throw at him, 
that's when you want to see Eddie Murray hit." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire had been waiting almost two years to see Eddie Murray hit as a 
Dodger, and though Murray's first swings were more feeble than fearsome, the 
Dodger executive vice president made no effort to hide his elation. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't feel more positive about it," said Claire, sounding comfortable in his 
third full season of running the club. 
</P>
<P>
"Every sign is there for Eddie Murray to have a great season and a great career 
for the Dodgers. This is just Page 1 of hundreds of thousands of pages of his 
career as a Dodger." 
</P>
<P>
Claire said that the Orioles had offered the switch-hitting Murray to the 
Dodgers in Dallas during the winter meetings after the 1987 season, but had 
asked for too much in return for the Los Angeles native. And at the time, the 
Dodgers' top priorities were to find a shortstop and a top-notch reliever, 
needs that were satisfied by the trade for Jay Howell and Alfredo Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
But in both '87 and '88, Claire said, all of the Dodgers' big league scouts -- 
Mel Didier, Jerry Stephenson, Phil Regan, and Steve Boros -- had plotted the 
first baseman's play, and he even sent a minor league scout, Gib Bodet, to 
offer his perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I still remember Gib telling me: 'Fred, this fella's bat speed is tremendous,' 
" Claire said. "We had a pretty good summary -- two years of background -- on 
Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
A deal almost was made last August, Claire said, before the teams finally 
agreed last December, Murray coming to the Dodgers for relief pitcher Brian 
Holton, starter-reliever Ken Howell and top minor league prospect Juan Bell. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a winning player, a player who has been a force driving a team to a 
championship," said Claire, citing Murray's World Series experience in both 
1979 and '83. "He'll be able to move right into a winning atmosphere here." 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who had arrived Tuesday evening, got his first taste of the Dodgertown 
atmosphere at breakfast, joining Lasorda at the manager's invitation. 
</P>
<P>
"He's happy, really enthused," said Lasorda, who isn't exactly blase about 
adding a guy who has averaged almost 100 RBIs and 28 home runs a season. 
</P>
<P>
"Murray's the kind of guy I'm looking forward to seeing hitting the ball out of 
the ballpark. That's what a No. 4 hitter is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't say how many (home runs) I want him to hit. I just want him to hit as 
many as he can." 
</P>
<P>
Murray sounded more than willing to oblige, though he could have done without 
the media attention. Dempsey, who dressed next to Murray, wasn't too thrilled, 
either, by the cluster of reporters that made it almost impossible for the 
catcher to get to his cubicle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to let this screw up my day," Dempsey said with mock gruffness. 
"And I'm here to protect Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet-2 and a listed playing weight of 224 pounds, Murray would hardly seem 
to require a bodyguard. But his term in Baltimore ended unhappily, with Murray 
on non-speaking terms with the media there. And when a reporter from Baltimore 
attempted to eavesdrop on Murray Wednesday, the player immediately clammed up. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just time to go, the way things were going," Murray said of his 
departure from the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why things changed -- I can't tell you." 
</P>
<P>
Interjected Dempsey: "I could." 
</P>
<P>
One of a family of 12 children, Murray, who attended Locke High School in Watts 
and has a home in the San Fernando Valley, said he was delighted to return 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm going to have fun again," he said. "The key thing is having fun 
when playing this game. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . It's going to be a learning experience, but I've never been one to shy 
away from a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
This is one challenge, apparently, that Murray can't wait to embrace. It has 
been years since he has reported so soon to spring training -- customarily, he 
had waited at least until after his birthday, which this year falls on Friday, 
when he will turn 33. This time, though he's no Oriole, he chose to be an early 
bird. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Because I love the writers," Murray said with a look that suggested otherwise. 
"I guess I'm getting so old it doesn't matter anymore -- or at least that's 
what you guys say." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson was scheduled to arrive here Wednesday night, and plans to begin 
working out today, according to team officials. Shortstop Alfredo Griffin won't 
arrive until Sunday evening, with permission from Executive Vice President Fred 
Claire, who said Griffin had some personal business to attend to. . . . Three 
players held up by visa problems in the Dominican Republic -- pitcher Ramon 
Martinez, catcher Gilberto Reyes, and infielder Jose Vizcaino -- also were 
expected to arrive Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Mike Marshall, after a winter of working with weights, came into 
camp at 240 pounds, almost 20 pounds above his playing weight. Marshall said he 
intends to drop 10 pounds here, but would like to play at 230, with the extra 
10 pounds presumably being muscle. . . . Outfielder Mike Davis, who has made it 
clear to the Dodgers that he wants a chance to play regularly somewhere, said 
he was coming into camp in great spirits. "Last year was a nightmare," Davis 
said, "but it's behind us. The way I remember it, I wake up, it's October, 
we're in the World Series. That's the last I recall from that season." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton relinquished his No. 33 to Eddie Murray and took No. 3, which had 
belonged to Steve Sax. Hamilton said he was offered the use of No. 6, which 
hasn't been worn since Steve Garvey was here. Hamilton declined. "They said it 
was available, but maybe they weren't thinking," Hamilton said. "I said, 
'That's OK, I'll pass on it.' " . . . Infielder Mike Sharperson signed a 
one-year contract. Sharperson hit .271 in 46 games with the Dodgers. . . . John 
Shelby is 31 today.

MCCASKILL'S DELIVERY IS LOW-PROFILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It is the third day of drills for Angel pitchers and catchers, and Kirk 
McCaskill is approached for a post-workout interview. McCaskill obliges but 
tosses out one ground rule before he settles back into a chair: 
</P>
<P>
"Just as long as it's not McCaskill Is Back." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill smiles, because he knows what's coming. After all, what's an Angel 
spring without another installment in the Kirk McCaskill comeback story? In 
1988, there was arthroscopic elbow surgery to overcome. In 1989, the injury du 
jour is something known as a radial nerve irritation, a condition that left 
McCaskill's pitching hand numb and rendered him useless for the last two months 
of the '88 season. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, after what did and didn't transpire last summer, who's to say that 
McCaskill is finally and truly back to the form he displayed in 1986, when he 
finished 17-10 with a 3.36 earned-run average? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not McCaskill. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to stay very low-profile this spring," McCaskill said. "I'm not taking 
anything for granted . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When a guy gets hurt one year, you can kind of brush it off. But when he's 
hurt two years in a row, then you have something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I've got to prove myself all over again. I feel like I'm fighting 
for a job." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, McCaskill has started a grand total of 36 games for the Angels. In 
1987, sandwiched between April surgery and September post-op complications, 
McCaskill started 13 games, compiling a 4-6 record and a 5.67 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"A year wasted," McCaskill said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he stayed unhurt through early August and went 8-6 in 23 starts -- the 
only winning record in the Angel rotation -- with a 4.31 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
But then came Aug. 13 and that tingling sensation that shot up McCaskill's 
right forearm while he attempted to loosen up before a game in Oakland. 
McCaskill was forced to miss that game -- and any others he had hoped to start 
for Manager Cookie Rojas. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, McCaskill ended the regular season on the 
disabled list. And for the second winter in a row, McCaskill was confronted by 
career-threatening uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
That he's throwing again here, without pain or numbness, has answered one 
critical question. But others remain. 
</P>
<P>
Has the nerve healed? The Angels can only hope so. 
</P>
<P>
Will the condition ever return? 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking it day by day," Manager Doug Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
And what caused the irritation in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
That, along with Junior Noboa's two-month stay on the Angel roster, lives on as 
the club's great unsolved mystery of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran all the tests in the world," McCaskill said. "We never found out a 
cause." 
</P>
<P>
That didn't stop people from speculating, of course. Theories abounded, ranging 
from an old hockey injury to Rojas' use -- or misuse? -- of McCaskill in late 
July and early August. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas came under scrutiny for his handling of McCaskill during three 
consecutive starts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- July 30: McCaskill threw 64 pitches and lasted two-plus innings in an 
eventual 15-14 Angel victory over the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Aug. 3: After vowing that McCaskill "will never pitch on three days' rest" 
again, Rojas pitched McCaskill on three days' rest. McCaskill was bombed again, 
facing only 11 batters in an 8-7 loss to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Aug. 8: The Angels lost again to the Mariners, 4-3, but only after Rojas 
had kept McCaskill on the mound for 145 grueling pitches, the longest stint of 
McCaskill's career. 
</P>
<P>
The next time McCaskill tried to pitch, his arm went numb. Soon afterward, 
fingers were pointed Rojas' way, although McCaskill absolved him then, as he 
does today. 
</P>
<P>
"The 145 pitches had nothing to do with it," McCaskill said. "And when I 
pitched on three days' rest, I had only pitched one inning (actually two) the 
start before. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it all helped lead up to it, but on the day it happened, I felt fine. It 
just appeared. I had no inkling. 
</P>
<P>
"I played catch the day before and when I woke up the next morning, the arm was 
fine. I did my stretching and running before the game and everything was fine. 
Then, when I started to throw in the bullpen, my forearm went numb." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill ventures his own guess as to the root of the nerve irritation, citing 
a game against Baltimore on May 29, in which McCaskill was struck on the right 
forearm by a line drive. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of makes sense," he says. "I got hit in the forearm and that's where 
the radial nerve is." 
</P>
<P>
So why did the nerve wait more than two months to go numb on McCaskill? 
</P>
<P>
The pitcher can only shrug. 
</P>
<P>
During the off-season, rest was prescribed for McCaskill. He did not pick up a 
baseball until January, when the numbness was gone. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, McCaskill passed the days by traveling with his wife Dana in 
Europe, raising money for the charity that bears his name, the Kirk McCaskill 
Strike Out Hunger Foundation, and keeping tabs on Wayne Gretzky as a Los 
Angeles King season-ticket holder. 
</P>
<P>
One can easily imagine some king-sized introspection weighing on McCaskill's 
mind during those hockey nights at Inglewood. A former All-American hockey 
players at the University of Vermont, McCaskill once had to choose between the 
Winnipeg Jets and the Angels as his athletic vocation. 
</P>
<P>
After consecutive washed-out seasons in baseball, McCaskill could be excused 
for wondering if he had made the right choice. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill, however, said he did. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I would've made it as a hockey player," he said. "Put it this 
way: I wasn't on my way to making it. I was only on my way to a quick exit. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, I felt myself getting better as a baseball player and was 
committing more and more time to that. The first day of my last Jets camp 
(1984), we held a scrimmage and I hadn't been on skates in nine months. I was 
totally uncomfortable on skates. I could barely turn on them anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Confidence plays a big part in any sport you play, and I no longer had any 
confidence in my hockey skills." 
</P>
<P>
The King games were merely one way to take McCaskill's thoughts off his arm and 
rehabilitation. Or, at least, such was the intent. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere McCaskill was recognized during the winter, he claims, the opening 
ice-breaking salvo was always the same: "So, Kirk, how's the arm?" 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to have a T-shirt made," McCaskill joked. "It would have read: 
</P>
<P>
"1 -- My arm is fine. 
</P>
<P>
"2 -- Yes, I've signed my contract. 
</P>
<P>
"3 -- No, I haven't met Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
"4 -- No, I don't know where Ron Romanick is." 
</P>
<P>
Romanick, McCaskill's old Angel running mate, is out of baseball. Not wanting 
to reach the same destination just yet, McCaskill has returned to Mesa, hopeful 
of learning if one can pitch effectively in the big leagues with his fingers 
crossed. 
</P>
<P>
The early reports have been encouraging, but, then, they also were at this time 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's throwing the ball as well as ever," said Marcel Lachemann, the Angel 
pitching coach. "And he's throwing all four of his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"This is different than last year. Whenever you've got a pitcher coming off arm 
surgery, you've always got to look at about a year before the thing's totally 
healed up. Even with arthroscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not surgery. We're talking about resting the arm. He's done that and 
now he's going through his whole program. He's doing everything -- all his 
drills, all his throwing. We had to hold him back a little last year." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are counting on McCaskill as one of their five starting pitchers. 
The proof rests in the recent reassignment of Willie Fraser, the club's fifth 
starter in 1988, to the bullpen, where he is to provide needed support behind 
Bryan Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
Without a strong McCaskill, the thinking behind such a move is moot. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad the Angels are sticking with me," McCaskill said. "They're 
encouraging me more than anything else. But, I can't afford to look at it that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on my winter workouts, I could see where they might say, 'He'll be in 
the rotation.' In my mind, however, I'm still trying to win a job. 
</P>
<P>
"The injury is something that's always going to be on my mind, there's no 
denying that. All I can do is stay so focused on what I'm doing here that the 
injury, in the back of my mind, will be a very minuscule part of my mind-set." 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, all McCaskill Is Back stories are to be put on hold. The 
subject suggests checking back some time in early October. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Wally Joyner and Devon White, Angel rookie successes who had to wrestle 
with Mike Port down to the deadline for acceptable salaries in their second 
seasons, Bryan Harvey had an easy go of his 1989 contract negotiations. Harvey, 
runner-up to Oakland shortstop Walt Weiss in the 1988 American League 
rookie-of-the-year voting, signed a one-year contract worth $170,000 Wednesday 
afternoon, the first day of full-squad workouts. Harvey's contract also 
includes a $15,000 bonus if he makes the All-Star team. "It's good to be over 
with," Harvey said. "I had it easier than some guys. I don't know, my agent 
(Steve Greenberg) and Mike Port talked a few times and things just worked 
themselves out. I think (the rookie-of-the-year voting) helped me a little 
bit." 
</P>
<P>
So, no doubt, did the current state of the Angel bullpen. After Harvey, Willie 
Fraser, who had a 5.41 ERA in 1988, ranks as the club's No. 1 short-relief 
specialist. . . . The official figures on Bert Blyleven's Angel contract: 
Blyleven, 37, will be paid a guaranteed salary of $1.225 million this year. His 
1990 contract, to be renewed at the club's option, calls for a salary of $1.175 
million. If the Angels choose not to re-sign Blyleven next season, they can buy 
out his contract for $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Wally smiling? It may have something to do with the fact that, for the 
first time in three years, Joyner has come to training camp with his contract 
already signed. "I'm in good spirits," Joyner said. "Just call me Mr. Happy." 
Joyner would have been happier, he joked, had Blyleven remained a Minnesota 
Twin a little longer. "There goes a couple home runs," Joyner quipped. "I guess 
I've got to pick on someone else." 
</P>
<P>
The only no-shows Wednesday were pitcher Vinicio Cedeno and catcher Edwin 
Marquez, both experiencing visa problems. "We've got two MIAs," Manager Doug 
Rader said. "According to (Port), Marquez called today and said he had no plane 
ticket or a visa. Mike said, 'That's a deterioration of the scenario -- the 
last time I talked to him, he had a plane ticket.' So we're losing ground on 
the thing." . . . Also out of camp was third base coach Moose Stubing, who 
doubles as a basketball official in the Big West, Southwest and Western 
Athletic Conferences. "We've got a new nickname for Moose," Rader reported. "We 
call him Bo. I told him, 'This is just a hobby for you.' "

GREG BALLARD HOPES NBA HASN'T SEEN LAST OF HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ALDRIDGE, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Ballard can't get his check cashed, because he's about to do an interview. 
He hasn't had time to find an apartment -- his local residence is a downtown 
hotel -- and he has no way to get to the bank. So John Lucas, the ex-Bullet, 
tells him that he'll cash it for him, and gives Ballard the keys to Lucas' car. 
</P>
<P>
"You sure?" Ballard asks. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time, Lucas says "Yes," and adds, "I've been taking care of you 
for years. I burped you in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
That's where the young, 6-foot-7 Ballard was a Bullet for eight seasons, the 
future initially on a team with Elvin Hayes, Wes Unseld, Bob Dandridge, Kevin 
Grevey. Now, Ballard, 34, is in the state of Washington, playing on a 10-day 
contract with the Seattle SuperSonics. It's not the stuff with which NBA 
first-round picks are normally associated, and Ballard, the fourth player taken 
in the first round of the 1977 draft, was the highest pick Washington has had 
in the last dozen years. But it's the winter of Ballard's career and he'll take 
the playing time where he gets it. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Ballard spent a season and a half in Italy after leaving Golden 
State, his previous NBA employer, for a contract in Europe. He played in 
Pesaro, on the Adriatic coast, and in Forli, a town about 30 minutes east of 
Bologna. When Forli bought out his contract, bringing in ex-Phoenix Sun Kenny 
Gattison, he spent Christmas at home in Washington before he received a call 
from George Karl, head coach of the Continental Basketball Association's Albany 
Patroons. 
</P>
<P>
And that's why Ballard played seven games in Albany as a player-coach this 
season before he got a jingle from Bernie Bickerstaff, the former Bullets 
assistant now head coach at Seattle. And that's why Ballard is back in the big 
league, even if it's just for another day or so. After his playing days end -- 
which could be Thursday, when the 10-day deal runs out -- he wants to get into 
coaching and scouting full time. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know how long I was going to be (in the NBA)," said Ballard, the last 
active member of the Bullets' 1978 championship team that beat the SuperSonics 
in the finals. "I was praying I would be around but I didn't know how long I 
would last in the league. Because every year, there was exceptional talent 
coming out. I'm talking about players who can play three positions. I wasn't 
sure how long Greg Ballard would last." 
</P>
<P>
Ballard had a setback when he sprained his ankle in warm-ups before the 
SuperSonics' game with the Bullets Friday. He didn't play that night and didn't 
make the trip when the SuperSonics played in Portland. He sat out again as 
Seattle beat the Boston Celtics this week, so his numbers are stuck on 
one-of-eight shooting from the floor ("He's still got no conscience," said 
Karl) with four of four from the foul line in two brief appearances. And, with 
no more games in his contract tenure, he's run out of time to impress. 
</P>
<P>
All Bickerstaff would say about Ballard's future was, "Right now, we're just 
looking at the 10-day thing and we'll see what transpires from that." 
</P>
<P>
In eight Washington seasons, Ballard averaged 13.2 points, missing only 13 
games; he once played in 305 consecutive games. He averaged double figures in 
scoring the last six seasons, reaching a high of 18.8 in 1981-82. He is still 
among all-time leaders in several Bullets categories: second in steals (713), 
third in games (643), fourth in minutes played (18,687), fifth in rebounding 
(4,094), sixth in assists (1,542) and seventh in points (8,706). 
</P>
<P>
After the Bullets traded him on draft day 1985 for second-round picks in 1985 
and 1987 (the '85 pick turned out to be Manute Bol), Ballard put in two seasons 
at Golden State, where he averaged 8.8 and 7.1 points in a reserve role. But in 
July 1987, he opted to go to Pesaro. He played one season there before shifting 
to Forli last summer, but not without casting a glance back toward the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard wanted to return and was thinking about the Miami Heat, but when Ron 
Rothstein was named coach, his chances dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, I was talking to Stu Inman (the Heat's director of player 
personnel). He was talking very positive, but this was before they had hired 
their new coach. When they hired their new coach, he had a lot of input, a lot 
of say-so, on the players he wanted on his team. He basically wanted to go with 
a younger team and, sure enough, he stuck to his guns." 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, where TBS broadcasts one NBA game a week, Ballard's life with his 
wife, Donna, and their four children was two years of ups and downs. True, he 
was given a car and a fully furnished apartment (an American player can get a 
villa if he so desires), but there was always the language barrier. His coach 
spoke three languages, including English, and most of his teammates spoke 
English, so the on-court communication was fine. But there are many non-playing 
hours in the day. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying to learn the language was difficult," he said. "I picked up a little 
bit of it. What makes the language so difficult is you have a lot of verbs. ... 
A lot of times people in the community would invite you over to their house. 
You felt uncomfortable going over there because you couldn't communicate with 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Karl said the American players abroad also carry a disproportionate share of 
their hosts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"The success of the team (in Italy) is out of sync," he said. "People think the 
success of the team is being caused by the Americans. Actually, the success of 
the Italian teams is based on the Italians. On the top teams over there the 
Americans basically cancel each other out. The blame goes over on the 
Americans. And the Americans are the ones they can change. It's harder to 
replace their own players." 
</P>
<P>
So, Forli officials told Ballard they were buying out his contract and bringing 
in Gattison. He could stick around if he wanted and work out with the team in 
case a player got injured. He chose not to, went home for the holidays, and was 
figuring out what to do next when Karl called. On Jan. 26, Ballard joined the 
Patroons, who had lost two players to Italian teams in the last six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg and I had talked last year when he decided to go to Italy," said Karl, 
who coached the Warriors in 1986-88. "He had some interest in becoming a coach. 
I think he was an intelligent player who had the ability to communicate with 
the players. ... It was easier for him to become a player-coach. I could pay 
him some money (the top CBA players make $500-$600 a week) in that capacity. I 
could not pay him just as an assistant coach." 
</P>
<P>
In seven games at Albany, he averaged 8.1 points (with a high of 16) and 5.3 
rebounds, shot just under 50 percent from the floor, broke down film and 
scouting reports with Karl and coached a couple of practices. But Bickerstaff 
came calling Feb. 13 and Ballard checked into his hotel room, leaving the 
family behind in Washington, for who knows how long. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think he can contribute in the NBA," Karl said.

KINGS OBTAIN GOALIE HRUDEY FOR YOUNGSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By trading talented rookie goalie Mark Fitzpatrick and young defenseman Wayne 
McBean, their first-round pick in the 1987 National Hockey League draft, for 
New York Islanders goalie Kelly Hrudey, the Kings served notice Wednesday that 
they are serious about challenging for the Stanley Cup this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, right now," General Manager Rogie Vachon of the Kings said. "We're going 
for it. You can't win the Stanley Cup or go into the finals without good 
goaltending. In my book, Kelly Hrudey is one of the premier goaltenders in the 
league. With Hrudey and Glenn Healy, we have two good goaltenders." 
</P>
<P>
But to get Hrudey, the Kings gave up two players with great potential, as well 
as some unspecified future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up young talent and future top draft picks in August to get Wayne 
Gretzky, it might seem that the Kings are trading away the future. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly, according to owner Bruce McNall, who said he has given this some 
thought. "It might look like we're mortgaging the future with this move, but 
don't forget, we have a goaltender of the future in Robb Stauber." 
</P>
<P>
Stauber, drafted by the Kings in 1986, is a junior goalie at the University of 
Minnesota. He has a 2.14 goals-against average, and Minnesota is leading the 
Western Collegiate Hockey Assn. with a record of 26-7-3. He has said he would 
like to play in the 1992 Olympics but that still would make him a pro before 
Hrudey is likely to retire. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey, 28, is in his sixth season in the NHL after being drafted by the 
Islanders in the second round in 1980. He had career bests last season, with 22 
victories and three shutouts in 47 games, and he finished third in voting for 
the Vezina Trophy, behind Grant Fuhr of Edmonton and Tom Barrasso, then of 
Buffalo, now of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
This season, as the Islanders have struggled to a record of 21-37-3, his record 
is 18-24-3. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey, who played with Gretzky during the '87 Canada Cup, was eager to join 
the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"Career-wise, it couldn't be better. From where the Islanders are now, it will 
be about three years before they're up to this level again," said Hrudey, who 
attended Wednesday's game at the Forum. "If I have to swallow my pride and get 
traded once or twice to get with a team like this, I'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought he would start the Kings' next game at Edmonton, Canada, 
Friday, he said he hoped so. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from Edmonton, so I'm really looking forward to the competition with the 
Oilers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vachon said that he had been trying to make this trade all season, but Islander 
General Manager Bill Torrey wouldn't even talk with him until recently. Now 
that the Islanders are in last place in the Patrick Division, 18 points behind 
fourth-place Philadelphia, they have to start thinking about rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, in second place in the Smythe Division with one of the best records 
in the league, have to think about cashing in on their momentum. 
</P>
<P>
As McNall put it, "In life, timing is everything. My thinking is, if you have 
some great players at one age and some great players at another age, and 
they're not meshing, they're not peaking at the same time, both groups lose. 
We're bringing in a world-class goaltender who is the same age as Wayne 
Gretzky. Wayne likes that idea." 
</P>
<P>
It's a calculated risk trading away so much of the future, but McNall wants to 
win a Stanley Cup, and he didn't make his millions by being cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Betting on Hrudey, though, seems like a sure thing. John Tonelli of the Kings, 
who played with Hrudey when he was with the Islanders, says that Hrudey is "a 
winner, a character player, a hard worker, very determined . . . definitely a 
positive addition to this team." 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls said that he has always considered Hrudey one of the best 
goaltenders in the league, right behind Fuhr and equal to Ron Hextall of 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Vachon figures Hrudey has five or six more years as one of the top goaltenders 
in the league. Hrudey also has playoff experience. Healy, who is 24 and has won 
25 games for the Kings this season, does not. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good meeting with Glenn Healy this morning, and he knows that he's 
going to be with us and we're going to need him," Vachon said. "For the 
playoffs, we need both of them." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' trading of Fitzpatrick and McBean does not mean that they had any 
doubts about their talent. Fitzpatrick, the one the Kings called the Kid, is 
just 20 years old and is considered a star of the future. 
</P>
<P>
McNall said: "I still think Wayne McBean will be one of the top defensemen in 
the league in the future. But the Islanders weren't going to give up someone 
like Hrudey without getting something in return." 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Rollie Melanson probably will be reassigned to New Haven, since it has 
never been the Kings' policy to keep three goaltenders. 
</P>
<P>
The trading deadline is March 7, and although Vachon said, "We're not going to 
close up shop," he also said that the team is starting to shape up as a team 
that management likes very much.

<P>
Given the track record of his British predecessors in this century, zero for 
12, the odds against Frank Bruno winning the heavyweight boxing championship at 
the Las Vegas Hilton Saturday night, 7 1/2-1, look about right. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, given Mike Tyson's most recent performances in the ring -- 
his last three opponents have lasted less than a total of seven rounds -- 90-1 
might be more like it. 
</P>
<P>
But this sunny, smiling son of London's blue-collar Wandsworth District will 
nonetheless step through the ropes Saturday, becoming the 13th British 
heavyweight to challenge an American for the heavyweight title in the 20th 
Century. And no one predicting an upset has yet been found, not even among the 
40 or so British journalists on hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people back home are just hoping he can give Mike a good fight, maybe 
extend him a little bit, not get embarrassed," said Colin Hart of the London 
Sun. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno has seemed quietly confident. "I'm relaxed, I'm quite confident," he 
said. "I respect Mike Tyson, but I don't fear him. I respect any man who has 
the courage to step through the ropes." 
</P>
<P>
Bruno, who has 31 knockouts in his 32-2 record, is England's most popular 
sports figure, according to British writers. His chiseled face is on television 
and in newspapers daily. He earns a six-figure income endorsing products. 
</P>
<P>
In England, anything this guy does is news. Last September, a nation was 
transfixed as news reports came in from Jamaica, where Bruno, caught in the 
200-m.p.h. winds of Hurricane Gilbert, protected his girlfriend and two 
daughters with his body. 
</P>
<P>
For the hurricane he figures to see Saturday, they say he'll earn about $3.6 
million, plus what he earns from British closed-circuit and cable television. 
The total could hit $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
He's an open, affable man, who, like his opponent Saturday, spent a term or two 
in what the British call a "special school." In Tyson's case, it was called 
reform school. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno's family arrived in London from Jamaica in the late 1950s. His father 
died when he was 11. His mother, Lynette, is a nurse and a Pentecostal 
evangelist. 
</P>
<P>
At 27, Bruno is almost 6-foot-4 and should weigh about 225 Saturday. He was 
almost that big when he was 15, and a schoolyard bully. His mother, unable to 
control him, enrolled him in a "special school" outside London. 
</P>
<P>
As British boxing writer Hugh McIlvanney put it, the school, Oak Hall, was for 
youngsters "who were not yet delinquent but were heading enthusiastically in 
that direction." 
</P>
<P>
At Oak Hall, someone taught big Frank how to box. In short order, just after 
Bruno turned 18, England had its youngest amateur heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
He turned pro in 1982, and knocked out his first 21 opponents. Excitement grew. 
Crowds began watching his East London workouts, in a gym above a pub. 
</P>
<P>
Then Bruno met Bonecrusher Smith in 1984, in London. In a 10-rounder, Bruno, by 
all accounts, won at least seven of the first nine rounds. But he came apart in 
the 10th and Smith knocked him out. 
</P>
<P>
He knocked out four more opponents -- including Gerrie Coetzee in one round -- 
and earned a World Boxing Assn. title bout with Tim Witherspoon at London's 
Wembley Stadium in July, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Smith fight all over again. 
</P>
<P>
Before 40,000, Bruno, ahead on everyone's card, was knocked out in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
Now you know why the odds are 7 1/2-1. When Tyson beat Smith on a decision in 
1987, he won nearly every round. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any way Bruno can pull this off and become the Englishman who finally 
reverses his country's nine-decade losing streak against American heavyweight 
champions? 
</P>
<P>
Not many in England think so, but they'll love him just the same. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so popular, I think he'll be a hero if he lasts more than 91 seconds," 
said Hart, alluding to the time it took Tyson to dispatch Michael Spinks last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"If he goes two or three exciting rounds, that would be even better. If he 
wins, they'd probably make him a duke, he'd visit Buckingham Palace . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Despite widely held beliefs that he will lose, Bruno remains optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"If I paid attention to what everyone said about me, I wouldn't get out of bed 
in the morning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of his losses to Smith and Witherspoon, he reminds critics he's older and 
stronger. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more of a man now than when I fought Witherspoon, mentally and 
physically," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He may stand little chance of beating Tyson Saturday night, but with most of 
those he has been in contact with the last seven weeks, he would win a 
unanimous popularity decision. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel staff threw a party for him when he broke early camp in Scottsdale, 
Ariz., and those there said that some of the employees shed tears when he left. 
</P>
<P>
Things haven't been nearly that sweet at the Las Vegas Hilton, however. Bruno 
was reportedly upset that his suite wasn't made up when he arrived in town, 
that no limousine was provided to take him to his workouts and that the hotel 
wouldn't give him a Tyson-Bruno T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Honest. 
</P>
<P>
Embarrassed, Team Bruno called a news conference, where everybody apologized. 
"It just slipped out of my mouth," Bruno said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno would also win a beefcake decision. If no one had ever seen or heard of 
either fighter, no one would bet against Bruno when they take their robes off. 
</P>
<P>
Bruno is all lean slabs of muscle. And much taller than Tyson. He is also, most 
agree, strong enough to hurt the champion, maybe to even knock him off his 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
But he couldn't do it to Smith or Witherspoon, so . . . 
</P>
<P>
Camp Bruno talks a good fight, in the face of the odds. "I guarantee you're 
going to see one of the best fights you've ever seen here in the U.S.," said 
his trainer, Terry Lawless. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Wednesday, after Don King had talked for 45 minutes, 
Bruno stood up and spoke for one minute. "Don King makes Mike Tyson out to be 
Superman, but I've got the Kryptonite, right here," he said, showing his right 
fist, then sitting down. 
</P>
<P>
Since his arrival here, Bruno has been seeing a psychiatrist, who comes to the 
Hilton every day to put Bruno under hypnosis. It's a form of relaxation 
therapy, Bruno's camp explains. They say the challenger was in excellent 
physical shape in the bouts he lost, but that prefight tension drained him. 
</P>
<P>
And Bruno has had plenty of time to get tense. This fight, because of the 
Tyson-Robin Givens soap opera divorce and other problems, was postponed five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, it was to have been held in London. When the site was switched to 
Las Vegas, the Hilton compensated British promoters, as well as Bruno. "I don't 
fear any man, but I do fear losing," Bruno said. "I fear making a fool of 
myself in front of millions of people." 
</P>
<P>
That could happen, Frank. 
</P>
<P>
This is an impressive-looking challenger, but one who stands straight up, 
throws one punch at a time, exposes his chin, is slow as a statue and has a 
history of wearing down in the late rounds. 
</P>
<P>
But stop worrying, Frank. If you wind up looking foolish against this guy, 
you'll have lots of company.

CAL LUTHERAN GUARD THINKS A PRO CAREER IS POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
By now, guard Steve deLaveaga of Cal Lutheran in Thousand Oaks has heard just 
about every reason he doesn't have a future in professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, the reports say the 6-foot-4, 180-pound senior from San Ramon is too 
slow or too skinny to make it in the National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Such an evaluation might discourage most. But that's what college recruiters 
were saying about deLaveaga before he started playing for Cal Lutheran four 
seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
Before he went on to virtually rewrite the school's scoring records. 
</P>
<P>
In four seasons with the Kingsmen, deLaveaga has an average of 22.3 points 
including 27.4 points as a junior and 28.2 this season. He has a school-record 
2,524 points and has scored in double figures in 81 consecutive games -- second 
nationally among active players behind Sean Elliott of Arizona at 98. 
</P>
<P>
He also scored a school-record 51 points in his team's 130-96 victory over 
Christ College of Irvine Tuesday and is third among National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. Division II players in scoring average this season and ninth in 
the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Still, deLaveaga realizes he is a long shot to reach the NBA. Cal Lutheran, 
after all, does not play the kind of schedule that would impress professional 
scouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not one of those guys that they're knocking down doors for," he said. "But 
that's OK because I've been in that position before. All I want is a chance." 
</P>
<P>
It seems as if that's how it has been for deLaveaga through every step of his 
basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole life, I've been told that I couldn't do this and I couldn't do that," 
he said. DeLaveaga was hardly an instant success as a prep player at California 
High in San Ramon. In fact, he was eighth man on his team as a freshman and 
sixth man as a sophomore before starting as a junior and senior. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 22 points and was an all-league selection as a senior but didn't 
attract the attention of many four-year colleges. Only Cal Lutheran offered him 
a full scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
And only deLaveaga knew that he could succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody said I was still a step slow but I knew I could play college ball," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of overachieved just to get to college," he said. "I didn't really set 
any guidelines for myself. I just wanted to get better year by year." 
</P>
<P>
At Cal Lutheran, deLaveaga has shown steady improvement in averaging 13.5 
points as a freshman, 20.1 as a sophomore and 27.4 as a junior. He has also 
improved considerably in other areas and is second in rebounds and assists and 
first in steals this season. 
</P>
<P>
"My sophomore year, I became the guy they'd look to for baskets," he said. "As 
I got older I learned I could also help our team more in other ways. Because of 
double teams, I've helped the others get open shots. In basketball you can't 
just be a scorer and Coach (Larry) Lopez has helped me on that. After my 
sophomore year, he challenged me and I became better at passing and defense." 
</P>
<P>
He credits a strong desire to succeed for his development. 
</P>
<P>
"Recruiters don't measure heart and I always played with a lot of heart," 
deLaveaga said. "That's the one thing that's gotten me to this point. There 
were so many guys that I played with that were much higher rated (in high 
school) and now they're sixth man at this level." 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga is a workaholic who stays long after most of the other players have 
left practice and frequently helps out at high school and youth camps in his 
spare time. 
</P>
<P>
"He is just a flat-out basketball junkie and I say that in the most 
complimentary terms," said Brian Underwood, Cal Lutheran assistant coach. "He 
loves to play basketball but he's by no means a one-dimensional athlete. He's 
also a good student." 
</P>
<P>
It is a rare day when deLaveaga doesn't practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I have trouble with moderation," deLaveaga said. "I don't think I'll ever be 
satisfied with anything I do." 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga, who is shooting 44.3% from three-point range, is hoping that his 
skills will be enough to make it to the NBA but realizes there is still plenty 
of work ahead. "The whole game needs improvement," he said. "My quickness for 
one, my range as a shooter. To play at the next level, I have to be able to do 
the whole thing. Not just shoot but all the other things involved in playing 
basketball."

U.S. GAINS QUARTERFINALS OF WORLD YOUTH SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The United States advanced to the quarterfinals of a world soccer championship 
for the first time in 59 years Wednesday, despite a 3-1 loss to Brazil in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier tie with Mali and a victory over East Germany, combined with Mali's 
3-0 loss to East Germany Wednesday, advanced the United States to the next 
round of the fifth World Youth Championship. The United States will play Iraq 
Saturday at Taif. 
</P>
<P>
The last time an American team succeeded in reaching the quarter-final level 
was in the first World Cup at Uruguay in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's match at Jedda, Troy Dayak of Livermore, Calif., scored his 
second goal of the tournament and the first to be scored against unbeaten 
Brazil, but the U.S. did not seriously threaten the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
The American team, composed of players under 20, is the nucleus of the one that 
will represent the United States in 1992 Olympic qualifying competition. It 
will also be the home team for the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight in the Coliseum, Mexico will play El Salvador in the championship match 
of the Los Angeles Soccer Cup at 9 and Costa Rica will play Guatemala at 7. 
Mexico beat Guatemala Tuesday night, 2-1, and El Salvador edged Costa Rica, 4-3 
on penalty kicks.

<P>
FERKEL, AN ORIGINAL OUTLAW, MAKES FAREWELL TOUR OF WEST COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shav Glick 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Ferkel, who came out of Findlay, Ohio, in 1973 and helped change the face 
of sprint car racing, is making one final swing of California sprint car tracks 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
The ageless Ferkel, one of the founders of the World of Outlaws, will be 
driving his own Gambler car with its 5-foot by 5-foot overhead wings and a new 
Ron Shaver aluminum engine Friday and Saturday nights in the Midwinter Outlaw 
championships at Ascot Park against a combination of World of Outlaws and West 
Coast drivers. 
</P>
<P>
It will be Ferkel's first visit to Ascot, where he and Bubby Jones, then of 
Danville, Ill., introduced the drag racing tire called the "humper" on the 
right rears of their sprinters in 1973, since the Pacific Coast Nationals in 
1985 and his first year touring with the Outlaws since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been staying pretty close to home the last few years but the opportunity 
came up this year to come out West and I decided to take it," said Ferkel, who 
still lives in Findlay. "It may be my last time out this way. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the early '70s, before the Outlaws came about, we raced wherever we 
heard there was a good payday. Me and Bubby read about this race at Ascot and 
came out with our humpers, which were nothing more than drag racing tires with 
a tall profile, and broke the track record by a ton and lapped nearly everybody 
in the race." 
</P>
<P>
By the following season, nearly every car in the CRA was equipped with the 
odd-looking right rear tire, which is now standard equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Outlaws will present a new look this season and Ferkel, who helped Ted 
Johnson form the organization 12 years ago, is not pleased. Steve Kinser and 
Sammy Swindell, who have won all 11 Outlaws championships, have left to help 
form a rival organization, the United Sprint Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm old-fashioned or something, but I don't understand the loyalty, or 
lack of it," Ferkel said. "The World of Outlaws brought sprint car racing 
national recognition, and it was that recognition that made millionaires out of 
Kinser and Swindell. How can they forget what got them where they are today?" 
</P>
<P>
The USA will open its season Saturday night in Savannah, Ga. Kinser, Swindell 
and Karl Kinser, chief mechanic and owner of Steve's car, are among the 
majority stockholders of USA. 
</P>
<P>
"If the USA was out to make sprint car racing a better product, I'd say fine, 
but it appears to me that it's just a group of guys with an ax to grind," 
Ferkel said. "If their idea is to cause a big split in the sport, it could set 
sprint car racing back, and that's crazy because the guys who owe the Outlaws 
the most are the guys who left." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Swindell, Sammy's younger brother, won the Outlaws' season opener last 
Saturday at Firebird Raceway in Chandler, Ariz., and will head the cast of 
Outlaws at Ascot. Swindell beat Bobby Davis Jr. to the flag in a battle of 
Memphis drivers. Davis finished third behind Kinser and Sammy Swindell in last 
year's standings. 
</P>
<P>
Ascot fans may remember Jeff Swindell as an 18-year-old in 1980 who came from 
the rear of the C main, through the B main qualifier and eventually from 26th 
to finish fifth in the Pacific Coast Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Other prominent Outlaws entered include Andy Hillenburg of Broken Arrow, Okla., 
and Jac Haudenschild of Millersburg, Ohio, who were sixth and eighth, 
respectively, last year. 
</P>
<P>
West Coast defenders will be led by Ron Shuman of Tempe, Ariz., a former Outlaw 
who stayed home last year and won the California Racing Assn. championship for 
wingless cars; Brent Kaeding of Campbell, Calif., the Northern Auto Racing Club 
champion; and Lealand McSpadden of Tempe, Ariz., who won 15 CRA main events 
while racing part-time. 
</P>
<P>
OFF-ROAD -- Competitors in the Mickey Thompson Off-Road Gran Prix series will 
face the longest and perhaps most demanding stadium course yet designed 
Saturday night when they compete at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego. The 
course has been stretched to four-tenths of a mile, with 10 turns and nine 
jumps. Jeff Huber, the only driver to win a Grand National sport truck in a 
main event in a Ford, will rejoin the Ford team after a two-year stint with 
Mazda. Huber, an Apple Valley driver who won at Orange Show Stadium in 1985, 
will replace Dan Esslinger, who is co-owner of the team and was its driver the 
last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- When Rick Johnson won his fifth straight Supercross last Saturday 
night at Miami, the Honda rider from El Cajon passed Bob (Hurricane) Hannah as 
the winningest rider in stadium motocross. It was Johnson's 28th win. Johnson 
is now after Hannah's national record of 64, counting both stadium and outdoor 
races. Johnson's combined total is 59. The next Supercross is set for Saturday 
night at Atlanta. . . . Sportsman riders will complete their season Sunday in 
the 13th annual Continental Motosport Club's Golden State Nationals series at 
Glen Helen Park in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING -- Bernie Longjohn, manager of L.A. County Raceway in Palmdale, has 
also been named manager of the new Bakersfield Raceway -- formerly Famoso Drag 
Strip -- by the National Hot Rod Assn., which recently acquired a 20-year lease 
on the famous strip where the March Meet Fuel and Gas Championships were held 
for 39 years. The March Meet will not be held this year while improvements are 
being made on the facility, but it will be resumed next year. 
</P>
<P>
MOTORCYCLES -- Round 2 of the Miller Formula One Grand Prix sprint series, 
sanctioned by the American Road Racing Assn., will be held Sunday at Willow 
Springs Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
STOCK CARS -- Former CRA champion Brad Noffsinger of Huntington Beach was a 
late scratch in the Daytona 500, being replaced by Charlie Glotzbach. . . . P. 
J. Jones of Torrance, after starting fifth in the Daytona Dash 200, led briefly 
before spinning out in a tangle of cars early in the race. 
</P>
<P>
NEWSWORTHY -- Gordon Hoyt of Whittier has been elected president of the 
Bonneville 200 MPH Club. . . . Jim Kropfeld, a two-time world unlimited 
hydroplane champion who suffered a broken neck when his Miss Budweiser flipped 
upside down in the opening race of 1988 in Miami, will return to racing this 
year for Bernie Little's Budweiser team. Tom D'Eath, who won the title in the 
same boat last year, has switched to car racing.

UC IRVINE PLAYS HOST TO CS LONG BEACH

<P>
UC Irvine has won five of its last six basketball games and will finish the 
regular season with a four-game home stand that begins tonight at 7:30 when the 
Anteaters play host to Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A sweep would guarantee Irvine at least a tie for second in the Big West 
Conference, which would be a remarkable feat considering Irvine's 3-5 start in 
conference play. The Anteaters are 11-12 overall and 8-6 in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (12-12, 9-6) had won four in a row before getting routed at Las 
Vegas Monday night by 18th-ranked UNLV, 104-74. In the first meeting this 
season, Long Beach won, 75-70. JOHN WEYLER

Ever since Wayne Gretzky took a stand against fighting in the National Hockey 
League, it has been the hottest topic on ice. The subject of debate. The 
subject of polls. 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing is, the players are still swinging. 
</P>
<P>
Just nine seconds into the game between the Islanders and Flyers Sunday night, 
six players had been given game misconducts and 102 penalty minutes had been 
handed out by referee Dave Newell. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just talking with Mick Vukota after the warm-up and he made a comment 
about fighting slowly going out of the game," Pat LaFontaine said when the dust 
had cleared. "I said, 'You know, Mick, I haven't seen a brawl where everybody 
drops the gloves in about two years.' And then, this happens." 
</P>
<P>
It started when the Flyers' Craig Berube and the Islanders' Brad Dalgarno got 
into it along the boards in front of the Islander bench. 
</P>
<P>
When they went to the penalty box, the Flyers sent out Al Secord and the 
Islanders sent out Alan Kerr. As they lined up for the faceoff, Secord hit Kerr 
with a high stick, and as they squared off, others started pairing off for 
fisticuffs. The Flyers' Rick Tocchet took on Gerald Diduck. The Flyers' Kjell 
Samuelsson took on Dale Henry. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining why the brawl was a good thing, Tocchet told Jim Smith of 
Newsday: "The guys had to wake up." He added: "I think, after the altercation, 
we started to dominate and they started to back up. I'm not saying they were 
intimidated but . . . I think it was the effect of us standing up." 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders, who lost the game, 5-4, thought that they had showed courage in 
outscoring the Flyers, 4-1, after the Flyers' 4-0 outburst in the first period. 
Islander Coach Al Arbour said: "We stood up to them. We punished them. We 
didn't take a backward step." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently hockey needs fights to prove something about standing up. 
</P>
<P>
To get a feel for just where the players who fight, the players who don't 
fight, the coaches and the league stand on the subject of fighting, the 
Associated Press surveyed players, 19 coaches and NHL Vice President Brian 
O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
One common opinion was that without fighting there would be more stick fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Robinson summed up the opinion of those who are not appalled by fighting: 
"Two guys aren't really going to hurt themselves that bad if they drop the 
gloves. They're on skates. The fights don't last that long, anyway. And so what 
if you take a bop on the nose or a bop in the eye? I think it's a safety valve. 
Otherwise, people would use their sticks." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said that he didn't consider fighting a necessary part of the game, but 
said, "It is part of it in terms of the emotional type of game we play here." 
</P>
<P>
As for there having been no fights in the 14-game NHL series against the 
Soviets, O'Neill said: 
</P>
<P>
"Those were exhibition games and can't be compared to our regular-season 
schedule. It's an entirely different game. We're involved with much more 
emotion when we play against ourselves and in our division. Everybody says we 
allow fighting, but we don't allow fighting. It is heavily penalized. What we 
don't do is automatically banish players from the game -- that's the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Angus Reid of the Sports Network polled 1,500 Canadians on the subject of 
violence in the National Hockey League and learned that 74% thought that hockey 
would be more entertaining with less violence. And 50% said that, despite the 
NHL's recent crackdown, the level of unnecessary violence has increased over 
the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Reid reported that among Canadians who do not watch televised hockey, 11% said 
that it was because of the excessive violence. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their disapproval of the violence, 77% of the Canadians polled would 
still encourage their children to play hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago leads the league in major penalties for fighting. Pittsburgh is second 
and Detroit third. Los Angeles, the City of Angels, has the fewest. 
</P>
<P>
President Barry Shenkarow of the Winnipeg Jets said that comments made by 
commentator Don Cherry of "Hockey Night in Canada" were "inaccurate, slanderous 
and definitely uncalled for" as he demanded a public apology. Shenkarow said: 
"He is certainly entitled to his opinion, but when he refers to our coach in 
Moncton (New Brunswick), Alpo Suhonen, as 'some kind of dog food' that is going 
too far." 
</P>
<P>
Hartford goalie Mike Liut is not happy with announcer Stan Fischler of 
SportsChannel, who is also a Hockey News columnist, for calling him a clubhouse 
lawyer when he was traded from St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most insulting and ignorant thing anybody could say," Liut said. 
"Yes, I've gone through tough years. I've had my moments of frustration. That 
happens in a 12-year career. But I'm not going to drag anybody down." 
</P>
<P>
Liut, 33, is the subject of a lot of trade rumors now that rookie Peter 
Sidorkiewicz has played eight of the last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Playing clubhouse philosopher, Liut said: "You start out having to prove 
yourself, and you end up proving yourself. I'm 33. Billy Smith is 38. There's 
some leeway in there. I can still be a very capable player." 
</P>
<P>
Liut told Jeff Jacobs of the Hartford Courant that although he has joked about 
the trade rumors -- "If they give me the starring role in "Policy Academy VI," 
I'll go to L.A. in a minute" -- the talk bothers him. "I find it insulting, 
embarrassing. It hurts not to be wanted someplace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NHL Notes 
</P>
<P>
By shutting out St. Louis Tuesday night, 2-0, Vancouver set a club record for 
consecutive victories with six. The Canucks have closed in on third place in 
the Smythe Division as Edmonton slipped. Edmonton had lost four of its last 
five before beating Hartford Tuesday, 7-4. . . . The Winnipeg Jets retired 
Bobby Hull's No. 9 Sunday night. Hull played with the Jets of the World Hockey 
Assn. after a long career with Chicago. He is the second player to have his 
number retired by two teams. The other is Gordie Howe, who was honored by 
Detroit and Hartford.

<P>
The Trojan quarterback, who is expected to be among the first players chosen in 
the National Football league draft, doubled as an infielder on the baseball 
team his first three years. He did not report for baseball this season, 
however, nor does he plan to pursue a career in organized ball. Peete could 
have signed last summer with the Oakland A's. 
</P>

Said Peete: "I wanted to put all my time and effort into being the highest

CALARTS STUDENT MAKES MOVIE TO HELP DEAL WITH HER FATHER'S 'SECRET' DEATH OF 
AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Bayer didn't tell his daughter that he had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
She found out anyway and came home from college to be with him. But he didn't 
want to talk about it. He ordered his doctor to keep quiet. Heidi Bayer 
discovered that the rest of the family didn't want to talk either. No one did. 
And then her father died. 
</P>
<P>
So she decided to make a movie. 
</P>
<P>
"People wanted to know why this 22-year-old blonde chick wanted to do a film 
about AIDS," Bayer said. "Everyone asked. Finally, I told them my father died 
of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience was so frustrating. This film is my way of talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
Bayer is funneling her frustration into a cinematic short story, a 20-minute 
drama called "A Choir of Angels." On a recent day on an indoor set at CalArts, 
the film student was running around in striped pants with a rubber chicken tied 
to her waist. She was trying to find one of her actors for a walk-through. She 
was trying to find a can of Budweiser that had been on the television set in 
the last scene. She was sniffling. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd been shooting for five days, I'd been getting four hours sleep a night, 
and I was fighting a cold," Bayer said. "I couldn't help thinking about my 
father. I thought I was going to lose it." 
</P>
<P>
She didn't -- shooting went so well that it ended two days ahead of schedule. 
Editing work remains, and the movie cannot be finished until more money is 
wrangled for film processing. Yet Bayer feels a certain calmness. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really strange, but this has helped me work a lot of things out," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"A Choir of Angels" is not about William Bayer. It is about Don and Jesse, 
working-class roommates. Their lives change one morning when Maria arrives at 
their apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Maria is Don's pen pal from Italy, and she is beautiful. Don is shy. Jesse is 
smitten. There is immediate conflict. And that's just the start of it: Maria 
has come to America because she has AIDS and her family has disowned her. 
</P>
<P>
This is a common story of AIDS victims who face the illness alone, Bayer said. 
Some are like Maria, cast out by lovers, friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
Others are like William Bayer, a stockbroker in Denver. He insisted on keeping 
his affliction a secret, even from his children and his wife, from whom he'd 
been separated for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In their last days, these people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome die 
among strangers -- doctors, nurses and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"But this isn't a story about death," Heidi Bayer said. "It's a story about 
life and living with the disease." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Panavision Loans Camera 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Panavision were impressed. They chose "A Choir of Angels" to be 
part of their New FilmMakers Program and they loaned Bayer an expensive 
16-millimeter camera. She needed a break like that. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the film might never have got started if not for Erika T. Wing. 
</P>
<P>
Wing is Bayer's roommate. She doesn't know anyone who has AIDS and she doesn't 
get as emotional about the disease as Bayer does. But she believes in what the 
film has to say. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the subject matter is really important," said Wing, a 26-year-old 
CalArts student. 
</P>
<P>
Wing, who speaks with a North Carolina accent, is an organized person. A 
notebook is often tucked under one arm. After being interviewed, she reassured 
a reporter that all pertinent topics had been covered and she recited them. 
</P>
<P>
As producer of "A Choir of Angels," Wing had only $5,500 to work with -- most 
of it money Bayer received after her father's death. So she called movie 
equipment companies and film labs all over Los Angeles to find the best deals. 
She persuaded Pepsi-Cola and Hansen Juices to donate refreshments. She got 
Anheuser-Busch to chip in a few cases of beer for the wrap party. Burbank 
Studios loaned a backdrop, and Carpeteria sent over a roll of carpeting for the 
set. 
</P>
<P>
Other CalArts students offered help. One man built the set. Several others 
acted. Some people from outside the school worked lights. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me very proud," said 
</P>
<P>
Steven Lavine, president of CalArts. "AIDS is a staggeringly big issue. It's 
wonderful that these students are taking on the hard issues." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Pain, Deterioration 
</P>
<P>
The issues, for Bayer, took shape in words and gestures. Physical pain and 
deterioration do not appear in this film. 
</P>
<P>
"After what I saw and what I went through. . . ." she said. "I couldn't show 
any of that. It's just too ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, she said, should have to see it. 
</P>
<P>
"What struck us about 'A Choir of Angels' was the theme of AIDS and the way it 
was dealt with, which we thought was less sensationalistic and more 
down-to-earth," said Benjamin Bergery of Panavision. "It presents AIDS in a 
human way." 
</P>
<P>
No matter how many nice things people say about the film, Bayer and Wing still 
find themselves broke with more work to go. Processing and editing will cost 
$3,000. Wing has her hand on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be tough. We'll go around to private people and AIDS research 
groups. I've got a couple different foundations and health groups in mind," she 
said. "We're going to try anything we can." 
</P>
<P>
Bayer doesn't think so much about dollars. She thinks about finishing the film 
and having it shown at student film festivals and "at the Beverly Hills 
Cineplex and all over the United States, including Canada." 
</P>
<P>
She is glad it's almost done. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so emotional when you're so close to something," she said. "This is the 
end of my mourning process. No, this is the end of a phase of it."

'IT'S IMPORTANT THAT KIDS TELL THESE THINGS TO KIDS.'; 
</P>
<P>
THEIR OWN POINT OF VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conversation was about vaginal fluids, semen, homosexuality, condoms, 
toilet seats and breast milk. The conversationalists ranged in age from 14 to 
16. 
</P>
<P>
"Using a condom is very effective, but . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"But what?" 
</P>
<P>
"They can break." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of decades ago, frank talk on sex would invariably bring about a fit 
of giggles among teen-agers. A decade ago such discussions were infused with 
bravado and smugness. But now, in the age of AIDS, this teen-age conversation 
in a classroom at the Oakwood School in North Hollywood concerned basic science 
-- and survival. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can get it from casual contact." 
</P>
<P>
"Like a kiss?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not even from a toilet seat." 
</P>
<P>
Even though these teen-agers tossed off this kind of talk matter-of-factly, it 
was not casual conversation. They have moved beyond just learning and talking 
about the causes of AIDS. Now they want to spread the word. They are making a 
video. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hear something from an adult, sometimes it really just passes over 
your head," said Malakhi Simmons, 16, who was operating the camera that was 
focused on the four students in one scene. 
</P>
<P>
The story line of the short video is about a group of teen-agers getting 
together to make a brief informational video about AIDS. Bits of their 
conversation will be mixed with scenes from the video they are discussing. For 
example, when the students are talking about prophylactics, the on-screen scene 
will be of a teen-ager shyly buying a condom. 
</P>
<P>
"You listen and hear things from an adult," Simmons continued, "but you don't 
pay attention the way you do when someone your own age is talking to you. It's 
important that kids tell these things to kids. We know the way they think." 
</P>
<P>
The video is being made for a competition sponsored by the Public Television 
Outreach Alliance, an organization producing the upcoming "America in the Age 
of AIDS" public TV series. 
</P>
<P>
The local winners of the contest, which is restricted to high school students, 
will have their video shown on KCET television. The national winners will 
travel to Florida this summer to be honored at the Public Broadcasting 
Service's annual program fair. 
</P>
<P>
Making a video seems to come naturally to the students involved in the project, 
many of whom have parents who work in the film and television industries. 
Simmons' father is a cinematographer; James Pitts' father produces and directs 
videos. Pitts, 15, went with his father to San Francisco when his father taped 
a public service announcement for an AIDS group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Encounter 
</P>
<P>
"It was for a group that asked people to help take care of the pets of people 
who have AIDS," said Pitts, who was so excited about the project that he 
occasionally jumped out of his chair and mimed how sections of the video would 
look. But he talked quietly when he spoke about the trip to San Francisco, 
where he first met several people with AIDS. "I think meeting them made me more 
caring." 
</P>
<P>
Oakwood has not had any students with AIDS, but through their parents, several 
of these young video makers have met people who have the disease. "There is 
this friend of my dad's that I have known for a long time," said Nichole 
Gendler, 14. "I saw him at Christmas and it was really sad. He was fragile, he 
was really skinny and he can't walk well. He can hardly talk." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I complain, sometimes I don't get the things I want," said Sophie 
Tokar, 14. "I complain to my parents and stuff. But then I see someone who has 
a disease with no cure and I feel really lucky. I think about what it would be 
like to have a disease that you know will kill you. I can't believe how lucky I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
All of the students stated emphatically that the fact that most AIDS victims 
are gay is of no consequence to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cross Boundaries 
</P>
<P>
Oakwood, which has been in North Hollywood for more than 30 years, draws most 
of its students from upper-middle and upper-class families, according to 
Principal Fred Mednick. But AIDS knows no economic boundaries and the private 
school has had programs to educate its students about the disease. Math teacher 
Ken Gould, who is overseeing the project, and two other instructors taught a 
class called "AIDS: A Positive Response" last year as an elective for students. 
</P>
<P>
The class toured the offices of AIDS Project-Los Angeles and some of the 
students did volunteer work there. (Oakwood students are required to do 
community service projects while attending the school). Several speakers 
visited the class, including one man who had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"I think going into the class the students felt that they could do nothing 
about the disease," said Gould, 26. "All they could do was protect themselves. 
But I think the class made the disease real for them, it made it human." 
</P>
<P>
In the term following the class, Gould asked for volunteers to participate in 
the annual AIDS Walkathon. About 100 students and faculty members joined the 
event, in which they raised almost $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The response to the video project was far more modest -- about 12 students 
signed up to make videos individually or in groups -- and most of them say they 
did it because in addition to believing in their cause, they thought it would 
be fun to write and produce their own videos. But even amid the usual giggles 
over line flubs and bursts of energy when someone got a new idea about how to 
do a scene, the taping was colored just a bit by the fact that barring a 
medical breakthrough, their generation will be the next to have to deal with 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it's mostly adults who have this disease," said Tokar. "But we are 
coming towards this, now. We have to tell kids to be careful."

Fanciful crystal hood ornaments, devilish masks, an audio library of 
recollections from older San Fernando Valley residents -- Valley museums are 
definitely eclectic in nature. Many have captured what life was like a century 
ago through preserving or rebuilding structures, then packing them with 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
Following are museums and historical collections open to the public, many of 
them free. Some are surrounded by parks -- just the locale for a post-museum 
family picnic. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Fernando Mission, founded in 1797, contains several museums and 
gardens, and a cemetery that is the final resting place for early settlers of 
San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
The mission church, originally built between 1804 and 1806, was leveled in the 
1971 earthquake. An exact replica was built on the site and contains a 
15th-Century statue of St. Ferdinand that was sent to California by the king of 
Spain in the late 1700s. 
</P>
<P>
One building, completed in 1822 and also restored after the earthquake, 
features 21 Roman arches and four-foot-thick adobe walls. The building contains 
a collection of altar furnishings, vestments, Hispanic furniture, and a wine 
cellar and vat where grapes were pressed. 
</P>
<P>
A series of dioramas that re-create carpentry, pottery, saddle-making, weaving 
and blacksmith trades are near the west garden. An archival center, assembled 
for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, is open most weekdays by appointment and to 
the public from 1 to 3 p.m. Mondays and Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
The mission is at 15151 San Fernando Mission Blvd., Mission Hills, and is open 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily except Christmas and Thanksgiving. Admission is $1.50 
for adults and 50 cents for children ages 6 to 15. (818) 361-0186. 
</P>
<P>
* The Anthropology Museum in Cal State Northridge's Anthropology Department 
features cultural exhibits that change every semester. The department will show 
more than 100 Mexican and Guatemalan masks through May 26. 
</P>
<P>
The hand-carved wooden masks in the exhibit were used to celebrate traditional 
Indian festivals in 20th-Century Mexico and Guatemala. The masks are based on 
the human face, animals and devils. 
</P>
<P>
The Anthropology Department is in the Sierra South building, Room 219, at the 
Northridge campus, 18111 Nordhoff St. Admission is free. The exhibit is open 8 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. (818) 885-2210. 
</P>
<P>
* The William S. Hart Ranch and Museum in Newhall served as silent screen star 
William Hart's retirement home until he died in 1946. Hart was billed as "the 
bad guy who was really good at heart and turned out to be good at the end," 
said Katherine Child, who manages the collection. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's 22-room Spanish colonial mansion on a hilltop has been preserved as he 
left it, right down to his boots in the corner and a tuxedo hanging in the 
closet. A large collection of Western paintings, including those of Charles M. 
Russell and James Montgomery Flagg, are on display. Navajo rugs, photographs 
and movie memorabilia are found throughout the home. 
</P>
<P>
A ranch house at the bottom of the hill contains a tack room where saddles, 
some edged in sterling silver, are displayed. A public park, which Hart deeded 
to Los Angeles County, surrounds the mansion, and includes hiking and nature 
trails, a large picnic area, a dog graveyard where Hart's pets are buried, a 
farm machinery exhibit and a small barnyard with horses, goats and birds. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is at 24151 San Fernando Road. Free tours are given 10 a.m. to 12:30 
p.m. Wednesdays through Fridays, and 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Saturdays and 
Sundays. (805) 254-4585. 
</P>
<P>
* The Leonis Adobe museum and ranch in Calabasas, built in 1844, was remodeled 
into a Monterey-style mansion by occupants Miguel Leonis and his Indian wife, 
Espiritu, around 1880. "It looks just as if they walked out of it," said Glenn 
Hiatt, museum director. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen and dining room of the main house at the museum still possess their 
original adobe dirt floors. Family portraits line the living room walls. 
</P>
<P>
Plummer House, which stood in Plummer Park in West Hollywood for more than a 
century until it was moved to the Leonis Adobe grounds in 1983, serves as a 
visitors center for the museum. John Plummer was a sailor and a major Hollywood 
landholder in the 1870s. The three-acre Leonis Adobe grounds also contain a 
picnic area, barnyard with farm animals and a windmill. 
</P>
<P>
Leonis Adobe is at 23537 Calabasas Road. It is open 1 to 4 p.m. Wednesdays 
through Sundays, and on Memorial Day, Fourth of July and Labor Day. Admission 
is free. Group tours are available by reservation. (818) 712-0734. 
</P>
<P>
* The Gordon R. Howard Museum in Burbank is housed in three buildings that 
document Valley life since the 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
The Mentzer House, a restored Victorian cottage built in 1887, has period 
furniture, photographs and memorabilia. Nora Mentzer, who was active in Burbank 
community service, lived in the house until its acquisition by the museum in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle museum features a 1937 Rolls-Royce, a 1939 Daimler, a 1949 Seagrave 
fire engine and a 1922 bus built by the Moreland Bus &amp; Truck Co. The main 
building contains a pictorial history of such area companies as Lockheed, Walt 
Disney and NBC as well as furniture and rugs from old hotels, Indian artifacts 
and portable offices used by Spanish noblemen in the 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The museum complex, named after Gordon R. Howard, a major benefactor, also 
contains Sandy Colvin's extensive camera collection, one of the largest in the 
United States. Antique dolls, a fire hat collection and photographs of Burbank 
resident and heavyweight boxing champion James Jeffries are also on display. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is at 1015 W. Olive Ave. Hours are 1 to 4 p.m. Sundays and other 
days by reservation to groups of 10 or more. Admission is free. (818) 841-6333. 
</P>
<P>
* The Valley College Historical Museum in Van Nuys is a repository of Valley 
history that includes archival material belonging to W. P. Whitsett, founder of 
Van Nuys. Whitsett was instrumental in bringing water to Southern California 
from the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
Lithographs, paintings, photographs and clothing on display document Valley 
life in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. A geological exhibit provides a 
record of rocks and fossils found in the Valley. Also on display are artifacts 
from ships sunk off the California coast, such as an anchor from a 
pre-Columbian Chinese ship and gear from American sailing ships. 
</P>
<P>
A collection of 70 cassettes and tapes recording Valley history as seen through 
the eyes of longtime Valley residents is a continuing project. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is at Valley College, 5800 Fulton Ave. (facing Burbank Boulevard at 
the south end of the campus). It is open 1 to 4 p.m. Mondays through Fridays 
except on college holidays and is open other times by appointment. Admission is 
free. (818) 781-1200, Ext. 373. 
</P>
<P>
* Bolton Hall Museum in Tujunga was built in 1913 from rocks gathered from the 
Tujunga Wash and local hillsides. The building was originally used as a meeting 
hall for the Little Landers Society, an early settlement, and now serves as a 
gathering spot for church groups, women's clubs and an arts society. 
</P>
<P>
William Smythe, founder of the Little Landers, named the structure after Bolton 
Hall, a writer friend. The building, restored in 1980, contains a museum that 
chronicles the Sunland-Tujunga area through artifacts, photographs and 
documents. On display are kitchenware from the 1800s and early 1900s, Indian 
artifacts of the Tujunga tribe and wood carvings by William Nicholson, an early 
grocer in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Bolton Hall, at 10110 Commerce Ave., is open 1 to 4 p.m. Tuesdays and Sundays. 
Admission is free. Group tours are available by reservation. (818) 352-3420. 
</P>
<P>
* The Andres Pico Adobe in Mission Hills, built in 1834 and restored in 1932, 
is thought to be the second-oldest adobe home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It features Victorian furniture of the style favored by Romulo and Catarina 
Pico, the occupants who modernized the house in 1874. Various rooms contain an 
1880 Weber square piano, Indian baskets, arrowhead collections, branding irons 
and, in the library, research material on California and Valley history. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't rope off rooms, except for my bedroom," said curator Elva Meline, who 
lives in the museum. "People can move around inside the rooms, and they really 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
The museum is at 10940 Sepulveda Blvd. and is open 1 to 4 p.m. Wednesdays 
through Sundays. It is closed on Easter, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, 
Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is free. Group tours are available by 
appointment. (818) 365-7810. 
</P>
<P>
* The Stagecoach Inn Museum in Newbury Park was constructed in 1876 as the 
Grand Union Hotel. A 1970 fire leveled the structure after it was moved in 1965 
to make room for the Ventura Freeway. The Conejo Valley Historical Society 
salvaged artifacts from the ashes and rebuilt the hotel, which reopened July 4, 
1976, 100 years after its original dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Artifacts and rare photographs of the Chumash Indians are found in Anderson 
Hall on the basement level. Also on display are flora, fauna, fossils and 
minerals of the Conejo Valley. A spool bed belonging to Robert Todd Lincoln is 
featured in one of the bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
A nature trail winds through native plantings, over wooden footbridges and a 
creek, ending at a Chumash Indian village, an early California adobe and a 
pioneer home. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, at 51 S. Ventu Park Road, is open from 1 to 4 p.m. Wednesdays, 
Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays. Guided tours are available by appointment.

</P>
<P>
* The Merle Norman Classic Beauty Collection in Sylmar was assembled in 1972 by 
J. B. Nethercutt, co-founder of Merle Norman Cosmetics, and his wife, Dorothy, 
to showcase and share their dedication to beauty and fine art. 
</P>
<P>
The opulent Grand Salon contains a changing display of 30 antique luxury cars, 
including a "Twenty-Grand Duesenberg" (Duesenberg Torpedo Sedan) that sold for 
$20,000 in 1933 and examples from all six of the Rolls-Royce Phantom series. 
</P>
<P>
A music room features antique music boxes, phonographs, a collection of musical 
watches, an extensive library of music rolls and the "Mighty Wurlitzer" theater 
organ that was used to play the score of the epic silent film "Napoleon." 
</P>
<P>
The mezzanine houses a collection of 1,100 hood ornaments. Among them are 
French Lalique crystal falcons and silver coiled cobras that once belonged to 
Rudolph Valentino. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is at 15180 Bledsoe St. in Sylmar. Two-hour guided tours, which

* The Chatsworth Museum, a repository of Chatsworth and Valley history, 
features photographs, Indian artifacts and garden implements used by early 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
A library and gift shop are next to the one-room museum. Minnie Palmer, who was 
born in Homestead Cottage on the property in 1886, preserved a pioneer life on 
the grounds, even forsaking electricity until the 1950s. Her home has been 
restored and filled with turn-of-the-century furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
The Chatsworth Historical Society, which operates the museum, will bury a time 
capsule on the property during Chatsworth's 100th anniversary celebration March 
10. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is at 10385 Shadow Oak Drive in Chatsworth Park South and is open 
from 1 to 4 p.m. the first Sunday of each month. Admission is free. (818) 
341-1529. 
</P>
<P>
* Los Encinos State Historical Park in Encino consists of a five-acre park that 
surrounds a nine-room house and museum. The museum features rooms that document 
historical periods from 1849 to 1945. Each room is dedicated to a different 
family and culture. 
</P>
<P>
On the property, a garden features herbs and vegetables that were grown in the 
1870s, and ducks freely roam, attracting handouts around a spring-fed man-made 
lake shaped like a Spanish guitar. 
</P>
<P>
"Families love coming out here with their kids to feed the ducks," said Ranger 
Russ Kimura. He added that the ducks prefer cracked corn, which is sold in the 
park for 25 cents a bag. 
</P>
<P>
The museum and park are at 16756 Moorpark St. It is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

THE NEW: GREETING YARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The front-yard card -- the suburban mega-message -- is taking root on local 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Grass Greetings in Reseda rents 4-foot-square four-color personalized cards in 
the shape of either a stork (for showers and just-borns), Father Time (for 
thirtysomething birthdays) or a party animal (a cheerful bear). Grass Greetings 
rents about seven to eight a week, "and the number is increasing rapidly," says 
Jan Tringale, who owns and manages the 1 1/2-year-old firm with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
The cards are most popular with people between 25 and 40, and the card that's 
rented most is the stork, Tringale says. She and her husband make the cards out 
of fiberglass and other weatherproof materials, and rent them from $19.95 a 
day, Monday through Thursday, to $104.74 for seven days. The price includes 
delivery, pickup and a diploma-size delivery certificate. 
</P>
<P>
Grass Greetings grew from Tringale's Midwest roots: She used to make big 
greeting cards for special events, such as graduation, and an aunt suggested 
that she try to market them. 
</P>
<P>
The year-old Rent-A-Stork in Woodland Hills -- part of a national franchise -- 
leases from two to seven 4 1/2-foot wooden storks a week, for $37 for five 
days. The personalized bundles, with such information as the child's name or 
weight, say "It's a Girl" or "It's a Boy." A $20 one-day standing stork is 
available for baby showers. 
</P>
<P>
When Jan Crivier of Canoga Park came home from the hospital with her first baby 
girl -- after three sons -- a Rent-A-Stork, arranged by her husband, Rick, 
greeted her on the front lawn. "My husband thought it would be better than 
flowers. All the neighbors saw the pink bundle and came by, knowing how 
thrilled we'd be," Jan says.

BEVERLY HILLS DELAYS ACTION ON ZONING CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to spare some residents from taking their dream house designs to a 
review board, the Beverly Hills City Council put off action on a new zoning 
code intended to stop the building of bigger houses in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, council members at their meeting Tuesday night asked planners to come 
up with new guidelines that would allow some Colonial-style homes or others 
with flat facades to be built without review board permission. 
</P>
<P>
"The sense of the council is to come up with standards to eliminate the 
subjectivity (of a review board), so someone will be able to understand that 
there's some rationale for acceptance or denial," Mayor Robert K. Tanenbaum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be repugnant to some people to go before some government board for 
permission to build what they have had a time-honored right to build," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approval Required 
</P>
<P>
The original proposal would have required the review board's approval for 
flat-front houses, unless they were built lower than other residences or placed 
further back on the lot, concessions that could mean less space inside. 
</P>
<P>
MeraLee Goldman, chairwoman of the city Planning Commission, argued against the 
change, saying some people would take advantage of a Colonial-style exemption 
to build bulky homes that led to the original revision of the zoning code. 
</P>
<P>
The commission suggested instead that houses designed with so-called facade 
modulations be encouraged. This type of design, with part of the house set back 
farther from the street, would have a less bulky look, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working on this for three years. This will undermine what we're 
doing," Goldman said. "The last time this was done, it gave us one 
cookie-cutter house that was built all over this city." 
</P>
<P>
But council members responded to appeals from residents, such as Tricia Moore, 
who said the establishment of a review board would discourage "traditional 
styles of architecture that have been around for centuries: Cape Cod, French 
Provincial. . . . There is a whole category of architecture that's being 
removed from the city." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said she was speaking as an individual, not in her capacity of executive 
vice president of the Beverly Hills Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing from several residents, some of whom made similar remarks at 
previous sessions, the City Council debated the changes for more than an hour, 
prompting Vice Mayor Max Salter to call for action. He said further discussion 
would mean that "you're not going to have a horse. You're going to have a 
camel." 
</P>
<P>
But the council concluded by asking staffers to come back with a new version by 
March 7. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying that we need protection for the neighbors, and at the same time 
we don't want to be overly restrictive with regard for what anyone can do with 
his own property," said Councilman Allan L. Alexander. "It's difficult to 
achieve because there are varying interests."

PASADENA PAINTER CAPTURES THE ESSENCE OF AFGHANISTAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Hidden under a sheet and surrounded by Afghan rebel soldiers in an ambulance, 
Peter S. Adams of Pasadena bumped his way across the legendary Khyber Pass into 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
In billowy shirt and draw-string pants, he had adopted the look of a 
moujahedeen, or holy warrior. He wore a traditional Nuristani hat to cover his 
golden hair, now dyed black. His long beard and eyebrows were also dyed. 
</P>
<P>
The only trace of his surfer good looks were his blue eyes. He had decided that 
contact lens to make his eyes look brown wouldn't be worth the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the blue eyes, he survived the passage across the border and into 
the mountainous, landlocked country of southwestern Asia. And he survived those 
six weeks in the fall of 1987 with the rebels, who were fighting the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Artistic Trip 
</P>
<P>
Peter Adams went to this foreign land not to fight. He went to paint. 
</P>
<P>
He sketched and painted his way across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bhutan, Tibet, 
China and India, creating 200 works of art during his seven-month Asian trip. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year since his return, Adams, 38, has told the story of his 
trip. His Afghanistan paintings also tell the story of a land and a people 
wounded and disabled by war. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, as the last Soviet soldier was leaving the country after 
Afghanistan's occupation of nine years, Adams spoke about his artistic journey. 
His work will be displayed Monday and Tuesday at Monterey Park's Bruggemeyer 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
Adams sold about 45 of the paintings from his Asian trip when his work was put 
on display last year at Adamson-Duvannes Galleries on the Westside. His works 
sell for as much as $15,000 and grace the walls of homes and galleries 
throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall he exhibited pastels from the Asian trip at the Pacific Asia Museum 
in Pasadena. David Kamansky, the museum's executive director, said Adams' 
"sense of light, color and space is very beautiful" in combination with a 
traditional style. 
</P>
<P>
That he went to Afghanistan, Adams said, had as much to do with his desire to 
paint and travel as with political conviction or wanting to help Afghan rebels 
or refugees. He is largely apolitical, even though his sister, Aileen Adams, 
has been active in Democratic party politics. "I don't think of myself as 
liberal or conservative, except on particular issues. But I did feel the 
Soviets were wrong." 
</P>
<P>
But what he saw inspired him to donate part of the sales from his paintings to 
the International Medical Corps. The Los Angeles-based organization was founded 
to set up medical clinics inside Afghanistan and help refugees outside the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
As much as anything, he made the trip because of his attraction to Asia. "I'm 
very much in love with the art, clothes and costumes and customs of the Orient. 
There are so many noble and enriching aspects of Asian cultures. Their 
histories go back thousands of years -- with buildings, architecture and 
fascinating art. 
</P>
<P>
"All this is disappearing and someday will be gone, just as our American Indian 
culture has vanished in comparison to what it once was." Adams wanted to record 
the culture before it disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
In his Pasadena studio, a light and airy place of skylights and arched windows, 
he spoke about his trip. Gold-framed paintings, resting on easels and propped 
along the walls, told as much as his words. 
</P>
<P>
The largest painting, a centerpiece work from his trip titled "Afghanistan 
Supply Line," depicts the band of 15 soldiers that he accompanied. The scene, 
in oil on a 4-by-5-foot canvas, shows the soldiers trekking across a rocky 
snowfield. The dawn sky of amber, grays and blues sets off the background of 
10,000-foot-high mountains. In the foreground, two soldiers carry AK-47 rifles. 
Another rides a burro, and others carry boxes of medical supplies and 
ammunitions. 
</P>
<P>
Another painting, inspired by his three-week stay in the Shangri-La-like 
kingdom of Bhutan, shows a red-robed holy man leaning on a staff. 
</P>
<P>
A procession of Tibetan holy men inspired another painting. They were gathered 
around the Panchen Lama, who was the second-highest holy leader in Tibet until 
his death Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' adventuresome artistic career was nurtured by a supportive family, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His late father was a Los Angeles real estate developer whose first love was 
acting -- he had a lengthy movie career that included being a stage husband to 
Claudette Colbert and Kitty Carlyle. Adams' father also appeared in such 
television shows as "Dallas" and "General Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
An aunt was a sculptor and a paternal grandmother, a painter. And Adams' 
maternal grandfather, George B. Seitz, started out to be a painter in 
Philadelphia, but instead became a screenwriter, producer and director. Seitz, 
who was credited with discovering the late composer George Gershwin, also was 
known as a writer, actor and the producer of serials including "The Perils of 
Pauline." And, as an MGM director, Seitz helped make Mickey Rooney a star. 
</P>
<P>
Adams first gained confidence as a painter when he was a high school student at 
the Harvard School in Studio City. Later, he briefly attended college in San 
Diego, because of its potential for good surfing, and came back to Los Angeles 
to attend the Art Center College of Design, which is now in Pasadena. But Adams 
dropped out at age 20 to become an apprentice of Theodore Lukits, a Hancock 
Park painter. 
</P>
<P>
For four years Adams studied with Lukits, whom Adams describes as a 
19th-Century-style painter. "It was like stepping back 100 years," Adams said. 
Then, as a journeyman, Adams stayed with Lukits for three more years before 
setting out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collecting Sights 
</P>
<P>
For the last 11 years, he has roamed the California countryside as well as the 
globe in search of images. "Painting gives me a good reason to travel, and I 
like color. If I wasn't a painter, I'd be a collector," he said. "You get going 
on a painting, and it becomes like a jigsaw puzzle. I'm always racking my brain 
and thinking about, how is this going to work and how is that going to work?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 he traveled unescorted through China. He was, he believes, the first 
Western artist to be allowed to do so. In Afghanistan, however, he was quite 
happy to have escorts and translators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't speak the language, and the approach he took in China would not have 
worked in an Afghanistan at war. (In China, Adams used note cards in Chinese to 
help him get around. But Adams, who is single, did not dare show the card that 
said: "Our eternal destiny is to be together.") 
</P>
<P>
In his travels with the soldiers, Adams never encountered actual fighting, 
seeing only the aftermath. Even before crossing the border into Afghanistan, he 
spent one long and trying month in Peshawar, Pakistan, waiting to get word from 
rebels whom he had been trying to persuade to take him across. In Peshawar he 
went to the refugee hospitals almost daily to paint portraits of the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impressed by Spirit 
</P>
<P>
Today, when he looks at the photographic slides he took there, he still is 
touched by what he refers to as the undaunted spirit of the Afghan people. As 
he showed the slides to a visitor, he pointed out one of the most poignant 
images of the trip: a soldier whose arms had been amputated being served a cup 
of water by his smiling little son. 
</P>
<P>
In Peshawar, a border city rife with rumors, reports of spies and 
counter-spies, and restaurant bombings by saboteurs, Adams said he felt more 
frightened than in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
His most difficult time with the soldiers came not from bullets but from fleas. 
After staying in a village home, he came away with what he estimated to be 
close to 200 flea bites. 
</P>
<P>
And in western China, one unfortunate encounter was with a shopkeeper in a 
marketplace who became disturbed by Adams' painting and attracting a crowd. The 
man grabbed Adams' brush and ran it across the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of time painting was kind of a battle. You get this idea that it would 
be so serene, Zen and peaceful and meditative. But in a marketplace you get 
hundreds of people crowding around and shoving. And you get an audience 
applauding." 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 28, he achieved that odd kind of momentary recognition that only 
Hollywood bestows. 
</P>
<P>
The television show "Jeopardy!" referred to Adams when the clue card read: 
"While working in the Himalayas, artist Peter Adams had to put vodka and gin in 
his paints to prevent this." 
</P>
<P>
Correct answer: "What is: 'to keep from freezing'?"

PLAN B: YET ANOTHER VARIATION ON A FREEWAY THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SOUTH PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor James Woollacott leans against the railing of the York Boulevard Bridge, 
on the city's boundary with Los Angeles, and lets his eyes sweep across the 
scene. A segment of the Pasadena Freeway, buzzing with morning traffic, bends 
away to the east. Water trickles down a flood-control ditch. 
</P>
<P>
Extending north of the freeway, a narrow swath of greenery -- bushes and grass 
littered with a few rusty automobile parts -- stretches up the Arroyo Seco. 
</P>
<P>
"A piece of dirt," says Woollacott wryly, dismissing the undeveloped green 
strip. Here's where the city would like to see the long-planned missing link of 
the Long Beach Freeway merge with the Pasadena Freeway. Put it here, Woollacott 
and his fellow council members fervently argue, not where the California 
Department of Transportation wants to build it, along Meridian Avenue, a block 
or so from the commercial center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What's more important?" muses the 71-year-old mayor, a slim, dapper man with a 
neat white mustache. "Putting a piece of useless land to productive use or 
putting 500 families out on the street just to save that piece of dirt?" 
</P>
<P>
The cluttered strip of urban back yard below the bridge, seemingly far from 
South Pasadena's quaint mansions and tightknit suburban neighborhoods, 
represents the last battleground in a war that has consumed the city for more 
than a quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
A group of residents of the city's west side will discuss various freeway 
options at Arroyo Vista School Auditorium, 335 El Centro St., at 7:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
As Caltrans moves quickly toward completion of environmental studies for the 
proposed freeway extension, which will ultimately link the 10, 110 and 210 
freeways, Woollacott and the City Council are making a last-ditch stand on a 
proposal that would encroach on the Arroyo Seco. 
</P>
<P>
"Plan B," as they call the proposal, to distinguish it from a dozen or so other 
plans considered since 1960 by Caltrans, would not only take the freeway out of 
the middle of town but reduce the number of homes that would have to be 
demolished by about 500, Woollacott says. 
</P>
<P>
As drawn by freeway consultant Jess Reynolds in 1973, the Plan B route slants 
across the southwest corner of the city and follows South Pasadena's boundary 
with Los Angeles to the Arroyo Seco, the dry riverbed that runs south of the 
Rose Bowl. Then it would "co-mingle" with the Pasadena Freeway, either running 
side by side with the older freeway or joining it as a second deck. 
</P>
<P>
It would require using a half-mile-long corridor in the Arroyo Seco. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is a variation of the option known as the "Westerly Route," rejected 
by Caltrans as too costly and destructive. Plan B veers from the Westerly Route 
north Avenue 60 and rejoins the Westerly Route about 1 1/2 miles to the north 
at Orange Grove Avenue. As plotted by Caltrans, the Westerly Route would also 
swing away from the center of South Pasadena to the city line. It would have 
knocked out dozens of homes along Monterey Road and Pasadena Avenue, crossing 
the Pasadena Freeway near Orange Grove Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
But Plan B is beginning to look more and more like a long shot, some state 
officials and residents say. Just to get it on the Caltrans table may require 
action by both the state Legislature and the U. S. Congress, bypassing the 
green patch's designation as protected "parkland," to say nothing of overcoming 
a burgeoning resistance movement from the west side of town. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Long Beach Freeway continues to abruptly drop off the map 
at Valley Boulevard in Alhambra. With no link to the freeways to the north, 
complain residents of neighboring cities, north-south traffic has been 
hemorrhaging into local streets in Alhambra, Pasadena and South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure is on Caltrans to close the gap. "It's probably the most 
outstanding example of a freeway gap in the Los Angeles region," says Jack 
Hallin, Caltrans' chief of project development for the region. "It's indicative 
of the problems of building in a built-up area. Everyone wants the freeway -- 
'but not in my back yard.' " 
</P>
<P>
As the 29-year-old debate moves toward its fateful conclusion, the strategy 
sessions and behind-the-scenes maneuvering are picking up markedly in 
intensity, all parties concede. In the past month, city officials have held a 
series of meetings with Caltrans officials, and they have huddled regularly 
with their Sacramento-based lobbyist and their special legal representative. 
</P>
<P>
"No big deal," cracks City Manager John Bernardi, who has been in the thick of 
it. "We just have to extend our days to 26 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Among the hurdles the city faces: 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is an eyelash away from putting its money on the so-called "Meridian 
Variation," a route that would complete the freeway by plowing straight through 
the middle of town, roughly along Meridian Avenue. A final environmental impact 
study on the "Meridian Variation" was submitted more than three months ago to 
the Federal Highway Administration, which would provide most of the funds for 
it. Final approval could come as soon as May, Caltrans officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Plan B must overcome state law, which specifically prohibits the use of Arroyo 
Seco land for building a freeway, and federal law, which prohibits any federal 
project on previously designated parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Recent arrivals to South Pasadena's west side have provided new energy in 
building resistance to what some refer to as the "Eastern Establishment," the 
city's elected officials, and their determination to shunt the freeway 
westward. Organized as South Pasadenans Against the Westerly Route, they have 
begun forging alliances with residents groups in adjoining cities. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, city officials are optimistic that they can wrest major 
concessions from the state. 
</P>
<P>
"South Pasadena is not a freeway obstructionist," Woollacott said. "Everywhere 
we go, we get the response, 'Oh, you guys are the freeway fighters.' But we've 
been trying to get this thing built since way back in the late 1960s. It's just 
that we thought that there was a better way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Door-to-Door Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Feisty residents in the western part of the city, who would be most affected by 
Plan B, have no such qualms. South Pasadenans Against the Westerly Route 
(S.P.A.R.) has appointed block captains to carry the message door-to-door that 
the city has been "unfair" to their community. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying to the mayor, 'We don't think you should save the city by 
sacrificing the west,' " said Mavis Minjares, a member of the group. "We're a 
part of the city, too." 
</P>
<P>
The choices are clear cut, city officials insist: Caltrans can split the city 
in half and demolish 1,267 homes in South Pasadena and neighboring El Sereno to 
build the Meridian Variation. Or it can skirt the center of town and demolish 
only 762 homes in the two communities under Plan B. 
</P>
<P>
The Meridian Variation would be 6.2 miles long and cost about $425 million to 
complete. The Westerly Route studied by Caltrans, somewhat similar in 
configuration to Plan B, would be 7.1 miles long, and cost $476 million. No one 
knows how much Plan B would cost. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials say they're open to city suggestions. "We're talking to 
them," says Jack Hallin, Caltrans' chief of project development for the area. 
"We're listening to what they have to say." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Two Problems' 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is in the midst of a preliminary feasibility study of Plan B, to 
determine approximate costs and consequences to neighborhoods in its path. 
Pressed, however, Hallin expressed doubt. "There are two problems with that 
alignment," he said, "state law and federal law." 
</P>
<P>
The city has appealed to state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) to help overcome 
a 1975 state law prohibiting further encroachments of freeways into the Arroyo 
Seco. According to city officials, Torres, who represents South Pasadena, is 
preparing a bill to permit a freeway corridor of about half a mile, where the 
Long Beach and Pasadena freeways would merge. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokeswoman for Torres would not confirm that the senator was committed 
to such a course. "We're still looking at a variety of options and trying to 
gather all viewpoints," said Torres' aide Beth Bonbright. "It's a very 
difficult, emotional issue." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that Torres has until March 10 to "drop something into the hopper" 
during the current legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming state restrictions are eased, Hallin said, federal constraints may be 
even more resistant. The crucial federal law is a section of the Transportation 
Act of 1966, prohibiting the construction of federal projects on parkland 
unless "there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of such land." 
</P>
<P>
"Congress has not been disposed to waiving environmental law," Hallin said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has adopted a we'll-cross-that-bridge-when-we-come-to-it stance on the 
federal question. "Somewhere in the great United States there must be a freeway 
that runs through a park," says Woollacott. "Where there's one, there can be 
two." 
</P>
<P>
"All we can do is take care of the local (or state) level first," adds 
Bernardi. "Then we can move to the federal level." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Injunction 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Freeway's missing link has been debated, railed against and 
fought in South Pasadena ever since Caltrans first adopted the Meridian Route 
in 1964. In 1973, South Pasadena, which has always prided itself on its 
small-town atmosphere, joined with environmental groups to successfully sue for 
a federal injunction on the project. The plaintiffs argued that the state's 
environmental review procedures were inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction still stands. Even if the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) 
approves the project in May, state attorneys acknowledge, Caltrans must go to 
Los Angeles Federal Court to ask that the injunction be lifted. The city has 
already stated its intention to challenge that request, should Caltrans proceed 
with the Meridian Variation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, a federal advisory committee on historic preservation dropped another 
major roadblock in front of the project, recommending to the FHA that the 
project be rejected because the original Meridian Route took out too many of 
the city's historic homes. Hence, Caltrans created the Meridian Variation, 
which swung around the city's historic district on Mission Street and avoided 
the distinctive homes on Monterey Road and on the small, tree-lined lanes north 
of Mission. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, voters were asked in a city-sponsored advisory referendum whether the 
city should continue to fight against a Meridian route for the freeway. The 
voters voted overwhelmingly in the affirmative. Ever since, the city has used 
the 71% "yes" vote on Proposition GG, as it was titled, as a rationale for 
continuing its efforts to shunt the freeway link to the west side of town. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sore point for S.P.A.R. members. "A lot of people who voted for GG 
weren't for a westerly route at all," said Minjares "They were for a 'no-build' 
option." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Expensive 
</P>
<P>
The west-side residents argue that a Meridian route would be less expensive and 
have less of an environmental impact than Plan B, because of the two plans' 
contrasting requirements. "The Westerly route would have to be elevated, while 
the Meridian route would be submerged," noted Minjares. "Noise and pollution 
will be much more difficult to control on the west side of town." 
</P>
<P>
Council members express dismay that they appear to be working to protect one 
part of the city while sacrificing another. "It's not an easy thing to think 
that you may be part of a decision to take anybody's house," said Woollacott. 
"That bothers me a lot. But I was elected to represent a city." 
</P>
<P>
City officials, depicting the Meridian Variation as the would-be "destruction 
of South Pasadena," have said that the city will fight to the end to prevent 
Caltrans from building along that route. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the council voted to retain San Francisco attorney Antonio 
Cosby-Rossman to represent the city in a possible court challenge to the 
Caltrans plan. Council members also voted to use Community Redevelopment Agency 
funds to pay for the litigation, which they estimated could cost as much as 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Old-timers in South Pasadena are sticking to their guns in the face of 
adversity. But most have learned to be blase about the freeway issue even while 
they rush to shore up their positions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our main concern," says Bernardi. "It's always been our main concern. But 
it's been on our minds for so long, it's almost second nature now."

SCHOOL BOARD VOTES TO ACQUIRE RESIDENTIAL LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents and business owners reluctant to leave a four-acre parcel by Wilson 
High School will have to go, the Long Beach Unified School District decided 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
In a 4-1 vote, the school board Tuesday night approved a plan to buy the 
properties bordered by Bennett and Ximeno avenues, between 7th and 8th streets. 
The land is needed to replace physical education facilities that will be lost, 
they said, when a proposed science building is constructed on a campus athletic 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jerry Schultz cast the dissenting vote. Agreeing with the 
protesting homeowners and renters, Schultz said, "We're looking to seize an 
entire block of property to put in a soccer field." 
</P>
<P>
Resident Maria Barnett, who had organized her neighbors to battle the 
district's plan, said her group may continue its fight in a courtroom. 
Barnett's Long Beach Neighborhood Coalition filed a lawsuit last month against 
the district. "They still have to deal with the owners, which is going to be a 
problem," Barnett said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
One apartment building owner, Caryl Miller, told the school board, "I feel that 
uprooting people instead of trees and tennis balls is a violation of human 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
Miller was referring to alternative plans that would have the school district 
acquiring Rogers Field, Billie Jean King Tennis Courts and Blair Field instead 
of commercial and residential properties. But those plans created other 
problems, according to district officials. They also raised the ire of tennis 
players such as Judy Elder, who collected about 400 signatures -- and a letter 
from tennis champion Billie Jean King -- in hopes of preserving the recreation 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
School board members expressed sympathy for the residents. But the majority 
insisted that buying the four-acre parcel was in the best interest of students. 
</P>
<P>
"We must come down on the side of education," board member Bobbie Smith told 
the approximately 100 people gathered for the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching physical education, said board member Jenny Oropeza, is "a legitimate 
part of our mission."

RECALL ELECTION DATE SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has set May 23 as the date for a recall election regarding 
Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak. 
</P>
<P>
The Council's action came after more than 3,000 signatures of San Gabriel 
voters on recall petitions were certified by the county registrar-recorder. The 
petitioners say that Blaszcak, who was elected last April, has misused the 
powers of his office. 
</P>
<P>
Blaszcak angered his critics by buying a $2,100 portable telephone at city 
expense and by making nocturnal visits to City Hall, which they considered 
improper. Blaszcak has returned the telephone and has insisted that his City 
Hall visits were solely to pick up his mail. 
</P>
<P>
Blaszcak, charging that the recall drive was based on lies and 
misrepresentations, has challenged Dorothy Schneider, the longtime San Gabriel 
resident who organized the recall campaign, to a public debate. "It's the 
American way to be able to face your accusers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider said Wednesday that she would not debate Blaszcak. "If he wants a 
debate, he can debate anybody he wants to," she said. "I'm certainly not going 
to debate him. Facts are facts." She said the issues had been discussed "too 
much" in the press and in the City Council.

BUILDING SAFETY SURVEY OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted to spend $80,000 to $100,000 on a survey to identify 
buildings that might collapse or be seriously damaged in a moderate or strong 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, which is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 1, will include all 
buildings constructed before 1934 that have more than 100 occupants, and all 
buildings completed before 1976 with more than 300 occupants. The city first 
adopted seismic building standards after the Long Beach earthquake in 1933, and 
it approved tougher standards in 1976 after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The survey will pave the way for a law to upgrade hazardous buildings in the 
city. That law will target unreinforced masonry buildings, which are the most 
likely to collapse during a strong earthquake.

SNAPSHOTS: CHARLES J. RAMIREZ: FROM BROADCAST NEWS TO PREACHING 'THE GOOD NEWS' 
OF JESUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYBIL BAKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven years ago, Father Charles J. Ramirez, associate pastor of Church of the 
Nativity in El Monte, was a television newscaster in Sacramento. But, he says, 
"I decided I'd rather be preaching the good news of Jesus rather than just the 
news." 
</P>
<P>
No sudden conversion caused his shift in careers, but a series of whispers that 
eventually swelled to a calling. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic church on North Tyler Avenue, where Ramirez is saying the 9 a.m. 
Sunday Mass, is large, beige, mutedly modern in design. 
</P>
<P>
As Ramirez delivers the homily, he strolls halfway down the aisle. He is 41, 
slightly chunky, moving easily in his vestments, with jet-black hair and dark 
warm eyes, bright as a bird's, that beam with warmth and contentment. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez describes his congregation as roughly 60% Latino, 30% Anglo and 10% 
Asian, predominantly Filipino and Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
Nativity is a charismatic renewal Catholic church, which is more evangelical 
than traditional Catholicism. The 400 or so attending the service shake hands 
before it starts and hold hands afterwards, reaching across the aisle so that 
the whole congregation is linked. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez came to Nativity in June of 1987 as a deacon and was ordained Sept. 5 
that year, when he became an associate pastor. 
</P>
<P>
From 1974 to 1978 in Sacramento, first at the CBS affiliate and later at the 
ABC affiliate, he was a field reporter. The police beat, the City Council, the 
school board. A human interest series, "Around California." ("Like Charles 
Kuralt," he says, "but not as good.") 
</P>
<P>
And then newscasting began to be frustrating in unexpected ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember covering a story in the poor section of Sacramento, working the 
swing shift," he said. "A woman was shot by her ex-son-in-law. You never leave 
the scene of a murder till you get a shot of the body being brought out on the 
gurney. 
</P>
<P>
"This woman was the mother of a big family, about eight kids." He tells how the 
children drove up one by one and reacted to the tragedy. "The members of the 
family didn't want us to shoot the body," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the TV crew got its pictures. The gurney was being wheeled away when one of 
the woman's daughters broke out from the gathering and ran after it, pleading, 
"Let me touch her one more time!" Ramirez recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like a vulture, waiting there. I thought, Something's not right here, 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
He moved from the station to General Dynamics, a defense contractor, doing 
in-house TV shows, and he started teaching a class at a local parish. By 1982, 
the charismatic renewal movement was well established, and it became central in 
Ramirez's life. 
</P>
<P>
He had been brought up a Catholic in Azusa, the son of a salesman and a mother 
who later became a real estate agent, and attended what was then Pomona 
Catholic Boys High School and then Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, he said, "my concept of God wasn't a loving concept, more of a 
policeman in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
His grandmother always wanted a priest in the family, "but I always fought it," 
he said. "I wanted to get married and have a family and everything." 
</P>
<P>
In his room at home, there had been a picture of Jesus Christ ministering to a 
throng of the faithful. And Ramirez imitates how he felt as a youngster. "Can I 
ever find myself there? Nah -- that's for people who are straight-A students 
and have their lives together." In time, he said, "the picture starts coming 
into focus." At the end of seminary training, "the archbishop says OK, you can 
step into that picture and become part of it." 
</P>
<P>
The God of charismatic renewal is primarily a God of love, Ramirez says. "You 
know what it's like when someone loves you? There's a great sense of joy in 
that. Someone would walk to the ends of the Earth for you -- that's what it was 
like, my relation to Jesus. . . . So when I saw him more as lover than accuser, 
then it clicked." 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying this "great sense of peace," he said, was a feeling that you want 
"to give it back. . . . People always ask, 'What meaning does life have for 
me?' That's not the question. The question is, 'What meaning can I give to 
life?' " 
</P>
<P>
The key had clicked in the door, and now the door opened. In 1982, he entered 
St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, where he learned the Spanish in which he says 
some of the Masses. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez believes that his story is more ordinary than most people would think. 
"There are more vocations than there are priests," he said, explaining that the 
world has "so much static" that many with a calling for it never make it to the 
priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, he concedes, the ban on marriage discourages many. "I think marriage 
should be optional for priests," he said. "But you'd have to find a really 
understanding wife." 
</P>
<P>
Living in a rectory means a priest is available at all hours, like a mother, he 
said. "I'm so exhausted at the end of the day," he said, that "it wouldn't be 
fair to my own family. . . . I myself couldn't serve two masters." On his day 
off he sleeps, visits his family, and sometimes takes in an escapist movie. (" 
'Naked Gun' was hilarious.") 
</P>
<P>
He is more trusting and less cynical, he said, than in the days when he was a 
TV reporter. And a great deal happier. 
</P>
<P>
As a TV newscaster, he said, "I had to remain removed from my subject. I did a 
story about a little girl who gets abducted. I wanted to console the mother, 
but it wasn't my job to offer consolation. Now I can console people, get 
intimately involved. Not only in the tragedies, but in the joyous events, the 
baptisms and marriages. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of neat."

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA; 
</P>
<P>
PURCHASE OF RIGHT OF WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors has urged the county Transportation Commission 
to buy the Santa Fe railroad right of way from downtown Los Angeles to Pasadena 
for construction of a light rail transit line. 
</P>
<P>
Light rail cars would reach Pasadena through Highland Park. The railroad right 
of way is one of two Los Angeles-Pasadena alignments under study by the county 
Transportation Commission. The other alignment, which is favored by Alhambra, 
would bring the line along Main Street through El Sereno, and then turn north 
along the extension of the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on recommendations from its Light Rail Alignment Task Force and 
Transportation Advisory Commission, the Pasadena board urged the county 
Transportation Commission to refrain from tying the transit line to the 
long-delayed Long Beach Freeway project. In addition, the board noted that by 
buying the Santa Fe right of way east to San Bernardino, the commission could 
preserve the right of way for a commuter rail line to supplement the Los 
Angeles-Pasadena trolley system. 
</P>
<P>
The county commission has completed a draft environmental impact report for the 
Main Street and Highland Park alignments from Los Angeles to El Sereno and 
South Pasadena. Pasadena is conducting studies of light rail alignments through 
Pasadena. The Pasadena board this week urged the county commission to finance 
environmental studies of the route through Pasadena as quickly as possible so 
that the commission can consider the entire line when it begins making 
decisions on when to provide funds for construction.

COUNTY YIELDS WATER RIGHTS FOR BUSINESS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a deal to provide water for its expanding Rancho Los Amigos business park, 
Los Angeles County has agreed to pay Downey $295,000 and give the city water 
rights worth another $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, approved Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors, eliminates the 
need to spend $1.5 million to refurbish and enlarge the current water system 
that serves the Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Downey, which is planning an expansion of its water system, has agreed to 
provide water to the new business park, Downey Municipal Court and the county 
library in Downey, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Business park development already has been approved for 37 acres south of 
Imperial Highway and east of Old River School Road near Rancho Los Amigos 
Hospital. Another 113 acres is expected to be developed.

A COURT, NOT A JAIL PLANNED

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors formally reassured Monterey Park on Tuesday that the 
county plans to build a $45-million Children's Court in that city, not a new 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
The city's redevelopment agency tentatively agreed Feb. 10 to sell four acres 
to the county for $3.5 million for construction of the court. But some 
officials expressed concern that the site might be used for a jail because it 
is next to the county's women's jail, the Sybil Brand Institute, supervisors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors directed that a letter be written to Monterey Park, affirming 
the county's intentions.

SANTA MONICA RENT CONTROL DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Yarmark recently wrote comparing his experiences in a Polish 
concentration camp with Santa Monica's rent control law. (Times, Feb. 5.) While 
I feel sympathy for anyone who has endured the horrors of a concentration camp, 
I must correct his misstatements of the facts about rent control. 
</P>
<P>
He claims that the Santa Monica Rent Control Board has prevented him from using 
his land or getting out of the rental business. This is completely false. Mr. 
Yarmark did withdraw his property from rental use under the Ellis Act and 
evicted all of his tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Under two recent court decisions, the Ellis Act entitles him to evict all his 
tenants and to be free of the removal-permit requirements of the Santa Monica 
Rent Control Board. The removal permit is normally required of any landlord who 
wishes to demolish a building containing rental units. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Mr. Yarmark chooses to rent the property again, the rent control law no 
longer affects his rights in his property. (If he did choose to return the 
units for use as residential rental property, the rent control law would 
guarantee him a fair return on his property.) Despite his assertion that he is 
a "minority" as a landlord, Mr. Yarmark has ceased to be a landlord by his 
withdrawal of the property from rental use. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mr. Yarmark must still comply with other state and local laws to get 
permission to demolish his property. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that the city include in its general plan a housing element, 
which assures that housing needs for all income groups will be addressed. The 
city has adopted a housing element that seeks to preserve the number of 
affordable rental units in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Yarmark appears to believe that he has a constitutional right to do 
anything he wants with his property. However, regulation of the uses of land in 
Santa Monica has been in effect long before Mr. Yarmark came here to live. He 
would have needed a permit then to build, demolish or otherwise develop the 
property, and he still needs one now. 
</P>
<P>
There is no "right" to develop property and thereby obtain greater profits at 
the expense of the community. The development of property is a privilege that 
may be limited by local government for the protection of the general welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Yarmark is confusing "justice" with his personal desires to make more 
money. It is understandable that he may wish to make more money. However, his 
personal desires for greater profit do not excuse him from compliance with 
permit requirements, any more than a driver's personal desires for greater 
speed should excuse him from compliance with speed limits. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mr. Yarmark did apply for a demolition permit, and his application was 
recently approved by the city of Santa Monica. Apparently, he wrote his letter 
to the editor before the application was granted.

SHORT, FAST TRIP AT LAX; 
</P>
<P>
CLASS ON FEAR OF FLYING GETS TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time Ada got up the nerve to fly was five years ago. It was a flight 
from Florida to California and she nervously paced the aisle the entire trip. 
She wasn't herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I had five Valiums and four glasses of wine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 15 years since Don last flew. That flight -- for reasons he still 
can't pinpoint -- left him afraid to fly, even though as a child he often 
accompanied his father, a private pilot, into the wild blue yonder. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had a horrible anxiety attack," the 45-year-old Huntington Beach 
resident said. "God, I couldn't breathe, I thought I was having a heart attack, 
I broke out in a cold sweat. It was like my heart had stopped and I was in 
suspended animation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meet Once Weekly 
</P>
<P>
Don and Ada are among 34 people who have met once a week at a South Bay hotel 
since January, hoping to overcome their fear of flying -- a phobia that some 
experts say afflicts as many as 25 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
For six weeks now, they have gathered one evening a week to listen to Carol 
Stauffer, a clinical social worker, and former USAir pilot Frank Petee. They 
tell them why they should not be afraid. A large part of their message boils 
down to this: 
</P>
<P>
The odds of being fatally injured while flying are a whole lot less than while 
cruising a Southern California freeway. One estimate says that on a per-mile 
basis, a person is a hundred times more likely to die on a highway than in an 
airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"The most common fear is not being in control of the situation, that you are 
turning your life over to someone else," said Stauffer, who has taught the 
class since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Never Hear Good Things' 
</P>
<P>
"You almost never hear the good things about flying," she said in an interview. 
"It is not newsworthy." 
</P>
<P>
Stauffer and Petee conduct their classes for USAir. It is similar to others 
conducted around the country by different individuals or groups. Students, who 
pay a $250 fee, come from all walks of life. Despite their dread of flying, 
most of them do so out of necessity and they enrolled in the class to make the 
experience less traumatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Just sheer grit gets them on the airplane," Stauffer said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's session was a major event for the students, especially those who 
had not set foot aboard an aircraft for some time. The lesson plan: Sit aboard 
a jetliner at Los Angeles International Airport as it races down a runway. 
</P>
<P>
No, there is no takeoff. The class is not ready to leave the ground just yet. 
This is just a warm up. The jetliner reaches a speed of 138 m.p.h. before 
braking to a halt. Petee described the experience to the students as an "almost 
takeoff," designed to link what they have learned in class with the actual 
experience of being on a moving plane. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the hotel for the airport, the class was introduced to the 
aircraft's crew, including its three flight attendants. The attendants 
explained how they are trained to handle any emergency that might arise during 
a flight. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the obvious question is, 'Have any of you been involved in an 
evacuation?," one student asked. 
</P>
<P>
No, the attendants replied, although one said she had been aboard an aircraft 
when its cabin lost air pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens in that?" asked another student. 
</P>
<P>
"You die," joked another student. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crew Introduced 
</P>
<P>
Once the students were assured that depressurization -- when oxygen masks drop 
from the plane's ceiling -- is nothing to fear, the other crew members were 
introduced. Next, the classroom lights were dimmed and Stauffer led the 
students through some relaxation exercises. They were told to wrinkle their 
foreheads by raising their eyebrows. Stauffer slowly counted to five, then told 
them to relax. 
</P>
<P>
The students then headed for the airport, where they gathered at about 9:30 
p.m. at Terminal 1, Gate 14. 
</P>
<P>
Some appeared confident, others nervous as they looked out a window at the 727 
that they would board. 
</P>
<P>
As she waited, a woman with fear of flying named Kim said she had not flown for 
about a year and half. She said her fear was gradual and may have begun years 
ago when an airliner crashed near her home in the Chicago area. "I had worked 
myself up to the point where I would almost cry before I had to fly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Once they were aboard the jetliner and strapped to their seats, the students 
repeated the relaxation exercises. Then the plane began to taxi as Petee gave a 
nonstop commentary over the plane's public address system, telling students 
exactly what was happening inside the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, air traffic controllers gave permission for the make-believe 
takeoff to begin, and Petee passed the word along. He kept talking as the 
aircraft headed down the runway. 
</P>
<P>
"The airplane is already accelerating quite fast. We are already up to 80 
knots, 100 knots . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Let's get it on," Don blurted out, grinning nervously. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . 115 knots, 120 knots," Petee continued. 
</P>
<P>
Then the student passengers felt as if they were being pulled forward, the way 
air passengers normally feel during a landing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are reversing," Petee explained. "The brakes are on, the power is back and 
the spoilers are up." 
</P>
<P>
The students, now familiar with such terms, applauded, and Petee asked if they 
wanted to try it again. They did. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that was so much easier than the first one," Don said after the second 
trip down the runway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congratulations 
</P>
<P>
Back at the gate, people who once might have rushed off a plane lingered on 
board, congratulating themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A student named Elizabeth said she was not frightened by the experience. "I 
knew we weren't going anywhere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another student, a middle-aged woman who did not want to divulge even her first 
name, voiced a similar sentiment: "I have a great sense of reality. I wasn't in 
the air." 
</P>
<P>
But 36-year-old Celia, who stopped flying more than a dozen years ago, 
proclaimed a personal victory. "I am so proud of myself, I am elated," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Celia said she is still apprehensive about the one-hour graduation flight that 
she and the other students were to take this week. Nevertheless, she said, she 
will definitely be there. 
</P>
<P>
As for Ada, she had "no problem" with racing down the runway. And she, too, 
said she will attend the graduation flight. Being afraid to fly, she said, puts 
a crimp in your travel plans. Pretty soon, she said, you run out of places you 
can drive to. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen all of California."

NOT SO GREAT SWIMMER BETTER THAN MOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The rap against UCLA's Craig Oppel is that he is good. Very good. 
</P>
<P>
But not great. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he won a gold medal in swimming at the Seoul Olympics. But he won it as 
an alternate on the U.S. 800-meter freestyle relay team and did not swim in the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
And at last year's National Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship meet, he 
scored 27 points, yet failed to win an individual event for the third 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
That may be so, but Oppel, a psychology major, rationalizes that not many 
people have been where he's been. The NCAA championship next month figures to 
be his last competitive meet and then he plans to attend law school in the 
fall. Swimming has been good to him, he says, but it's time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"Few people have finished second, and even fewer have won. I wanted to win, but 
it just didn't happen," said Oppel, donned in an Olympic jacket and gold ring. 
"Right now it (not winning an NCAA title) bothers me, but hopefully I can 
rectify that this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll look back on swimming very favorably. I have a lot of fond memories. I've 
traveled all around the world free. As far as swimming goes, getting to be part 
of the U.S. team and the UCLA team. Getting to meet great people. The list goes 
on and on." 
</P>
<P>
When Oppel arrived at UCLA he emphasized four goals: 
</P>
<P>
* To win an individual and a team NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
* To win a title at a U.S. national meet. 
</P>
<P>
* To win a world title. 
</P>
<P>
* To win an Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Now into his senior season, Oppel has accomplished three of those goals. In 
1986 he swam the butterfly leg of the winning 400-meter medley relay at the 
World Championships in Madrid. In 1987 he won a national title at the Long 
Course Nationals in the 200-meter freestyle, and then came the gold medal in 
Seoul this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming out of high school (Valley High in Des Moines, Iowa) I had seen 
numerous people with 'potential,' the kiss of death," Oppel said. "I didn't 
want to be one of those people who had potential and didn't foster it." 
</P>
<P>
But the one goal eluding him would appear to be easiest: the NCAA title. Last 
year he swam a season-best 1:35.08 in the 200-yard freestyle final but placed 
second to Doug Gjertsen of the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
At practice, Oppel does not need to convey his desire to win an NCAA title this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone understands that I want it this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said UCLA Coach Ron Ballatore: "He was a quiet leader the first three years, 
but this year you hear more than ever before. He feels like he's more part of 
the team than he's been before." 
</P>
<P>
Oppel's return to the UCLA team this season resembles the experience of another 
former Bruin swimmer, Brian Goodell, Ballatore said. Goodell won two gold 
medals at the 1976 Montreal Games in world record times while still in high 
school. When Goodell came to UCLA, people wondered what he would do for an 
encore. 
</P>
<P>
"I was concerned about Craig in the fall," Ballatore said. "But he's very loyal 
to the program. He felt that he really wanted to finish this season. He has 
things left that he hasn't accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he finished fifth at the Olympic trials in Indianapolis, Oppel felt 
that he had a chance to swim in the finals in Seoul. It looked as if he would 
after he swam on the team that finished first in its qualifying heat. 
</P>
<P>
Relay teams, however, are not set until the day of the final, and that morning 
he swam what he calls one of his two bad meets in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that he had a good chance to swim in the finals. He swam the fastest 
200 meters in the world the year before," said Ballatore, who was Oppel's guest 
coach in Seoul. "He just didn't swim a good leg. That's about all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
Said Oppel: "In this sport, you have your ups and downs and that was one of my 
downs. . . . You're dealing with a sport measured in hundredths of seconds. 
Medals are decided in less time than it takes to blink an eye." 
</P>
<P>
The perception that the Olympics serve as a gathering place to interact with 
athletes from around the world did not hold true for Oppel. The majority of 
Oppel's spare time in Seoul was spent with the 10 past or present Bruins 
swimmers there. 
</P>
<P>
One thing Oppel did want to do was exchange uniforms with athletes from 
Iceland, where he was born, but they left before closing ceremonies before 
Oppel could negotiate the trade. 
</P>
<P>
"The only experience you have with foreigners are people you know through 
swimming in international meets," Oppel said. "As far as athletes from other 
nations and other sports, each had their own niche. You might play Ping-Pong 
against a German weight lifter or snooker against a Russian gymnast." 
</P>
<P>
Nearing the end of his swimming career does not seem to bother Oppel. When he 
is recognized on campus as the Olympic swimmer, he squirms. 
</P>
<P>
His gold medal from Seoul lies on his desk at home -- under a pile of books. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm at the pool I'm an intense competitor," he said, "but I really just 
want to be another person when I'm away from the pool."

<P>
Presidents Day was no holiday for the fish. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers who took advantage of the long holiday weekend caught a variety of fish 
that put lumps into the sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Halibut and sculpin made up most of the catches, with the deep-water rock cod 
boats scoring limits on two-day trips. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Sportfishing's Sea Spray was drifting at Twin Roads and 18 anglers 
reeled in halibut from 10 to 25 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Sportfishing's Southern Cal fished Catalina Island for rock cod in 
an area not fished for a month and within two hours anglers decked a limit of 
cows and lings. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing aboard the Annie B barge, Otto Koval of Long Beach was using a two-hook 
leader with cut squid and reeled in two halibut. Knowing they were hooked well, 
he bounced them to the deck instead of waiting for the net. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabrillo Marine Museum will have an open house Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. in honor of the L.A. Parks and Recreation Centennial Celebration. 
</P>
<P>
A guided tour will give a view of the marine lab's support systems. 
</P>
<P>
Also for viewing will be some of the exotic fish caught in local waters this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Fofa of Santa Monica caught the whopper of the week aboard the Spitfire 
off Sunset Beach, a 31-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Tyler of West Los Angeles, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Southern 
Cal, won the jackpot with a 28 1/2-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Dee Clay of Redondo Beach, fishing at Hidden Reef on the Blackjack, won the 
jackpot with a 25-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Sullivan of Santa Monica, on the Redondo Special, caught a 16 1/2-pound 
halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Myron Ackerman of Long Beach, at Catalina aboard the Southern Cal, landed a 
16-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Parke of Torrance, aboard the Sea Spray, won the jackpot with a 15 
1/2-pound halibut. 
</P>

TORRANCE TENTATIVELY OKS NEW USER FEES, HIKES IN OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you are a resident of Torrance and your neighbors complain repeatedly to the 
police when you play loud music at 3 a.m., you may have to pick up the tab for 
their house call. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has given tentative approval to 19 new or increased user fees, 
including a $97 fee that would be assessed if police come to your home more 
than once to tell you to turn down the music. 
</P>
<P>
The fees were discussed Tuesday at the first of three City Council meetings 
that will consider a total of 109 user fees in an attempt to raise city revenue 
by making users pay more of the cost of providing a wide range of services. The 
proposed increases would raise about $2 million annually -- a 72% increase in 
fees collected by the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city allocated about $8.9 million to provide user-fee services in 1988 and 
collected $2.6 million in fees. If the proposed fees are approved, the city's 
cost for those services would drop to $4.3 million. According to a study 
commissioned by the city, the city subsidizes about 70% of the cost of 
city-provided services. If all fee increases are approved, the subsidy would be 
reduced to 49%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police, Fire Fees 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council discussed police, fire, traffic engineering and 
utilities department user fees. Next week, it will discuss developers fees. At 
the third meeting, they will discuss recreation department fees, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The increases would be phased in over a three-year period beginning July 1, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
User fees are those assessed for services used by individuals, such as adult 
education classes and building inspections. The fees are paid as the service is 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly two hours of discussion, the council voted unanimously to have the 
19 proposed fees it reviewed presented in ordinance form on March 21 for a 
final vote. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Director Mary Giordano said she is optimistic that the council will 
support most of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Its hard to say in advance if they will support all of them because we are 
considering 109 fees," she said in an interview. "But I felt that there was 
support from the council." 
</P>
<P>
Giordano said that once the city staff clarifies some concerns raised by the 
council, the 19 proposed user fees are likely to be enacted. 
</P>
<P>
The largest fees would be charged to state and county agencies for capital 
improvement projects that the city handles on contracts with these agencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Overhead 
</P>
<P>
Giordano said that every year the city handles many of these projects, 
including street repairs, for state and county agencies and that while these 
agencies always pay for the work, they never pay for the city overhead -- the 
staff time involved in managing the delivery of services, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed fee would charge state and county agencies 17.8% of the total cost 
of a project and would raise $390,000 annually, according to a financial report 
that analyzed the impact of the fees. 
</P>
<P>
One set of fees that raised questions were proposed "false alarm" charges. 
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, after three false burglary alarms the city would 
bill a resident $75 for each subsequent time the Police Department responded. 
It would also charge $100 for each false robbery alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dan Walker said he opposes the burglary alarm fee because it might 
deter residents from buying burglar alarm systems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried that the city would send the signal saying that, for whatever 
reason, you shouldn't use an alarm system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost in Manpower 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Donald Nash disagreed, saying that the fee would only deter 
residents from accidentally setting off the alarms. 
</P>
<P>
"It would just make people more careful," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Giordano agreed. "It costs us in manpower when we have to go out to 
investigate" false alarms, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert said she was concerned that a proposed $97 fee for police 
responding to more than one call of disturbing the peace at the same address 
could be abused. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the city would charge the fee beginning the second time 
that police respond to a complaint at the same address. The fee would be 
assessed in addition to any fine resulting from the issuing of a citation. 
Geissert said it is possible that a resident who does not like a neighbor might 
file false complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I can imagine some real abuse," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nash pointed out that the fee would not be automatic. Officers would assess the 
fee only if, in their judgment, the resident had been disturbing the peace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First In-Depth Analysis 
</P>
<P>
David M. Griffith &amp; Associates, a Sacramento-based consulting firm that 
specializes in revenue studies for state and local governments, studied user 
fees in Torrance. Giordano said the Finance Department is recommending that the 
council approve all the increases suggested by the report. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager LeRoy Jackson, who recommended the analysis during last year's 
mid-year budget review, said this is the city's first in-depth analysis of the 
cost of user-fee services. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said that the city is not suffering financial hardship but 
expressed concern about unexpected costs in the past few years. Such expenses 
include putting aside $500,000 for safety studies, a potential legal battle 
with the Torrance Mobil refinery and the $5.2 million cost of repairing the 
mudslide at Via Corona and Vista Largo. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the city should consider increasing user fees because 
California residents want local government "to operate in a business-like 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
The consulting firm, which took five months to complete the report, compared 
user fees in Torrance with fees in other Southern California cities of similar 
size. 
</P>

'LITTLE THINGS' HURT: PERRIS OUSTS INGLEWOOD, COACH CITES DEFENSE, REBOUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Inglewood basketball Coach Vince Combs said it was no mystery why his team was 
eliminated from the Southern Section 4-AA playoffs Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't do all the little things," said Combs, who blamed poor 
rebounding and defense for the 77-68 quarterfinal loss to Perris at West 
Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts because, in all due respect to Perris, we should have won. But it's 
been tough to get these kids to play at both ends of the court. They're so 
offensive-minded that no one bothers to do the other things." 
</P>
<P>
Ivy League champion Perris (22-5), which advances to the semifinals Friday 
against Glendora (27-1) and record-scoring forward Tracy Murray, blew open a 
close game with five uncontested baskets in the final 2:32. 
</P>
<P>
A short bank shot by Inglewood forward Harold Miner, who led all scorers with 
28 points, pulled the Sentinels within two, 66-64, with 3:13 left, but Perris 
answered with an 8-2 run to build a 74-66 margin with 48 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time they got the lead or came close, we came right back," said Perris 
Coach Phil Ward. "That was probably the most important thing we did. That took 
some wind out of their sails." 
</P>
<P>
Perris received big games from guards Jerry Dalton (24 points) and Kerry Swarn 
(eight), who continually drove inside for easy buckets against taller 
Inglewood. Small forward Bryon Samuels added 13 points for the Panthers, five 
coming in the decisive late run. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the lack of desire to play defense took us out of the game," Combs 
said. "We're a much better team that we showed tonight. It's been a 
roller-coaster kind of year, and it ended on a downward slide." 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood, the Bay League runner-up, finished with a 16-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
The Sentinels, who played without standout forward Steve King (academic 
ineligibility), lost another key player when starting guard Tommy Holland 
fouled out with 5:58 remaining and his team trailing by one. 
</P>
<P>
"That hurt tremendously," Combs said, "because he's a senior and a competitive 
team leader." 
</P>
<P>
With Holland out of the game, Inglewood appeared more vulnerable against the 
offensive penetration of Perris' quick guards. 
</P>
<P>
At least Ward, the Panthers' coach, saw a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"We have talented guards," he said. "When we spread the court, they had to 
chase us and they couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood trailed throughout the first half and didn't take the lead until 
midway through the third quarter when point guard Johnny Terrell (13 points) 
scored on a breakaway layup to make it 39-38. 
</P>
<P>
Ward countered by switching to a zone defense in hope of changing the tempo of 
the game. The maneuver seemed to give Perris a boost as it regained the lead 
before going back to an aggressive man-to-man defense that attempted to keep 
the 6-5 Miner from establishing position inside.

FOREIGN TRADE DROP REPORTED BY SOVIET UNION; 
</P>
<P>
DECLINE IN EXPORTS HURTS DRIVE TO BOOST ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Exports from the Soviet Union declined last year despite a major push by Moscow 
to expand its foreign trade, while the total cost of imports increased 
significantly, the government said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But even though the total value of imports and exports rose to the equivalent 
of nearly $220 billion in 1988, the growth was so small -- only 2.3% -- that no 
real recovery was possible from a massive drop in 1987, the official Soviet 
newspaper Government Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, foreign trade has stagnated at a time Moscow had hoped that increased 
trade would help revitalize the country's economy, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The report was one of the most pessimistic accounts of the Soviet Union's 
deepening economic crisis. It made clear that growth is small and circumscribed 
and that various quick solutions that have been proposed, such as joint 
ventures with foreign investors, are not likely to be the breakthroughs the 
government wants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scathing Criticism 
</P>
<P>
Economic relations with the Soviet Union's socialist partners, Moscow's most 
important trade links by far, are "unsatisfactory," the newspaper frankly 
declared. "New forms of cooperation have not yet produced any returns, and 
direct ties between socialist countries have turned into a means to exchange 
deficit items," it added. 
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, prices for raw materials and fuels, the principal 
Soviet exports, declined worldwide, and Moscow did not meet its sales targets. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of machinery and other equipment fell as well. They now account for less 
than 12% of the country's exports and, largely because of shoddiness and old 
technology, only 3% of Soviet sales to capitalist countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Soviet industry continues producing planes, vehicles, tractors and 
agricultural machines whose specifications differ very little from previous 
models and which are inferior to Western types," said the newspaper, an 
authoritative new semimonthly publication from the Council of Ministers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost of Imports Rises 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it said, the cost of imports rose 6.5%, an increase that 
reduced the Soviet Union's trade surplus in 1988 by almost half, to the 
equivalent of $6.5 billion. But it calls into question the ambitious plans put 
forward by some Soviet officials for massive imports of Western consumer goods 
and equipment to expand Soviet industries -- all of which would have to be 
financed by foreign loans and credits if the surplus declined further. 
</P>
<P>
Overall prospects for Soviet economic restructuring this year do not appear 
promising, the Government Herald reported, saying that contracts for the 
delivery of raw materials this year are well below targets set in the country's 
economic development plan. 
</P>
<P>
It said fuel prices seem unlikely to increase much and that various trade 
development programs, including joint ventures and new deals with the West, 
have brought little investment and limited trade.

MOVE MAKES CHALLENGE OF EVIDENCE MORE LIKELY; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE WON'T RULE ON SURVEILLANCE AT EXCHANGES 
</P>

<P>
Calling it "an interesting and difficult question," a federal judge Wednesday 
refused to rule immediately on the legality of electronic surveillance used by 
the FBI during its undercover investigation of alleged fraud at Chicago's two 
major commodity exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by John F. Grady, chief judge of the Northern District of 
Illinois, left the door open for lawyers eventually to contest the 
admissibility of evidence gathered by "human bugs" -- electronically outfitted 
FBI agents working undercover in the trading pits of the Chicago Board of Trade 
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Civil liberties lawyer Burton Joseph said Grady's language suggested that the 
judge believed "the argument is far from frivolous and merits serious 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Criminal lawyers representing many of the traders called before the special 
grand jury hearing the government's case believe that the challenge to the 
recorded evidence could undermine the unprecedented government investigation of 
commodity futures trading. 
</P>
<P>
Former federal prosecutors Susan Bogart and Stephen J. Senderowitz filed the 
novel challenge on behalf of three traders subpoenaed in the probe. They 
contend that this type of electronic monitoring, where ambient conversations 
are overheard, requires judicial authorization. Apparently, the government did 
not have that authorization when FBI agents recorded conversations on the 
trading floors. 
</P>
<P>
If prior judicial approval was necessary before the wired agents went into the 
trading pits, Joseph and other lawyers said, much of the government's evidence 
in this investigation could be tainted and unusable. 
</P>
<P>
Grady did not address that question in his ruling. Instead, he said it was the 
wrong time to file the challenge because Bogart's and Senderowitz's clients, 
who were not identified by name, had not yet appeared before the grand jury. If 
they do appear and are cited for contempt for refusing to answer questions, 
Grady wrote, then the legality of the electronic surveillance can be 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Bogart said an appeal of Grady's Wednesday decision was being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
While the challenge was heard in secret last week -- and all the proceedings 
except Grady's eight-page decision remain secret -- the ruling provided 
additional insight into the government's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The judge wrote that the three traders represented by Senderowitz and Bogart 
"have indicated that, should they appear before the grand jury, they intend to 
invoke their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, Grady wrote, "the court sees no reason to decide the 
electronic surveillance question as a mere academic exercise."

COMPUTER FAILURE TEMPORARILY SHUTS DOWN WELLS FARGO ATMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 445 of Wells Fargo Bank's 1,200 automated teller machines in California 
shut down temporarily on Wednesday because of a computer failure, the bank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The rare shutdown, which started Wednesday morning and lasted until late 
afternoon, affected ATMs mostly in the state's Central Valley, but some in 
Southern California were also hit, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kim Kellogg said. No 
customer records or transactions were lost or ruined, but many customers were 
unable to use the automated tellers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, people just went into branches and did it the old way," 
Kellogg said. 
</P>
<P>
She blamed the shutdown on a failure of the communications link from a central 
processing unit to the ATMs, adding that the bank has not had a similar foul-up 
in at least seven or eight years, and certainly nothing of this magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't remember when anything like this last happened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
G. Henry Mundt, senior vice president of marketing at Cirrus System, a Chicago 
firm that operates the nation's largest ATM network, said computer-related 
shutdowns are rare because most ATMs are run by sophisticated computer systems 
with backups. "If there is a malfunction, the backups kick into place," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo's Kellogg said the bank has backups, but because this problem 
involved wiring going out from a computer, the backups couldn't help. 
</P>
<P>
While mass shutdowns of ATMs for prolonged periods are rare, machines are often 
turned off for a few minutes a day for standard servicing to replace money and 
receipts, Mundt said. ATMs operate on average more than 99% of the time, he 
said.

UPS to Build Facility: United Parcel Service announced plans to construct a 
$68-million facility at Ontario International Airport. The air hub facility 
will be located on 160 acres adjacent to the airport and will include a 
500,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art sorting facility. The operation will 
employ about 1,450 people, with direct payroll to exceed $29 million when it 
reaches capacity in 1995. Ground breaking is expected later this year. 
Ontario's city council has unanimously approved the project.

Minorco Deal Opposed: New York City's pension fund is threatening to sell its 
Chemical Banking Corp. stock if the bank helps finance a South 
African-controlled company's hostile bid for Britain's Consolidated Gold Fields 
PLC. A Chemical Bank spokesman said the bank was legally bound to participate 
in the promised lending for Minerals &amp; Resources Corp., or Minorco. 
Chemical has agreed to lend Minorco $523 million toward the $3.8-billion 
purchase price for Consolidated Gold, a major international mining company. The 
pension fund, which holds 237,000 shares worth about $7.4 million, objects 
because of the republic's anti-apartheid policies.

Mediator Meets With Airline: A federal mediator began meeting with 
representatives of Eastern Airlines and the Machinists union in a last-ditch 
effort to reach a settlement before a 30-day cooling-off period expires. The 
airline rejected the National Mediation Board's offer of binding arbitration to 
end the 16-month dispute. That rejection triggered the 30-day period, after 
which the union will be free to strike and the airline free to impose its 
disputed terms on workers. In a related development, Eastern's pilots said they 
would cross Machinists union picket lines if there's a strike next month, 
provided the troubled carrier's owner grants them concessions in their own 
contract.

Pacific Rim Conference Set: San Francisco, where the Golden Gate Bridge 
symbolizes the gateway to the Pacific, was chosen to host a major trade and 
finance symposium expected to attract about 1,000 business and political 
leaders from Pacific Rim nations. Mayor Art Agnos said the 1990 Pacific Rim 
Conference was "a real coup" for San Francisco and would help establish the Bay 
Area as a major U.S. "hub" of commerce for an economically powerful 
Asia-Pacific region that encompasses 57 countries and 2.4 billion people. The 
first Pacific Rim Conference was held in Perth, Western Australia, in November, 
1986.

FIRM HAD LOSS AFTER BIG REBOUND; 
</P>
<P>
WILES LEAVES AS HEAD OF AILING MINISCRIBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Q. T. Wiles, one of high technology's top corporate turnaround specialists, 
resigned Wednesday as chairman and chief executive of MiniScribe, a troubled 
computer equipment firm that until recent weeks was one of his biggest success 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
Wiles, who ran MiniScribe since 1985, could not be reached for comment. But 
Warren Perry, MiniScribe's director of investor relations, said Wiles resigned 
voluntarily. MiniScribe is one of the nation's largest makers of disk-drive 
data storage devices, and its products are used in personal computers made by 
such companies as Apple and Compaq. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said Wiles, 69, told MiniScribe directors that he believed the company's 
chief executive should be straightening out MiniScribe's problems from company 
headquarters in Longmont, Colo. Wiles' office is in a high-rise Ventura 
Boulevard building a few blocks from his home in Sherman Oaks in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A Nebraska native, Wiles, whose full name is Quentin Thomas Wiles, is something 
of a doctor for sick high-tech companies. His idiosyncratic management style 
and tireless work schedule have gained him near-legend status in 
high-technology circles. 
</P>
<P>
At one point in 1986, Wiles was running seven companies while also serving as 
chairman of the San Francisco investment firm Hambrecht &amp; Quist. 
Obsessively meticulous, Wiles carries in his briefcase color-coded folders, 
each color corresponding to one of the companies he is running. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first moves when taking over an operation is to give managers "Q. 
T.'s Disciplines," a 12-point guide that includes such suggestions as listing a 
manager's five most important tasks. He also provides them with "Q. T.'s Method 
of Operation," an eight-point list that includes general suggestions such as 
identifying problems and planning solutions. 
</P>
<P>
He also imposes wrenching cutbacks on companies, as he did when he took over 
MiniScribe in 1985. Wiles was called in to turn around the company by Hambrecht 
&amp; Quist, which owns 12% of its stock. Among his changes was to split the 
company into about a dozen units to improve accountability. 
</P>
<P>
After Wiles took over, the company's earnings and revenue grew every quarter 
for three years, with sales soaring from $115 million in 1985 to $603 million 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
But MiniScribe's business turned down sharply late last year, in part because 
it and other disk drive companies overestimated how much the business would 
grow in 1988. Seagate Technology in Scotts Valley, which had expected a big 
year, flooded the market with its drives, causing widespread price cutting. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, MiniScribe reported its first loss in more than three years, showing 
a $14.6-million deficit in the fourth quarter, compared to a profit of $9.1 
million a year earlier. Sales were virtually flat at $116.6 million. In 
December and January, the company fired 2,000 workers, most of them in 
Singapore and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
MiniScribe's balance sheet, made public last week, also showed growing 
problems. As of Jan. 1, MiniScribe's cash on hand had plunged to $8.9 million 
from $49 million a year earlier and its inventory more than doubled to $199 
million in the same period, reflecting large amounts of unsold products and raw 
materials that were bought just as sales were slowing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad Q. T. didn't get out of there at the beginning of 1988. He would 
have been a hero. But he stayed too long," said James N. Porter, president of 
Disk/Trend Inc. in Mountain View. 
</P>
<P>
Richard P. Rifenburgh, Wiles' partner at Hambrecht &amp; Quist Venture 
Partners, was named to replace Wiles as chairman and chief executive. Perry 
said Rifenburgh will relocate to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Wiles remains vice chairman of Hambrecht &amp; Quist. He also is chairman of 
some other companies, including Adobe Systems, a computer equipment company in 
Mountain View, and Silicon General in San Jose, a Wiles spokeswoman said.

INFLATION DATA SENDS BOND PRICES LOWER

<P>
Bond prices tumbled Wednesday, driven lower by news of the biggest jump in 
consumer prices in two years and the inflationary fears it stirred. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell about 5/8 point, or $6.25 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction 
from its price, rose to 9.12% from 9.05% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The government reported that consumer prices rose 0.6% in December as the cost 
of fuel, food and other items shot up. The rise in the Labor Department's 
consumer price index followed moderate 0.3% increases in November and December. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues declined 5/32 point to 9/32 point, intermediate maturities fell 3/8 
point to 1/2 point and long-term issues lost 23/32 point, according to figures 
provided by Telerate Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, dropped 4.03 to 1,122.66. In corporate trading, industrials also fell. 
Moody's investment-grade corporate bond index, which measures price movements 
on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was down 0.76 at 
296.90. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.82% as the discount increased 2 
basis points to 8.52%. Yields on six-month bills slipped to 8.97% as the 
discount edged down 1 basis point to 8.48%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 
9.33% as the discount jumped 7 basis points to 8.62%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 10%, up from 9.318% late Tuesday.

The dollar fell against most major foreign currencies Wednesday as dealers 
weighed the implications of a government report showing that consumer prices 
rose sharply during January. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices gained, driven higher by the inflation report. Prices for the 
precious metal rose by more than $5 an ounce in London. Later, Republic 
National Bank of New York quoted gold at a bid of $386.40 an ounce at 4 p.m. 
EST, up 90 cents from Tuesday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said consumer prices surged 0.6% in January, the highest 
monthly rate in two years. Last month's rise doubled the more modest 0.3% 
increases in November and December. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Anne Tompkins, a foreign exchange trader at Barclays Bank PLC in New York, 
said the inflation report intensified market speculation that U.S. interest 
rates will be hiked to slow inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Higher U.S. interest rates raise the value of dollar-denominated investments. 
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, many dealers seem to be focusing their attention on the 
strong West German economy and British economic prospects. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar slid against the West German mark, falling below levels considered 
key thresholds at which the U.S. currency would find support. The dollar fell 
to 1.8380 marks in London from 1.8420 marks late Tuesday. Later in New York, 
the dollar fell to 1.83425 marks from 1.8440 marks on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound came under pressure from the mark's strength. The pound fell 
in London to $1.7465 late Wednesday from $1.7565 late Tuesday. In later New 
York dealings, sterling dipped to $1.7470 from Tuesday's late $1.74725. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar eased to 126.62 Japanese yen from Tuesday's 127.15 
yen. In London, the dollar traded at 126.65 yen and later in New York the 
dollar finished at 126.525 yen, down from 127.15 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Tuesday's late rates, 
included: 1.5658 Swiss Francs, down from 1.5690; 1.1999 Canadian dollars, up 
from 1.19225; 6.2560 French francs, down from 6.2795, and 1,349.75 Italian 
lire, down from 1,351.00. 
</P>
<P>
Other rates for the dollar in Europe late Wednesday, compared to Tuesday's late 
rates, included: 1.8380 West German marks, down from 1.8420; 1.5667 Swiss 
francs, down from 1.5685; 6.2625 French francs, down from 6.2735; 2.0725 Dutch 
guilders, down from 2.0910; 1,350.50 Italian lire, down from 1,356.00, and 
1.1965 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1897. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices benefit when price pressures build because investors typically use 
precious metals as a hedge against inflation. Renewed demand for bullion this 
week also has bolstered gold prices. 
</P>
<P>
The late bid for gold in London was $386.30 an ounce, up from Tuesday's 
$380.75. Zurich's late bid was $386.25 an ounce, up from $383.00.

Union Carbide Corp.: The Danbury, Conn., chemicals firm said 1988 net income 
soared 185% to $662 million. Sales increased 20% to $8.32 billion. The results 
reflect an after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of $58 million for settlement 
of the litigation concerning the accident at its plant in Bhopal, India, which 
killed 3,300 people. Operating profit increased 79% to $1.6 billion, led by a 
123% boost in operating profit for the chemicals and plastics segment.

APOSTLE OF PERFORMANCE VIOLENCE TELLS WHY HE DOES WHAT HE DOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Welcome to the Cutting -- or should we say the Slashing, Bashing and 
Slam-Banging -- Edge. Have we got some performance art for you. It slices. It 
dices. It hacks things up a hundred different ways. And a crowd-pleasing 
display of S&amp;M it is. 
</P>
<P>
Handsome, mild-mannered John Fleck, for instance, is one of the hot cats on the 
L.A. scene. And he's just the kind of guy you want to bring home to the folks 
-- then pray that they don't ask what he does for a living. 
</P>
<P>
Long the darling of underground haunts, this Cleveland-born "28-37"-year-old 
actor-performance artist has a way with the, uh, offbeat. 
</P>
<P>
He's given himself a lobotomy, hanged himself, been raped by a television set, 
let loose with certain bodily functions and done other deeds onstage you can't 
write about in a family newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
His controversial "Blessed Are All the Little Fishes," performed with the 
trendy trio "Fat . . . ," opens Friday at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions 
(LACE) for a two-weekend run. 
</P>
<P>
"I love outrageousness," understates the artist who, during the course of his 
50-minute ditty, does we-won't-tell-you-what to a goldfish, batters another 
innocent sea-creature and uses his body unlike anything at the Royal Academy of 
Dramatic Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Fleck, however, isn't the only shockmeister in town. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Coleman, the so-called Charles Manson of performance, was busted on two 
counts of cruelty for biting the heads off mice in the documentary "Mondo New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
But Fleck and Coleman are just the tip of the sliceberg. The venues are alive, 
it seems, with the sounds of ugh and ick. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Finley grossed everybody out by smashing yams into her anatomy. Stelarc, 
who goes by the solitary name, implants hooks in himself and hangs from wires. 
And Penn and Teller, those sadists of magic, are due at the Wiltern next month. 
</P>
<P>
So why, you ask, do they do it? Just to get their audiences upset? 
</P>
<P>
Not according to Fleck. 
</P>
<P>
"People who don't like my shows think I do (these violent things) just to be 
sensational," Fleck acknowledges. "But it's drama. Conflict. Passion. Life and 
death. I don't do it for gratuitous shock." 
</P>
<P>
Shaking people up, he argues, is one way to get them to listen. "We're all so 
protected and cool, especially in the art community," he says. "We're cool, 
we're hip, we've been around. But if I can get one of these cool people in 
black leather to go 'oh,' I just love that. You've got to be like an atomic 
bomb to keep these peoples' attention." 
</P>
<P>
But there is a difference between shock and schlock. And performers for whom 
getting attention is the be-all and end-all can leave viewers feeling cheated 
by their self-indulgent and often puerile antics. 
</P>
<P>
David Leslie, for example, calls himself the Evel Knievel of performance. At 
his last "Stunt: David Leslie's Swansong" at New York's PS 122 in November, he 
sashayed his way up an elaborate two-story scaffold/tower after a lot of costly 
but mindless hype-jinks. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie almost broke his neck swooping down from those heights. On purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The thrill, apparently, is supposed to be that we might get to see him miss . . 
. and die. 
</P>
<P>
Fleck, on the other hand, uses violence to get attention, but he's out to grab 
the opportunity to say something more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's uncomfortable to see a little fish getting hurt," Fleck concedes. "But 
what about on the bigger scale, the waste, killing and slaughter in the world? 
There's violence all around -- murders in Silver Lake -- and it seeps down into 
how I feel about myself." 
</P>
<P>
These feelings, combined with the AIDS crisis and the influence of activist 
performers such as Tim Miller, have inspired Fleck with what he calls an 
increasingly "political" awareness. It prompts him to address the violence 
around us -- ironically enough -- with violence onstage, a kind of 'fight fire 
with fire' logic. 
</P>
<P>
"We hear about (violent events) on the news and we read about (them) in the 
newspapers, but it's just not real," Fleck muses. "So I'm making it a little 
real for people. It's still safe, but it's a little closer and it makes you 
uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Putting violence onstage may diminish it elsewhere, Fleck believes, through a 
kind of transcendence. "I heard Stelarc once, and he doesn't seem to have a 
violent bone in his body," Fleck recalls. "He just puts those hooks in to show 
how he can surpass physical limitation." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to live it to break through it, instead of avoiding it. So (seeing 
violence) is therapeutic and cathartic for me and perhaps also for the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
But even if the coach potatoes in the audience don't get the message, Fleck the 
pragmatist admits, performance still has to hold its audience's attention. 
</P>
<P>
"An audience appreciates seeing someone willing to hurt themselves," he 
deadpans. "It's such a total commitment, uncommercial. This certainly isn't a 
workshop to get an agent. In fact, I try not to let my agent know."

SHEILA JORDAN'S SLOW RISE TO RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheila Jordan has fought many demons in her life. The road that led to her 
current level of vocal success (she opens tonight for a three-day stint at the 
Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood) was long and tortuous. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Detroit to a 16-year-old mother, she was raised by grandparents in an 
impoverished coal-mining area of Pennsylvania. "I never dreamed of becoming a 
singer," she recalls. "It was a struggle just living; we ate whatever my 
grandfather caught when he went hunting -- deer, squirrel, porcupine. Often 
there was almost nothing to eat and not even much to wear. 
</P>
<P>
"The church gave me strength to survive. I did sing for a while at PTA meetings 
and on local radio, but the other children kidded me so much about my singing 
that I gave it up." 
</P>
<P>
Not until she visited her mother in Detroit was Jordan turned on to jazz. 
Before long, Ellington, Basie, Gillespie and Holiday were her idols, Charlie 
Parker her virtual guru -- first on records and later in person. 
</P>
<P>
For a while she and two fellow Bird fanatics formed a vocal trio, setting 
lyrics to Parker's music, thus becoming the unknown predecessors of Lambert, 
Hendricks &amp; Ross. But it was hard keeping interracial company in Detroit; 
she and her black friends were constantly hassled. "The cops would take me to 
the police station and search me -- they couldn't believe that we were just 
enjoying our music." 
</P>
<P>
After she had left high school and moved promptly to New York, Jordan met 
Parker through his pianist, Duke Jordan, whom she later married. "Bird was 
wonderful -- when Duke and I were living in a loft downtown, he'd come over and 
turn me on to composers like Stravinsky and Bartok, and he'd talk about plays 
and books and bring his painter friend along. He was such a well rounded man." 
</P>
<P>
During those years there were singing jobs now and then, and piano studies with 
Lennie Tristano, but two years after her daughter Traci was born, the marriage 
ended and Jordan took a job with an ad agency to pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
Recognition came very slowly. There was a much praised vocal on a George 
Russell album, singing "You Are My Sunshine" just the way Russell had heard her 
sing it for some coal miners during a return to Pennsylvania. And there was her 
first solo album, on Blue Note. Then came a brief period of recognition 
followed by long term oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically (and it's a typical jazz world irony), she began to gain acceptance 
after paying visits to Scandinavia for concerts and recordings. The late 1960s 
and the '70s found her winning the Down Beat poll as the female singer 
deserving wider recognition. In fact, she won that poll nine times, but the 
recognition was never enough to enable her to give up the day job. 
</P>
<P>
"I was praying like crazy, dear God, let me sing more. Then six months later I 
was laid off my job. I was devastated, but it was a blessing in disguise -- 
since then I've been singing constantly!" 
</P>
<P>
Jordan likes to sing standards, bop tunes, and a few originals by herself or by 
Harvie Swartz, the bassist with whom she has worked as a duo off and on since 
1981. At Catalina she will be backed by Swartz and pianist Alan Broadbent. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are getting better all the time," she says. "Last summer I was in 
Hamburg, singing in a jazz opera. It paid so well that I paid off the mortgage 
on my farm house in upstate New York." 
</P>
<P>
Spending most of last year in Europe, she became a vocal teacher at a music 
school in Graz, Austria. She has also taught intermittently at City College in 
New York. "I expect to go back to Graz in the fall. They have some great 
students there -- really talented singers and pianists. It's very gratifying to 
work as a teacher."

CANYON GIRLS OVERCOME LA QUINTA IN 3-A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christa Ramirez scored the game's only goal with three minutes gone in the 
second half to give the Canyon High School girls a 1-0 victory over La Quinta 
in the Southern Section 3-A playoffs Wednesday at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The Comanches (16-2-3) play Moreno Valley in the quarterfinals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez headed home a corner kick by Kelly Thompson in front of the La Quinta 
net for his 19th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon goalie Keri Erkenbrack was well-protected by her teammates as she was 
forced to make just two saves en route to recording her 13th shutout of the 
season. Erkenbrack, who, like Ramirez, played on the Canyon girls' basketball 
team, has allowed just seven goals this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense has been the focal point of our team all season," Comanche Coach 
John Williams said. "Keri hasn't had to make that many saves this season, but 
when she's had to, she's come up with the stops. And we also got outstanding 
defensive play from Jeni Smith, Kim Maynard and Julie Gribble." 
</P>
<P>
Maynard's aggressive play prevented La Quinta star Cheryl Jones from getting 
any effective shots on goal, while Smith and Gribble kept the Aztecs (14-4-1) 
from getting out of their zone for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta had its best scoring chance of the first half with 10 minutes left 
when Erkenbrack made a diving save of Jennifer Sogoian's tailing, sinking shot. 
With 5 minutes left in the match, the Aztecs were deprived of a game-tying goal 
when Jill Keller booted away Lara Crowley's free kick from just outside the 
penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure that if we can get good defense, we have a chance to win." Williams 
said. "We got that good defense, and Ramirez got the big goal on a beautiful 
header." 
</P>
<P>
In another 3-A game: 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei 1, Long Beach Wilson 0 -- Goalie Michelle Lodyga and a tight defense 
made one goal stand up for the Monarchs (21-4-2) at Mater Dei. Lodyga made nine 
saves for her 20th shutout of the season. The Monarchs have yet to give up a 
goal in the playoffs. Tina Manfre scored from 25 yards out to give Mater Dei a 
1-0 lead 14 minutes into the second half. AL PRESTON

In other 2-A matches: 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge 4, Garey 0 -- The Warriors scored three second-half goals, two by 
John Szczuka, at home. Bruno Matturrano scored from 30 yards out 15 minutes 
into the second half to give the Warriors (11-4-5) a 2-0 lead. Szczuka scored 
his first goal on a header 20 minutes into the second half. He scored from 10 
yards out to give Woodbridge a 4-0 lead. Scott Schmidler scored 15 minutes into 
the match as the Warriors (11-4-5) led, 1-0, at halftime. Goalie Eric Mooberry 
made eight saves for the Warriors. Woodbridge will play Ridgecrest Burroughs 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 4, Arroyo Grande 3 (penalty kicks) -- Fighting Irish goalie Jerry 
Vargas made a diving save on a penalty kick by Jose Quintana to preserve the 
victory at Kennedy. The two teams were scoreless through regulation, two 
overtime periods and sudden death. Vargas made 15 saves, including two penalty 
kicks, for Kennedy (16-4-3). 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 5, Paraclete 0 -- Daran Martinez scored two goals and Horcio Villa, 
Mike Marageti and Troy Duncan one for visiting Esperanza (15-3-2), which plays 
Kennedy Friday in the quarterfinals.

BREA-OLINDA FALLS TO MORNINGSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL ROBERTSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brea-Olinda High School Coach Rick Jones knew that junior forward Keith Walker 
would have to be a major factor for his team to remain in the Southern Section 
3-A boys' basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Walker had a game-high 22 points against Morningside Wednesday in a 
quarterfinal game, but scored only four in the second half, and Morningside 
beat the Wildcats, 75-72, at Sonora High School. 
</P>
<P>
"Keith just didn't shoot well in the second half," Jones said. "Morningside did 
a good job keeping him away from the basket, and that made a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside (21-4), the Ocean League champions, will play Corona del Mar Friday 
in the semifinals. Brea-Olinda, which finished second in the Orange League, 
ends its season with a 21-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
Walker had nearly unstoppable in Brea-Olinda's previous playoff games, scoring 
64 points. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside, which has won 19 games in a row, shuffled players into the lineup 
every few minutes to guard Walker, and that tactic worked down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats held a 36-34 halftime lead, but Morningside started to connect on 
three-point field goals in the third quarter. Senior guard Jonathan Madison, 
who finished with a team-high 14 points, made three three-pointers in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
With 14 seconds left, Brea-Olinda cut the lead to 74-70 on a free throw by 
senior guard David Dittman. But that was a close as the Wildcats could get as 
Morningside ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we should have played more effectively inside," Morningside Coach 
Carl Franklin said. "We made some mistakes early in the game, but we ironed 
things out in the second half. We were able to come through with a nice 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda's Matt Chamberlain had 17 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
James Westbrook scored 10 points and Chris Vance nine for the Monarchs.

CAPISTRANO VALLEY STOPS MORENO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capistrano Valley High School added insult to injury in a 72-55 victory over 
Moreno Valley in a Southern Section 5-A quarterfinal boys' basketball game 
Wednesday at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
Chopin Scott, the Vikings' guard who was averaging 19 points a game, was 
feeling the effects of a car accident Sunday that left him with a split right 
eyelid, bruised ribs and minus two teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Add Andy Bosma's stingy defense against Scott and the Cougars (22-4) easily 
breezed by the Vikings (19-7) to set up a semifinal game Friday against against 
Buena. The site will be determined in a coin flip today. 
</P>
<P>
"Bosma played a hell of a game on Chopin Scott," Capistrano Valley Coach Mark 
Thornton said. "We wanted to put Bosma him, deny him the ball and contain him." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars did that, limiting Scott to nine points and three rebounds before 
he fouled out with 29 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley's star forward, Scott McCorkle, scored 27 points, including 
20 points in the second half. He also grabbed nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been in a slump lately," Thornton said. "He hit a couple of big 
three-pointers that put us ahead for good." 
</P>
<P>
That was late in the third quarter, when the Cougars held a 40-34 lead before 
McCorkle sank two consecutive three-pointers and the Vikings never closer. 
</P>
<P>
But the game was much tighter through the first half. Moreno Valley fell behind 
early, but found its fast break and took control of the boards to tie the 
score, 26-26, at halftime.

WOODBRIDGE GIRLS FACE ANOTHER TALL ORDER IN BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Woodbridge High School girls' basketball team finds itself up against a 
taller, more physical team in the quarterfinal round of the Southern Section 
4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
So what else is new? 
</P>
<P>
It has become something of a rallying point in the past two seasons for 
undersized Woodbridge (21-5), which meets Katella (23-3) at 7:30 tonight at 
Katella. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, few gave Woodbridge much chance after the second round of the 
playoffs. But the Warriors survived their height disadvantage and advanced to 
the 2-A championship game, although they lost to a big Chino team, 47-41. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to rally behind it because there is nothing else to rally around," 
Woodbridge Coach Eric Bangs said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, that's not entirely true. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Leslie Rathbun, the team's top player, averages 20 points and six 
steals a game. But she is just 5-feet-7. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Wehren, a 5-8 senior forward, averages 13 points and nine rebounds and 
Gina Krouse, a 5-10 senior center, contributes six points and eight rebounds a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The trio must find a way to contend with Katella's 5-10 Joni Easterly, who 
leads the Knights with a 22.8-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Carlson, a 6-1 center, and Margaret Harker, a 5-10 forward, are the 
Knights' other front-line players. 
</P>
<P>
"Our team speed is better," Bangs said. "But you can't run without the ball. We 
have to create turnovers and get the rebounds." 
</P>
<P>
In another 4-A game: 
</P>
<P>
La Habra (19-6) at Palos Verdes (23-3): La Habra faces a monumental task 
against top-seeded Palos Verdes, which has the 6-foot-5 Burge twins. Heidi, a 
forward, averages 23.9 points and 14.1 rebounds. Heather, the center, averages 
21 points and 12.4 rebounds. They helped Palos Verdes win the 3-A title last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley (18-8) at Long Beach Poly (19-6): Fountain Valley won the 
teams' meeting in December, 51-40, at Poly. Stacey Hisaka made 15 of her 21 
points from the free-throw line. Hisaka, a guard, leads the team in scoring 
with an average of 13.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5-A: 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (24-3) at Ontario (24-1): Junior center Jenny Sullivan leads Ocean 
View with an average of 14.5 rebounds. Heidi Hasemann, who had a team-high 14 
points in Ocean View's 45-38 second-round victory over Capistrano Valley, adds 
depth to the Seahawks' front line. Ontario, seeded fourth, squeaked past Canyon 
Springs, 59-48, in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo (22-4) at North Torrance (16-9): The Diablos, the top-seeded 
team, are in the quarterfinals for the second time in three seasons. For that, 
Coach Steve Asay can thank one of the more balanced lineups in the division. 
Three players score in double figures, led by center Jennifer Rohrig, who 
averages 13.5 points. Rohrig also gets a team-leading 7.6 rebounds a game. 
Guard Tina Ranker leads the Southern Section in assists with 11.1. 
</P>
<P>
Downey (18-6) at Valencia (17-9): Downey was one of the few teams in the 
division not to get a bye in the first round. And it had to get past San 
Clemente, 64-49, to catch up to the rest of the division. Downey then upset 
fourth-seeded Tustin in the second round Friday. Valencia, one of the 
division's dark horses, is led by Kristen McDonald, who averages 19.3 points 
and 9.1 rebounds. She was named the Orange League's co-MVP. 
</P>
<P>
University (20-6) at Camarillo (20-6): Only two seasons ago, University had a 
9-14 record. This season, the Trojans were co-champions of the Sea View League. 
Shelly Davis, a senior forward, has led the team's comeback. Nichole Victoria, 
a 5-6 junior guard, leads Camarillo with a 19.1-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake (18-8) at Canyon (20-4): Although Canyon got the No. 2 seeding, the 
team is something of an unknown in the playoffs. Forward Keri Erkenbrack 
averages in double figures for points (20.2) and rebounds (10.1). Sheri Rhyne, 
who had 11 blocked shots in a game against Foothill earlier this season, adds 
to Canyon's strength inside. Westlake has advanced to the quarterfinals despite 
being an at-large team from the Marmonte League and having to play a 
first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A: 
</P>
<P>
St. Lucy's (19-8) at Brea-Olinda (24-2): Top-seeded Brea breezed past Sierra 
Vista in the second round Friday. The Wildcats should do the same here. Aimee 
McDaniel, the Orange League co-MVP, and Tammy Blackburn form one of the top 
backcourts in the Southern Section. McDaniel averages 15.1 points and Blackburn 
12.6. St. Lucy's advanced this far despite being the No. 3 team from the 
Baseline League. 
</P>
<P>
Atascadero (18-5) at La Quinta (22-3): A long day of travel isn't the only 
hurdle Atascadero must face. The Greyhounds must find a way to slow 
guard/forward/center Amy Jalewalia, the Southern Section's leading scorer with 
a 31-point average. La Quinta's Heather Brannan adds steady play in support of 
Jalewalia. 
</P>
<P>
In the Small Schools: 
</P>
<P>
Lone Pine (11-8) at Liberty Christian (16-4): Lone Pine is another team making 
a long journey to stop a high-scoring player. Lone Pine's task is to cope with 
Liberty Christian's Sharon Crouch, who averages 22.8 points, 16.8 rebounds and 
7.5 assists.

<P>
'JU-DEE' SAILS ABOVE GENERIC COMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One downside to the upswing in the number of comedians is that, at this point, 
many are almost interchangeable: A comic has to be enormously unusual these 
days to transcend the burgeoning ranks of nameless, generic wiseacres. Judy 
Tenuta is -- and does -- as she demonstrated unequivocally Tuesday in her 
Irvine Improvisation debut. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting some sort of pink and white prom gown-from-hell spruced with silver 
lame, Tenuta glided regally toward the stage to the strains of heavenly music 
pouring from the PA, rubbed her nostrils briefly and then ran that hand over a 
guy's head in the front row, gracefully sashayed and pirouetted around the 
stage and then spoke her first words -- "Hey, pigs, let's party" -- punctuated 
with a riff from her accordion. 
</P>
<P>
It's doubtful that anyone left this show fuzzy on the headliner's name (at 
least her first name). For one thing, her accordion is labeled "Judy." And 
throughout the show, longtime devotees and enthusiastic new converts to this 
bizzaro religion -- Judyism -- chant her name in strange, Munchin-like hosanna 
("Ju-dee"). 
</P>
<P>
Her act is every bit as memorable. After more than a decade of knocking around 
the stand-up circuit, Tenuta has forged a very distinctive character: The 
Petite Flower. Her alternate handles include Giver Goddess, Fashion Plate Saint 
and Empress of Elvis Impersonators. One that hasn't made the list yet but 
should be near the top is Siren of Sarcasm. Because while today's better-known 
character comics -- Emo Philips, Pee-Wee Herman -- project a childlike 
sensibility, Tenuta's attitude is far more aligned with adolescence. She's a 
smart aleck. She pops her chewing gum. She calls people names (Pseudo-Virgin, 
Stud-Puppet, Porno-Pockets, Robo-Crotch, et al). She must have the last word. 
And nothing is too facetious, mean or outrageous to say. 
</P>
<P>
Her persona is so enchanting that it carried her Tuesday despite a surprising 
amount of comparatively pedestrian material. The combination of edgy 
disposition and theatrical, wildly imaginative presentation made for a wholly 
unique blend of fanciful escapism and trenchant reality. 
</P>
<P>
Her topics included romance, George Bush and the Catholic church, of which she 
is particularly contemptuous. Spinning one yarn about a priest, she said, "Like 
this guy's not going to go cruising for Cub Scouts." In a later anecdote about 
switching communion wafers for cookies: "Come on, father. If you were God, what 
would you rather taste like -- cardboard or Chips Ahoy?" 
</P>
<P>
There were other no-holds-barred barbs. Aware that she was in a politically 
conservative enclave, she seemed to delight in Republican-ribbing and 
Bush-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
"My Mom said, 'Why can't you be more like (your sister) Blambo. She's a Special 
Ed teacher.' I said, 'Yeah, mom, like I have time to teach jumping jacks to 
Republicans.' " 
</P>
<P>
The inevitable groans just encouraged her: "I love George Bush. Tell me this 
guy doesn't suffer from Reaganheimer's Disease. He can't even remember when 
Pearl Harbor Day was. Let's give this guy a job where accuracy is not involved, 
like a TV weatherman. . . . Plus I love his wife, Babs. Tell me this broad's 
not a year older than God's parents." 
</P>
<P>
This last kind of joke, along others such as a long piece on her obese 
roommate, sustain that distinctive adolescent sensibility but too often they 
descend into fairly stock stand-up. You can't help but wonder if she's slumming 
-- especially when she follows up with something fresh and wonderfully 
out-there, like "What scares me is when you're forced to be nice to some 
paranoid schizophrenic, just 'cause she lives in your body." 
</P>
<P>
But Tenuta is so much fun to watch that even if she maintains the status quo, 
plenty more folks are going to embrace Judyism. 
</P>
<P>
Headlining a first-rate bill that also includes Fran Solomita and John Padon, 
Tenuta continues through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Improv is at 4255 Campus Drive, Irvine. Show times: 8 p.m. Thursday and 
Sunday, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. Friday, 8 and 10:30 p.m. Saturday. Tickets: $8 to 
12. Information: (714) 854-5455.

KING AND MALCOLM X TAKE A 'MEETING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Meeting" is what if theater, as in what if Martin Luther King Jr. and 
Malcolm X sat down in a cozy hotel room in 1965 and discussed the civil rights 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
As directed by Adleane Hunter for the Orange County Black Actors Theatre as 
part of its observance of Black History Month, Jeff Stetson's play offers 
intriguing possibilities: Could these men have joined in a common strategy for 
the movement? Could they have gotten along as leaders? They were, after all, 
men with very different perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
A disciple of Thoreau, Gandhi and Christ, King used nonviolent civil 
disobedience in his efforts to win hearts and to influence minds. Malcolm X, 
meanwhile, spoke of aggression and the need to meet fist with fist, gunshot 
with gunshot. Turn the other cheek? Like hell, man. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Stetson lets fantasy go too far, creating an idealized vision 
that smacks of contrivance: Malcolm X (Bingwa) discovers that King (Curtis 
Thomas) has brought his daughter a doll to replace the one she lost when their 
home was firebombed, and suddenly, all heat between the men dissipates. Malcolm 
X finds himself marveling at what he and King could do as "a team." The play 
ends with a handclasp of understanding (harking back to an arm-wrestling match 
earlier) that goes beyond respect to approach near-mawkish affection. 
</P>
<P>
Director Hunter can be criticized for taking this happy ending and pumping it 
up to made-for-television dimensions but, in her defense, it does seem in line 
with Stetson's fable-like writing. It's obvious that we are supposed to leave 
the theater feeling good about these two legends; "The Meeting," in the end, is 
less about black history than it is about black pride. 
</P>
<P>
Stetson sees Malcolm X as more than a charismatic leader, passionate social 
thinker, uncompromising avenger and former prisoner. He paints him with 
humanistic strokes, as a man who also had a sense of humor and who harbored a 
great love of family. 
</P>
<P>
In the production's best performance, Bingwa shares Stetson's vision and 
presents a wise and, though temperamental, relatively reasonable firebrand. 
</P>
<P>
When, for instance, his fuming bodyguard (Tahlib McMicheaux) sarcastically 
berates him for meeting King, Malcolm X takes it all in stride. 
</P>
<P>
Because King is more familiar to most of us, Thomas has a bigger challenge in 
making the role his own. And -- unlike Bingwa, who resembles Malcolm X somewhat 
-- Thomas looks nothing like King. Still, Thomas is able to evoke the 
character, focusing on King's strength and famous patience. King is the 
immovable object to Malcolm X's irresistible force, and Thomas communicates 
this resolve. 
</P>
<P>

BURN CENTER, SUPPORT GROUP MARK BIRTHDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA MARIN, Pamela Marin is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was black-tie optional. It was $100 per couple. So how come it looked like a 
great big family reunion -- or a meeting of 180 long-lost friends? 
</P>
<P>
A few words with the hosts and guests of last week's "Birthday Bash" for the 
Orange County Burn Assn. and the UC Irvine Burn Center provided ample 
explanation for all that cocktail-hour hugging and kissing and genuine emotion 
so rare at formal events. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very close-knit community," said an ebullient Susie Martinez, 
nursing manager of the eight-bed burn unit, which is at UC Irvine Medical 
Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"Patients and members of the recovery team often become extremely close," said 
Dr. Kenneth Waxman, associate director of the burn unit. 
</P>
<P>
"These people," said Mark Chweh, who suffered burns on 50% of his body in a 
building fire last summer, "are incredible." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the dinner and awards party marked the coming of age of the UCI 
Burn Center (officially 21 years old) and the 10th anniversary of the Orange 
County Burn Assn., a volunteer group that organizes patient support groups, 
community education programs and fund raising for research. 
</P>
<P>
In a tumble of words, Martinez explained the facts of life in the burn unit, 
which treated about 700 patients last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to recruit nurses, because burns are such an awful injury, with 
such devastating disfigurement, that a lot of nurses just don't want that kind 
of emotional intensity," said Martinez, an 18-year veteran of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of drama, almost all the time," she said, "but it's so rewarding 
to take a patient from the critical, intensive-care stage, with all the shock 
and trauma and guilt and anger . . . and help them and their family get on with 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Helping burn survivors get on with life is the primary function of the 
association, which organizes a monthly therapy session for current and former 
patients. Between 15 and 30 people attend, discussing the physical and mental 
adjustments required by their burns. 
</P>
<P>
Caryl Modrinski, director of the organization, said she got a call recently 
from a 38-year-old woman who wanted to find out more about the support group. 
"She said she was burned when she was 3 years old, but she said she still could 
not deal with her disfigurement." 
</P>
<P>
A regular at the therapy sessions is Tom Handlan, 28, who 8 years ago suffered 
second- and third-degree burns on 95% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me a better-than-100% chance of dying," said Handlan with a 
mischievous laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Handlan survived, recovered, flourished: He graduated from Cal State Fullerton 
last year and is enrolled in the master's program in clinical psychology at 
Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner, awards were presented to Dr. Robert Bartlett and Pat Allyn, R.N.; 
Capt. William Lawler of the Westminster Fire Department; medical researcher 
Aubrey Woodroof, and burn survivor and activist Barbara Kammerer. 
</P>
<P>
Honored for their valor in rescuing others from flames were Quintin Reich, 
Robert Walker, Greg Upham, Rubin Vigil, John Floyd and Mark Chweh.

ANN CONWAY: WOMEN TOLD TO SOAR TO NEW ATTITUDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
"Your attitude determines your altitude." That was the message television 
personality Melody Rogers had for the 450 women who attended the "Celebrating 
Women Today" seminar Tuesday at the Four Seasons Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, whose show "2 on the Town" was canceled last fall after an 8-year run, 
told the decked-out crowd she had learned that her "thinking attitudes had 
always directly corresponded to what was happening in my life." 
</P>
<P>
And, looking snappy and happy in ruby red, she told the tale of her journey 
from the "frustrated chorus girl" years to becoming a bright-eyed, 
tousle-haired TV celebrity. "But we were replaced by the 'Gong Show,' " she 
wailed before joining guests at the benefit for the Orange County Philharmonic 
Society staged by its Spyglass Hill Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Her attitude now? "Oh, I've been working in my garden a lot lately," she said 
with a huge smile. "And I got married. I needed time, after all. Time for me. 
Time to see what's next." (What's next for Rogers, she said, is the TV show she 
is currently producing with her husband, Patrick Kelley. "It's called 'American 
Tales,' " she said. "We're going to travel around the country in a motor home 
with our dogs and interview the backbone of America.") 
</P>
<P>
Her advice for women having trouble celebrating life? "Go out into the garden. 
Plant seeds. Watch them grow. The laws of nature remind us to trust. Look at a 
deciduous tree. Its leaves fall, but they always come back." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the seminar agenda was Beverly Hills psychologist Leonore Hausner, 
Ph.D. "I'm here to teach women about more effective ways to communicate," she 
said, moments before she went on stage with a peppy dialogue that got her 
audience howling. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about lack of communication causing divorce, she cited the woman who 
went to an attorney who asked her if she had "grounds." "Grounds? We've got 3 
acres!" the woman answered. 
</P>
<P>
Then Hausner, who also wore red, got serious and said that poor listening was 
the chief reason for poor communication. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to be a reflective listener," she told the crowd. "When somebody 
talks to you, listen to the feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Don't try to be a know-it-all, she said, and tell them you know the answer to 
their problems. And don't be a soother and tell them to just sleep on it and 
everything will be all right. "And don't be a worry wart!" she said, and say 
things that will scare them to death. Just say something like: "That must have 
been so embarrassing for you." 
</P>
<P>
"When your friend talks to you of a humiliating experience," she said, "listen 
to the feeling." 
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Joyce Reaume, event chairwoman, introduced Susan Taylor 
Rothenberg, new owner of Charles Jourdan boutiques in Costa Mesa and Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm am also here to celebrate," said Rothenberg, stunning in a mustard-colored 
leather suit and a diamond the size of a Jacuzzi. "This is my first California 
fashion show!" 
</P>
<P>
With that, models sporting avant-garde looks by Charles Jourdan of Paris took 
the runway. On view: crayon-colored leather suits, some draped with bold 
scarfs; skinny bathing suits topped with huge hats; and romantic evening gowns, 
one fringed at every turn with flowing ostrich feathers. 
</P>
<P>
Cocktails and a fillet of beef luncheon followed. Proceeds were estimated at 
$15,000. Also among those on the seminar committee: Barbara Sanderson, 
president of the Spyglass committee; Judy Rose, Christel Schar (who asked 
Rogers to appear); Phyllis Meyer; Milli Wieseneck; Terri Newman, and Mary 
Sabatasso.

ASK THE VET: LITTLE CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT CAT VIRUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn.

<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Last week, we had to put our 3-year-old mixed-breed cat, Sugar, to sleep 
after he started losing a lot of weight and became very sick. Our veterinarian 
did some blood tests and diagnosed FIP, which he said was caused by a virus. 
Why didn't the vaccinations protect him? Was there something else we could have 
done to prevent this infection? 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. L. O'Neil, 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
A: Unfortunately, the loss of your cat to FIP (feline infectious peritonitis) 
is compounded by the fact that there is little that you could do to have 
prevented this disease from occurring. The FIP virus is spread through contact 
(from fighting or through exposure) with infected cats. Unfortunately, there is 
currently no vaccination available to prevent this disease. 
</P>
<P>
If you are planning to get another kitten, completely clean areas that your cat 
frequented, purchase new feeding bowls and litter box and dispose of old toys. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it necessary to keep a sweater on a small dog when the weather turns 
cold? Our little Pekingese starts to shiver when we go for walk at night when 
it is cold. We bought her a sweater and she seems to like it. We were told by 
friends that it didn't make any difference. 
</P>
<P>
A Reader, Orange 
</P>
<P>
A: When the temperature really drops or the weather becomes damp, adding a 
sweater to keep your pet warm when you go for walks is probably a good idea. 
This is particularly true for dogs kept primarily indoors and if they have 
short coats. One note of caution: Exercise will increase the body temperature 
and a restrictive amount of clothing may cause your pet to overheat.

VICTIM OF KNIFE ASSAULT OVER JACKET IS IMPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old man was recovering Wednesday from stab wounds suffered when 
three boys with shaved heads attempted to steal his leather jacket in front of 
Loara High School, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police were looking for the three, who are suspected of stabbing the 
victim in the leg and abdomen about 3:30 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A UCI Medical Center spokeswoman identified the victim as Jose Irribarren. He 
was in fair condition Wednesday after undergoing exploratory abdominal surgery 
Tuesday night, according to Fran Tardiff. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said the victim, who is not a Loara student, had just 
driven up to the school when he was approached by the three. "They accosted 
him, told him they wanted his jacket, stabbed him and fled," he said. The 
suspects -- two 17-year-olds and one 16-year-old -- also are not students at 
the school, he said. They did not get the jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Police described the weapon as a "butterfly" knife, which opens with a flick of 
the wrist. The victim told police that the attackers are "skinhead types," 
Hedgpeth said. Skinheads shave their heads and espouse white supremacy. 
However, there was no evidence in the preliminary stage of the investigation 
that the attack had ethnic overtones, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Loara Principal Gerald Glenn said the attack occurred nearly an hour after 
classes had finished for the day, and there were few people on the campus. 
Security is not being beefed up after the attack, which he said was the first 
of its kind to occur at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth said Anaheim police "have had experiences in the past with some people 
in this area described as 'skinheads,' but as to whether this is an organized 
group, I don't know."

DOUG DECINCES NAMED TO ORANGEWOOD BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former California Angels player Doug DeCinces has been elected to the board of 
directors of the Orangewood Children's Foundation, which supports the county's 
shelter for abused and abandoned youths. 
</P>
<P>
The retired third baseman is a Villa Park resident who works in the development 
field, according to William G. Steiner, executive director of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
DeCinces served as honorary chairman of the 1987 community campaign that raised 
$200,000 for the Orangewood Foundation, the private fund-raising organization 
for Orangewood Children's Home. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the selection, Board Chairman William Lyon said DeCinces will be 
among 21 directors of the foundation, which raised $8 million to build the 
shelter and which supports the nearly 3,000 children who receive protective 
care in Orangewood each year. 
</P>
<P>
DeCinces, a native Southern Californian, played in the World Series with the 
Baltimore Orioles before joining the California Angels. He left the team in 
1987 to play baseball in Japan and then retired.

ATTORNEY INDICTED IN ALLEGED SODOMY OF NEIGHBOR YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury has indicted a Laguna Hills attorney for allegedly 
sodomizing a neighbor boy and providing him with marijuana and cocaine during 
an 8-month period ending last fall, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-count indictment was filed Tuesday against Eric Paul Lampel, 34, who 
surrendered Wednesday afternoon before Orange County Superior Court Judge Myron 
S. Brown in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Brown released Lampel on his own recognizance on the condition he not live in 
his neighborhood and that he stay away from both the alleged victim and 
witnesses in the case, according to Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Connie 
Johnson. She said Lampel is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges March 16. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office normally files charges in criminal cases. But 
Johnson said she brought the case before the grand jury to "evaluate the 
credibility of all the witnesses," some of whom are juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
Lampel could not be reached for comment Wednesday. However, his attorney, Paul 
S. Meyer of Costa Mesa, released the following statement: 
</P>
<P>
"These charges are absolutely unfounded. This previously rejected case will 
never stand the light of day. Mr. Lampel looks forward to presenting the truth 
in court." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer would not elaborate on his contention that the district attorney's office 
had at some point chosen not to pursue the case. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who will prosecute the case, declined to provide many details about 
either the victim or the alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
She said the charges against Lampel include sodomy of a minor under the age of 
16, oral copulation of a minor, furnishing marijuana and cocaine to a minor, 
contributing to the delinquency of a minor -- a misdemeanor -- and misdemeanor 
child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have also accused Lampel -- who specializes in personal injury, 
real estate and business law -- of violating a position of trust with the 
alleged victim, a charge that could result in additional penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson alleges that the crimes took place between December, 1987, and Sept. 6, 
1988. She would say only that Lampel "was a neighbor to several youths in the 
Laguna Hills area. The alleged victim was one of these youths." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said there is one youth alleged to be the main victim, but there are 
"some other minors who can give some evidence and will give some evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, conducted by the Sheriff's Department and the district 
attorney's office, was launched after "one of the mothers went to the Sheriff's 
Department," Johnson said, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said she took the unusual action of presenting evidence in the case to 
the grand jury because "I wanted to evaluate the credibility of all the 
witnesses and there was one witness who wanted to go before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
"So I figured if we were doing one we might as well do the whole thing" before 
the grand jury, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A secretary at Lampel's Laguna Hills law office said Lampel "wants to cooperate 
with the press," but he was not immediately available for comment. She called 
the charges "very vicious, untrue allegations." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson could not be reached later Wednesday regarding the assertion that the 
district attorney's office at some point chose not to prosecute Lampel.

NEW PLAN TO AID ABUSED YOUNGSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The traumatizing impact of the criminal justice system on sexually abused 
children may be eased in Orange County if an experimental program being 
introduced today proves successful. 
</P>
<P>
Aimed at drastically reducing the number of interviews that abused children 
must endure, the program would coordinate the needs of investigators and also 
provide an array of support services under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
Called the Child Abuse Services Team or CAST, the program involves 
unprecedented cooperation between 10 police departments, the county Department 
of Children's Services, the district attorney's office and a host of private 
agencies which have agreed to coordinate their investigations of sexual abuse 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal justice experts say they had become increasingly concerned with the 
ordeal youngsters are put through after abuse was reported -- a process that 
requires them to recount and relive a brutalizing experience over and over. 
</P>
<P>
"We got together and conducted a mini-poll and in the worst-case scenarios a 
child might be interviewed 25 times, at the least 10 to 11 times," said 
Superior Court Judge Betty Lou Lamoreaux, who is chairwoman of the Child Abuse 
Services Team committee and formerly was presiding judge of the county's 
Juvenile Court. "By the time a child goes from police to social workers, mental 
health workers, doctors, therapists, lawyers, more detectives, it only heaps on 
more abuse." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-month pilot program, run by the Orange County district attorney's office 
and paid for by the county and private agencies, will operate out of the 
county's Orangewood Children's Home in a specially designed suite of rooms and 
will provide interviewers trained to deal with abused children. 
</P>
<P>
Agencies participating in the program include the Costa Mesa, Cypress, Garden 
Grove, La Habra, Newport Beach, Orange, Santa Ana, Tustin and Westminster 
police departments and the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It had become obvious that the way we were doing things was not in the best 
interest of the kids, " said Gene Howard, director of the Department of 
Children's Services. "We think that with CAST we will be able to decrease the 
trauma caused by the system itself." 
</P>
<P>
There are similar interdepartmental teams in Santa Monica and in Santa Clara, 
San Luis Obispo and San Joaquin counties. But they do not equal the Orange 
County program in scope or services provided, according to those officials 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Officials contend that the cooperation forged by the program will strengthen 
communication between the agencies and make their investigations more 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has been working in their own sphere, and while we give lip service 
to networking with other county agencies, it is not something that happens 
naturally," said Jan Sturla, an assistant district attorney and CAST staff 
member. "This should work for the children, and it should work for the rest of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Children may be affected in a number of ways, experts say. Already embarrassed 
by the abuse itself, many children withdraw and refuse to cooperate with 
authorities. Others maintain a strong facade through the process but are in 
fact deeply hurt. 
</P>
<P>
And it is believed that the emotional upheaval of reliving abuse can cause 
lasting damage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a humiliating thing for kids to have to go through," said Cathy Campbell, 
director of CAST. "We ask them to sit down like you and I would sit down and 
recount the most intimate details of their lives. It's hard to know what kind 
of healing, if any, gets done." 
</P>
<P>
Many youngsters who are asked to tell their stories over and over eventually 
recant them, regardless of the truth, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of guilt already, and if Dad goes to jail and Mom is mad, they 
feel responsible for everything," said Robin Tobias, an after-care family 
therapist for ChildHelp USA, a group that supports physically and sexually 
abused children. "They ask themselves, 'what have I gotten myself into,' and 
they will change their stories." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the effects of continually repeating a story can also make the 
child seem glib and unbelievable, authorities suggest. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time a child appears in front of a jury, they have a tendency to repeat 
things by rote, and the jury gets the impression either that it's memorized or 
they have been brainwashed and the story might not be true," Lamoreaux said. 
"I've tried a couple of cases myself, and it comes out so easily that it makes 
you wonder. From the judicial viewpoint, that is one reason we need a new 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the example of other programs around the county, authorities say, CAST 
should boost the number of successful child-abuse prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County program is modeled on a similar one that has operated in 
Huntsville, Ala., for more than 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ethel Amacher, clinical director of the Huntsville program, said the team 
approach has resulted in fewer numbers of recantations. 
</P>
<P>
"We can see that when children have a supportive team around them, they see 
themselves as part of that team," she said. "We are prosecuting more cases and 
prosecuting them more successfully. Our case load has risen. We are reaching so 
many more people." 
</P>
<P>
Sturla said: "An emotionally strong child is a better witness, a more coherent 
witness." But he added: "As a prosecutor, I like to think that we are not 
torturing a child by putting him or her through this procedure. A better 
conviction rate is a desirable sidelight, but the focus is to help the child." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 4,000 cases of sexual abuse of children were reported to 
police agencies throughout the county. Because of its limited scope, not all of 
these potential cases will be referred to CAST. About 200 children are expected 
to make up the initial case load, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of the program will be the children's center at Orangewood, in rooms 
designed to be non-threatening and comfortable for the child. 
</P>
<P>
Within the center are two waiting areas, one for younger children with 
child-size, bean-bag furniture and toys and the other for older children and 
teens. Both will be equipped with televisions and videocassette recorders. 
</P>
<P>
Key elements of the center are the three interview rooms and a connecting 
observation room. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is for one trained interviewer to handle the questioning for 
investigators throughout the criminal process. Because officials from several 
agencies will be able to observe and provide data to the interviewer, it is 
expected that the number of interviews needed will be reduced sharply. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, there are a variety of ways police departments go about the 
process," Sturla said. "Some kids are interviewed by the patrol officer who 
arrives on the scene. Others use more experienced detectives. Having an 
experienced, qualified interviewer will increase the quality of reports (that 
the D.A.'s office) will get." 
</P>
<P>
The initial medical exam and contacts with social workers, therapists, 
court-appointed child advocates and lawyers will also take place at the center. 
</P>
<P>
And while children caught up in the justice system are often left bereft after 
a case is resolved, families involved in CAST will be provided with mental 
health and other support services. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say that if the program is successful, it might be expanded to 
include victims of other kinds of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a program that will last," said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, a 
former police officer who has championed the program from the beginning. "The 
Board (of Supervisors) is very committed to it. This is a re-looking at how we 
do business in this sensitive area of helping our children. Incidents of child 
abuse in all forms are on the rise and we must be prepared to deal with these 
situations in a more effective way," he said.

VON STAICH USES VICTIM'S STATEMENT TO ASK NEW MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Convicted murderer Ivan Von Staich has given the state Court of Appeal a sworn 
statement from a woman who now says she may have been partly at fault when Von 
Staich killed her husband 5 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors attacked the new statement as coerced and meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
Von Staich, who a jury found was justified in escaping from Orange County Jail 
because he feared for his life, is also seeking to overturn the murder that put 
him in jail in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
In appealing for a new trial earlier this month, Von Staich submitted the new 
statement from Cynthia Topper that would appear to support Von Staich's 
contention that he acted in self-defense in killing her husband, Robert Totter, 
on Dec. 7, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, investigators with the district attorney's office interviewed 
Cynthia Topper themselves and said they heard a different story. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators said that Topper denied the alleged recantation as "all lies" 
and that Von Staich or his investigators may have somehow coerced the woman 
into signing the declaration. She suffered severe brain damage when Von Staich 
attacked her after the shooting, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe it is true," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard King. "It's 
totally inconsistent with the facts that came out at Von Staich's trial." He 
declined to provide access to investigators' taped interviews with Topper, and 
she could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"This woman is a very confused and vulnerable victim," King said. "Because of 
him, she now has the mental capacity of a fifth-grader, and this is just 
another example of his capitalizing on his brutality to victimize her yet 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Von Staich, 32, was convicted of breaking into the Toppers' Santa Ana home in 
1983 and shooting and killing Robert Topper, 29. Von Staich then repeatedly 
beat 25-year-old Cynthia Topper, his former girlfriend, with a claw hammer, 
sending her into a coma that required brain surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Sentenced to 37 years to life in the attack, Von Staich escaped from Orange 
County Jail in January, 1986. But last week, a jury astounded county officials 
by finding that Von Staich was justified in his escape because he was beaten by 
jail guards and had to flee for his life. 
</P>
<P>
Von Staich has already been turned down by the 4th District Court of Appeal in 
Santa Ana on an earlier motion for a new murder trial. But in papers filed Feb. 
6 with the court, he urged yet another reconsideration of his case based on the 
allegedly new evidence from Topper. 
</P>
<P>
Topper was not called to testify at Von Staich's trial because of a memory loss 
caused by her beating. But in the signed declaration that Staich gave the 
court, Topper said that she invited Von Staich to her house that night to pick 
up some old clothes and that her husband, Robert Topper, in fact, provoked the 
attack by threatening to kill Von Staich. 
</P>
<P>
Topper's declaration ends: "My conscience has been bothering me real bad, so I 
just want everyone to know the truth about the night of Dec. 7, 1983. I know 
the trial is over, but I feel that if I had not called Ivan that night, that 
maybe none of this would have happened."

JOB LOGS CITED BY BOTH SIDES IN KRAFT TRIAL 
</P>

<P>
A swimwear distributor testified Wednesday that Randy Steven Kraft was working 
for him in Torrance on the night that one of the 16 men Kraft is accused of 
killing was last seen alive in Carson almost 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time since Kraft's defense began June 30, his attorneys used work 
records in a bid to show that he was busy with his computer consultant business 
in Los Angeles County when bodies of young men were being found in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 43, is on trial in Superior Court in Santa Ana, accused of killing more 
people than any serial killer has ever been charged with slaying in California. 
If convicted of any of the 16 murders, prosecutors -- in a bid to send him to 
the gas chamber -- might introduce evidence at a penalty phase alleging that 
Kraft committed up to 45 murders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense's Picture 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney C. Thomas McDonald contends that Kraft's work records and his 
demeanor among colleagues on the job were inconsistent with someone who had 
roamed freeways all night, picking up young men and killing them. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that the defense's timetable of Kraft on the job helps 
build a case against the defendant. They said none of the employment logs show 
that Kraft was at work when any of the 16 victims were known to have been 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
Swimwear distributor Donald Sheahan on Wednesday produced work records for 
Kraft, who was setting up computer programs for him. Here is how they relate to 
three of the 16 murders, according to court testimony: 
</P>
<P>
* The job records show that Kraft worked at Sheahan's Arena USA in Torrance on 
Nov. 16, 17 and 19, 1978. He left work at 9:30 p.m. on the 17th and returned on 
the 19th at 11 a.m. Kraft is charged with killing Michael Joseph Inderbeiten, 
21, last seen alive at 2 a.m. on Nov. 18, 1978, walking toward a bus station 
near a bar in Long Beach. His body was found 4 hours later along the 7th Street 
on-ramp to the San Gabriel River Freeway in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
* The records show that Kraft was at Sheahan's on June 18, worked past midnight 
and returned June 20 at 10:30 a.m. Kraft is charged with killing Richard Allen 
Keith, 20, last seen alive at 11 p.m. June 18 when leaving his girlfriend's 
house in Carson. His body was found about 6 hours later on Moulton Parkway in 
Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Over the defense's objection, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown has pointed out 
to jurors that Kraft could have gone through Carson -- and picked up Keith 
hitchhiking -- on his way home to East Long Beach after leaving Arena USA that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
* The records show that Kraft worked at Arena on July 5, 1978, from noon to 
8:30 p.m. and on July 6, 1978, from 2 p.m. to midnight. Kraft is charged with 
killing Keith Arthur Klingbeil, a transient from Washington state, whose body 
was found about 3:30 a.m. on July 6, 1978, in a northbound lane of Interstate 5 
in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The records also show that Kraft worked during the week before and the week 
after the June 11, 1978, death of Roland Gerald Young, whose body was found in 
Irvine. McDonald also introduced testimony that a week before the Inderbeiten 
killing, Kraft was at his niece's wedding in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is a picture of Randy Kraft living a normal life style, 
doing normal things at the time all this was going on," McDonald said after the 
court session. 
</P>
<P>
While McDonald was pleased with Sheahan's testimony, he lost another round with 
Judge Donald A. McCartin on Wednesday in his attempt to put before jurors the 
names of other potential suspects in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
McCartin refused to let him elicit testimony in front of the jury that mass 
murderer William C. Bonin, convicted of 14 murders in Southern California in 
1978-80, was once a suspect in any of the Kraft murders. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald wanted jurors to hear testimony that fibers found on one of the 
victims had once been compared with known fibers in some of the Bonin cases. 
Prosecutor Brown contended that the testimony would be irrelevant because the 
lab reports showed that the fibers did not match, and the judge agreed. 
</P>
<P>
After the court session, McDonald complained that "the jurors should be given a 
chance to evaluate any information that might be relevant." 
</P>
<P>
He said this would probably not be his last attempt to get Bonin's name in 
front of the jury.

Fran Cummings, former Cal State Fullerton volleyball coach, has been named 
general manager of the Los Angeles Starlites, the women's professional 
volleyball team that plays its home games at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings replaces Gary Coffey, who resigned Tuesday for personal reasons. 
Coffey will continue as general manager and coach of the International 
Ambassadors women's volleyball team, which plays an international schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings will manage the Starlites' day-to-day operations, including 
marketing,promotions and sponsorships. The Starlites, two-time defending Major 
League Volleyball champions, played in front of 1,528 Friday in an 
opening-night victory over the Portland Spikers. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously some great things have been done to support the team in Irvine and 
Orange County, and we want to continue to capitalize on that," Cummings said. 
"We just need to show people our product. It's just a matter of turning people 
on to it." 
</P>
<P>
Cummings resigned from Fullerton under pressure in November after nine seasons 
during which her teams had a record of 84-216.

DESPITE TRAFFIC WORRIES, EXECUTIVES UPBEAT OVER FUTURE, UCI POLL FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Most Orange County executives hold an optimistic view of the year to come and 
expect their companies to grow in 1989, but they worry that traffic and other 
problems threaten to undermine the county's attractiveness as a place to do 
business in the future, a UC Irvine poll revealed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of the respondents cited the transportation system as the 
major problem facing the county. The lack of lower-cost, or affordable, housing 
ranked a distant second, with 12% of the executives citing it as the biggest 
problem to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
Other concerns included increasing commercial rents and land prices, the 
overall cost of living in the county and difficulties in hiring qualified 
workers for many skilled, technical and managerial positions. 
</P>
<P>
For those reasons, 41% of the respondents said they expect the county's 
attractiveness as a place to do business will decline over the next 10 years -- 
compared to 34% who said they expect the county's attractiveness to increase. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Executive Survey and Employment Forecast is based on the responses of 
chief executives and chief financial officers of 194 county-based firms. The 
findings showed little change from the university's 1987-88 survey. The 
findings were also quite similar to the results of a survey of Orange County 
business executives conducted by The Times early last year. 
</P>
<P>
And as in the previous polls, the problems identified in this year's survey 
failed to dim county executives' outlook, said Jone L. Pearce, a UCI associate 
professor of management and co-director of the UCI Center for Orange County 
Research survey. 
</P>
<P>
Although two out of five executives said the county's business climate will 
decline in the next decade, only one in 10 said it is "very likely" that their 
company will move out of the county in the next 10 years. And 48% said it is 
very likely that their companies will expand in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that 10% of the respondents said their companies will probably move 
out of the county by 1999 is not disturbing, Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
The responses, she said, tended to come from older manufacturing firms and 
businesses unable to afford the county's commercial rents. Their absences will 
be more than made up for, she said, by the expansion of existing firms and by 
new firms that either move in from outside the county or are started in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to identify solutions to the county's pressing transportation problems, 
the executives suggested comfortable standbys: 35% said more freeways are 
needed, 24% said existing freeways should be widened and 20% said the county 
should invest in a fixed rail system. People movers, monorails and other more 
futuristic solutions weren't mentioned with enough frequency to be cited in the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tolls, User Fees Suggested 
</P>
<P>
Half of the executives suggested tolls or other user fees to pay for 
improvements in the transportation system, 25% said they would support a sales 
tax increase and 20% suggested a tax on new construction. 
</P>
<P>
Because job creation is a prime indicator of the direction the economy is 
taking, the executives were asked for their hiring projections for 1989. Half 
said they intend to increase employment. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the executives forecast a healthy 3% increase in the number of jobs 
available in the county by year's end, Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
A mathematical forecast prepared by Ralph Catalano, professor of social ecology 
at UCI, projects that 30,000 jobs will be created in the county this year. That 
will represent a 2.6% increase from the 1.14 million jobs that existed in 
December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The executives said the most sought-after employees will be clerical, sales and 
crafts workers and unskilled laborers. A year ago, managers and professional 
and technical workers were the prime hiring targets. 
</P>
<P>
Although 41% of the respondents said they expect the county's attractiveness to 
business to decline over the next decade, only 36% said they believe the 
business climate has worsened in the past year; 33% said it has improved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Downbeat 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers -- who tend to look for large, unskilled or semiskilled worker 
pools and low-cost sites for their plants -- predominated among those who 
anticipate or have seen a decline in business climate. Retailers and financial 
executives predominated among respondents anticipating increased attractiveness 
to business. 
</P>
<P>
In a measurement of their confidence in the future, leaders of businesses with 
more than 100 employees awarded the economy a score of 80 -- the equivalent of 
a B+. That stands well above the 53, or "so-so" score, recorded in a nationwide 
confidence sampling by The Conference Board. 
</P>
<P>
And executives of small business and professional services firms -- included in 
the 3-year-old UCI survey for the first time -- were even more optimistic. The 
20 small-business leaders were asked whether they believe that their own 
companies' economic performances will increase or decrease in 1989. Ninety 
percent said they expect increases and 10% said they believe things will stay 
the same. None anticipate decreases. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar nationwide poll by D&amp;B Reports, 71% of the small-business 
executives anticipated increased financial performance this year, 16% said 
things will stay the same and 13% said they expect to see declining 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Lyman W. Porter, a professor of management and co-director of the UCI survey, 
said that county business executives tend to be highly optimistic because the 
diversity of the businesses shields the county from the damaging economic 
crunches that can hit areas where one or two industries dominate. 
</P>
<P>
"And the kinds of businesses that are here -- medical and high technology and 
retail and service -- are the kinds of businesses that have done well in the 
general economy over the last 3 years," Porter said.

Pacific Rim Conference Set: San Francisco, where the Golden Gate Bridge 
symbolizes the gateway to the Pacific, was chosen to host a major trade and 
finance symposium expected to attract about 1,000 business and political 
leaders from Pacific Rim nations. Mayor Art Agnos said the 1990 Pacific Rim 
Conference was "a real coup" for San Francisco and would help establish the Bay 
Area as a major U.S. "hub" of commerce for an economically powerful 
Asia-Pacific region that encompasses 57 countries and 2.4 billion people. The 
first Pacific Rim Conference was held in Perth, Western Australia, in November, 
1986.

POSTNUCLEAR BEER DEFEAT MAY MEAN END TO LIVE MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Laguna Beach City Council's unanimous refusal Tuesday to allow beer sales 
at Club Postnuclear probably means the end of live concerts at the club, 
according to owner William (Max) Nee. 
</P>
<P>
Postnuclear, which opened in July at 775 Laguna Canyon Road, has been the only 
club in Orange County besides the well-established Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano to regularly present nationally known touring rock and reggae acts. 
</P>
<P>
Nee had launched Postnuclear as an alcohol-free establishment, but late last 
year he decided that the lavishly appointed but struggling club needed beer 
sales to broaden both its audience and the range of musical attractions that it 
could present. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't be able to book our live music now," Nee said after the council 
denied his application for a beer permit by a vote of 5 to 0. The decision 
capped an hourlong hearing in which public comment was about evenly divided on 
the issue of beer sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost $10,000 this month" on live shows, Nee said after his council defeat. 
"I can't go on like that." 
</P>
<P>
Nee said he would present six more concerts already booked through March 16. 
After that, the club will open only on Friday and Saturday nights for dancing 
to recorded music, which has proven to be a strong draw. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council vote overturned a previous decision by a lesser city agency, 
the Board of Adjustment, that would have allowed Postnuclear, which admits 
18-year-olds, to sell beer under strict guidelines aimed at ensuring that 
minors would not drink and that security in and around the club would be 
tightly enforced. Council members said they were not willing to allow beer to 
be sold under any circumstances in a club where some patrons would be under 21. 
Some minors might drink, they said, and, barring that, under-age patrons still 
would come under a bad influence. 
</P>
<P>
"What 18-year-olds want more than anything else is to be 21 years old," said 
Council Member Lida Lenney. Beer sales at Postnuclear would "show them why it's 
important to be 21 years old . . . because you get to drink beer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also said they feared that beer drinking at the club would 
increase the number of drunk drivers on Laguna Canyon Road, a route infamous 
for bloody car wrecks. 
</P>
<P>
Nee and other club spokesmen had promised to implement a special program, based 
on studies done at the University of Minnesota, aimed at deterring excessive 
drinking at Postnuclear. It would have included strict security measures and 
special training for alcohol servers. Drinking already is a problem among 
Laguna Beach teen-agers, Nee said -- and no council member disputed him. 
Postnuclear would give them a "safe, controlled" alternative to beer parties, 
he argued, and set a model for responsible social drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is (the council) never even listened," Nee said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Nee held out one vague avenue for continuing live shows at Postnuclear: forming 
a partnership with the neighboring Canyon Bar &amp; Grill, which has a full 
liquor license. But it was unclear how such a partnership between two 
nightclubs could be implemented or whether it could pass muster with city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Chastain, owner of the Canyon Bar &amp; Grill, said after the hearing that 
he is open to discussions with Nee, but "there's no way Max could buy my liquor 
license and install it in his place." 
</P>
<P>
Except for one high school student who complained that Postnuclear doesn't 
admit teen-agers under 18, those speaking against the beer license were older 
residents. Two were neighboring businessmen who decried traffic problems and 
fan behavior Monday at a free afternoon show that featured the rock band Dead 
Milkmen. 
</P>
<P>
"They had every freak in Orange County down here," said Gene Henson. "I felt 
after walking through that crowd that I should go home and take a bath." 
</P>
<P>
Three speakers 20 and under backed Postnuclear, favorably comparing its 
cleanliness and stylishness to other rock clubs they had frequented. 
</P>
<P>
Two adults not connected to the club also argued in favor of a beer permit. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Loeliger told the council that "usually I would not support any 
alcohol-related matter because my son (who was 22) was killed by an 
irresponsible drunk driver." But Loeliger praised Postnuclear as "a place (for 
young people) to let go of their frustrations, the growing pains, and be among 
themselves without getting into trouble, as they would at private parties where 
they would drink alcohol anyway." 
</P>
<P>
One resident, Kedric Francis, asked the council to consider the cultural 
benefits of having an adventurous rock music club in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What always struck me (about Laguna Beach) was the diversity here -- cultural, 
social, artistic," the 28-year-old attorney said. "Now I sense that tolerance 
slipping away. These arguments (against Postnuclear) are based on fear of the 
young and the new and the different. Culturally, (the club) is on the cutting 
edge. . . . When one cultural aspect of the community is strong, it adds 
strength to all the others."

MAKING A SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
THE WAY OFF BROADWAY ACTING WORKSHOP IS NO PLACE FOR THE TIMID OR THIN-SKINNED

Michelle Fashian is having trouble getting her lip to quiver. She has just 
spilled her guts but can't muster the tears necessary to carry the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Bach, the drama instructor leading the group of 10 young adults in the 
Way Off Broadway acting workshop, is displeased. His two proteges on stage are 
not emoting enough. They are not believable. They're not cookin'. 
</P>
<P>
"Agony, baby, agony," he yells as Fashian portrays an impoverished New Yorker. 
"You're 10 years old. You're hurting. All you want to do is put your head on 
your mother's breast. C'mon, Michelle. You need the image. Quiver! Let it out. 
Full cry. Get it cookin'." 
</P>
<P>
The small room is silent as Fashian, a 23-year-old assistant manager of a 
children's shoe store, reaches into her soul, groping for the memory of some 
long-ago anguish, anything that might bring tears to her eyes. When she finally 
musters a quiver, Bach yelps. "You're cookin'!' " 
</P>
<P>
The students are not actors, but most of them would like to be. They are 
waiters, forklift operators, salespersons and dental assistants, almost all in 
their 20s, who are taking acting classes at night at the Way Off Broadway, a 
makeshift theater/studio that occupies a couple of rooms in an industrial 
building off Grand Avenue in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Organized 2 years ago by Orange County actor Tony Reverditto, the 
one-night-a-week workshops, which are scheduled to run from 7 to 10:30 p.m. but 
sometimes stretch into the early morning hours, cost $80 a month -- and a lot 
of time and energy. Most students meet 5 nights a week to study the scenes that 
are performed for the class on Wednesday nights. In addition, the group is 
rehearsing a full-length play, Frances Swann's "Out of the Frying Pan," one of 
six productions they present each year. 
</P>
<P>
("Out of the Frying Pan," a Depression-era screwball comedy, will be performed 
at 8 p.m. tonight, Friday and Saturday and March 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 and 11. The 
theater is at 1058 E. 1st St., Santa Ana. For more information, call (714) 
547-8997.) 
</P>
<P>
Fashian is not the only student who devotes all her free time -- 4 nights and 2 
days a week -- to acting classes and rehearsals. The others rehearse just as 
rigorously, knowing that if they perform their scenes badly, they will hear 
about it in front of the whole class. 
</P>
<P>
For these beginners, acting is an all-encompassing hobby that holds little 
chance of becoming an occupation. They are only too familiar with the 
contradictory phrase "working actor." But few are willing to let go of the 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
"My ultimate goal would be to make money at something I love, which would be 
acting," Fashian says. "But it's not too realistic, is it?" 
</P>
<P>
Reverditto -- who not only runs the studio (he is now trying to obtain 
nonprofit status), but also attends the workshops -- has more credits than 
anyone else in the class. Still, he knows it's a long way to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure there's no room at the bottom and plenty of room at the top," he 
says. "I know I'll make it. It just may take some time." 
</P>
<P>
But Jim Huang, a salesman in Orange, says he's not sure he wants to make the 
commitment needed to become a professional actor. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many people doing it," he says, "and it's not a high-security 
type thing. Unless you commit all the way, it's hard. You have to know it's 
what you're going to do with your life. But I really like it as a craft." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the students have no interest in pursuing acting as a profession. John 
Stuczynski, an agent for Farmers Insurance Group in Newport Beach, said the 
classes help him communicate with customers and muster composure during crises. 
</P>
<P>
Says Reverditto: "A lot of the people 
</P>
<P>
who come here just want to gain more confidence in their jobs. Some have had an 
interest in theater but never pursued it before, and others have been acting 
for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The students take the classes for varying lengths of time, depending on their 
experience, he adds. Some stay 6 months, others for years. 
</P>
<P>
"What we learn here is good to use in everyday life," says Carol Giglio, a 
23-year-old dental assistant who lives in Anaheim. "They are exercises in 
opening your mind. They help you cope." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Huang agrees. "It kind of breaks down your shell a little bit, breaks 
through the armor." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the students say they love the acting classes and don't mind 
the time commitment, many say their purses sometimes feel the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
"I've kind of been hanging by a thread," says Michael Kemp, a 26-year-old 
waiter. "Eighty dollars a month isn't a great deal, but when your car breaks 
down it is. You can sure start feeling sorry for yourself, saying, 'Look at all 
the time I'm putting into this,' but that's just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the students work during the day and study acting at night. For 
Giglio, the two go hand in hand. She uses her dental career not only to pay the 
bills but also to help perfect her acting technique. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great because it's a way to really study people and their mannerisms," 
she says. "I steal from them." 
</P>
<P>
The students are investing not only their time in the elusive goal of becoming 
an actor but emotional energy as well. Wednesday's scene studies are filled 
with Bach-induced outbursts of naked anger and anguish, which at times seem 
almost violent in the workshop's intimate surroundings. A little hallway 
adjoining the stage is used for deep breathing and profuse sweating -- a place 
to regain control or cool down after a scene. 
</P>
<P>
It took Fashian weeks to be able to quiver on command. At first she was scared 
to death by the way Bach coaxed his students -- by provoking them into fits of 
emotional frenzy. When Bach yelled, she winced. But now, Fashian is starting to 
cook. 
</P>
<P>
"First time I ever went to class I was scared for the person up there, the way 
Greg tore into him. But it was the most I ever saw an acting teacher do," says 
the former drama major. "He really gets responses. . . . He helps you do all 
the work." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to put yourself on the line," Huang says. "That's the hardest part, 
sitting up there in front of a whole bunch of people and crying. It's like Greg 
says, you try not to cry in real life and here you try to cry." 
</P>
<P>
Because the Wednesday night scene studies are meant to help the students 
overcome acting problems, they are no fun for the thin-skinned. Everyone is 
criticized on stage. Personality quirks, nervous tendencies and habits that 
inhibit or intrude are analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now my acting problem is what Greg calls (being able to) 'cook,' but I 
can't seem to let my emotions out unless he provokes me. I can't cry," Fashian 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Bach says all the students have the ability to tap that reservoir of emotion -- 
they just need help shedding their inhibitions and unlearning things they were 
taught along the way to becoming adults. They need to become children again. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have that little 10-year-old in us, the little kid full of imagination, 
freedom and spontaneity," Bach explains. "We need to hold onto that kid when 
we're on stage because he has the freedom to show his emotions, he's not afraid 
of looking like a fool." 
</P>
<P>
Bach's 21 years of directing and producing -- mostly plays in Orange County and 
Los Angeles -- have taught him how to get performances out of his acting 
students. He says they are like car batteries; they have to be charged up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to pull a psychological trip on them," says the 50-year-old 
director. "What I'm trying to do is teach them how to work with directors. To 
take direction." 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Beals and Michael Gaffney, both insurance advisers and recent immigrants 
from Oklahoma, are performing a scene from the James Reach play "Patterns," 
which they have been rehearsing for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfied with Gaffney's portrayal of a rising executive and his ambivalence 
toward his boss, Bach goads him, at first quietly, then with shouts and orders: 
"C'mon, Mike. I'll be your boss. What do you think of me? Build the core. 
Improvise. Tell me how you feel. You're hurtin', man." 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're a (expletive) pig!" Mike yells. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon, tell me off, how do you feel?" 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're a (expletive) pig!" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm your boss," Bach says. 
</P>
<P>
"You pig! Have a heart! Have a heart! Have a heart!" Mike screams at the top of 
his lungs. He's breathing so heavily he can hardly talk. He disappears into the 
hallway to sweat and breathe before emerging, still shaking, to try the scene 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"Mask it, Mike," Bach says. "Sit on it. Keep that core. Build on it. Go!" 
</P>
<P>
The scene is replayed and this time Bach is pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, you could have stuck that one in the can," he says, indicating a wrap. 
"That's serendipity, you guys. Could you feel it working?" 
</P>
<P>
"When I was cooking up and finding my core, I found myself not so conscious of 
my body," says Mike, who has a tendency to shuffle his feet and squint on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
"That's it. Don't be afraid to make a fool of yourself," Bach responds. "What's 
our whole theme in this room?" 
</P>
<P>
The class answers in unison. 
</P>
<P>
"Look stupid."

LIFE ON WHEELS: THAT'S LUXURY IN THE COUNTY DRIVER'S SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Candice Pratt, 15, has her future all mapped out. "On my 26th birthday, I'm 
going to get a red Ferrari Testarossa convertible," says Pratt, who lives in 
Laguna Niguel. And after that, she plans to become a U.S. senator and 
eventually president. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Mairena, 32, wasn't interested in the presidency when he was 15. He 
just wanted a Ferrari. And 3 years ago -- that's right, before he was 30 -- he 
wrote a check for roughly $72,000 and drove away in a black Ferrari Mondial 
400. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Orange County, the land where status car dreams come true. 
Statistics are hard to come by; the Department of Motor Vehicles doesn't keep 
track of how many such vehicles are registered here, either by make or by price 
tag. But when was the last time you looked around -- on the freeway, on Pacific 
Coast Highway, in just about any parking lot -- and didn't see a Mercedes-Benz, 
a Porsche or a Jaguar? 
</P>
<P>
Sales of dream cars are booming here, according to the people who sell them. 
Although Ferrari sales can't go higher because production is limited, the 
county does have the world's largest Ferrari dealership: Newport Imports, which 
also handles Jaguar, Aston Martin, Lotus and Range Rover. Jaguar sales have 
quadrupled since 1982, according to Newport Imports manager Don Moothart. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes-Benz dealer Jim Slemons says his sales went up 15% in 1988, and this 
year's sales so far are ahead of last year's. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nowhere in the United States where you see as many luxury cars as you 
will in Newport Beach," Moothart says. "Nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach may have a high concentration, but the rest of the county has its 
share of status cars too. The other day at a north county K mart, the 
blue-light special announcements were interrupted by a notice that "there's a 
royal-blue Jaguar in the parking lot with its lights on." 
</P>
<P>
"People do kind of stare at you when you drive into the lot at Fedco or the 
Price Club," Rolls-Royce owner Linda Weaver says. "It's like, 'What are you 
doing here?' " 
</P>
<P>
But of course people look, whether you pull up in front of a discount store or 
an exclusive restaurant. Isn't being seen the whole point of driving a status 
car? 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily, according to some owners. Although status is a factor, it 
isn't always the most important one. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't really draw conclusions about someone's motivations by simply noting 
that they possess this object," says psychiatrist Martin Brenner, medical 
director of CPC Santa Ana Hospital and the owner of a 1986 Jaguar Vanden Plas, 
which cost him "about $40,000." 
</P>
<P>
"I always dreamed of having a Jag," Brenner says. "I loved the old XKE, it's an 
awesomely beautiful car. And when I got my car, I just felt good with myself 
that I was driving a car that I liked and that I felt proud of." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, having a nice car is simply "conforming to the prevailing 
custom," Brenner says. "You fit better. It's like going into a very nice 
restaurant where everybody's dressed nice." 
</P>
<P>
Brenner concedes that although he bought the car primarily for himself and not 
to impress others, "I do enjoy the fact that I get positive feedback about my 
automobile." 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Engel, owner of a blue 1986 Ferrari Testarossa, says status is the 
primary reason he bought his car. "A lot of my friends have status cars too -- 
Ferraris, Lamborghinis, whatever -- and I would say that status is probably the 
controlling aspect of why we buy them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most powerful, fastest car made, ever. It looks great, and it 
makes me feel great. I like to be looked at. It's a conversation piece. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a snob about it. If a boatload of kids start honking, I'll roll down 
the window and talk to them about it. That's part of the fun." 
</P>
<P>
Engel, who lives in Newport Beach, had to wait 18 months to get his car 3 years 
ago. Now the wait is 2 1/2 years, according to Ed Woodburn of Newport Imports. 
"A couple of people have gotten tired of waiting and taken their names off the 
list," Woodburn says. "But not many." 
</P>
<P>
The Testarossa sells for $141,780, Woodburn says. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver says she wishes that her 1979 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith had dark-tinted 
windows because "I prefer not to get looked at." But she's well aware that not 
everyone feels that way. Weaver, co-owner with Mairena of Pegasus, a courier 
and limousine service, sometimes rents out her own car through the company to 
customers who definitely want to be seen in a Rolls. Unlike a stretch limo, she 
says, "it's easier for them to make people think it's their car." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver, who lives in Irvine, owned a Mercedes-Benz and had been shopping for a 
new one when she came across the used Rolls about 5 years ago. "A new (Rolls) 
was extremely out of all reason," she says. But she was able to get the older 
model for "in the neighborhood of $50,000," about $15,000 less than the she 
would have paid for the new Mercedes she had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted a Rolls," she says. "It makes you feel like what you worked 
for has turned out right. They do ride so nicely; that's really the pleasure of 
the car. It's like taking a scenic ride on your couch to Santa Barbara or 
whatever. It's so quiet, it's just not as stressful." 
</P>
<P>
Mairena, Weaver's partner, says that "as a child, the Ferrari was the ultimate 
car I wanted to have. I started thinking about it from the time I started 
thinking of what I was going to be when I grew up." 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of nice when people look," he says. "But it doesn't really matter. 
That's not the intent. It's not a red Ferrari; it's a black Ferrari. And you 
don't really know it's a Ferrari until you look at it, really look." 
</P>
<P>
Mairena's first vehicle was a 1956 Ford truck, followed by a Volkswagen beetle, 
a Fiat, a Porsche, then the Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ferrari was everything I expected it to be," he says, "even though it 
doesn't have all the whistles some American cars do, such as electronic seats 
that recline and turn." 
</P>
<P>
Mairena isn't sure how big his car's engine is or how fast it can go, but he 
has taken it up to 125 m.p.h. and "it didn't seem to be straining." 
</P>
<P>
The Ferrari doesn't do as well when it's stuck in traffic, however: "It's 
terrible because you have to keep shifting." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Babick of Newport Beach may be a more typical owner of a luxury car. He 
drives a 1986 Mercedes-Benz 300 and a 1983 Porsche 911se. "But I don't consider 
either of them a status car. In California, there are so many nice cars, even a 
Mercedes is commonplace." 
</P>
<P>
Although he admits to being "into cars," Babick says he picks his cars because 
they please him, not for the effect they may have on others. 
</P>
<P>
Luxury automobile dealer Slemons is also active on the county social circuit. 
He says a Mercedes-Benz is "definitely a status symbol." 
</P>
<P>
"There are more of them in Newport Beach than any other kind of car," says 
Slemons, who also sells Acuras, Hondas, Jeeps and Eagles (in addition to Volvos 
in Hawaii). 
</P>
<P>
A Mercedes-Benz is "almost like a uniform," he says. "It's a way of saying 
you've arrived." 
</P>
<P>
Slemons says the Mercedes fits the county's conservative image better than some 
more expensive, flashier cars: "It's conservative, classy, just like people in 
south Orange County are conservative in their attire, their politics and the 
things that they do." 
</P>
<P>
His own car of choice is a 1972 Mercedes-Benz 280sl, which he bought used from 
a dealer in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Another up-and-coming status car, Slemons says, is the Jeep Cherokee Limited. 
"It's sort of a status second car." 
</P>
<P>
If you want 12 cylinders but can't quite afford a Testarossa, there's the new 
BMW 750il with a sticker price of $73,000. It can theoretically go up to 185 
m.p.h., although "there's a governor on it that keeps it down to 155," says 
Harry Taylor of McLaren's BMW in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Engel says he has had his Testarossa up to 187, "but that was on a test track." 
</P>
<P>
Pratt, a freshman at Capistrano Valley Christian High School, says that in her 
age group, "the girl who has the Mercedes definitely gets more attention. But 
mostly, people don't judge you by what kind of car you have. It's really just 
whether you have a car or not. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids don't see their first car as the one of their dreams." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's for You! (Or Is It?) 
</P>
<P>
Do you have a phone in your car? If so, we'd like to know why you decided to go 
cellular. If not, tell us why you prefer to remain incommunicado on the road.

The Road to Romance 
</P>
<P>
Sure, you've heard of life in the fast lane, but how about love in the fast 
lane? How many of you indulge in a little freeway flirting now and then? And 
how many have actually dated that attractive stranger one lane over? We would 
like to hear.

JOSEPH N. BELL: GUN DEALER BACKS UP HIS BAN ON ASSAULT RIFLES WITH ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the issue of gun control, at least, I wish Randy Garell were President of 
the United States instead of George Bush. The National Rifle Assn. should wish 
the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Garell, you will recall, is the Costa Mesa gun store owner who got national 
attention by banning assault rifles from his stock after a crazed young man 
used such a weapon to mow down a schoolyard full of children. Garell's action 
caused such a furor that he called a news conference to explain his feelings, 
and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates came down to lend him support. So did 
Costa Mesa Police Chief David L. Snowden. 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Garell said that because he was "greatly disturbed" by 
the schoolyard killings, he decided to respond to the plea of police officials 
at every level by selling off his current stock of military weapons to law 
enforcement agencies and banning their future sale in his store. 
</P>
<P>
That was 3 weeks ago, and the spotlight has since shifted from Garell to more 
visible power centers. President Bush got into the act by refusing to support a 
federal ban on assault weapons (his wife has taken the opposite position). And 
legislators from Sacramento to Washington -- prodded by a surge of public anger 
-- are struggling with the wording of laws to restrict these weapons. 
</P>
<P>
So what has happened meanwhile to Randy Garell? Has he had any second thoughts 
about his actions? Did he indeed get rid of his assault weapons? Is he 
distressed at the intransigent position the NRA has taken on this issue? 
</P>
<P>
I asked him these questions the other day and found him to be an amiable, 
thoughtful man still willing to give of time from his work to try to explain 
his feelings on an issue on which he believes the sides have become 
increasingly -- and distressingly -- polarized. 
</P>
<P>
He did, indeed, clear out the military weapons in his Grant Boys store. "Within 
a week of making that decision," he said, "I got rid of the entire stock, 
either by selling them to law enforcement people or returning them to the 
vendor." 
</P>
<P>
He admits to having second thoughts, but for economic rather than philosophical 
reasons. "I suppose we have second thoughts about everything," he said. "I 
could have made a tremendous amount of money the last few weeks selling these 
weapons. You tell Americans they can't have something, and they want it. But 
the more I think about it, the more certain I am that I did the right thing for 
me and for my business. This was a personal decision. I make no judgments for 
anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
In the first week after his decision, Garell estimates that he received more 
than a thousand phone calls. "I'd say 99% were favorable, and half of those 
calls came from gun owners and NRA members like me who feel it is important for 
the gun industry to do something to police itself. We still support the NRA, 
but on this particular issue, they should be doing more. Life is compromise, 
and the NRA is going to have to move toward the middle ground that protects the 
rights of hunters and sportsmen and collectors and also protects the rights and 
safety of the public." 
</P>
<P>
Garell says he hasn't had any heat from the NRA and doesn't expect any 
"because, as a whole, the gun industry allows people to make their own choices 
and respects them for it." 
</P>
<P>
But he is also fearful that "a lot of the legislators writing these laws don't 
know anything about guns. They have to see the larger picture too." He would 
like to see a body of specialists created -- "people who really know and 
understand guns" -- who could evaluate new weapons that come into the state and 
decide if they should be made publicly available. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in the existing rules," he said, "and follow them very tightly in 
my store. We don't bend them for anybody. I strongly support a 15-day wait on 
the purchase of all weapons in the state of California -- and most of the 
people who have been in my store the last few weeks offering support feel the 
same way." 
</P>
<P>
He concluded rather wistfully: "I went into this business believing that I 
should never risk making a customer mad. I broke that rule a few weeks ago by 
taking a larger view. But if we can't all do that, we're going to be in trouble 
-- not just in gun control but in housing and law enforcement and criminal 
justice and other areas where new thinking is also badly needed." 
</P>
<P>
In the familiar cacophony of NRA cliches, Garell sounds like a voice in the 
wilderness. But instead of listening, the NRA continues its broken record of 
"Gun control is one step toward turning America into a totalitarian state" and 
"What you'll be doing is disarming the average man and woman, making them more 
vulnerable to the bad guys, who will have no problem obtaining these weapons" 
-- both arguments made repeatedly by NRA representatives in the current flap. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of baloney has been keeping gun laws off the books for years. But 
every once in a while in this country, a public issue comes up for grabs in 
which the answer is so clear, so obvious, that debating it approaches the 
theater of the absurd. Such an issue is the banning of assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
If the NRA had any sense -- and I've seen little evidence of that -- it would 
listen to the moderates in its midst who could help hammer out the kind of 
compromise suggested by Randy Garell. The alternative -- at long last -- may be 
punitive laws urged by people who are finally fed up with the excesses of the 
gun lobby.

BONNER, 3 OTHERS PICKED FOR SEATS ON U.S. COURTS 
</P>

President Bush on Wednesday nominated the chief federal prosecutor in Los 
Angeles, Robert C. Bonner, to a federal district court seat and, in a move 
likely to spark a political battle, picked a San Francisco lawyer strongly 
opposed by gay rights activists for a federal judgeship in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Bonner and San Francisco attorney Vaughn R. Walker, Bush is 
resubmitting Reagan Administration nominations that expired last fall in 
election-year logjams. He also renewed the nominations of Pamela Ann Rymer and 
Ferdinand F. Fernandez, both federal judges in Los Angeles, for the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez would be the first Latino member of the 9th Circuit, the nation's 
largest federal appeals court, with jurisdiction over cases from California and 
nine other Western states ranging from Hawaii to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nominations, only Walker's is expected to be controversial, but the 
fight over it could be prolonged and become tied up in state politics. 
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, who is expected to run for governor, has supported 
Walker. Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston has told Walker's opponents in the past 
that he would try to block the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Wilson aides predicted that the Walker nomination would be approved 
by the Senate. "There was a great deal of partisanship last year" because of 
the presidential election, and "people were looking for reasons to oppose 
nominations," said Wilson spokesman Bill Livingston. But gay rights activists 
vowed to continue the fight against Senate confirmation that they launched last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be an easy road for him," predicted Leonard Graff, legal 
director of the National Gay Rights Advocates in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be some very vocal opposition to Walker's nomination," he said, 
adding that Cranston "will be pressed not to sign off" on the choice. Under the 
Senate's non-binding traditions, district court nominations are seldom approved 
unless both senators from the state in which the judge would sit consent to the 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, who was en route to Japan, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy surrounding Walker involves actions that the 44-year-old 
attorney took several years ago during a legal battle between the U.S. Olympic 
Committee, a client of Walker's, and the San Francisco-based Gay Olympics. The 
Olympic Committee won a suit to prevent the gay organization from using the 
Olympic name. The committee then won a court order directing the gay group to 
pay some of the committee's attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, acting as the committee's lawyer, also filed a lien against the house 
of Tom Waddell, a founder of the gay games who was dying of AIDS at the time. 
Walker's opponents charge that he callously refused appeals to release the lien 
on the dying man's house. His supporters say the decision was up to the 
committee, not him, and that he was simply vigorously representing his client's 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast with Walker, the other three nominations have generated minimal 
controversy in the past and are expected to gain routine Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Rymer, 48, has been a federal district judge in Los Angeles since 1983. Reagan 
nominated her last year to the appeals court seat vacated when Anthony M. 
Kennedy was appointed to the Supreme Court. Her nomination was held up when the 
Senate's Democratic majority decided to hold off filling most appeals court 
vacancies until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
A highly regarded and generally conservative judge, she was briefly considered 
for the high court appointment that Kennedy eventually received. 
</P>
<P>
Bonner, 47, as U.S. attorney has been the chief federal prosecutor in Los 
Angeles since 1984. He would take Rymer's seat on the district court. 
Fernandez, 51, was a state judge in San Bernardino County for six years before 
being placed on the federal bench by former President Ronald Reagan in 1985.

The Times reported incorrectly in Thursday editions that U.S. District Judge 
Ferdinand F. Fernandez, who was nominated to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals by President Bush, would be the first Latino on the appeals court. 
Judge Arthur L. Alarcon, who was named to the 9th Circuit in 1979, is the 
first.

Traffic on the Simi Valley Freeway was snarled today during the morning commute 
when a man jumped off a pedestrian bridge into an eastbound traffic lane and 
was killed, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the death was being investigated as a suicide. The man, whose 
identity was not released, climbed over a safety fence on the pedestrian bridge 
that crosses the freeway east of Reseda Boulevard in Northridge and jumped 
about 9 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man hit the cab of a tractor-trailer rig and was killed instantly, police 
said. The death caused traffic in the eastbound lanes to slow and back up about 
a half mile while the investigation took place.

ORANGE POLICE INITIATE DRUG RAID AT PERRIS HOUSE RESULTING IN 3 ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange police confiscated 40 pounds of a volatile substance used to make 
crystal methamphetamine and at least 40 weapons -- both semi- and fully 
automatic and some with silencers -- from a home in Perris, authorities said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Police Sgt. Timm Browne said authorities served a search warrant on the 
house in the 26000 block of Hammock Avenue on Wednesday and discovered 40 
pounds of "methamphetamine oil," which can produces a crystal form when mixed 
with salt, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a poor man's cocaine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Browne said the group allegedly sold drugs in Orange. Riverside County 
sheriff's deputies assisted in the arrests and search. 
</P>
<P>
Browne said three residents of the house were arrested in the raid on suspicion 
of manufacturing and possession of the drug for sale. Gerald Rundell, 35, John 
Curry, 36, and Janet Nelson, 32, all of Perris, were booked into Riverside 
County Jail, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Browne said the three were in the last stage of manufacturing the crystal 
methamphetamine when the raid took place. He said the chemical process would 
produce 320 pounds of the substance with an estimated street value of $3.2 
million.

Hungarian workers, attacking the government for squandering their labor, today

on Solidarity in Poland.

"We think workers' interests are best defended by workers themselves," former 
machine tool worker Bottyan Kiss told a news conference called to announce the 
plan to launch the Workers' Solidarity on Saturday. About half a dozen 
independent trade unions have been founded in Hungary since May but all were 
related to white-collar professions.

Thirteen months after the death of South County education activist Jan Overton, 
authorities have determined that cyanide poisoning was the cause. Overton, 46, 
collapsed and died at her home Jan. 24, 1988, as she prepared to leave for a 
family outing. Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman Bob Rivas confirmed 
today that cyanide poisoning caused Overton's death, but declined to discuss 
the investigation. Rivas also declined to say how the cyanide got into 
Overton's body. Overton was a past president of the Orange County School Boards 
Assn. and a member of the state School Boards Assn. Delegate Assembly. She was 
vice president of the Capistrano Unified School Board at the time of her death.

BUSH ENGAGES IN 'SUMMITS' ON MIDEAST;

'NO NEW INITIATIVES' AS HE MEETS ISRAELIS, ARABS, OTHER LEADERS

<P>
President Bush, on the first day of his Far East visit, plunged into a series 
of mini-summits with Israeli and Arab leaders, as the United States suggested 
that new Soviet initiatives in the Middle East are merely "rhetorical 
exercises." 
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of an imperial Japanese funeral, Bush conferred with 
Jordan's King Hussein, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli President 
Chaim Herzog. Bush pledged that the United States will take an active role in 
the search for peace in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting on the talks, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said there are 
"perhaps some opportunities out there with respect to the Middle East peace 
process that haven't existed before." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Baker noted that the United States has opened talks with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, which Washington had shunned for years as a 
terrorist group. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Bush did not offer any new U.S. initiatives in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Attend Funeral 
</P>
<P>
On his first overseas journey as President, Bush will attend the funeral Friday 
of Japanese Emperor Hirohito, who died of cancer Jan. 7 at the age of 87. 
</P>
<P>
Bush today held private talks with a handful of other world leaders, including 
French President Francois Mitterrand, Portuguese Prime Minister Mario Soares, 
Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and Prime Minister Chatichai 
Choonhavan of Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
It was Bush's talks with Hussein, Mubarak and Herzog that provided a 
counterpoint to the 10-day trip through the Middle East by Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who is trying to advance Moscow's role in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said "it's healthy, quite frankly, that the Soviet Union would be 
interested in contributing to the cause of peace in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rhetorical Exercises' 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I suppose we would want to know that there were concrete 
contributions that they have in mind, rather than simply rhetorical exercises." 
</P>
<P>
Challenging Moscow to "contribute in a concrete way," Baker said the Soviet 
Union should establish full diplomatic relations with Israel and "cease its 
support of radical countries in the Middle East region such as Libya." 
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow also could exercise influence with Syria.

A plane carrying 11 people, including a government minister, crashed into a 
lake today near the Swiss border, and all aboard were presumed dead, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, a nine-seat Aerocommander AC-90 from Austria's Rheinthalflug 
airline, was preparing to land at Altenrhein just over the border when it went 
down, said airline spokeswoman Renatte Moser. "We have to fear that there are 
dead," she told the Associated Press. Moser said the nine passengers included 
Austria's social affairs minister, Alfred Dallinger, 62. There were two crew 
members on board. A previously unknown group calling itself the Austrian 
People's Army claimed responsibility for the crash in a telephone call to the 
West German news agency DPA. The Austria Press Agency said police were 
investigating the call. The caller did not say why the group would want to 
bring down the plane.

A federal judge has overturned a condemned murderer's death sentence because 
the jury that convicted him 10 years ago asked for a Bible during 
deliberations, court officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
In overturning the sentence of Brandon Jones, 31, who was convicted of killing 
a policeman during a service-station robbery, U.S. District Judge Charles Moye 
ruled that the Cobb County jury "had a duty to apply the law of the state of 
Georgia . . . not its own interpretation of the law or its own interpretation 
of precepts of the Bible." The state attorney general's office is now 
considering settling for a life sentence for Jones.

Car and light truck sales by the nation's Big Three auto makers dropped 0.4% in 
mid-February compared with a year earlier, the companies said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three said gains in truck sales were offset by losses in automobile 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. reported they sold cars 
and trucks at an average daily rate of 34,580 during the Feb. 11-20 period, 
compared with a rate of 34,718 during the same 1988 period. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler showed a big dip, falling 18.5% during the period this year. GM's car 
sales fell 1.2%, dropping to a daily rate of 11,714 from 11,852 during the same 
period last year. Ford said its car sales rose 1.6% in mid-February, going to a 
daily rate of 6,833 compared with 6,727.

PEPSI RAISES INDIA PROTEST ON COKE

Pepsico Inc., granted approval last year to set up a plant in India, is 
opposing a proposal by archrival Coca-Cola Co. to re-enter the Indian market, a 
government minister told Parliament today. 
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Food Processing Jagdish Tytler told the lower house, or 
Lok Sabha, that Pepsico has raised serious objections since reports surfaced in 
newspapers that the government would approve a plan by Coca-Cola to build a 
$2.3-million facility outside New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
Coca Cola had operated in India from 1950 until 1977, when it was forced to 
close its operations after the government insisted it abide by a law limiting 
foreign ownership in Indian subsidiaries. At that time the government also 
ordered Atlanta-based Coca-Cola to reveal the secret formula for its popular 
soda.

JAN. ORDERS FOR DURABLE GOODS SLUMP 3%

<P>
Orders to factories for "big ticket" durable goods declined 3% in January, the 
first decrease in four months and the biggest drop since last July, the 
government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, items expected to last 
three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted $128.06 billion in January, 
down from $132.06 billion in December. 
</P>
<P>
Orders in virtually all major industry categories were down, particularly in 
the volatile transportation and defense categories. 
</P>
<P>
Much of last month's decline was due to a 7.2% fallback in transportation 
orders, which had surged 22.1% in December due to high demand for aircraft and 
autos. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding transportation, orders in all other categories were down 1.2% last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, orders had been up a robust 7.3% in December, the biggest increase 
since last June. Orders for all of 1988 had been up 10.9% from 1987, the best 
showing since 1984, as manufacturers enjoyed an export-fueled rebound thanks to 
the decline of the dollar against foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
January's 3% decrease was the biggest decline since a 7.4% drop last July and 
the first drop since a 2.8% decrease in September. 
</P>
<P>
Orders in the erratic defense category, subject to wide swings depending on 
when government contracts are signed, plunged 33.5% in January after a 24.2% 
increase in December. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding defense, all other orders were down 0.4% after rising 6.1% in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good sign 
of business intentions to modernize and expand, were up 1.5% to $39.96 billion 
last month. The category had increased 9.9% in December.

CAESARS WORLD'S EARNINGS DROP

<P>
Caesars World Inc. reported today its earnings fell to $10.38 million, or 42 
cents a share, for the second quarter ended Jan. 31 from $15.74 million, or 65 
cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Second-quarter revenues dropped to $213.85 million from $198 million in the 
same quarter the year before. The decreased earnings in the most recent quarter 
were attributed to lower contributions from Nevada operations and higher 
expenses. Caesars New Jersey Inc., an 86.6%-owned subsidiary of Caesars World, 
reported a rise in second-quarter earnings to $5.73 million, or 35 cents a 
share, from $4.15 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier.

2 REPORTED PREGNANT BY GARVEY

Two women became pregnant while involved with Steve Garvey, the former All-Star 
first baseman of the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres who recently 
married a third woman, a TV station reported. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego woman, who declined to be interviewed on camera, said she recently 
gave birth to Garvey's child, according to a Wednesday report by San Diego TV 
station KNSD, an NBC affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
The other woman alleging that Garvey made her pregnant is Rebecca Mendenhall, a 
producer for Atlanta-based Cable Television Network. She was engaged to Garvey 
during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
A call to Garvey's office, seeking comment, was not immediately returned today. 
</P>
<P>
In a videotaped interview broadcast by KNSD, Garvey did not deny the 
allegations and promised to assume responsibility for any offspring proven to 
be his. He said his new wife, interior decorator Candace Thomas, 30, of Palos 
Verdes, knows all about the two situations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll live up to my moral obligations, which I feel strongly about because I'm 
a Christian," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey said his new wife supports his decision to take responsibility for any 
children he fathered while single. 
</P>
<P>
The couple was married Saturday in a private ceremony in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the true test when you love somebody, and I've told my wife about all 
the situations in my life -- this and others -- and she said that if that's the 
case and one woman or both don't want the child, I'll take it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the philosophy she has. On the other hand, she said, 'It's a good thing 
I married you to get you off the street.' " 
</P>
<P>
When asked about birth control, Garvey, a Roman Catholic said: "I'd like to 
think that with any relationship, one of the two people assume responsibility 
for birth control and . . . one will say, 'I'll be responsible.' 
</P>
<P>
"In both cases, I was led to believe that I wasn't responsible for birth 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Garvey said he doesn't think any pregnancies he caused while a bachelor will 
hamper future political aspirations, saying people will respect his decision to 
support any children he fathered.

The thaw in superpower relations spread to the ice rink today as hockey 
officials and diplomats announced that the Washington Capitals and Calgary 
Flames will play Soviet teams in Leningrad and Moscow next September. The games 
will be the first in which National Hockey League teams have competed in the 
Soviet Union. "I think it would be a wonderful occasion if we had as much 
unanimity inside the United Nations as we have here today about hockey; I'm 
sure the world would be a better place," said the second-ranking U.S. diplomat 
to the United Nations, Ambassador Herbert S. Okun. He gave a Capitals team 
jersey to the third-ranking Soviet U.N. diplomat, Victor A. Zvezdin, who 
reciprocated by giving Okun a jersey with the U.S. ambassador's name emblazoned 
on the back. NHL president John Ziegler said the trip will cost the two teams a 
little more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet club teams have played in North America six times since 1975, the most 
recent appearance being this season's 14-game series featuring two top Soviet 
teams: Central Army and Dynamo Riga.
