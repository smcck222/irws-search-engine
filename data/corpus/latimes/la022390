BRUINS FEEL THE HEAT IN 105-99 LOSS TO DUCKS

Onward and downward, UCLA's fall continues. 
</P>
<P>
Taking to the road Thursday night, the Bruins ran into a red-hot Oregon team 
that shot 58.1% in the first half, 72.4% in the second and blitzed the Bruins, 
105-99, in front of 9,134 at McArthur Court. 
</P>
<P>
That's four losses in a row and five in their last six Pacific 10 Conference 
games for the Bruins, who are 16-8 overall and apparently beginning to believe 
that they're in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to have to come back in the Pac-10 tournament," said forward 
Don MacLean, who scored 31 points and took 16 rebounds. "(Winning) that may be 
the only way we can get into the (NCAA) tournament." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins hadn't lost four consecutive conference games since the 1958-59 
season and haven't lost five in a row since the 1947-48 season. 
</P>
<P>
They can equal that latter streak Saturday at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
What will it take to bring them out of their funk? 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing a couple of wins wouldn't cure," Coach Jim Harrick said. "We ran 
and opened up a little bit and were much, much more fluid than we have been." 
</P>
<P>
It was all for naught. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon, which is 14-10 overall and 9-6 in the Pac-10, pulled into a 
fourth-place tie with UCLA in the conference race by shooting down the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"They were unbelievable," Harrick said of the Ducks, who made 65% of their 
shots overall and overcame a six-point second-half deficit to lead by as many 
as 15 points before the last few minutes turned into a parade to the free-throw 
line. "I can't fault our effort at all. We played hard, but just ran into a 
team that couldn't miss. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not fluid offensively like we need to be and like we were earlier in the 
season, but they just shot it. My land. We were in their face a lot of times, 
but they just shot the ball awfully well." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Terrell Brandon scored a season-high 31 points for Oregon, making 11 of 
16 shots, and guard Kevin Mixon scored a career-high 25 points, making eight of 
12 shots, including four of seven three-pointers, and providing what was 
believed to be the first four-point play in Duck history. 
</P>
<P>
Mixon was fouled by Mitchell Butler as he made a three-point shot from the top 
of the key with 14:15 left, then added a free throw. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Keith Reynolds scored 24 points, making 11 of 17 shots, and matched a 
career high with 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks hadn't scored so many points since the 1974-75 season, when they beat 
Villanova, 116-77, and hadn't scored 100 points in a game since the 1981-82 
season, when they beat UC Riverside, 100-89. 
</P>
<P>
"When they shoot the ball like that, it gets the crowd going and it would be 
tough for anybody to beat them," MacLean said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, which made 52% of its shots, has been outshot in each of its last four 
games after being outshot only three times in its first 20. 
</P>
<P>
But, said MacLean: "It wasn't our performance taking us out of it, like against 
Cal and Stanford (last week). It was the other team just playing a lot better 
than we did. Not that we played badly." 
</P>
<P>
Darrick Martin matched a season high by scoring 18 points for UCLA, Tracy 
Murray scored 15 and Trevor Wilson scored 12. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick called Oregon the Pac-10's most improved team. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, in a 79-62 loss to UCLA in Pauley Pavilion, the Ducks made only 
35.7% of their shots. Only Cal State Fullerton, which made 31.4% in an 87-75 
loss at Pauley, has shot worse against UCLA this season. 
</P>
<P>
But the Ducks, who won at Washington State and Washington last week for their 
first sweep of a conference trip since 1984, came out this time and made 10 of 
their first 13 shots, all but one of them by Brandon and Reynolds, to open a 
22-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA answered with a 7-0 run and neither team led by more than three points the 
rest of the half, which ended with the Bruins leading, 46-43. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean, who made only eight of 23 shots last week in the losses to Cal and 
Stanford, made six of 11 in the first half, including four on transition 
layups, and led the Bruins with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
And freshman Zan Mason, who hadn't played in three weeks, provided a spark off 
the bench, contributing four points, a rebound and an assist in six minutes. 
Last month, he had eight rebounds against the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds scored 14 first-half points; Brandon had 13. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA will be invited to play Michigan State next season at Auburn Hills, Mich., 
in a game to benefit the homeless, said the game's promoter, Sonny Vaccaro. A 
scheduling conflict, however, might prevent the Bruins from playing in the 
game, Coach Jim Harrick said. A similar game last month, matching Louisiana 
State and Notre Dame, raised $125,000 for Comic Relief, Vaccaro said. . . . 
Trevor Wilson took six rebounds to move past Willie Naulls and into fourth 
place on the Bruins' all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Newell, former California coach and a consultant to the Cleveland 
Cavaliers, upon hearing that several thousand fans walked out Sunday during 
UCLA's 70-69 loss to Stanford: "When you've been eating caviar and the top part 
of the steak, you don't want to go to ground hamburger. It's pretty hard to 
live with that. Their expectations are unrealistic. Nobody has a birthright to 
win." . . . UCLA had won seven in a row against Oregon. . . . UCLA is 5-6 on 
the road and has lost five of its last seven road games.

AZTECS DWINDLE DOWN TO A PRECIOUS FEW, LOSE

<P>
San Diego State's offense was crisp, and the score was close. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with about eight minutes left in the first half of a Western Athletic 
Conference basketball game before 11,104 in the University of Texas El Paso's 
Special Events Center Thursday, SDSU guard Arthur Massey marched up to Coach 
Jim Brandenburg and mumbled a couple of awful words. 
</P>
<P>
Stomach cramps. 
</P>
<P>
This was not good. With center Marty Dow already lost for the season, the 
Aztecs came in with just nine available players. 
</P>
<P>
By early in the second half, they had eight . . . until center Neal Steinly 
drew his fifth foul with 13:02 to play. Then there were seven. 
</P>
<P>
Going, going . . . gone. 
</P>
<P>
UTEP, 70-55. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (13-14, 4-9) played one of their better first halves in recent 
weeks, but in the end, it came down to a numbers game. Even with nine players, 
the Aztecs are usually outmatched. Steinly is 6-feet-11, Shawn Jamison 6-8. 
Other than that, no SDSU player is taller than 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
And that presents problems for Jamison. All night long, he battled UTEP's 
Antonio Davis (6-10), Greg Foster (7-0), Marlon Maxey (6-8), Francis Ezenwa 
(6-8) and David Van Dyke (6-8). 
</P>
<P>
When one would get tired, UTEP Coach Norm Ellenberger -- subbing for Don 
Haskins, who is out for the season with acute laryngitis -- just sent someone 
else to the scorer's table. Foul trouble? No big deal. Plenty of big guys to go 
around. Van Dyke, Foster and Maxey all finished with four fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison led SDSU with 22 points, but just five were in the second half. By 
game's end, he was visibly frustrated. He and assistant coach Jimmy Williams 
had words during a timeout with 3:02 to play and SDSU trailing, 64-49. Williams 
and Brandenburg said it was nothing more than heat-of-the-moment frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"He was frustrated because we play well enough to win and don't," Brandenburg 
said. "We're right there, but we can't get over the hump." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, numbers certainly did in the Aztecs -- but not just the number of 
dwindling players. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU made just 40% (21 of 52) of its shots from the field and 41% (10 of 24) of 
its free throws. The Aztecs also turned the ball over 16 times to UTEP's 11. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fatigued in the second half, and then we turned the damn ball over," 
Brandenburg said. "Turnovers and poor decisions are co-pilots with fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
Massey tried to play in the second half but ended up watching most of it. He 
finished with just 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably something I ate," Massey said. "I don't know. It made me so weak, I 
couldn't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs trailed at halftime, 34-30, despite dictating the tempo and getting 
17 points from Jamison. 
</P>
<P>
They kept UTEP guessing by making several defensive switches from zone to 
man-to-man. 
</P>
<P>
And Michael Best, who has been nearly invisible lately, entered the game with 
five minutes gone and made several nice feeds to Jamison. Best had seven 
assists and five points at halftime. But he had no assists in the second half 
and finished with seven points and nine turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Had they done better than four of 11 from the line in the first half, the 
Aztecs might have led. They had out-rebounded the much-taller Miners, 23-19, 
and their combination of defenses held UTEP to 36% (10 of 28) from the field. 
UTEP's biggest advantage was making 13 of 17 free throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
By game's end, Jamison was SDSU's biggest offender from the line: four of 11. 
He is just a 52% free throw shooter, and UTEP fouled him 11 times Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
In three Western Athletic Conference games since Dow has been out, SDSU has 
shot just 43% (67 for 155). Dow was averaging 12 points a game and, now that he 
is gone, the burden of SDSU's inside game falls directly on Jamison. By the 
second half, UTEP's big men had worn him down. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very physical player," said Davis, who led UTEP with 13 points. "He's 
strong inside, he has a nice touch and a nice hook shot. There's nothing you 
can do but front him. He can be a franchise player." 
</P>
<P>
But a franchise player needs a supporting cast. And for now, Jamison is lacking 
in that area. 
</P>
<P>
UTEP (17-8, 9-4), which has won eight of its past nine games, is just a 
half-game behind first-place Brigham Young in the WAC race. SDSU, meanwhile, 
will be back at UTEP in two weeks for the WAC Tournament. The way things shape 
up now, the Aztecs -- alone in eighth place -- will play ninth-place Air Force 
in the tournament's first game.

PAYTON DAZZLING WITH 58 AS USC FALLS IN OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Payton, Oregon State's All-American point guard, is ending his 
extraordinary career with a flourish. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in his second-to-last home game, Payton scored 58 points as the No. 17 
Beavers defeated USC, 98-94, in overtime Thursday night at Gill Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second-highest single-game scoring performance in Pacific 10 
Conference history. Lew Alcindor of UCLA scored 61 points in a game against 
Washington State in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the greatest one-man performances I've ever seen in this league 
in 15 years, be it (Bill) Walton or (Kareem) Abdul-Jabbar," USC Coach George 
Raveling said of Payton's performance. "I know this, 30 years from now when my 
grandson asks me about the greatest players ever, I'm going to be able to tell 
him, 'You know son, on a rainy night in Corvallis I saw a little ol' kid score 
58.' And he'll say, 'How big was he?' And I'll say, 'About knee-high to a 
grasshopper.' And he'll say, 'He got 58?' And I'll say, 'Yeah, it was only 
because the horn blew.' " 
</P>
<P>
After scoring 18 points in the first half, Payton scored 34 in the second half 
and added six points in the five-minute overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was struggling and they decided to give me the ball more often," 
Payton said. 
</P>
<P>
Payton made 22 of 38 shots from the floor, including 15 of 20 in the second 
half. He hit 13 of 16 free throws and had six rebounds, four steals and a 
season-low two assists. 
</P>
<P>
Was this Payton's best game? 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," Payton said. "I think I should have had a better all-around 
game." 
</P>
<P>
USC guard Robert Pack, who tried to check Payton for much of the game, said it 
was frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I did a pretty good job against him, but every time I did something 
well he came back with something great," Pack said. "It's easy to get 
frustrated when you're guarding him." 
</P>
<P>
But despite Payton's performance, the Trojans had a chance to beat the Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 94-90, USC cut it to two points with 44 seconds left after guard 
Harold Miner sank two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
But Miner made a freshman mistake on the ensuing possession, intentionally 
fouling Oregon State guard Charles McKinney with 35 seconds left. McKinney made 
both free throws to give the Beavers a four-point lead and Oregon State 
retained possession. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious that it was an intentional foul," Miner said. "I should have 
made it look a little better, like I was trying to make a steal. I take the 
blame for that. It was all my fault." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney sank two more foul shots after he was fouled by Phil Glenn with 23 
seconds left to seal the win. Miner hit a follow shot at the buzzer for the 
final margin. 
</P>
<P>
Miner led the Trojans with 27 points. Forward Ronnie Coleman added 24 and Pack 
had 22. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 86-83 with 11 seconds left in regulation, it appeared that the Trojans 
had lost the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Glenn made a three-point shot with three seconds left to send the game into 
overtime. Glenn was an unlikely hero. He had missed 13 consecutive shots since 
he scored a basket in a game against Northern Arizona two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans played their strangest half of basketball of the season, building a 
22-point lead 10 minutes into the game. They nearly blew it all before taking a 
47-35 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 9-6, USC outscored the Beavers, 25-6, to build a 34-12 lead with 9:41 
remaining. USC, which made 15 of its first 19 shots, did little wrong in 
building its lead. But Oregon State blitzed USC, 19-1, to close to within four 
points at 35-31 with 4:12 remaining. The Trojans went 6:11 without scoring as 
the Beavers got back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gary Payton's 58 points was the most ever scored against USC. Center Lew 
Alcindor of UCLA scored 56 in a 1966 game against the Trojans. It was also an 
Oregon State record, surpassing a 48-point performance by Mel Counts against 
Louisiana State in 1963 and Payton in December against Loyola Marymount. Payton 
also broke the OSU career record of 2,022 points set by center Steve Johnson. 
Payton has 2,080 points with three regular-season games left. USC, which 
dropped its third consecutive game, fell to 9-14 overall, 4-11 in the Pac-10, 
Oregon State is 20-4 and 13-2. . . . After shooting just .361 in the first 
half, Oregon State shot .568 in the second half. Said OSU Coach Jim Anderson: 
"It seems that when we start off shooting poorly our whole game falls apart and 
we tuck our heads in like a turtle." . . . USC guard Harold Miner needs eight 
points to break Tom Lewis' USC freshman scoring record of 475 points.

Defenseman Rich Pilon of the New York Islanders was struck in the right eye by 
a shot from Detroit Red Wing Brent Fedyk on Nov. 4. The injury caused a scar to 
form over Pilon's retina and he is unable to focus on objects. 
</P>
<P>
NHL rules require that players have at least 20-70 vision in each eye and 
Pilon, from a medical perspective, has no vision in his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pilon, 21: "Sometimes I think to myself that I can get in awesome shape 
and be like Paul Coffey, be a star, and they'll have to let me play," he told 
the New York Post. "They're just stupid thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I get mad, I pump iron. You can't drown in your sorrows. When you do 
that, life's done and there are too many things in life, no matter how negative 
this is." 
</P>
<P>
Add NHL: Mike Smith, general manager of the Winnipeg Jets, on preseason tours 
of the Soviet Union by NHL teams: "I don't think, if you're trying to rebuild a 
hockey club, you should be doing it on the plains of the Ukraine." 
</P>
<P>
Last add NHL: Pat Burns, coach of the Adams Division's Montreal Canadiens, on 
the weakness of the Patrick Division: "Whoever comes out of our division has a 
ticket to the Stanley Cup finals." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Feb. 23, 1906, who won a 20-round decision over Marvin Hart in 
Los Angeles for the heavyweight boxing title? 
</P>
<P>
The real deal: Wally Backman, signed as a free agent by the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
says he won't miss playing for the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
"After I was in the American League for a month, I knew that I only wanted to 
play in the National League," Backman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't because of the caliber of ball. It was just the way the game is 
played (in the American League). It's just sitting around, waiting for the big 
home run." 
</P>
<P>
Add real deal: Heavyweight champion Buster Douglas, visiting Las Vegas, said he 
favored that city as a fight site over Atlantic City, N.J. "I feel very 
comfortable here. Vegas is real; Atlantic City is just a carbon copy." 
</P>
<P>
Quiet . . . too quiet: Abe Lemons, Oklahoma City basketball coach, on the best 
way to distract a free-throw shooter: "What gets you is total quiet. Kids love 
to play with noise and a full house. That's the reason we didn't play well at 
Rice. There was never anyone there. 
</P>
<P>
"Try total quiet a few times. After having the noise reverberating in your ears 
all game, all of a sudden, it's quiet. That's tough." 
</P>

Trivia answer: Tommy Burns.

LA SALLE'S SIMMONS TOPS 3,000-POINT MARK

Moments after being presented with his very own day, Lionel Simmons went out 
and made it his night. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, La Salle's high-scoring forward, was presented with a proclamation 
from the governor of Pennsylvania before Thursday night's game against 
Manhattan, declaring Feb. 27 as Lionel Simmons Day in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The senior forward then went out and scored 27 points to pass the 3,000 mark 
and move into fourth place on the all-time NCAA list as No. 14 Explorers 
cruised to a 100-60 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference victory at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been so nervous in my life," said Simmons, who endured a two-day 
publicity buildup while needing only three points to hit 3,000. "My legs were 
shaking at the start of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, who has a career total of 3,024 points, passed Hersey Hawkins' 3,008 
for fourth place on the list with his last basket of the first half, a 
three-point shot with 1:51 left that gave the Explorers a 44-28 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Maravich of Louisiana State leads the list at 3,667, followed by Freeman 
Williams of Portland State (3,249) and Harry Kelly of Texas Southern (3,066). 
</P>
<P>
Simmons became the fifth Division I player to score 3,000 points, reaching the 
milestone on a free throw with 12:44 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids years from now we'll be able to say we played with one of the 
greatest players in the history of the game," La Salle Coach Speedy Morris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Overton scored a career-high 30 points to lead the Explorers (24-1, 14-0), 
who extended their winning streak to 16 games. Keith Bullock and Peter Runge 
had 16 apiece for Manhattan (10-16, 6-9). 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 73, No. 8 Georgia Tech 71 -- Bryant Stith's short jump shot in the 
lane at the buzzer gave the Cavaliers the upset win in an Atlantic Coast 
Conference game at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Stith, who scored a team-high 19 points, hit his game-winning shot off an 
in-bounds pass from John Crotty and ended the Yellow Jackets' seven-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Cavaliers' (16-8, 5-6) second win over the Yellow Jackets (19-5,

UCLA WOMEN AIM FOR HIGH PAC-10 FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The seventh-ranked UCLA women's team is on a roll going into the Pacific 10 
Conference swimming meet today through Sunday at the East Los Angeles College 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins defeated USC two weeks ago, 86-54, and Coach Cyndi Gallagher is 
hoping for a top-three finish this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to equal last year's performance," she said. "We have four girls 
qualified (for the NCAA meet in March) and hope to get a lot more. We were 
third last year and will challenge (Arizona State) for that again." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, ranked No. 1 in the nation, and Cal, No. 4, will probably contend for 
the team championship. UCLA, Arizona State, and USC will battle for the next 
spots. Oregon dropped its swimming program in 1986 so only nine teams will 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, 7-2 overall and 3-2 in the conference, finished in a sixth-place tie with 
Michigan at last year's NCAA meet. The Bruins have five All-Americans and 
several other swimmers who can score in championship meets. 
</P>
<P>
For the Trojans, the performance against the Bruins was encouraging, despite 
the defeat. Going into the meet, USC Coach Darrell Fick knew that winning would 
be difficult because USC was giving away so many points in diving. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has a much stronger diving program than USC, and because two diving events 
are included in dual meets, and scored like the swimming events, the Trojans 
were starting with a 14-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The 12th-ranked Trojans (9-6 and 0-5) have three All-Americans and several 
freshmen who have potential to score at the conference and NCAA meets. They 
finished fourth in the Pac-10 meet last year and 25th in the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Fick is optimistic that USC will finish in the top five this weekend but will 
not be disappointed with a lower placing. Several of USC's top swimmers have 
qualified for the NCAA meet and they will not be shaving for the conference 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be aiming for third or fourth," Fick said. "Cal and Stanford are just 
too deep, but we'll be in with UCLA and Arizona State." 
</P>
<P>
Fick thinks the Trojans will improve on last year's NCAA performance, and 
expects his swimmers to finish in the top 10. The team was dealt a setback, 
however, when Australian distance swimmer Janelle Elford changed her mind about 
attending USC after competing in last month's Commonwealth Games. 
</P>
<P>
Elford, the last person to have beaten Stanford's Janet Evans in a distance 
freestyle event at a major meet, won a gold, a silver and a bronze at the 
Commonwealth games, and Fick was counting on her to help the Trojans in both 
meets. 
</P>
<P>
USC's men's team defeated UCLA on Saturday, 69-44, and finished the regular 
season unbeaten in 11 meets. The Trojans are ranked second in the nation going 
into the Pac-10 meet March 5-7 at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. UCLA, which is 
tied with Michigan for fourth, finished its regular season at 9-4 and 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
It was USC's fifth consecutive victory over UCLA. USC had two scorers out of a 
possible three in seven of the 11 individual events, including the 1,000- and 
200-yard freestyles, in which it placed first through fourth. 
</P>
<P>
After UCLA had swept Cal and Stanford two weeks ago, the Bruin-Trojan meet 
looked to be one of the top duals of the year. But the week after the sweep, 
UCLA had disciplinary problems and five swimmers were suspended for meets 
against Arizona State and Arizona. In addition, freshman backstroke ace Geoff 
Cronin missed those meets and the USC meet as well because of poor attendance 
at practice. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Biondi and Tom Jager will meet again in 50-yard freestyle match races next 
month at Nevada Las Vegas and Iowa. They will swim March 2 at UNLV's Buchanan 
Natatorium for $4,500 in prizes, $2,500 going to the winner. That race will be 
held in conjunction with the Nevada Short Course championships. 
</P>
<P>
Meet director Dave Marsh, the coach of Las Vegas Gold swim team, has also lined 
up a 200-yard butterfly race between retirees Tracy Caulkins and Mary Meagher, 
and a 100-yard freestyle race between Rowdy Gaines and Australian Mark 
Stockwell. 
</P>
<P>
Caulkins won 48 national championships and Meagher is still the world 
record-holder in the 100-and 200-meter butterfly events, and the U.S. 
record-holder in each the 100- and 200-yard butterfly. Each won three gold 
medals at the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The race between Gaines and Stockwell pits the 1984 Olympic gold medalist 
against the silver medalist for the first time since those games. In their last 
meeting, Stockwell charged that Gaines jumped the start and should have been 
disqualified. Videotapes showed that Gaines did not come to a full stop before 
the starter started the race but the result stood. 
</P>
<P>
On March 28, when they meet at Iowa, Biondi and Jager will be joined by Tom 
Williams, the 50-meter freestyle champion at the 1987 Pan-American Games. 
</P>
<P>
The race, which will be held in conjunction with the U. S. Swimming Junior 
Olympic championships at the Iowa field house, will have a prize of $5,000 for 
the winner. As an added incentive, any swimmer who beats 19 seconds will win a 
new car. Biondi holds the American record of 19.15 seconds. Jager and Williams 
have swum 19.24 and 19.64 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi beat Jager in the first match race in December at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
Last month at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand, USC sophomore 
Gary Anderson won gold medals in the 200-meter individual medley, the 200-meter 
backstroke, and a silver medal in the 100-meter backstroke while competing for 
Canada. . . . Also at the Games, Glenn Housman of Australia became the second 
swimmer to break the 15-minute mark in the 1,500-meter freestyle, winning in 
14:55.25. In the same race, 16-year-old Kieren Perkins, also of Australia, 
became the third swimmer with a time of 14:58.08. Vladimir Salnikov of the 
Soviet Union holds the world record, 14:54.76.

EL SEGUNDO SHOOTS FOR FIRST FINALS SPOT IN 23 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>

A confident El Segundo High School basketball team will attempt to reach the 
CIF Southern Section finals for the first time in 23 years when it faces 
top-seeded Laguna Beach at 7:30 tonight in the 2-A playoffs at Rolling Hills 
High. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking forward to it," El Segundo Coach Rick Sabosky said of the 
semifinal match-up. "I know Laguna Beach is a good team. But I feel if we play 
a strong game defensively, we can handle them." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (15-13) have been impressive in both of their playoff victories, 
beating Crossroads, 81-67, last week and fourth-seeded Orange Lutheran, 80-63, 
in the quarterfinals Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense has been the key in the last few games," Sabosky said. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo figures to focus most of its attention on Laguna Beach forward Dain 
Blanton, a 6-foot-4 senior who averages 17.5 points and six rebounds. A good 
leaper, Blanton is rated one of the West Coast's top college volleyball 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a slashing-type player," Sabosky said. "He's really strong going to the 
hole." 
</P>
<P>
Blanton's supporting cast is headed by guards Josh Borella, who scored 28 
points Tuesday in a 73-62 victory over Bishop, and John Trevino, who averages 
15 points and 3.3 assists. The Artists (21-5) were runners-up to Trabuco Hills 
in the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo features a balanced lineup led by 6-5, 230-pound center Kenny 
Talanoa, 6-3 forward Tate Seefried and guard Scott Panfil. In Tuesday's win 
over Orange Lutheran, Panfil and Seefried combined for 40 points and seven 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Panfil averages 19.5 points, Seefried 16.5 and Talanoa 13.5 points and 13 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"If Seefried and Panfil are both on, we're pretty tough," Sabosky said. 
"They've both been contributing in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The coach also lauded the recent play of guard Craig Friesen and reserve 
forward Chris Hansen, a 6-4 junior who has been a welcome addition in the 2-A 
tournament after missing most of the regular season because of grade problems. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of tonight's game will advance to the 2-A championship game at 9:45 
a.m. March 3 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo last appeared in a CIF basketball final in 1967, when a team coached 
by Cliff Warren (now the coach at Rolling Hills High) and starring Dana Pagett 
(now the coach at Rancho Santiago College) lost in overtime to Monrovia in the 
major division title game. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach is going after its first Southern Section title since 1962, when 
it won the Small Schools championship under present Coach Ed Bowen.

TORO BASEBALL TEAM GETS A QUICK FIX; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE: CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS COACH GEORGE WING KNEW THE FASTEST WAY TO 
IMPROVE HIS TEAM. HE STOCKED IT WITH JUNIOR COLLEGE TRANSFERS AND FEELS 
CONFIDENT AS THE TOROS OPEN LEAGUE PLAY TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The quick fix is in at Cal State Dominguez Hills, where second-year baseball 
Coach George Wing is generally pleased with the results turned in by his first 
recruiting class. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros begin California Collegiate Athletic Assn. play at 2:30 this 
afternoon at Cal State Northridge with a 5-3-1 record. Northridge (2-0) will 
visit Dominguez Hills on Saturday at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Two Toro victories earlier this year were at the University of Arizona and UC 
Santa Barbara, two Division I schools. Dominguez Hills was ranked as high as 
13th in the nation before slipping to 24th this week. 
</P>
<P>
"At this stage it is too early for rankings," Wing said. "I think Dominguez 
Hills will have a real impact in the conference. Not a whole lot of people are 
looking at us yet, but the guys have the right attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Wing, hired so late in 1988 that he missed the entire recruiting season for his 
1989 team, has rebuilt the Toros with 22 junior college players. The team 
carries only five freshmen, none of whom have seen regular playing time. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, Wing, a former junior college coach, wants to go after high 
school seniors, but for the 1990 campaign it was important to put a winning 
team on the field. Dominguez Hills, which captured back-to-back California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. titles in 1986 and '87 under former Coach Andy Lopez, 
finished well below .500 the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year it was a situation of taking the hand that was dealt me and seeing 
what I could do," said Wing, who replaced Lopez in mid-July of 1988 from 
Cosumnes River College in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
On a potential future roster of 28 players, Wing hopes for a mix of 14 junior 
college players and 14 freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"My plan now is to build with freshmen," he said. "But after last year's finish 
(16-29-1), I felt that we needed to develop respect, for recruiting purposes, 
and that's why I went the quick-fix route." 
</P>
<P>
Building a team around transfers who have two years of college training behind 
them is considered the fast way to turn a sagging program around. So far, 
Wing's philosophy seems to be paying dividends. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys have developed a very strong (fellowship)," Wing said. "All the JC 
guys come from a familiar-type background; that is, they played at quality 
programs on a college level. They came here all for the same thing: to play 
baseball. It's easy for them to make the adjustment from one college to the 
next." 
</P>
<P>
Three players are having an immediate impact. Infielders Fred Camarena (.448) 
and Johnny Blood (.382) and outfielder George Scott (.375) lead the regulars in 
batting. 
</P>
<P>
Said Wing: "Between them, there is always one that is getting on base, starting 
something, always being a spark plug." 
</P>
<P>
What the Toros have lacked is more hitting from the remainder of their lineup. 
First baseman Bill Keep (.313) is the only other regular hitting above .300. 
The team has added 10 points to its batting average in the last week, but .292 
is not considered strong in college circles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still waiting on our power guys to get going," Wing said. "We have the 
potential to be very, very explosive, but we have yet to see it." 
</P>
<P>
The Toros have shown a propensity for falling behind early, then roaring back. 
Dominguez Hills has been outscored 17-11 through nine games in the first three 
innings, but in the middle innings it owns a 35-23 edge. 
</P>
<P>
Said first-year offensive Coach Eric Mihkelson, a former Toro player: "I wasn't 
excited at first with our offense. There wasn't any execution. But now we've 
got things going good." 
</P>
<P>
The seventh inning may prove to be the key in many Toro games this year, if 
early trends continue. Dominguez Hills has scored just once in the stretch 
frame this year, while opponents have managed eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
That may change as the season progresses and starting pitchers grow stronger 
and can go the distance more often. It could become a point of concern for 
Wing, however. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, the team looks solid but not spectacular, Wing said. Dominguez 
Hills has committed nine errors this season, three against Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Wing thought the Toros' pitching would be strong when he saw the team in winter 
workouts. But so far, things haven't shaped up that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not convinced yet that we will be a dominating pitching staff," he said. 
"In this conference, we have as good a chance as any team to win. But so far 
we've been on a roller-coaster ride with our pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
The staff was dealt a major blow about a month before the season began when ace 
hurler Chuck Plumley quit. 
</P>
<P>
"He just lost it in his heart," Wing said. "It wasn't a disagreement with us or 
unhappiness with the program; he just didn't want to play anymore." 
</P>
<P>
That still left 13 prospective pitchers in the fold. Left-handers Vincent 
Aguilar (1-1) and Willie Navarette (1-1) have five starts between them. Lefty 
Armando Gomez is 2-0 and occupies the third spot in the rotation. Wing looks 
for right-hander Gilbert Diaz, a 10-game winner from Allan Hancock College, who 
already has a save in relief, to see plenty of action, possibly as a starter. 
If Diaz comes around, Wing would have the option of mixing up his left-handed 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind," he said. "The potential is there for us to be 
a dominating force in the conference." 
</P>
<P>
When the team is up to bat, Wing lets Mihkelson call the signals. 
</P>
<P>
"He has played here and knows this field very well," the coach explained. 
</P>
<P>
When he was hired, Wing took a long, hard look at the facilities in Carson and 
realized that recruiting power-hitting lefties would be out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
The Toro diamond sits on a mesa looking out toward the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
In the afternoon the ocean winds whip in against the hitters. Home runs to 
right and center fields are few. 
</P>
<P>
So Wing decided to build a team that can play "up the middle" -- a bunt-and-run 
team, much like those Mihkelson is used to. 
</P>
<P>
"I've geared the team toward handling the bat, the short game of hit and run," 
Wing said. "Power hitting is great on the road, but it doesn't do us any good 
at home." 
</P>
<P>
In the CCAA, defending national champion Cal Poly San Luis Obispo is ranked 
fourth nationally this year. Struggling Cal Poly Pomona already has two losses 
to 16th-ranked Northridge, but the Broncos remain No. 15. Wing, however, said 
UC Riverside may be the team to beat. 
</P>
<P>
But then, he said, don't count the Toros out. "We are a dark horse."

Heidi Voorhees has seen this type of behavior for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Voorhees, a senior on the Notre Dame High golf team, yanks a driver out of her

the same tee area -- and whistles a drive down the middle of the fairway in the

Her opponent, almost always a male, typically does one of two things. He either 
suppresses a smirk, confident of his own abilities, or turns a sickly green, 
realizing he is overmatched. 
</P>
<P>
In the next stage, the young lad pulls the head cover off his driver and 
envelops the club with a vise-like grip, determined to send the ball on a 
white-knuckle ride. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Thran, the Harvard coach, has witnessed this attempt to assert male 
domination many times. Imagine what it was like last season when Notre Dame had 
two girls in the starting six. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls will stand up there, and while they won't hit it that far, they'll 
hit it down the middle," Thran said. "Then one of the guys gets up and wants to 
show how far he can hit it, and pumps one into the next fairway." 
</P>
<P>
Thran, whose team competes against Notre Dame in the San Fernando Valley 
League, devised a system to circumvent potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I put the freshmen and sophomores in with the girls," Thran said. "They're too 
young to know about girls yet." 
</P>
<P>
Old, young and in between, Voorhees has seen it all. Sometimes, the strange 
behavior starts before she steps up to the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, they think I'm not there to play," said Voorhees, a winner of 
dozens of girls' junior events over the past few years. "Sometimes, they think 
I'm there with my boyfriend to watch him play." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, Voorhees makes 'em pay. "Lots of them can hit it by me pretty 
far," she said. "But I have an advantage with my short game and my accuracy. My 
short game is pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Voorhees, a Notre Dame co-captain, orally committed to play 
next season at USC on a full athletic scholarship. In dual matches last season, 
she often was paired in the same foursome with Notre Dame senior Brendan 
O'Shaughnessy, the team's No. 1 player. Voorhees was the medalist -- the day's 
low individual -- seven times. O'Shaughnessy was medalist five times. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, life was even tougher on the egos of opposing males. Emilee Klein, 
who won the women's state amateur competition before enrolling at Notre Dame 
for her freshman season, also played on the varsity. This season, however, 
Klein decided to devote more time to tournament play and will not compete for 
the golf team, Coach John Skeese said. 
</P>
<P>
Area teams to watch: 
</P>
<P>
* Westlake (Marmonte League): Coach Lorin Maygren predicts that 1989 was 
nothing more than an anomaly. Westlake's track record indicates that he is 
probably correct. "I think this is going to be another real good year," Maygren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That statement alone should prove worrisome for every team in the Southern 
Section, if not Southern California. Over the past six seasons, the Warriors 
have won two Southern Section titles as well as finishing second, third and 
fifth. Last season, however, Westlake did not advance beyond the regional. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors again are led by Charlie Wi and Jerry Chang. Wi is a four-year 
starter. Chang has started for three seasons. Together they form the most 
potent 1-2 punch in the area; both advanced as individuals to the Southern 
California Championships in Bakersfield last season. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart Roman, Rob Paley and Jeff Rulon, all seniors who played in the top six 
last season, are back to defend the Marmonte League title, which Westlake has 
won the past six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
* Newbury Park (Marmonte League): The Panthers stormed out of the Marmonte 
League pack last season and into the Southern Section team finals, where they 
finished second and became the first team in school history to advance to the 
Southern California Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Steve Holmes, who emerged as Newbury Park's most consistent player 
toward the end of '89, returns. Genio Borghi, a junior, and sophomores Brad 
Bronk, Keith Early and Darren Humphrey round out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
* Crespi (Del Rey League): The Celts finished behind Loyola and St. Francis in 
league play last season, but everyone returns, including team co-MVPs Brett 
McGovern (junior) and Robbie Collins (sophomore). Seniors Rich Nehus and Scott 
Brunette and junior Brian Nourse also are returning members. 
</P>
<P>
* St. Francis (Del Rey League): The defending league co-champion Golden Knights 
received a shot in the arm with the addition of two new players. Kevin 
O'Connell transferred to St. Francis from Hoover and is a possible No. 1 
player. However, the biggest boon might be the addition of senior Dan Jennings, 
who previously played on the baseball team during spring semester. Top-six 
players Terry Brice, Matt Hydar, Tim Shepard and Dave Friedman also return. 
</P>
<P>
* Hart (Foothill League): Sophomore Jason Gore and junior Shane O'Brien, each 
of whom finished in the top five individually in the league tournament last 
season, are back. Juniors Mike Miller and Jason Black and senior Todd Leone 
also are returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
* Canyon (Golden League): Sophomore Jason Wolter, who finished second 
individually at the league tournament last season, leads a group of four 
talented underclassmen who return from last year's team, which finished second 
to Ridgecrest Burroughs. Juniors Valent Soisuvarn, Ryan Dunkel and John Weidner 
give Canyon a potent top four. 
</P>
<P>
* Hoover (Pacific League): Dee Kohlmeier has coached the Tornadoes off and on 
since 1953. Entering his fifth decade at the school, he might still be coaching 
the team to beat in the four-team Pacific League. Behind seniors John Hillman 
and Sean Boulton -- both are three-year lettermen -- Hoover has won three of 
the past four league titles. Sophomore Sam Park, freshman Eugene Song and 
junior Francisco Kim round out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
* Notre Dame (San Fernando Valley): The defending league champions -- the 
Knights were unbeaten in San Fernando Valley League dual matches -- have five 
of their top eight players back, led by Voorhees. Senior Tony DeFranco, juniors 
Danny Suter and Mike Calczynski and sophomore Greg Gonzalez also should 
contribute. 
</P>
<P>
* Agoura (Frontier League): The defending league champion is again the team to 
beat behind returning standouts Tim Murphy (senior), John Schweizer (junior) 
and Jason Tulley (junior). 
</P>
<P>
* Taft (City 5-A League): The Toreadors have won eight City Section titles, two 
in the past three years. Last year's team, which won the City team title by 12 
shots, was manned solely by non-seniors. Seniors Jim Venetos, Jason Meshekow 
and Chad Persons form the likely top three. 
</P>
<P>
* El Camino Real (City 5-A): The Conquistadores could wrest the City title from 
Taft. Returning are seniors Tony Bordwell, Tony Sanelli and Paul Parazato. Two 
years ago, El Camino Real stormed out of the 4-A League to win the City team 
title -- the first team outside the 5-A League ever to do so.

TOON, RESURGENT VAN NUYS FACE NARBONNE IN GIRLS' SEMIFINAL

Surprising Van Nuys High, which unseated North Hollywood as Mid-Valley League 
girls' basketball champion and qualified for postseason play for the first time 
in four years, hopes to continue its unexpected success today at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys will meet Narbonne in the City Section 3-A Division semifinals at 2:30 
p.m. The Wolves are 22-3, 10-0 in league play, and have undergone a resurgence 
under second-year Coach Tony Magnante. 
</P>
<P>
Magnante has fashioned a winning season around 6-foot center Stacie Toon, a 
three-year starter and a second-team All-City selection last season as a 
junior. Toon has been joined by Huong Thai, a 4-11 point guard who directed the 
junior varsity to a 21-0 record and a City title in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Still, much of the success in 1990 is attributable to Toon's maturation. Toon 
is averaging 19 points and 12 rebounds a game, and the improvement of her 
inside game has made her one of the dominant 3-A players, Magnante said. 
</P>
<P>
"She does well around the boards," he said. "She can get the rebounds and put 
the ball back up. . . . That's where she gets most of her points." 
</P>
<P>
Toon, also an All-City volleyball player, has been selected athlete of the week 
by both the Los Angeles Unified School District and United Cable, but she said 
her top priority remains a City title. 
</P>
<P>
"It would make my whole senior year," she said. "Van Nuys isn't known for 
sports, so it would mean a lot to the school." 
</P>
<P>
For Toon, a championship also would mean more exposure to college recruiters. 
She has received letters from UCLA, Michigan and Cal State Northridge.

Four South Bay high schools will play semifinal-round games Saturday night at 
7:30 in the CIF Southern Section girls basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In a match-up of two area teams, fourth-seeded West Torrance (20-5) battles 
Bishop Montgomery (17-9) in a 4-A Division game at South Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams boast excellent point guards. Bishop Montgomery is led by Lily 
Cabaleiro, who scored 25 points Wednesday night in the Knights' 51-44 upset 
over top-seeded La Habra. West's premier player is Rosa Olloque, who had 18 
points in the Warriors' 48-35 quarterfinal victory over Los Altos. 
</P>
<P>
The winner advances to the 4-A championship game at 6:45 p.m. Friday at Cal 
Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5-AA Division, top-seeded Morningside (26-3) faces Chino (25-2) at 
Ontario. The Lady Monarchs came back from an 18-point second-quarter deficit 
Wednesday night to defeat host Channel Islands of Oxnard, 66-55, behind the 
play of center Lisa Leslie (26 points, 21 rebounds, seven blocked shots) and 
forward Janet Davis (10 points, 16 rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
The 5-AA championship will be decided Friday night at 8:30 at UC Irvine. 
Morningside is going after its third straight Southern Section crown. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-AA Division, second-seeded Palos Verdes (26-4) travels to meet 
Estancia of Costa Mesa (14-12) at University High in Irvine. The winner plays 
for the title at 8:30 Wednesday night at Cal Poly Pomona. ROB FERNAS

AGASSI ILL, DROPS OUT OF MATCH

<P>
Andre Agassi, the highest remaining seed in the $1-million U.S. Pro Indoor 
tournament in Philadelphia, quit suddenly because of food poisoning Thursday 
night, handing a 5-7, 7-5 victory to 13th-seeded Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
Suellen Foley, a spokeswoman for the tournament, said Agassi had eaten pasta 
Thursday at a Philadelphia restaurant and had had a banana afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the way I would have liked to have won, but I'll take it," Sampras 
said. "I don't get very many freebies playing top 10 guys." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras said he had noticed Agassi slowing in the second set, but thought he 
would keep playing. Agassi, seeded No. 3 in the tournament, joined top-seeded 
John McEnroe and second-seeded Brad Gilbert on the sidelines. Fourth-seeded Jay 
Berger defeated Wally Masur Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, fifth-seeded Tim Mayotte rallied from a first-set loss to defeat Glenn 
Layendecker, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), and gain a quarterfinal berth. In other 
matches, Richey Reneberg, the player who ousted McEnroe on Wednesday, lost to 
Mark Kratzmann, 6-4, 6-4; and eighth-seeded Jim Courier needed four match 
points to beat 10th-seeded Christo van Rensburg, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker both struggled before advancing to the 
quarterfinals of the ATP Eurocard tournament at Stuttgart, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, ranked No. 1 in the world, had a tough time beating Goran Prpic of 
Yugoslavia, 7-5, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, seeded second, had to win the last three games to beat hard-hitting 
Alexander Volkov of the Soviet Union, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, Jonas Svensson of Sweden upset Yannick Noah of France, 6-2, 
6-4, and Aki Rahunen of Finland reached the final eight of a major event for 
the first time by defeating Amos Mansdorf of Israel, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Rahunen, 18 and ranked 138th in the world, came through this tournament's 
qualifying competition and is such a longshot that the wrong picture appeared 
with his biography in the official player guide produced by the ATP Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Zina Garrison used a near-flawless serve-and-volley game to defeat Australia's 
Liz Smylie, 6-0, 6-1, and move into the quarterfinals of the Virginia Slims of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison, the No. 2 seed and fourth-ranked player in the world, lost only 13 
points on her serve and won 26 of 33 points at the net in dispatching Smylie in 
49 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In other second-round matches, Nathalie Tauziat of France allowed only one 
service break in a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Italy's Linda Ferrando, and Anne Smith 
won the last four games en route to a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Claudia 
Kohde-Kilsch.

NOW, THEY'RE TWIN CHAMPIONS, TOO; 
</P>
<P>
WRESTLING: AFTER SOME SIDETRACKS, VALHALLA'S JEREMY HENDRICK HAS BEGUN TO MATCH 
THE SUCCESS OF BROTHER JASON.

<P>
Jason Hendrick, Valhalla's 154-pound wrestler, had been asked the question more 
than once. So had Glen Takahashi, his coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Jason has a brother?" people ask. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he has a twin, Jeremy, who has been wrestling as long as Jason. But 
because of two years of academic ineligibility, not many people knew about him 
until this season, when Jeremy stepped into Valhalla's lineup at 145 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a lot of people are aware of the two Hendricks. Last Saturday, both won 
2-A section titles. They will try for Masters championships this Saturday at 
Mira Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good when all of a sudden everybody was saying, 'Oh, he has a twin 
brother,' " Jeremy said. "People would see my last name and get scared. At 
first they think it's Jason. Then they find out it's Jeremy, and there's a 
little bit of relief." 
</P>
<P>
Jason (30-4 this season) has always been the more consistent. As a sophomore at 
138 pounds, Jason won the section and Masters and placed fifth at the state 
meet. During the summer, he placed third at the Cadet national tournament in 
Missouri and made the junior national Greco team. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy, on the other hand, was in and out of the wrestling room last year and 
didn't even compete over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't getting along with my parents last year," said Jeremy, who has a 
25-6-1 record. "Now everything is fine with my parents, and my grades are fine, 
and now wrestling (is going well). It's a 360-degree turn. I came back this 
year and said, 'No more, no more bad boy for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Takahashi: "He's just catching up now and finally coming into his own. 
He's starting to believe in himself. We're starting to see some really good 
wrestling from Jeremy." 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the season, Takahashi asked his wrestlers to write down goals 
on a piece of paper. The Hendricks took it one step further, putting them on a 
sheet of poster board and hanging it in their room: 
</P>
<P>
"Take first in league. Take first in CIF. Take first in Masters." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jeremy: "Jason and I wrote it real big so we can look at it every morning 
and put it in our head." 
</P>
<P>
Jason won his second section title Saturday by pinning Carlsbad's David Harris 
in four minutes 39 seconds after building a 10-2 lead. Jeremy defeated Aaron 
Welk of Vista, 13-5, in his final. 
</P>
<P>
Jason won last year's Masters title by upsetting Monte Vista senior Dusty 
Harless, who later placed second at the state meet. This year, Jason is 
confident but taking a cautious approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, Dusty Harless said it was going to be a cake walk, and I beat him, 
so I don't want to eat my words," Jason said. "It should be pretty easy, but 
you have to be mentally prepared and wrestle these guys like they're state 
champions." 
</P>
<P>
Jason, seeded first at 154, thinks his toughest competition will be No. 2 Colby 
Helper of Oceanside. Jason defeated Helper, 12-2, in the championship match at 
the El Cajon tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy is seeded ninth at 145 but has defeated some of the higher-seeded 
competition, including No. 1-seeded Welk twice. Welk (25-8) will meet Jeremy in 
the quarterfinals if both win their first-round matches. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm at the peak of my career right now," Jeremy said. 
</P>
<P>
Each brother agrees that having the other in the lineup helps. 
</P>
<P>
"We always talk before matches," Jeremy said. "And now I'm wrestling people 
he's wrestled before because I've gone up in weight so much (he weighed 119 
last year). He tells me what their moves are and how they wrestle. He's a 
helpful tool for me." 
</P>
<P>
And because Jason wrestles right after Jeremy, he is affected by the outcome of 
his brother's match. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps me a lot seeing him win, and if he loses I get angry and I go out and 
really wrestle the guy," Jason said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers often talk with their father, John, about upcoming matches. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of our parents are real supportive," Jeremy said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hendricks started in wrestling through a program in Jamul. They and their 
older brother, J.R., received a flyer about the Jamul Slammers at school. 
</P>
<P>
"We brought home the paper and hung it on the refrigerator and asked Dad about 
it," Jeremy said. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of wrestling, Jeremy was a passenger on a three-wheel all-terrain 
vehicle when it was involved in a hit-and-run accident with a car. Jeremy 
suffered a fractured skull, and injuries to his back and ribs. He couldn't 
participate in any physical activity for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"At one point, he was better than me, but after his accident, I went a couple 
steps ahead of him and kept excelling," Jason said. 
</P>
<P>
John Hendrick coached them for two years before the club fizzled. The Hendricks 
then went from club to club, gaining experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Teams just took us in," Jason said. "We always wrestled pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Hendrick began the season with the idea that he would be overlooked at 
first. He set goals, but as his confidence has grown, they have changed. At the 
start of the season, for example, he wanted to qualify for the state meet. Now 
he wants to place. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point was at the Five Counties tournament early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrestled bad and didn't place," Jeremy said. "Coach talked to me and said, 
'This is where you've got to turn around.' I started wrestling hard from 
there." 
</P>
<P>
He injured his ankle while defeating Welk, 7-3, in the second round at the El 
Cajon tournament and defaulted his quarterfinal. But after recovering, Jeremy 
began winning. 
</P>
<P>
He defeated Shawn Bankes of El Cajon Valley, 3-0, in a dual meet. "Bankes is a 
good wrestler," Jeremy said. "That really boosted my confidence." And he 
followed with tournament victories at Holtville, the Grossmont League meet and 
the section. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Jeremy's goals aren't limited to his high school career. Last summer, he 
had nothing to do with wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, he hopes to make the junior national freestyle team.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL ABSORBED A 137-113 LOSS BUT NEXT YEAR 
WILL HAVE SOMETHING THE GULLS HAVE ONLY DREAMED ABOUT -- A CONFERENCE TO CALL 
HOME.

Florida International did not leave Golden Hall with much after U.S. 
International picked its game apart in a 137-113 rout Thursday night. But at 
least Rich Walker, the Golden Panthers' coach, knew he had something USIU Coach 
Gary Zarecky might even give up star guard Kevin Bradshaw for. 
</P>
<P>
A conference. 
</P>
<P>
Florida International, an independent since moving to NCAA Division I three 
years ago, was one of the main forces, along with USIU, behind forming a 
conference consisting of other independents. 
</P>
<P>
But the Golden Panthers (6-19) will join the Trans America Conference starting 
next season, leaving USIU and Athletic Director Al Palmiotto without one of its 
key brethren. 
</P>
<P>
Palmiotto said after the Gulls' rout of Florida International that USIU (10-16) 
may nevertheless be closer to forming a new conference than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago State call me today and said they were in," Palmiotto said. 
"Northeastern Illinois and University of Missouri-Kansas City have already 
committed, and so has Milwaukee-Wisconsin (which moves to Division I next 
year). 
</P>
<P>
"We're still sitting on the fence with Wright State and Youngstown," Palmiotto 
said. "The big hangup is that schools are waiting to see if the NCAA makes 
Division I schools that play Division II or III football also make their 
football programs Division I." 
</P>
<P>
Palmiotto said that measure will be voted on the NCAA in March or April. If the 
NCAA doesn't require schools to align their football teams with the rest of 
their program, Palmiotto thinks the conference could be operating by the 
1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
"(Independents) are going to have to make a move soon," Palmiotto said. "With 
everyone moving to conferences, the independents are getting squeezed out. 
They'll have nobody to left to play." 
</P>
<P>
Getting into a conference is so important that Florida International jumped at 
the chance to join the Trans America Conference rather than waiting for the 
chance that a new one would be formed. 
</P>
<P>
"We were talking to (USIU) and anyone else who wanted to be in a conference," 
Walker said. "Being an independent is insanity. The travel. And your treatment 
on the road is horrendous." 
</P>
<P>
That is an opinion that drew Walker a technical foul in the first half of 
Thursday's game. With USIU leading, 22-15, early in the first half, Walker was 
called after complaining about a call. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls turned it into a five-point play as Bradshaw made both free throws 
and then hit a three-pointer to give USIU a 27-15 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Florida International pulled within 73-63 early in the second half, but USIU 
outscored the Golden Panthers, 10-1, and FIU never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
USIU did about anything it wanted in the second half, exploiting a FIU team 
that started three freshmen, a sophomore and a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, who had his second-highest point total of the season with 41 points, 
hit a three-pointer with one second remaining to give USIU 137 points -- tying 
for third most total for a USIU team and the most in a Gull victory. 
</P>
<P>
Demetrius Laffitte had 14 rebounds in the second half and tied Brett Crawford 
(vs. Mississippi Valley State, 1984) for the school record with 21 for the 
game. Steve Smith also tied a school record with 14 assists. Zach Lieberman had 
the same number against Cal State Los Angeles in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Laffitte finished with 31 points, and Paul Wilson added 26.

Old Hatchets: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher put aside old political wounds 
Wednesday and went to a lunch in London honoring former Prime Minister Edward 
Heath. Though he has kept up steady criticism of her policies, he warmly 
welcomed her to the affair.

Love Letters: French papers are taking up sides over the publication of letters 
from Simone de Beauvoir to Jean-Paul Sartre, which concentrate on her affair 
with him and her bisexual love life. The newspaper Le Monde said Wednesday that 
"anyone who loves life will find these letters delicious," while Liberation 
said "this suffocating display is a crime." She said of her conquests: "When I 
see all these dropouts and all these little, nice and weak people . . . it 
pleases me to think how solid we are, you and I. I've found up to now that it 
is a success for our morality and way of life."

Strange Bedfellows: Vice President Dan Quayle announced Thursday that Sen. 
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), will accompany him to the March 11 presidential 
inauguration of Patricio Aylwin in Chile. Quayle, champion of the Republican 
right, held a photo session with Kennedy, symbol of the Democratic left, saying 
"It shows the bipartisan commitment to the advancement of democracy in Chile 
and the Western Hemisphere." Aylwin replaced military dictator Augusto 
Pinochet.

Light Debt: Seymour Durst, president of a real estate company in New York, has 
a unique way of reminding people of the size of the U.S. debt. "It's a sign 10 
feet by 25 feet we put up on 42nd and 6th Avenue," he explained to Mark 
Patinkin of the Providence Journal in Providence. R.I. "It shows the debt, all 
13 digits of it, in flashing lights." The electronic sign, which now totals up 
to more than $3,000,000,000,000, continually updates itself. "The debt 
increases $8,000 a second," said Durst. Compiled by YEMI TOURE

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: FIRST NAMES CAN HOLD EXTRA CLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA V. GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given names have histories -- just as surnames -- and for genealogists the 
study of the given names selected by our ancestors are important clues to their 
ethnic origins, religions, educational and social backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
America is indeed a melting pot when it comes to our names. From the first 
immigrants to this country -- mostly English, with a sprinkling of Dutch, 
French, Irish, Spanish, Jewish, Scandinavian, Polish and African ancestors -- 
to today's multiethnic families from around the world, our given names often 
reflect the rich heritage passed down through generations. 
</P>
<P>
Popular given names in the 17th Century in this country were: John, William, 
Edward, Richard, Thomas, and Joseph for boys. Most girls were named Mary, 
Elizabeth, Sarah, Hannah, Abigail, Rebecca, Ruth, Lydia, Anne or Martha. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the 17th Century there was a heavy immigration of Germans 
into Pennsylvania. They were the first group to use two given names, providing 
what we call a middle name. 
</P>
<P>
The Scots and Scotch Irish also were influential in shaping name patterns. 
Among their favorites for boys were: James, Andrew, Alexander and Archibald. 
</P>
<P>
By the 18th Century there was usage of classical names for girls, such as 
Lucretia, Cynthia and Lavina, and more parents began to use middle names. Among 
female names, Nancy, Sally and Betsy became used as independent names -- not as 
nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
The influence of Romanticism in the latter part of the 18th Century probably 
sparked the revival of such old Anglo-Saxon names as: Alfred, Egbert, Harold, 
Edmund and Edith, Ethel and Audrey. Tennyson's "Idylls of the King" no doubt 
was responsible for the given names of Guenevere, Enid, Elaine and Vivian. Sir 
Walter Scott's writing influenced parents to name sons: Bruce, Douglas, Donald, 
Roy, Ronald and Kenneth. 
</P>
<P>
The 19th Century was a colorful but restless period in American history. In 
addition to the Civil War, there was a heavy immigration of 
non-English-speaking people, great internal migration, new frontiers being 
explored and settled, and the economic chaos of the Industrial Revolution. 
There developed a tendency to "Americanize" foreign-sounding given names. 
Heinrich and Johann usually became Henry and John. 
</P>
<P>
Parents still tended to name a son for the father and the use of "Junior" 
flourished. However, sons were often given their mother's maiden name as a 
middle name, and in some localities this practice became fairly prevalent for 
the naming of daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Many sons were named for well-known figures -- local and national ones. Every 
genealogist whose families were in America by this time stumble across 
ancestors and relatives named George Washington Smith, Daniel Boone Williams or 
Abraham Lincoln Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Civil War heroes provided many names for our ancestors -- Robert E. Lee or a 
combination of his name -- is borne by many of our Southern male ancestors. The 
names Stonewall Jackson and Jeb, for J.E.B. Stuart, also became popular. In the 
Northern states, Lincoln and Grant became common given names, while many 
parents named their daughters for states, such as Missouri, Tennessee or 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Romantic minds took an interest in the foreign and exotic, probably accounting 
for the popularity of Charlotte, Maria and Henrietta. The 19th Century was 
highly literate, as the majority of people knew how to read and many 
inexpensive books became available. Shakespeare's writing is credited with 
several names for girls, such as Juliet, Rosalind, and Viola. 
</P>
<P>
Found a "strange" given name in your family? Check all the dictionaries of 
given names at your libraries. The histories of these names are fascinating, 
and may provide you with some clues about your families.

Q: Is the red tie popularized by Donald Trump the power tie of 1990? I've heard 
yellow is more powerful now. -- T.E.J. 
</P>
<P>
A: Many of the Fortune 500 types remain in the black with red ties. 
</P>
<P>
Others keep out of the red in yellow ties, although that color seems to have 
slipped in the ratings. And some Wall Streeters are wearing pink ties. Men's 
wear designer Bill Robinson, winner of many awards, says the power look of the 
'90s is a tie of many colors, but instead of a standard paisley or a foulard, 
the new versions offer bolder, larger-scale patterns, such as scrolls, florals 
or vegetation prints. 
</P>
<P>
This tie of titans is a little wider than Trump's, says Robinson, averaging 
about 3 3/4 inches. And it looks best, he says, with shirts that have longer 
collar points. Robinson's woven tapestry-look tie (illustrated here) in navy 
with gold scrollwork is $62.50. For retail outlets, write to Bill Robinson, 575 
Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y., 10017, attention Lynn Tesoro.MARYLOU LUTHER

Barry Kieselstein-Cord is becoming the Paul Newman of the fashion industry. The 
New York-based jewelry designer, who has a boutique in Neiman Marcus Beverly 
Hills, has formed a partnership with Dallas-based car enthusiast David Bell to 
back "Team Kieselstein-Cord." Consisting of five Shelby racing cars and two 
professional drivers, the team will compete for the first time in a Southern 
Vintage Racing Assn. race at Moroso Park near Palm Beach, March 9-11. For the 
record, Kieselstein-Cord owns 13 cars, including a Porsche 911 and a Mercedes 
6.9.

BOB AND BARBIE: Mattel's Barbie has really gone Hollywood. Bob Mackie, best 
known as Cher's costume designer, has created a special Collectors' Edition 
Barbie. He's zipped up the world's most famous fashion doll in a gold lame, 
body-hugging gown that bares the midriff and swathed her in a white marabou 
stole. Asked if dressing Barbie was like dressing any of his long list of 
celebrity clients, Mackie mused: "She's a combination of all the best parts." 
This first Collectors' Edition Barbie from Mattel will be available in June at 
a suggested retail price of $120.

JACKET CODE: Bruce Springsteen, Bruce Willis, Cleavon Little, Emilio Estevez 
and Mickey Rourke all showed up wearing their leather jackets one recent night 
at the China Club. Do you suppose they called each other first? Rod Stewart 
bucked the trend, suited in pinstripes and a white tux shirt.

SAFARI SO GOOD: Other designers hand out tote bags when they introduce a new 
fragrance. Not so Ralph Lauren. His new $300-an-ounce Safari fragrance is part 
of an entire fantasy theme that is right out of Africa. Lauren has designed a 
line of ready-to-wear and home furnishings to complement the new scent -- the 
whole package, clothes, furnishings and fragrance is called the Safari 
Collection. Even the Polo Ralph Lauren store on Rodeo Drive has been 
transformed: The decor of leather riding boots and saddles has given way to 
leather riding boots, travel trunks and silver tea services.

FILLING A NEED WITH SOME STYLE: Dawn Wells (better known as Mary Ann on 
"Gilligan's Island") has designed a line of clothes for people who have 
difficulty dressing themselves because of handicaps or arthritis. Her garments, 
called the Wishing Well Collection, are made with full overlapping panels in 
the back that fasten with Velcro closures, replacing buttons, zippers and 
over-the-head entrances. In designing user-friendly garments, she has not 
forsaken style -- a bright red, double-breasted coat dress with black trim, a 
tuxedo-front dress in pastel colors and a panne velvet, mandarin-collar robe 
are just a few of the items in her mail order catalogue, available by calling 
(818) 840-6919.

WE'VE COME FOR YOUR DAUGHTERS: Strutting down the Paris runways are two models 
with decidedly conspicuous names -- Svetlana and Natasha. They are Soviet 
lasses signed with French modeling agency Glamour. "We plan to start scouting 
around the main cities in the Soviet Union to see who's out there for us," said 
Glamour President Jerome Bonouvreir, who plans to open a Moscow office in 
April. He got a well-manicured toe-hold on the market through Pierre Cardin, 
who is known for his longstanding manufacturing relationship with the Soviet 
Union.

Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling frescoes. The Vatican said Thursday that 
an exhibition will open March 25, marking the end of a 10-year project that 
cleaned and restored the Renaissance artist's 16th-Century masterpieces. The 
cleaning of the Sistine has been one of the most ambitious and significant art

Grammy Ratings Improve: Ratings for the Grammy Awards telecast on Wednesday 
night were up significantly over last year's and nearly equaled those of the 
recent American Music Awards. The 3 1/2-hour CBS broadcast averaged an 18.9 
rating, compared to a 16 last year -- meaning it was seen in about 17.4 million 
homes, or 3 million more than the 1989 show. For the hours between 8 and 11 
p.m., Wednesday's ceremonies averaged a 19.7 rating, just shy of the 20 figure 
that ABC wracked up during the same three hours for the American Music Awards 
on Jan. 22. CLAUDIA PUIG

Musical Chairs: Columbia/Tri Star incurred royal wrath after a seating mix up 
at the Buckingham Palace premiere of "Steel Magnolias." 
</P>
<P>
One person's wrong choice of the seat reserved for Olympia Dukakis next to 
Prince Charles led to seating pandemonium. When Dukakis and actress Julia 
Roberts showed and had nowhere to sit, the Prince tried to move and nobody knew 
where to go. The Palace sent a letter of complaint about the musical chairs 
game to Columbia/Tri Star's London office, expressing unhappiness that the 
Prince and Princess of Wales had to move seats. The next royal premiere is "The 
Hunt for Red October" on April 17. CLAUDIA PUIG

SWISS PIANIST PREMIERES SCHMID WORK AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost six decades after its completion, Swiss conductor/composer Erich 
Schmid's "Sechs Stucke fur Klavier," Opus 6, received a belated but welcome 
world premiere by compatriot pianist Marianne Schroeder Wednesday night at the 
Schoenberg Institute at USC. The originally scheduled 1932 premiere in Berlin 
was cancelled due to the threat of a nearby pro-Hitler rally. 
</P>
<P>
The work stands as an attractive example of early 12-tone writing, clearly 
modeled after corresponding works of Schoenberg, who was Schmid's teacher at 
the time. Lack of contrast, awkward cadences and other problems typical in 
early atonal music are not always avoided, but the music is crafted with 
sophistication and substantial bravura, to which Schroeder gave fitting 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Notably aggressive in both her physical assault on the instrument and in her 
cerebral approach to the technical complexity of the scores she favors, 
Schroeder generally plays impressively, though rarely soothingly. The strong 
force behind her fingers sacrifices accuracy at times, but adds a touch of 
brilliance to large-scale atonal works that require patient preparation and 
virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Such a work is Stockhausen's Klavierstuck VI, a massive, complicated explosion 
of undulating serial patterns and textures that Schroeder mastered handsomely. 
Less convincing was her reading of Scelsi's Sonata No. 2, three movements of 
quirky tremolos, tone clusters and textures that require a more playful, 
delicate touch. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. premieres of Wolf Rosenberg's lyrically atonal "Hommage a Alban Berg" and 
Argentine composer Bernardo Kuczer's minimalist octave study "Dualidades" found 
some moments of interest, but proved routine. Minor pieces by American 
composers Morton Feldman and John Cage completed the program admirably. GREGG

BOORMAN DREAMS UP RICH FAIRY TALE IN 'WHERE THE HEART IS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few film makers alive have an eye like John Boorman's. He's the kind of 
director who can make the landscapes sing, the drab city streets burst into 
extravagant bloom. 
</P>
<P>
That's what happens in the best of "Where the Heart Is" (citywide), a movie 
fairy tale about riches, poverty, art and the power of family. It's a movie, to 
some extent, split against itself. The rapturous visuals, Boorman's specialty, 
clash with his own stiff, unspontaneous screenplay, done in collaboration with 
daughter Telsche. Most of the dialogue in "Heart" seems to have no heart at 
all. Around it, Boorman's world -- bursting with satirically palatial wealth 
and funky destitution -- flames up with a soul all it own. 
</P>
<P>
This cautionary comedy about extraordinary reversals of fortune is constructed 
like the Arthurian legends of Boorman's "Excalibur" or the futuristic fable of 
"Zardoz." It has a once-upon-a-time buzz. 
</P>
<P>
Superficially, it's the tale of demolition tycoon Stewart McBain (Dabney 
Coleman) who, incensed at his children's artsy radicalism, exiles them to the 
Dutch House, a Brooklyn tenement. This building, in a barren block being razed 
for development, is the thorn in McBain's paw. He's locked in a Wall Street 
battle with a corporate raider; Dutch House, declared a historical landmark, 
endangers his contracts. Abandoning his children there, McBain is mocking their 
independence, telling them harshly to sink or swim. Instead, with their friends 
and roomers, they create an ephemeral Flatbush paradise of art, painting, 
computer games and haute couture. 
</P>
<P>
But, underneath, this story casts off realism and jells into myth. Two 
princesses and a prince (Uma Thurman, Suzy Amis, David Hewlett) are banished 
into the common land by their swaggering king of a father and his wife, queen 
of shopping sprees (Joanna Cassidy). The exiles join forces with comical rude 
peasants, wizards, artists, knights and swains, while the fiery dragon of 
hostile takeover scorches the earth. 
</P>
<P>
Boorman charges New York with his ecstatic vision. The Brooklyn Bridge spans 
these magical boroughs like castle battlements. The bums that huddle below in 
their cardboard box shelters are like Shakespearean clowns; natty young brokers 
peering into computers are warlocks with bubbling caldrons. The Dutch House, in 
its wilderness of crushed rock, is a cave of goblins and enchanters, where even 
the paintings -- beautifully rendered by Timna Woollard -- come alive. Above 
all this, McBain, king of destruction, watches skyscrapers crumble under his 
touch and rages against the ingratitude -- How sharper than a serpent's tooth! 
-- of his overcreative children. Destiny obviously waits, with a wink, in the 
wings. 
</P>
<P>
In reverting to this simple story, Boorman may seem to be retreating from the 
bold, epic canvases of most of his '70s and '80s work -- or, worse, trying 
ineptly to Americanize the intimate family drama of his last film, the 
multi-awarded "Hope and Glory." Actually, "Where the Heart Is" reprises the 
mood and themes of an earlier film some regard as Boorman's masterpiece, 1970's 
"Leo the Last." 
</P>
<P>
"Leo," which was also shot by "Heart" cameraman Peter Suschitzky, was about a 
kingly voyeur (Marcello Mastroianni), spying on and envying the London poor 
with his telescope. And Boorman, who came from the privileged family he 
described in "Hope and Glory," is a bit like Leo. He exalts the energy of the 
poor or natural man, mocks the absurd, overcultivated rich -- but he does it 
from outside. He's screened off by his own magic lens, his enchanted eye. 
</P>
<P>
Boorman's "Heart" kids live in a curiously enclosed world. They barely mingle 
with the commoners at all, except in a few quick snippets and montages. 
Instead, like slumming rich kids, they retreat into their magical cavern, make 
art, woo, have parties. Probably, Boorman can't help turning the experience 
into a fairy tale. He can't enter into the lives of the oppressed commoners he 
wants to exalt any more than he could in "Leo the Last." In "Where the Heart 
Is," he doesn't even try. 
</P>
<P>
Viewed as a real bum, scarcely a word or gesture of Christopher Plummer's 
performance as the unprintably named tramp rings true -- but he's a dandy 
wizard. The three children seem spurious or exaggerated too, the sisters almost 
indistinguishable, rich bohemians. Only Crispin Glover, as an apparently gay 
couturier and Dabney Coleman crack the boundaries of their roles. Coleman is, 
once again, a virtuoso of snarling frustration and petty patriarchal tyranny, 
infuriated here that the kids are realizing dreams he's probably repressed. 
</P>
<P>
As a verbal comedy, "Where the Heart Is" (rated R for language and nudity) 
isn't successful; the dialogue doesn't have the snap, zingers or rhythm it 
needs to woo the big audience over. But it's a weird, gorgeous treat anyway, 
lovably overdone and silly, swimming with loony, lush visual riches. When he's 
on, Boorman is like a wizard, a lover. Like Rodgers and Hart, he turns 
Manhattan, and Brooklyn too, into isles of joy.

'WHITE GIRL' A CONDESCENDING MORALITY PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, TIMES FILM EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When first-time film director Tony Brown submitted "The White Girl" to the 
movie industry ratings board nearly two years ago, he was shocked to have the 
film returned to him with an R slapped on it. After all, it was an anti-drug 
film with no strong language, no nudity and violence that was almost too tame 
for TV. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a Howard University professor who hosts his own PBS TV show, made the 
film independently for $2 million and was relying on fund-raising premieres to 
recoup his investment. An R rating would have made bookings with sensitive 
community groups tough. 
</P>
<P>
Brown won his appeal of the rating and "The White Girl" went out with a PG-13 
brand and enjoyed a long and fruitful run on the road. Now, it is being 
released commercially, where it will prove to paying customers that a bad 
movie's just a bad movie, whatever its rating. 
</P>
<P>
"The White Girl" is a morality play about a beautiful middle-class black 
student (Troy Beyer) who, because of parental pressure to succeed among whites, 
falls prey to the coke culture at a Southern college. Part sermon, part warning 
label, it's the sort of inspirational hokum that used to follow church services 
on Sunday-morning TV -- except those were more skillfully made. 
</P>
<P>
In this condescending sudser, Kim Barnes (Beyer) is a black student whose 
parents' greatest fear is that she'll fall in love with a black man. They 
encourage her to take drugs in moderation, presumably to help her fit in with 
her new upscale white friends, and she barely gets to midterms before her 
go-along, get-along black roommate Vanessa (Teresa Farley) has her whiffing 
cocaine by the gram. 
</P>
<P>
"The White Girl," which is slang for the seductive powder, turns into a 
tug-of-war for Kim's salvation, with Vanessa and her straight-from-hell druggie 
friends pulling one way and Kim's caring counselor and devastated boyfriend 
pulling another. 
</P>
<P>
However things turn out for her, it's pretty clear early on that the movie will 
not be saved.

'ANGEL TOWN' MISSES THE MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The awkward, tediously violent "Angel Town" (citywide) introduces former world 
kick-boxing champion Olivier Gruner as a new French graduate student at a 
fictional local university -- read USC -- whose martial arts skills come in 
handy when he takes on a Chicano gang terrorizing his landlady (Theresa 
Saldana), who lives in a large, run-down, turn-of-the-century house. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that some five years earlier Saldana's husband took a stand against 
gang violence in the neighborhood and paid for it with his life. 
</P>
<P>
Now the gang maintains a near nonstop harassment of Saldana's teen-age son 
(Frank Aragon) to try to force him to accept membership in the very outfit that 
murdered his father. It would seem that Gruner has arrived in the nick of time, 
yet before he's able to do his stuff effectively the gang manages to terrorize 
Saldana's mother-in-law into a fatal heart attack and rape Saldana besides. 
</P>
<P>
Writer S. Warren and director Eric Karson make no attempt to explore the gang 
phenomenon or psychology; the gang members are simply hateful figures of evil, 
the stereotypical ethnic bad guys whom the hero predictably defeats in the 
final reel. The wiry Gruner has presence, and when it comes to kick-boxers, is 
a better actor than the more monumental-looking Dolph Lundgren. 
</P>
<P>
The acting honors, however, go to Saldana, who suggests the cruel irony of the 
Chicano family who has worked hard to own its own home only to find the 
neighborhood disintegrating around it. "Angel Town" (rated R for violence) 
works up some exploitation-picture energy at the beginning, but it dissipates 
into protracted mayhem.

Art of the Odd: Steve Galloway's large, meticulously crafted new paintings are 
loaded with odd objects and goings-on that yield morality tales or fantasy 
scenarios of one sort or another. One or two are so obvious they fall flat: In 
the dusty land of "Hungry Belly," three ceramic bowls grow on slender stems 
that dangle labels reading "breakfast," "lunch" and "dinner." 
</P>
<P>
In "Migration of Light," events are more quaint and curious. A Breughel peasant 
drowses under a spreading tree, oblivious to a strange procession: A dog 
carries a piece of architecture strapped to his back and pulls a cubic video 
screen that broadcasts landscape views. On top of this portable entertainment, 
a skeleton plays the xylophone. Mingling 20th-Century technology with 
16th-Century imagery doesn't add any particular freshness to this scene, 
however. It's as if Galloway's effortless technique and runaway imagination 
make it too easy for him to embroider away to his heart's content. 
</P>
<P>
A series of small carbon pencil drawings are mostly of vaguely threatening, 
unnatural views of such things as eerily vast and empty architecture on stilts, 
a "monument" created with a hulking stack of pipes and a trio of doors standing 
mysteriously over potholes in a field. Less ambitious but more concentrated and 
without the distractions of lovely color and immaculate rendering, these images 
have a directness the other, more archly riddling images don't possess. (James 
Corcoran Gallery, 1327 5th St., to March 17.) CATHY CURTIS

<P>
Gutsy Nudes: A rounded, abstract female torso has joined Jim Morphesis' 
signature iconography of skull and crucified male torso. Less aggressive than 
earlier paintings but still gutsy, these thickly painted classic forms expound 
on life and death making repeated nods to their Surrealist and Expressionist 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
On these female forms, Morphesis' heavy black drawing line finds constraint. So 
too does the slashing brushwork that has in the past tried to dissolve the 
image into a storm of painterly abstract mark. Color on these wood panel 
paintings is lighter, full of pinks, bright yellows and greens. Pieces of 
floral wallpaper are collaged into the paint emerging unscathed from beneath 
areas of scumbled pure color. 
</P>
<P>
The paintings, however, are not mellow. Morphesis' use of line and the 
fragmenting of the abstracted female form is incisive, even angry at times. 
Various figures have gaping red chest cavities exposed above a swollen, 
pregnant belly which often manages to suggest the brittle roundness of a skull. 
Other torsos split open into jagged teeth or mutate into weird elongated faces. 
Surfaces are often rubbed raw of color and slashed so deeply that wads of paper 
clog the paint. But it is the figure's bony distortion, reminiscent of 
Picasso's fragmentation and Francis Bacon's sense of the body as meat that 
makes these images unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately floral patterned wallpaper and bright, garish, color gives the 
imagery a certain decorative trendiness. It is difficult to understand if the 
choice of color and material was meant to convey or undermine feminine 
stereotypes. However, their presence raises a lot of questions that seem 
superfluous against the power of the painted forms. (Tortue Gallery, 2917 Santa 
Monica Blvd., to March 17.) SUVAN GEER

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW: LASER DISC GAINING AS FAVORED FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first two months of 1990 have found the laser video disc continuing to make 
good on its 1989 gains. The predictions that video disc will replace 
videocassette as the consumer format of choice in the 1990s are looking better 
all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Recent events: 
</P>
<P>
* The simultaneous release this month of big pictures "Indiana Jones and the 
Last Crusade," "Lethal Weapon 2" and "The Karate Kid III" on both videotape and 
video disc. Previously, video disc debuts usually followed videocassettes by a 
month or two. Early February also saw the video disc version of "Batman." This 
software explosion may encourage more people to invest in the newer, less 
expensive video disc/compact disc/CD-V combination players. 
</P>
<P>
* Panasonic, the second-largest supplier of VCRs, has decided to get into the 
video disc-machine market. The company displayed two models at the Winter 
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January, and those models may 
be available to the U.S. public as early as June. 
</P>
<P>
* Also demonstrated at the Winter CES was the prototype of a video-disc 
recorder, the first of many that various manufacturers around the world are 
developing. One of these may be marketed as early as fall of 1991. TERRY

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: 'MUSIC FOR MAIDS': TITLE GIVES ALBUM AN EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's rare that an album's title alone is enough to persuade you to listen to 
it. But it's hard not to be intrigued by the teasing title of a new CD 
collection of Brazilian music from Rounder Records: "Brazil: Forro / Music for 
Maids and Taxi Drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Album coordinator Gerald Seligman's liner notes explain the title's origin. He 
writes: "A Brazilian friend of mine was aghast. 'Forro! You must be kidding. 
That's what maids listen to, what taxi drivers listen to.' " 
</P>
<P>
Seligman was so amused by his friend's reaction that he borrowed some of it for 
the title of this 38-minute collection of forro, which he describes as "roots 
music, the unvarnished rock and roll of the Brazilian northeast." 
</P>
<P>
As the liner notes further suggest, there is a strong similarity between the 
warm, relaxed, accordion-driven forro style (pronounced faw-RAW) and the 
equally disarming, joyful spirit of the Louisiana zydeco strains popularized by 
such artists as Buckwheat Zydeco and the late Clifton Chenier. 
</P>
<P>
"Forro is the music of choice at weekend revels which break up the hard life of 
the workers," Seligman writes. "It is played everywhere they are, even at the 
weekly fairs held throughout Brazil, where displaced northeasterners, who have 
tried to flee the poverty and governmental neglect characteristic of their 
region, meet to buy wares and drink, eat and listen to music." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the forro musicians, including some of those featured on the album, 
hold day jobs and only play on weekends or when asked. Only Jose Orlando -- of 
the artists featured on the album -- is relatively well-off, Seligman says. 
Orlando owns an amplified pickup truck that he uses as a mobile stage for 
touring. He is joined on this richly inviting collection by Toinho de Alagoas, 
Duda da Passira and Heleno Dos Oito Baixos. 
</P>
<P>
CLOSER TO HOME: If "Brazil: Forro" renews your appetite for the wonderfully 
appealing Cajun and zydeco sounds featured in the film "The Big Easy," Rhino 
Records spotlights that music in a most attractive CD titled "Alligator Stomp." 
</P>
<P>
The collection, featuring four bonus tracks, begins with Rockin' Sidney's "My 
Toot-Toot," probably the best known zydeco hit of the '80s. The tune was also 
recorded by Jean Knight, who had a Top 50 pop hit with it, and John Fogerty. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists on the 18-song, 49-minute package include Clifton Chenier, Jo-El 
Sonnier, Rusty and Doug (the Kershaw brothers), Beausoleil and Queen Ida. 
</P>
<P>
IN PRINT: Schwann has discontinued its monthly CD catalogue in favor of a 
series of new publications. InMusic is a monthly magazine that lists new 
releases -- CD, vinyl and cassette -- from all fields, pop and rock to jazz and 
classical. Besides listing the song titles and other information about the new 
releases, the magazine offers additional features, including a few reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Spectrum, the second publication, is a quarterly that lists all available pop, 
rock, county, soul and jazz albums, while Opus is a quarterly that will list 
available classical product. Both catalogues will include sound track albums 
and Broadway cast albums. InMusic sells for $2, while Spectrum and Opus costs 
$4.95 and $5.95 respectively. Information may be obtained by phoning (800) 
937-3513.

Massachusetts' highest court reinstated an order barring demonstrators from

"higher law" and continue to protest. The Supreme Judicial Court ruled 4 to 1 
that the injunction places only minimal limitations on protesters and does not 
threaten their First Amendment rights. A spokeswoman for Operation Rescue,

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL, BUT WHAT DOES IT 
MEAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Right off, I'll tell you that I don't have the answer to this urban mystery. 
</P>
<P>
All I know is that "Chanel, Dad Loves U" is being spray-painted across a wide 
swath of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintive message has been spotted on the Adams Avenue bridge over 
Interstate 15, on a freeway divider in Mission Bay Park and at a number of 
construction sites in between, particularly downtown. "Loves" is sometimes done 
with a heart. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks I put off pursuing this. I suspected that media hoaxers might be 
using a quirky name as a come-on. 
</P>
<P>
Then I read a Valentine's Day story about a couple with a 3-year-old daughter 
named Brandie. Chanel suddenly sounded more plausible. 
</P>
<P>
My colleague, Nora Zamichow, saw a "Chanel" writer some weeks back around 9:30 
p.m., putting his dark blue message on a construction fence around Symphony 
Towers. He was tall and lean and maybe wearing a sweatshirt. 
</P>
<P>
The fence has since been removed. "Chanel Dad U" then appeared on the 7th 
Avenue pavement outside Symphony Hall, and on the newspaper boxes along B 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
I asked construction workers about "Chanel." Nothing. The same with the city's 
anti-graffiti crews. 
</P>
<P>
I called the Police Department. There are no missing persons named Chanel. 
Also, no cases at the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
I called agencies working with runaways and the parents who hunt for them. 
Again, no Chanel. 
</P>
<P>
I could find no musical group or performer named Chanel. Nor any racehorse 
(Hey, wasn't Jimmy Durante's "Goodnight, Mrs. Calabash," said to be a winning 
horse at 40 to 1?). 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, less checkable possibilities: A custody battle (one 
"Chanel" is outside the Family Court building), a beloved pet, a perfume 
aficionado, a love affair with role-playing, a contemporary "Kilroy Was Here," 
and more. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's better that we not know. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Drink the Water 
</P>
<P>
Combatants in the court fight between the city of San Diego and the 
Environmental Protection Agency will tour the city's sewage stations today. 
</P>
<P>
A lunch break is included at the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant. Yummy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Club Comes to Arresting End 
</P>
<P>
If this isn't true, may I be struck by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
After Channel 10 did a story recently on a South Bay financial gambit called 
the Chairman of the Board Club, the club operator began to feel the heat. 
</P>
<P>
His pitch is that, for a mere $150, an investor can reap $27,000 as new 
investors are found. State and federal laws often take a dim view of such 
things, as the story pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
So, at a recent gathering of would-be investors in Bonita, club operator Noble 
Robinson tried to calm the waters. 
</P>
<P>
"You may have heard on television that this is illegal," he said. "If it was 
illegal, the cops would be in the audience tonight. They would arrest me, take 
me to jail and close down the club." 
</P>
<P>
You guessed the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The words were barely out of Robinson's mouth when investigators from the 
district attorney's office and an undercover cop from Chula Vista stood up in 
the audience and identified themselves. 
</P>
<P>
They arrested Robinson, took him to jail and closed down the club. He's charged 
with running a pyramid scheme, kind of a low-rent J. David &amp; Co.

2 OFFICERS TO BE TRIED IN KIDNAPING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Diego police officers were ordered Thursday to stand trial on felony 
kidnaping and robbery charges after two illegal aliens testified that the 
officers stole their money, drove them to an isolated area away from downtown 
and abandoned them. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of a two-day preliminary hearing, San Diego Municipal Judge 
Nicholas Kasimatis ruled that sufficient cause was shown for Officers Lloyd J. 
Hoff Jr. and Richard P. Schaaf to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Hoff scheduled arraignment for March 2 in Superior Court, where, if convicted, 
they could be sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything reflects these two officers worked together," the judge said. "The 
elements of kidnaping and the elements of kidnaping for robbery were shown. 
There is sufficient cause to believe they are both guilty." 
</P>
<P>
The two illegal aliens, both of whom admitted on the stand that they use 
illegal drugs, testified that they were among three undocumented workers who 
were stopped by the officers in separate incidents last August. 
</P>
<P>
Besides having their cash stolen and being taken against their will to the area 
near the railroad tracks, one of the immigrants said, Hoff struck him in the 
testicles several times with his police flashlight and pushed him into a pool 
of dirty water. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious charge against the officers -- which could bring the life 
sentences -- is one count of felony kidnaping for the purpose of robbery, in 
which Arturo Romero Garcia testified that he was taken to the railroad area and 
robbed of $35. 
</P>
<P>
A similar count was reduced to simple kidnaping after evidence indicated that 
Rolando Carrera Reyes was robbed first, then taken to the deserted area. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony in the preliminary hearing alleged that Hoff stole the money from the 
illegal aliens, beat one of them and drove the patrol car to the isolated area. 
</P>
<P>
Schaaf's primary role was described by the victims as going along with the 
events, except for one instance in which he allegedly tore up one of the 
victim's identification papers. 
</P>
<P>
Schaaf's attorney, Everett Bobbitt, argued that Schaaf should not be bound over 
for trial. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been absolutely no testimony to connect Officer Schaaf to a crime," 
Bobbitt told the judge. "They all said he did nothing. Being present and doing 
nothing to stop a crime is not a crime. The best evidence is that he was only 
present." 
</P>
<P>
But, said Craig Rooten, a deputy district attorney who is prosecuting the case, 
"He was there. He assisted in transporting these people around. He even tore up 
some of their papers. He adopted all of Officer Hoff's actions by not doing 
anything about it and taking these people off to dark areas where they were 
relieved of their money." 
</P>
<P>
Kasimatis agreed that "it's clear Schaaf's role was substantially less." But 
the judge pointed to other evidence that showed Schaaf's complicity. 
</P>
<P>
Several other officers testified Thursday that they saw two of the illegal 
aliens in the back seat of Hoff's and Schaaf's patrol car. Fingerprints taken 
from the car matched those of the immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
And, although officers are required to list in their daily logs every citizen 
contact they make while on duty, Hoff's and Schaaf's journal had no notation of 
stopping the illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys attacked the credibility of the illegal aliens. They showed 
that the immigrants were known to police, often using aliases, and several 
times lied to police detectives investigating the kidnaping and robbery 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia is serving time in jail for auto burglary. He admitted from the stand 
that he has been a heavy heroin user and was once charged with, but not 
convicted of, murder. 
</P>
<P>
Carrera Reyes admitted that he smokes marijuana. And, when he arrived in court 
to testify in the case, he was arrested on a six warrants, the most serious of 
which accused him of possession of marijuana for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The third alleged victim, identified as Ramiro Rodriguez, has disappeared since 
he complained to police that he also was robbed and kidnaped by the two 
officers. Rooten said police believe that Rodriguez has relatives in 
Watsonville, Calif., but said that Rodriguez has not been located. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd sure like to find him," Rooten said.

SILBERMAN IN S.F. HOSPITAL; NOTE RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Businessman Richard T. Silberman is recovering at a San Francisco psychiatric 
hospital after an attempt to kill himself, his wife, San Diego County 
Supervisor Susan Golding, said Thursday at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
In what Golding said was a suicide note found in her husband's Las Vegas hotel 
room, Silberman wrote her that he was innocent of federal money-laundering 
charges but wanted "to leave with some parts still unshattered," adding that 
"enough has been destroyed." Golding read from that note Thursday as she 
struggled to hold back tears. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman attempted suicide -- by swallowing an overdose of prescription 
sleeping pills -- because he felt he could not get a fair trial before U.S. 
District Judge J. Lawrence Irving, who is hearing the complex money-laundering 
case, Golding said. "He felt he could not receive a fair trial, and he did not 
want to destroy anything else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who was found unconscious in his fifth-floor Las Vegas hotel room 
two days after he abruptly vanished Feb. 15 from San Diego, is suffering from 
"severe depression," Golding said. Silberman told his family he was going to 
Orange County. Instead, police said, he flew to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Golding said she did not know how long her husband would remain hospitalized 
and offered no details of his treatment, but said he is "getting better and 
feeling better." 
</P>
<P>
A top aide to Edmund G. Brown Jr. when he was governor, Silberman was scheduled 
to stand trial April 10. Prosecutors said Thursday that they do not know 
whether Silberman's hospitalization will postpone the trial. Irving's law clerk 
said the judge could not comment on any particular cases. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, reputed mobster Chris Petti and three other men are accused of 
laundering $300,000 given them by an undercover FBI agent who allegedly had 
told them it was the proceeds of Colombian drug dealing. An FBI report released 
last Friday, the day Golding reported Silberman missing, alleges that Silberman 
confessed to the money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have filed papers asking Irving to revoke Silberman's 
$500,000 bail. A hearing on that request is scheduled for Tuesday. Golding said 
she did not know whether Silberman will attend that hearing but said he "will 
definitely be ready for trial at some point." 
</P>
<P>
Golding said she did not know how many sleeping pills Silberman took or when he 
took them. Although he remembers taking the pills, he "doesn't remember much 
about it after that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer James Brosnahan has identified the pills as Halcion 2, a 
commonly prescribed sleeping medication. Golding said the pills were "in the 
house, that we used occasionally for transcontinental flights." 
</P>
<P>
After he was found, Silberman spent the next two days, until Monday, in a Las 
Vegas hospital, where Golding, other family members and Brosnahan joined him. 
Silberman was released after he was "able to walk on his own," Golding said, 
and flew immediately to San Francisco, where he voluntarily admitted himself to 
the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute, a 70-bed UC San Francisco hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"He is getting better," Golding said. "I do not know how long he will be at 
Langley Porter. A week, two weeks, three weeks, that's for the doctors to say." 
</P>
<P>
A UCSF spokeswoman said state law bars her from providing any information about 
the psychiatric institution or its patients. 
</P>
<P>
A psychiatrist who used to work at Langley Porter, however, said Thursday that 
the institute offers both inpatient and outpatient services. Treatment varies, 
though it often involves "both medication and psychotherapy to address 
individual treatment needs," said the doctor, who asked to remain unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the inpatient adult wards are locked units and require a key to gain 
access," the doctor said. The length of time that an inpatient -- such as 
Silberman -- might stay "can vary from days to weeks, again depending on 
individual treatment considerations," the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
The institute has a nationwide reputation as being a "first-class" facility and 
is a "costly, costly place," said the psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman can leave "any time he wants," Golding said. 
</P>
<P>
The Las Vegas police officer who found Silberman also found the suicide note, 
Golding said. Though it was addressed to Golding, the officer opened it because 
"he was required to do that in the case of a potential suicide," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Randy Oaks, a Las Vegas police spokesman, could not be reached Thursday for 
comment on either the note or department policy. Detective Chuck Woodworth said 
no other Las Vegas police officer was qualified to comment on the Silberman 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Golding said Thursday she had decided to read the note at the press conference 
and to make it available to reporters because there had been "a lot of 
speculation" about whether Silberman had tried to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
The note is dated Feb. 15, the last day Silberman was seen in San Diego and 
also the day Las Vegas police said Silberman checked into the Las Vegas Hilton. 
It is written on that hotel's stationery. 
</P>
<P>
In the version Golding distributed, she had blacked out several names she 
didn't want publicized. 
</P>
<P>
The second paragraph says, "I am innocent. Petti and Benjamin," an apparent 
reference to key government informant Robert Benjamin, "know the truth -- no 
drugs, no drug money -- no make believe drug money -- just the opposite. It's 
too bad Judge Irving believed the FBI. His conclusions today are sadly wrong." 
</P>
<P>
In an opinion issued that day, Irving rejected a defense request to block the 
introduction of FBI testimony about comments Silberman made to several agents 
after his arrest last April and characterized those comments as 
"self-incriminating." 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Brosnahan has repeatedly maintained that the judge's 
characterization convinced Silberman that Irving had overstepped his authority 
and could not be fair, prompting Silberman's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman took "nothing with him" to Las Vegas except a satchel that contained 
a newspaper article that mentioned Irving's comment, Golding said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before he left last Thursday, Silberman transferred a "sizable sum of 
money" -- the proceeds from the sale of one of his houses -- from an account he 
controlled to an account to which Golding has access, prosecutors said in the 
legal brief they filed Tuesday. Sources have told The Times that the amount may 
be as high as $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Golding maintained Thursday that she didn't think there was "any connection" 
between the transfer and Silberman's disappearance. She also said the couple 
has "no financial problems whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Golding also said she would be in San Francisco, at Silberman's side, for about 
a week before she returns to her duties with the county board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Note on Hotel Stationery Tells Wife to Thank Friends 
</P>
<P>
This is the text of Richard T. Silberman's letter to his wife, found by police 
in his Las Vegas hotel room Saturday afternoon. San Diego County Supervisor 
Susan Golding, Silberman's wife, released the letter to reporters Thursday. She 
marked out some names in the text, indicated here by (blank). 
</P>
<P>

(Blank) is the best father in-law any man could have -- I have a deep love for 
him and your priceless mother -- who will always be with us. 
</P>
<P>
I am sorry our twosome couldn't go on forever -- But I want to leave with some 
parts still unshattered -- enough has been destroyed. Please remember the Best

TRANSIT CHIEFS SCRAMBLE TO FILL GAP AS AZTEC BUSES HALT SUDDENLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aztec Bus Lines, one of the county's oldest charter bus companies, has closed 
without warning, causing a scramble among county transit officials Thursday to 
replace the firm's buses on two East County routes used by about 600 people a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
The Spring Valley bus company has apparently filed for protection under the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code as a result of a National Labor Relations Board ruling 
against the company that required it to rehire 75 former employees and pay back 
wages reportedly amounting to several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec owner James Pike of Los Angeles did not return phone calls to his office 
Thursday, but, according to a company letter faxed to county transit officials 
Thursday morning, the firm has filed under Chapter 7 bankruptcy provisions and 
is no longer in business. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was the first formal notice county transit officials received about 
the closure. A bus driver tipped off county officials late Wednesday that the 
company was planning to close shortly before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
The tip sent officials on a last-minute scramble to find replacement minibuses 
for two East County routes serviced by Aztec through a contract with the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, we were not real excited" about having to find replacements 
on about four hours' notice, said Larry Watt, a principal transportation 
specialist for the county. 
</P>
<P>
One route, No. 864, carries passengers from Alpine to El Cajon, and the other, 
No. 856, takes people from Cuyamaca Community College through Spring Valley and 
Lemon Grove to the Marketplace at the Grove shopping center. Buses begin 
picking up passengers as early as 4:57 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The county contacted Community Transit Services Inc., which also has a county 
contract to provide bus service on other routes, and the company provided 
replacement buses and drivers. Watt estimated that the two lines had 90% to 95% 
service, and full service should be restored by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec entered into a contract with the county in April, 1988. The contract runs 
through June, 1991. Watt said Aztec had met its obligations under the contract 
and had provided adequate service on the two East County lines. 
</P>
<P>
Community Transit Services has agreed to a short-term, stopgap contract to 
operate the two routes. The county, Watt said, will negotiate a long-term 
contract with the company. 
</P>
<P>
People answering the phone at Aztec offices declined to comment on the closure, 
referring calls to Pike in Los Angeles. Pike, who reportedly owns and operates 
other bus lines outside San Diego, bought Aztec in late 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec was once one of San Diego's largest charter companies, with a fleet of 
buses and contracts with government agencies, providing service ranging from 
the San Diego Unified School District and unincorporated areas of East County 
to the cities of Poway, La Mesa, Santee and El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Festering problems between management and the union representing the company's 
bus drivers, however led to a long and bitter strike 10 years ago, labor 
claims, lawsuits and a retrenchment. 
</P>
<P>
The NLRB ruling calling on Aztec to rehire workers and pay back wages was made 
last July.

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN TO SECEDE FROM SCHOOL DISTRICT ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of residents living in the Eastview section of Rancho Palos Verdes have 
taken a step forward in their drive to secede from the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
The residents filed an application with the county Committee on School District 
Organization so they can begin collecting signatures. 
</P>
<P>
However, before any signatures can be solicited, the committee, the county 
Office of Education and the county engineer must approve a map delineating the 
proposed secession area. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes annexed the Eastview area in 1983, but students have 
remained in the Los Angeles district. The residents want their children to be 
in the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District. They now attend 
Crestwood Elementary School and Dodson Junior High School in Rancho Palos 
Verdes and San Pedro High School. 
</P>
<P>
Signatures must be collected from 25% of the registered voters within the 
proposed secession area.

GIRL, 16, BACKS KILLER'S STORY IMPLICATING PEARCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 16-year-old housemate of Roberta Pearce, corroborating the testimony of a 
confessed teen-age murderer, tearfully testified Thursday in Vista Superior 
Court that Pearce wanted her estranged husband killed and told the two killers 
as they left her Valley Center home, "Be careful and don't get caught." 
</P>
<P>
Mandy Gardiser, who said she moved into Pearce's home about two weeks before 
the Jan. 31, 1989, killing of Robert (Wayne) Pearce in Cardiff, said the 
42-year-old former teacher's aide offered her "a line" of crystal 
methamphetamine after Isaac Hill and Robert Pilato left to kill her husband, 
and that she then helped clean the house of beer and wine containers that might 
bear fingerprints and other forensic evidence in case police came to search it. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Gardiser said, Pearce was angry that relatives called her to 
express their sympathy over Robert Pearce's killing. 
</P>
<P>
"She'd start crying and act real sad," Gardiser said. "When she'd get off the 
phone, she wouldn't be sad any more. She said, 'I wish these people would stop 
calling me,' because she had to put on a role." 
</P>
<P>
Roberta Pearce is charged with first-degree murder and could be sentenced to 
death if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The day's most unexpected testimony came during Gardiser's cross-examination by 
defense attorney William Fletcher, who hammered away at the inconsistencies of 
Thursday's testimony with Gardiser's previous testimony about the sequence and 
timing of events. Fletcher unwittingly elicited a confession by Gardiser that, 
when she testified last year at the preliminary hearing, she was under the 
influence of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher and Gardiser were sparring over her specific recollections of 
conversations about the murder plan when, explaining the inconsistencies of her 
previous court testimony last year, Gardiser said, "I was on drugs at the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"During the preliminary hearing?" Fletcher asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you tell Mr. (Tim) Casserly (the deputy district attorney who is 
prosecuting the case) you were doing drugs?" Fletcher asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she said. "Yesterday (Wednesday)." 
</P>
<P>
"You were on drugs while under oath during the preliminary hearing?" Fletcher 
asked again. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just really nervous," she said. "I thought it would help me not be 
upset. I just thought it would help me get through it." 
</P>
<P>
Gardiser also apparently contradicted herself again Thursday, saying once that 
her recollection of events was skewed when she was interviewed by detectives 
three days after the slaying because, "at that time I was doing a lot of 
drugs." 
</P>
<P>
But, later in her testimony Thursday, she said she "was not on drugs" during 
her interview with detectives. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of Gardiser, a key prosecution witness, admitting that she was under 
the influence of methamphetamine during her preliminary hearing testimony led 
to speculation among some defense attorneys Thursday that the defense would ask 
for a mistrial on the grounds that Pearce was ordered bound over for trial on 
murder charges based on incompetent testimony. 
</P>
<P>
But other attorneys said the issue would only go to the strength of Gardiser's 
credibility as a prosecution witness and not poison the prosecution's case 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a court-ordered gag rule, neither Fletcher nor Casserly would 
discuss the development. 
</P>
<P>
There were other inconsistencies with Gardiser's testimony and that of Hill, 
who already has testified and who, along with Pilato, has already pleaded 
guilty to Pearce's murder. Gardiser testified, for instance, that she never saw 
Pilato or Hill use drugs at Roberta Pearce's home, while Hill said he smoked 
marijuana and was injected with an unknown drug by Pearce herself minutes 
before he and Pilato left to kill her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Gardiser consistently and vehemently denied that -- as the defense 
contends -- she spawned the plan to kill Robert Pearce without Roberta Pearce's 
knowledge so that she could continue to live in the Valley Center home that 
would otherwise be lost in the pending divorce.

OZONE PROTECTION DEBATE GETS OFF TO A FIERY START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The debate over whether San Diego County will regulate the emissions of 
ozone-depleting chemicals got off to a fiery start Thursday, as 
environmentalists and businessmen gathered to discuss the county's proposed 
curbs on the use of halons and chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
About 90 people attended the public meeting, at which Air Pollution Control 
District officials had hoped to field suggestions to help polish 16 draft 
proposals they had intended to present to the San Diego County Board of 
Supervisors for approval March 27. By meeting's end, however, the officials 
said they would consider postponing that date to gather more information. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the proposals would prohibit the sale of certain 
non-essential aerosol products, ban the use of foam food-packaging containers 
when alternatives are available and increase restrictions on businesses that 
work with refrigerants and solvents. 
</P>
<P>
Local environmental groups said the APCD's proposals could be tougher and more 
focused. Diane Takvorian, executive director of the Environmental Health 
Coalition, said it is not enough to rely on industries to police themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is fairly clear that all industries are not going to voluntarily 
comply," she said. "The time for study is basically over. We should take 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the automotive, electronics and firefighting industries that 
use CFCs and halons, meanwhile, said the proposals are misguided and 
under-researched. Many requested a chance to suggest revisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a county supervisor, and you should be thankful for that," said Ervin 
Rubey of the San Diego County Auto Recyclers Assn. He said he is angry that 
input from the affected industries had not been solicited earlier. "If I were 
and, you brought this intellectual vomit to me, I would throw it back in your 
face." 
</P>
<P>
Al Thornton, a spokesman for Great Lakes Chemicals Corp., a Louisiana-based 
halon manufacturer, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people here have written that March date down and intend to 
show up with their guns," he said, referring to the planned March 27 
presentation to the county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
By the workshop's end, APCD officials said they would consider postponing their 
presentation in order to hold a second workshop with those industries that 
would be most affected by the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
But Paul Sidhu, a deputy director of the APCD, chastised those industry 
representatives who are "saying San Diego shouldn't do anything because their 
efforts will not solve the problem. It's a collective effort. You can't just 
pass the buck." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the idea is to close businesses down," he added. "But, if there 
are alternatives, we want you to use them." 
</P>
<P>
CFCs are widely used as a coolant in refrigerators and air-conditioning units 
and as a solvent in industrial processes. Halons are used exclusively in 
firefighting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Many scientists agree that both CFCs and halons have caused severe depletion of 
the Earth's atmospheric ozone layer that, if allowed to continue, could cause 
more skin cancer cases and gradual global warming.

TUCKER'S SURPRISE: PUPPET PULLS HIS OWN STRINGS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: VOTERS AND LEGISLATORS ARE GETTING USED TO THE IDEA THAT THE YOUNG 
ASSEMBLYMAN ISN'T A CARBON COPY OF THE MAN HE SUCCEEDED: HIS FATHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he settled into the late Curtis Tucker's Assembly seat last year, Curtis 
Tucker Jr. had some surprises in store for his father's allies. 
</P>
<P>
The National Rifle Assn., accustomed to the elder Tucker's longtime support, 
discovered to its dismay that the new assemblyman is a firm advocate of gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
And death penalty opponents learned that the Inglewood Democrat, unlike his 
father, strongly supports putting California's gas chamber to work. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tucker reached the state Assembly largely on the strength of his 
father's name, he appears determined to chart his own political course. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are beginning to realize that Tucker's dad is no longer 
around," the 35-year-old assemblyman said. "Just as they had to get used to 
him, now they have to get used to me." 
</P>
<P>
This independence is certain to complicate the already longshot candidacies of 
the two men planning to run for Tucker's 50th District seat this year -- 
Democrat Matthew Olds and Peace and Freedom Party candidate Michael Long, both 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Tucker has inherited two key advantages: name recognition and 
fund-raising connections. These helped him capture 71% of the vote in a special 
election last February, four months after his father, a 14-year incumbent and 
chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, died in office at 70. 
</P>
<P>
But by establishing his own political identity, Tucker has begun peeling away 
the image of him that opponents painted last year: that of a puppet of the 
Sacramento power brokers who helped engineer his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more than his father's son," said state Assemblyman John Burton (D-San 
Francisco), a death penalty opponent who chairs the Assembly's Public Safety 
Committee, a heavily lobbied panel to which Tucker was appointed this year. 
"He's his own man. He's carving out his own area." 
</P>
<P>
It is no wonder that opponents questioned Tucker's autonomy, however: He 
reached the Assembly in a process more akin to a coronation than a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker says he decided to enter the political world in 1983, after working for 
five years as a cable splicer and cable splicing supervisor for Pacific 
Telephone. 
</P>
<P>
A 1980 graduate of Cal State Dominguez Hills, he had hoped to study law while 
continuing to work for the phone company, but he says he quit his job after 
getting into a conflict with his supervisor and drawing an unwanted transfer to 
Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
His father -- whose dream, Tucker says, was to be succeeded by his son in 1990 
-- immediately helped land him a job in the Wilshire district office of 
Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I was ready to make the move, and the next thing I knew I was 
interviewing with Roos," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
After a four-year stint handling constituent issues for Roos, Tucker 
transferred to the Crenshaw District office of Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los 
Angeles) in 1987 to do similar work. The move was made, Tucker says, because 
his father thought it would be politically wise to get him closer to the 50th 
District. 
</P>
<P>
When the elder Tucker died of liver cancer on Oct. 9, 1988 -- and then beat a 
Republican in the first posthumous legislative victory in state history -- the 
political machinery began churning in earnest on his son's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian rescheduled the special election from April to February 
at the request of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who stood to 
gain a key 41st vote in the 80-member Assembly with a Tucker win. And Brown 
threw his endorsement and a full complement of campaign resources behind 
Tucker, shooing away several strong Democratic candidates and overwhelming the 
Republican and two Democrats who remained in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, buoyed also by a deathbed transfer of $28,000 in campaign cash from his 
father and thousands more from medical industry contributors to the elder 
Tucker's campaigns, won big. For some, the manner of the victory still rankles. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the money that came down from Sacramento, it was hard for people like 
me, who had no money, to withstand it," said Inglewood School Board member Lois 
Hill-Hale, one of the Democrats Tucker defeated. "The money allowed him to send 
out more mailings than anyone. Plus the fact that Willie Brown shortened the 
campaign time." 
</P>
<P>
Since taking office, Tucker has kept a low profile compared to many other 
members of the Assembly's freshman class. He has gotten only half a dozen bills 
enacted, most of them technical bills requested by state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, freshman Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo) attracted broad 
attention with a number of bills, including a measure -- now law -- requiring 
newly elected state officials to disclose all income received during the 12 
months before taking office. 
</P>
<P>
Olds, one of Tucker's would-be opponents, says 50th District voters are 
interpreting this as inaction. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the man," said Olds, a 26-year-old registrar at a Glendale trade 
school. "But in the community there's a lot of resentment. People don't think 
he's doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
Others disagree. They point to evidence that Tucker has not remained hidden in 
his father's shadow. Since taking office, he has staked out his own turf on 
several key issues. 
</P>
<P>
An example is his consistent support for gun control legislation, including 
last year's bitterly contested ban on military-style semiautomatic assault 
weapons. Reviewing Tucker's voting record, NRA lobbyist Brian Judy does not 
hide his dismay. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the 10 votes we used to track gun-control issues (last year), he voted for 
gun control and against the NRA position on all 10," Judy said. "It is a 
disappointment. His father was consistently against gun control." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker has also turned heads by pronouncing himself a firm supporter of capital 
punishment. He has said he would endorse applying the death penalty to 
murderers as young as 14. Like his gun-control votes, such stands might prove 
popular to some in his district, parts of which are buffeted by high crime 
rates and gangs. But they buck the views of the two men most responsible for 
helping him into office -- his father and Speaker Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain his position, Tucker cites the escalation in violent crimes in 
the Los Angeles area, and his belief that capital punishment would be meted out 
evenhandedly. 
</P>
<P>
"My father grew up in the South, and he saw that the system didn't always work 
for blacks," Tucker said. "In today's society, with all the counterbalances, 
with all the TV and newspaper accounts, I don't think you're going to have the 
mishandling of justice you had back in the '30s, '40s, '50s and '60s." 
</P>
<P>
He says changing times also justify the execution of younger criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids nowadays that are committing crimes are not committing your basic 
childhood 'Let boys be boys' crimes," he said. "We're seeing rapes, murders, 
aggravated assaults, burglaries, armed robberies. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no fear of any retribution. I think if they commit the crime, they 
should serve the same penalties that an adult would serve." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker's most recent display of independence came last month in the Public 
Safety Committee. He joined three Republicans and another Democrat to provide a 
five-vote majority for a bill that would all but ban the sale of graphic 
pornography from sidewalk vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
The action came despite strong opposition from Burton, who called the measure 
"garbage." The legislation later cleared the Assembly, and is now before the 
Senate Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that Tucker will have a tough time holding an independent 
course in the Public Safety Committee. The panel often handles controversial 
issues such as pornography and criminal sentencing, which can put 
conservative-leaning committee members at odds with liberal Democrat leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Said a lobbyist who regularly appears before the committee: "It's a tough 
committee for a rookie Democrat to be on." 
</P>
<P>
Burton, however, downplays his differences with Tucker. He points to the 
hard-line conservatism of Tucker's predecessor on the panel, Gary Condit 
(D-Ceres), who last year won a special election for the congressional seat 
vacated by Tony Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at who he replaced on the committee," Burton said. "There's 
no way in the world that his vote will be farther away from mine than Gary's 
was." 
</P>
<P>
Although Tucker has yet to get major legislation passed, he has introduced 
several bills that could attract attention in this year's session. 
</P>
<P>
One would ban the bulk use in populated areas of hydrogen fluoride, the acutely 
toxic chemical used in the South Bay by a refrigerant manufacturing plant and 
two oil refineries. Concern about the chemical has grown since an undetected 
buildup of hydrofluoric acid, the liquid form of the chemical, caused a 1987 
explosion and fire at the Mobil Oil refinery in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Another of Tucker's bills would create a pilot child-development program, 
providing health care, counseling, tutoring and other services for needy 
students at six California elementary schools that would be designated if the 
bill becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
A third, aimed at discouraging gang violence, would require that court 
proceedings involving minors who are charged with serious crimes be open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
And a fourth would assign a team of drug-sniffing dogs to each of California's 
prisons to regularly search cells, prison grounds and visitors' vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker acknowledges that attracting backing for such measures may mean bowing 
to the wishes of legislative leaders on other issues. But at no time, he vows, 
will he stop speaking, and voting, his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to be a troublemaker," Tucker said. "I'm not trying to be a 
wild card. I'm just doing my job."

POLICE HONOR 9 OFFICERS IN FOOTHILL NARCOTICS UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of northeast San Fernando Valley narcotics officers, honored Thursday 
at an awards ceremony, said they oppose using barricades to curtail drive-by 
narcotics traffic, as is being done in Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
"There will never be a need to put up barricades to keep out drug dealers in 
Pacoima and other areas of the Foothill Division," Sgt. Cary Krebs said. "We 
have found we can rid the neighborhoods of drug dealers by being out there day 
and night busting people." 
</P>
<P>
Krebs heads a narcotics unit composed of nine officers who Thursday were 
awarded medals by Police Chief Daryl F. Gates during the Los Angeles Police 
Department's 11th annual Recognition Day ceremony in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
They were among 105 police officers and civilian employees honored for bravery 
in acts ranging from battling drug traffic to calming a suicidal woman to 
attempting to save a drowning woman who had driven a Jaguar car into her 
Brentwood swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Krebs' unit, the only one of its kind in the city composed of patrol officers 
instead of detectives, has arrested nearly 1,000 dealers since its inception 
almost two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need barricades," said Mike Cherry, one of the officers in the 
Foothill narcotics unit. "If Van Nuys and Devonshire did what we did, we'd all 
drive drug dealers out of the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
It was police officers from the Devonshire Division who proposed in November 
setting up roadblocks around a 30-square-block area in Sepulveda. The 
barricades were erected late last year with the support of the Los Angeles City 
Council, which voted to keep them up as long as police deem necessary. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Devonshire Police Capt. Mark D. Stevens said the barricades were 
necessary because traditional police methods, such as foot patrols, had failed 
to stem the tide of drive-by drug traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The barricade concept -- believed to be the first such effort on a large scale 
in the country -- has not prompted any organized opposition in Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
Police credit the roadblocks with dramatically reducing crime and have used 
them in parts of South-Central, Koreatown and Pico-Union as well. 
</P>
<P>
But Krebs said Thursday that the "supermarket atmosphere" in which drugs are 
openly sold in some areas of the city can be eliminated by assigning undercover 
officers to arrest drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the awards went to officers fighting drug traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jim Staugaard and management analyst Karen Frick of the North Hollywood 
Division were recognized for hiring a homeless man as a Police Department 
janitor and loaning him money to buy food. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt Weeks, the man they helped, said he feels fortunate to earn $351 a 
week in take-home pay as a department custodian. "I had 42 cents and no place 
to sleep when they helped me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven officers received medals for acts of bravery and service. Officer 
Karen L. Kubly, the only woman to receive a medal for bravery, had used Spanish 
she had learned in the Police Academy to calm a 67-year-old intoxicated woman 
until her partners could grab the woman from the edge of a Hollywood apartment 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
And Officer John Lopata was honored for diving into a Brentwood swimming pool 
to rescue an 81-year-old woman whose blue Jaguar had sunk to the bottom. The 
woman died despite Lopata's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary," said Lopata, who moved to Los 
Angeles from Chicago in 1970. "I didn't even tell my wife about it."

CRASH PILOT WAS 'CAUTIOUS,' GIFTED EX-COMBAT FLIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pedro Duran's plane was his baby. The former Marine combat pilot and two 
friends bought the Italian-made Siai-Marchetti a year ago, but it was Duran who 
flew the high-performance craft most often. 
</P>
<P>
At least twice a week he took off from Santa Monica Airport, often to perform 
aerobatic stunts over the Malibu Hills or to practice landings at Oxnard 
Airport. He spent many Saturdays at the hangar, waxing the brown and green body 
of the single-engine plane or performing ritual acts of maintenance. He was 
known as an extremely cautious pilot. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a fanatic with that plane," said Michael L. Withem, one of the plane's 
other owners. "I think he had more dates with that plane than his girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Duran's care, caution and experience, the 42-year-old medical 
consultant known by friends as P.J. was killed Wednesday when the Marchetti 
crashed in a Calabasas field. A 24-year-old flying enthusiast whom 
acquaintances identified as Cameron Duke was also killed. 
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed at 4 p.m. in a field off Lost Hills Road near Malibu Creek 
State Park. The accident is being investigated by the National Transportation 
Safety Board, but no cause is known yet, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators on Thursday were still piecing together what caused the accident. 
And friends of the pilot tried to understand how a skillful pilot like Duran 
could "auger in." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office did not release the names of the 
victims. But Withem and Stephen A. Shoop, the third owner of the plane, went to 
the crash site Wednesday and identified the victims as Duran and Duke, both of 
West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Withem and Shoop, also former military pilots, described Duran as a gifted 
pilot who had more than 5,000 hours of flying experience. He had survived being 
shot down twice in Vietnam and had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so incredibly cautious . . . He is just the last guy I ever expected 
this to happen to," Shoop said. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably will never know what happened," Withem said. "This was a guy who 
flew F-4 Phantoms in Vietnam, was a very highly decorated Marine pilot." 
</P>
<P>
Shoop and Withem disputed statements by witnesses who said the pilot leaped 
from the plane as it began to plummet after developing engine problems during 
an aerobatic maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
Shoop, who was at the crash site before the victims were removed, said Duran's 
body was found burned in the wreckage. Duke's body was about 20 feet from the 
crash site. Both victims were wearing parachutes that had not been opened. 
</P>
<P>
Shoop said a torn seat belt was still around Duran's body, suggesting that he 
was still in the pilot's seat at impact. Shoop said that if someone tried to 
jump from the plane, which had a side-by-side seat configuration, it probably 
was Duke. 
</P>
<P>
"P.J. would never have abandoned a passenger," Shoop said. "He may have ordered 
his passenger to attempt to jump, but he would have never abandoned him." 
</P>
<P>
An NTSB spokesman said investigators had not determined if anyone had jumped 
from the craft. 
</P>
<P>
Shoop and Withem said the $181,000 Marchetti was designed 10 years ago to be 
used as a military fighter plane but was instead sold to private pilots. Though 
not outfitted with weapons, the plane had instrumentation that included 
switches for engaging guns and dropping bombs from wing racks. The body paint 
was still the original military green and brown camouflage. 
</P>
<P>
Duran had met Duke at the Santa Monica Airport, where it was believed the 
younger man was taking flying lessons, Withem said. He often flew with Duran 
when Withem and Shoop were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was an empty seat, P.J. would take someone," Withem said. "On this 
day there was an empty seat, and Cameron took it."

STATE CHECKS TOXIC WASTE HAULERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trucker Jeff Rodriguez was not bothered about being delayed an hour at the 
Castaic weigh station as authorities checked to see that his transport papers 
were in order and that his truck was equipped to haul the load of hazardous 
waste it was carrying. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get upset," Rodriguez said as state Department of Health Services 
officials pored over his transport documents and inspected his truck at the 
weigh station on the Golden State Freeway in Castaic. "It's part of the job. 
You get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was one of more than 50 truckers hauling hazardous waste materials 
who were pulled over Wednesday and Thursday at the weigh station just north of 
Magic Mountain Parkway and checked to see if they were improperly transporting 
hazardous waste, said Richard Varenchik, a Department of Health Services 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the inspectors donned protective gear before crawling under or on top 
of the big rigs to check for leaks and to take samples of the cargo that would 
later be tested to determine if there was any mixing of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
During the two days of inspections, 12 citations were issued, mostly for 
expired hauling permits, Varenchik said. 
</P>
<P>
But Paul M. Baranich, a hazardous waste specialist who participated in the 
inspections, said the presence of the inspectors was more important than the 
number of citations issued. 
</P>
<P>
"The more we're out there, the more visible we are, the more people get the 
idea that we are taking enforcement against people who violate" transportation 
laws, Baranich said. 
</P>
<P>
Baranich said his agency conducts about six to seven operations a year in Los 
Angeles County. He said the California Highway Patrol had recommended the 
Castaic weigh station for an inspection stop because it is one of the busiest 
in the state, handling more than 7,000 trucks a day. 
</P>
<P>
Like Rodriguez, most of the truckers stopped didn't seem to mind the 
inconvenience, even if citations were issued. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure they got a job to do just like I do," said Jim Wellcome, whose 
company, Pacific Environmental Management Corp., was issued a $200 fine for an 
expired hauling permit.

COUNTY PLANNERS DELAY VOTE ON DUMP EXPANSION; 
</P>
<P>
LANDFILLS: THE COMMISSIONERS DECIDE TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES TO 
THE SUNSHINE CANYON SITE. DUMP OPPONENTS CALL THE ACTION A 'PARTIAL VICTORY.'

<P>
Los Angeles County planning commissioners Thursday postponed indefinitely a 
vote on a proposal to expand the Sunshine Canyon landfill near Granada Hills 
after a county attorney told them alternatives to the dump need closer 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
The Regional Planning Commission voted 4 to 0 to delay its decision so the 
landfill's environmental impact report can be revised to more closely examine 
other dump sites. These include Elsmere Canyon north of Sylmar and the unused 
portion of Sunshine Canyon -- which straddles the city limit -- within the 
jurisdiction of the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris Industries is asking the county to allow the Sunshine Canyon 
landfill, which now occupies 230 acres within the city, to expand onto 542 
acres of unincorporated county territory and is considering expansion onto its 
land in the city as well. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has generated opposition from environmentalists and homeowners who 
say it would destroy a valuable oak forest within an area the county has 
designated as ecologically significant. 
</P>
<P>
Dump opponents called the delay a "partial victory," especially because it came 
after the county's chief planner, James E. Hartl, had recommended the 
commissioners approve the expansion on county land. 
</P>
<P>
"It's encouraging because I don't think this project will survive the kind of 
scrutiny that is required," said Jill L. Ratner, staff attorney for Citizens 
for a Better Environment. 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris spokesman Mark Ryavec played down the importance of the delay. 
The Planning Commission asked only "to fine-tune portions of the EIR, and we're 
happy to do that," Ryavec told radio station KNX. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission appeared to be on its way toward making a decision, as 
Commissioners Clinton Ternstrom and Lee Strong said they were leaning toward 
giving Browning-Ferris a 10-year permit to dump 6,000 tons a day in the portion 
of Sunshine Canyon under county jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
But that possibility was suspended after Charles J. Moore, principal deputy 
county counsel, told the commission that the landfill's draft environmental 
impact report did not sufficiently study the feasibility of other landfill 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
"A more thorough analysis of the long-term alternatives, short-term 
alternatives and cumulative impacts needs to be done," Moore said. "A great 
deal more work needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
State law requires any development proposal that would have a significant 
effect on the environment to undergo an environmental impact investigation, 
which must be certified by the responsible government agency and must 
thoroughly study alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The county's general plan also requires the consideration of alternatives 
whenever development is proposed in an area deemed ecologically significant, 
such as Sunshine Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said the potential for starting new landfills, reopening or expanding 
dumps and dumping on the part of Sunshine Canyon within the city of Los Angeles 
were not adequately discussed by the environmental report. County planners have 
recommended that the city be shut out of the expanded Sunshine Canyon dump on 
county land unless the city permits dumping on the part of the canyon within 
city limits. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the county has yet to complete an environmental review of five 
possible new landfill sites: Blind Canyon, Browns Canyon, Elsmere Canyon and 
Towsley Canyon in the county's jurisdiction, and a landfill in Mission, Rustic 
and Sullivan canyons in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's suggestion about other sites prompted Strong to note that those sites 
have opponents who are "already gearing up to fight them," making their 
eventual approval uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Jack R. Michael, the county's special assistant for waste management programs, 
said the county's best strategy is to create as much landfill space as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The alternatives are all the sites, in the ideal," Michael told the 
commission. "Let's provide that resource. We can control ultimately whether it 
is used or not." 
</P>
<P>
But Ratner, of Citizens for a Better Environment, said outside the hearing room 
that the intent of state environmental law is not to allow individual projects 
to be "rammed through piece by piece." 
</P>
<P>
"That is what is going on here," Ratner said. 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors will make the final decision about the proposed 
landfill expansion.

'STREET KID' ACCUSED OF HELPING WIFE KILL ESTRANGED HUSBAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old "street kid" was arrested on suspicion that he helped a Sun 
Valley woman stab her estranged husband to death while he slept, then attempted 
to make the killing appear to be the work of an intruder, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Thomas Moore, 18, was scheduled to be arraigned today in San Fernando 
Municipal Court on a charge of murder for financial gain for allegedly helping 
Mary L. Kellel-Sophiea kill her husband, Gregory Kellel-Sophiea, in his Sun 
Valley home. 
</P>
<P>
She called police at 3 a.m. on Jan. 31 and reported that her husband had been 
stabbed to death in his bed. She told police she had been asleep in another 
bedroom with the couple's 6-year-old daughter and had not heard the intruder. 
</P>
<P>
Police found pry marks on a door to the house, but said inconsistencies in the 
woman's statements led to her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Kellel-Sophiea stabbed her husband while he was sleeping, then 
tried to cover her tracks by making the slaying appear to have been committed 
during a break-in. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's fingerprints were also found in the house, and he was arrested Tuesday. 
Police said Moore, whom they described as a "street kid," knew Kellel-Sophiea 
and helped her murder her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Police refused to elaborate on their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
But Kellel-Sophiea's attorney, Leslie H. Abramson, denied that her client knew 
Moore, and said that he was solely responsible for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"She has never seen him before in her life. He is a complete stranger," 
Abramson said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was clearly a burglary, and I guarantee you that this woman had nothing 
to do with this." 
</P>
<P>
Kellel-Sophiea pleaded not guilty earlier this month to a first-degree murder 
charge in San Fernando Municipal Court, and was free on $150,000 bail awaiting 
a preliminary hearing. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig R. Richman said the 
prosecution will ask that she be re-arraigned on a charge of murder with the 
special allegation that she killed for financial gain and will ask the judge to 
revoke her bail. 
</P>
<P>
Mary and Gregory Kellel-Sophiea had separated shortly before the killing, and 
she and her daughter were living in the Long Beach area. The night of the 
killing, she went to the couple's home to sign papers allowing her husband to 
sell the house, police said, and decided to stay overnight in a separate 
bedroom.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OPERATOR FINED OVER ODORS AT LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of the Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley was ordered Thursday to pay a 
$2,450 fine and donate $10,000 to a university after the firm was convicted of 
allowing obnoxious odors to be released from the dump last spring. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was imposed by Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph Spada after the 
landfill's owner, Valley Reclamation Co., pleaded no contest to permitting the 
illegal odor emissions, Los Angeles City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
James Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Reclamation was ordered to donate $10,000 to the UCLA Occupational 
Health Center for use in training health technicians about asbestos exposure, 
according to Hahn's office, which filed the complaint against the landfill 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
The misdemeanor case stemmed from the installation of a gas collection system 
at the landfill last May. The city attorney's office said the odors were 
released because the operator failed to adequately rebury decaying garbage 
unearthed during the digging of trenches for the system.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY CITES ARCO OVER AMMONIA LEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials cited the Atlantic Richfield Corp. Wednesday, 
alleging two violations of the health and safety code for a leak of 8,000 
gallons of heavily diluted ammonia from the company's Placerita Canyon power 
plant Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Urloff, a hazardous materials specialist for the county health 
department, said the company was notified that it must test the soil and clean 
up any contamination or face criminal sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The liquid, estimated to be more than 96% water, leaked from an ammonia holding 
tank after a worker forgot to turn off a water hose running into a containment 
pod at the ARCO steam and cogeneration plant near Sierra Highway and Placerita 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
The fluid spilled over the tank and flowed down a canyon and along nearby Oak 
Orchard Road and Oakcreek Avenue into the dry bed of Placerita Creek. Many 
neighbors complained of annoying odors, but Urloff said the solution was 
probably not strong enough to cause serious environmental damages.

HAVEL: A MAN IN SEARCH OF AN IDEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the noble souls thrust into prominence in the thrilling months since 
tyranny's icy grip on Eastern Europe began to loosen, Vaclav Havel, 
Czechoslovakia's playwright-turned-president, is perhaps the greatest. This 
week he addressed a joint session of Congress. What he said concerning the need 
for a wise and enlightened U.S. approach to Soviet affairs already has been 
widely discussed. But much of his talk dealt with democracy and the 
responsibilities of, and toward, the human spirit. It bears thoughtful 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a global revolution in our sphere of human consciousness, nothing will 
change for the better in the sphere of being," Havel said. "We still don't know 
how to put morality ahead of politics , science and economy. We are still 
incapable of understanding that the only genuine backbone of all our actions, 
if they are to be moral, is responsibility -- responsibility to something 
higher than my family, my country, my company, my success. 
</P>
<P>
"When Thomas Jefferson wrote that governments are instituted among men, 
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, it was a simple 
and important act of the human spirit. What gave meaning to that act, however, 
was the fact that the author backed it up with his life. It was not just his 
words; it was his deed as well." 
</P>
<P>
Communism's bequest to Czechoslovakia, Havel said, was "a legacy of countless 
dead, an infinite spectrum of human suffering, profound economic decline and, 
above all, enormous human humiliation." But though they have been victims, 
Czechs and Slovaks feel "a sense of culpability for our former reprehensible 
passivity . . . . Democracy in the full sense of the word will always be no 
more than an ideal. One may approach it as one would a horizon, in ways that 
may be better or worse, but it can never be fully attained . . . . You, too, 
are merely approaching democracy." 
</P>
<P>
It is sobering to wonder who among our own leaders could have framed such 
thoughts? Who among them could have set them down entirely by himself, as Havel 
did. Who of them would have spoken so clearly and so fearlessly? And, yet, how 
edifying that the man who did all those things chose to do them in the very 
heart of our own imperfect American democracy.

ELECTION IN NICARAGUA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Boudreaux faults Nicaragua for having "no tradition of open and honest 
elections" ("Costa Rica's Election Furnishes a Lesson in Democracy," news 
analysis, Feb. 6). But that should be blamed on the United States and its 45 
years of support for the Somoza dynasty, not on the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
How many clean elections does it take to establish a tradition of electoral 
honesty? The 1984 Nicaraguan elections which I observed were a model of 
fairness and honesty. The Latin American Studies Assn. 15-member observation 
team declared the 1984 contest to be honest. So did other groups. This is a 
short tradition, admittedly, but a precedent has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Your staff writer says Daniel Ortega "rejected demands by the opposition to 
outlaw presidential succession." More exactly, it was the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Boudreaux says that "while Costa Rica's revolution was fought to ensure a 
multiparty democracy, the Sandinistas came to power with the intent to stay 
there as a revolutionary 'vanguard.' " But a multiparty democracy is 
functioning in Nicaragua. Seven parties are in the government. Twenty-one 
parties are in the race now. The Sandinistas came to power with the intent to 
stay there. But that is the intention of every victorious party, anywhere in 
the world.

Killing 2,000 goats on Santa Catalina is a very logical act. The balance of 
nature is necessary for the survival of all things. 
</P>
<P>
When an "unbalanced" situation occurs -- too many goats -- how divine of 
mankind to step in and set it straight. 
</P>
<P>
Using this same logic, we will notice the other "unbalanced" situation that is 
going on -- too many people -- and thus proceed in the same fashion. (Pity that 
the goats can't pull the trigger.) By reducing world population by 50%, I am 
certain that the "native grasses, shrubs and animals -- such as fox -- will be 
able to thrive." As Jane Goodall mentioned, it is "the arrogance of mankind" 
that uses one form of logic for animals and another for the human race.

HEROES NEVER PLAY A WAITING GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is the stuff of heroes? There is no scientific formula or chemical 
compound. Some heroes don't even know they have it until they are confronted 
with the crisis of fellow humans in danger. 
</P>
<P>
They just respond. Such was Vidar Anderson, the eastern Sierra volunteer 
fireman who would always be first on the scene whenever someone needed help. 
And at Convict Lake last Monday, Anderson was among the first trying to save 
four teen-agers who had ventured too far out on the thin ice and plunged into 
the frigid waters. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, this was Anderson's last rescue effort. Three of the boys died and 
Anderson himself disappeared in the dark waters. In all, seven perished. 
Anderson did not stop to measure personal risk. The kids needed him and he gave 
of himself -- all there was to give. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only so many of those kind of guys around," a friend said of 
Anderson. Another of those kind was U.S. Forest Service employee Clay Cutter, 
31. Cutter's wife Terry was not surprised that he would risk -- and lose -- his 
life for others. He would not have had it any other way, she said. 
</P>
<P>
And there was Cris Baitx, who managed to survive. Baitx said he knew they 
should wait until more rescuers arrived with the proper equipment. But there 
could be no delay: "Just watching those heads bobbing up and down was too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
One thing about heroes: They don't ponder the odds or wait for more help when 
they know that wasted minutes can mean lost lives. That's the real right stuff.

MONEY PROBLEMS FROM BIRTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crisis that has overtaken obstetric facilities serving the poor in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties has a single cause: the under-funding of Medi-Cal, 
the state and federal program that provides health services to many of the 
nation's low-income families. Sadly, there is no cheap, shortcut solution. As 
long as the under-funding continues, the health and safety of thousands of 
newborns and their mothers will be in peril. 
</P>
<P>
Some additional private hospitals have said they would accept Medi-Cal 
obstetrics cases, but only obstetrics cases, to help ease the burden. That 
would do more harm than good. It would undermine the hospitals that contract 
with Medi-Cal to provide full service. It would also risk the continuum of care 
that should include prenatal and postpartum services to both mother and child. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have negotiated two special arrangements to ease the crisis. In 
Los Angeles County, overflow contracts have been approved so that the county is 
able to divert 1,190 births a year to two dozen private hospitals, and the 
program will be expanded. That still leaves county hospitals with an annual 
volume of more than 38,000 births. In Orange County, where the hospital at UC 
Irvine was being forced to divert patients at times of overcrowding, a 
transitional contract has been signed with AMI Garden Grove Hospital covering 
pregnancy-related care. But in the Santa Ana-Irvine area, five of the eight 
hospitals do not have Medi-Cal contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But special arrangements provide only marginal relief and do not address the 
fundamental funding problem. Furthermore, the Medi-Cal funding problem impacts 
the entire health system as hospitals and doctors compensate by increasing the 
billings to other patients. 
</P>
<P>
In California, 40% of the obstetric hospital days are funded by Medi-Cal. That 
places a heavy strain on contract hospitals because Medi-Cal fees cover, on 
average, only 61% of costs, according to the California Assn. of Hospitals and 
Health Systems. As a result, one-third of the state's hospitals refuse Medi-Cal 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Overwhelming case loads have developed at many of the major public facilities, 
including the four acute-care Los Angeles County hospitals and UC Irvine, the 
principal public facility in Orange County. Women's Hospital at Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center, designed to handle 15,000 deliveries a year, had 
more than 18,000 births last year, accounting for 1 in every 200 births in the 
nation. The overload inevitably has led to mistakes and delays that have 
resulted in brain injury and other serious problems for some patients. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has been made more difficult by the refusal of many obstetricians 
to accept Medi-Cal patients. The refusals have continued despite recent 
increases in Medi-Cal fees covering pre-natal care and delivery that bring the 
fees close to those under contracts with private insurers. 
</P>
<P>
As state officials move toward mandatory health-insurance legislation, the 
crisis in Medi-Cal obstetrics cannot be ignored. Drafts of the legislation 
under consideration in Sacramento propose increasing the use of Medi-Cal. But 
the obstetrics crisis raises anew fundamental doubts about the ability of 
Medi-Cal to provide appropriate medical care. Any expansion of Medi-Cal, 
without full funding, would only worsen the already troubled health-care 
system.

A fugitive from a 1988 methamphetamine sting was arrested Thursday by U.S. 
marshals. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bateman had been indicted in January, 1989, as part of a Drug 
Enforcement Administration sting operation that closed down 23 methamphetamine 
labs in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Bateman was one of about 100 people videotaped buying chemicals to make the 
drug at the Triple Neck Scientific chemical company in Kearny Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Bateman, 42, was indicted for conspiracy to possess methamphetamine with intent 
to distribute, but he was never arrested, said a deputy U.S. marshal. The 
deputy said that agents developed information that Bateman was living at 13315 
California 67 in Lakeside. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. marshals, accompanied by sheriff's deputies, surrounded the house about 11 
a.m. and arrested Bateman, along with two others, who were arrested on 
suspicion of illegal possession of weapons and methamphetamine equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they found several guns and laboratory equipment used to 
produce the drug inside the house.

<P>
Aguirre was last seen alive about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday, when his housemate and 
her daughter left the home in the 100 block of Via de Laurencio to drive their 
housekeeper home, said Deputy Robbie Arff. 
</P>
<P>
When they returned about 11 p.m., they found Aguirre lying on the living room 
floor with a gunshot wound to his head. 
</P>
<P>
Arff said that there was no sign of forced entry or struggle. The front door 
was ajar and the back door was open, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre had reported a burglary in the home about a month ago, Arff said. She 
said that "a significant amount of money" had been stolen at the time. The

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The school board will decide at Wednesday's meeting the future of the former 
Carlsbad High School teacher's aide previously accused of selling steroids to 
three students. 
</P>
<P>
The eight charges against Gregory Tirona of selling a controlled substance were 
dismissed Tuesday after a jury hung 11-1 in favor of acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
Tirona has said he wants to return to the school, where he taught a class for 
suspended students. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Ed Switzer said the board may choose either to retain 
Tirona or refer him to the school's personnel commission for a termination 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"As a board member I think I have a strong obligation to protect kids, but by 
the same token, I don't want to falsely accuse an employee," Switzer said.

THIS WAR IS NO WAY TO PROTECT CHILDREN; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: THE PROBLEMS WILL BE COMPOUNDED IF WE FAIL TO SEE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AS AN 
UNPRECEDENTED HEALTH CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK RIDLEY-THOMAS, Mark Ridley-Thomas is executive director of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
By most accounts, the No. 1 crisis facing American cities is drug abuse. "For 
about 75 years," writes Howard Moody in the journal Christianity and Crisis, 
"we've been trying to prevent some of our citizens from using, abusing, 
importing and selling opiates and euphoriants. So far, the only real effect is 
more addicts, more drugs and more murder and mayhem on the 'mean streets' of 
our cities and, more recently, in our small towns." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, there have been about 750,000 drug-related arrests 
nationwide. Interestingly, 75% of them were not for dealing and selling, but 
for possession. Federal as well as local law-enforcement efforts are largely 
aimed at reducing demand. While this is certainly appropriate, failing to 
recognize that demand constitutes an unprecedented public-health crisis rather 
than a law-enforcement monopoly will only compound current problems. Public 
policy on addiction and abuse must be radically refocused. A federal report 
fingers street-gang members, often the victims of economic deprivation and 
inadequate education, as the entrepreneurs of the underground crack economy. 
</P>
<P>
Members of state and federal courts felt compelled recently to comment that the 
overburdened courts should be among the last resorts in the fight against 
drugs; they call for much more education, treatment, early intervention and 
research. Indeed, this addresses the demand issue in a more effective way. The 
punitive approach is too costly and reaps too few positive results. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is particularly sensitive for the California Supreme Court, which 
recently ruled against a mother whose child was born addicted to illegal drugs. 
With this attempt to protect the child, the court has cleared the way for the 
denial of custody to a mother who abuses drugs. 
</P>
<P>
This has far-reaching implications for the health-crisis dimension of drug 
abuse, documented by a recent report on infant mortality and low-birth weights. 
At a time when infant-mortality rates are declining nationwide, they are 
increasing in Los Angeles County. This phenomenon is most apparent among 
African American women and is traceable to the rise in crack cocaine addiction 
and the shortage of obstetric and prenatal care. The percentage of babies born 
weighing less than 5.5 pounds -- a key predictor of mortality and disability -- 
rose 17% overall and 32% among African American women in the county. 
</P>
<P>
This situation looks even grimmer in view of the paucity of services for 
addicted mothers. The possibility of the courts' removing children from 
addicted mothers only makes matters more ominous; as many as 2,500 drug-baby 
cases could enter Los Angeles-area courts annually. In the rush to criminalize 
everything and everyone associated with illicit drug use, Los Angeles could 
easily become part of the latest rash of copycat criminal prosecutions of 
drug-addicted mothers charged with endangering their fetuses -- three-dozen 
women have faced this ordeal nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
For African Americans generally, the problem gets worse because of the 
disproportionately low number of treatment centers in the very communities hit 
hardest by crack. According to Karen Bass, a physician assistant and clinical 
instructor at USC, since 1986, the year of the crack explosion, more than 50% 
of the 5,312 crack-related cases in the county involved African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of these cases came from the county's Southeast Planning Area, which 
had only three community-based treatment centers and one private provider, the 
lowest number of all six county regional planning areas. 
</P>
<P>
In light of these conditions, the African American community in Los Angeles has 
taken it upon itself to organize against what appears to be an intractable 
menace. In an unprecedented two-day conference today and Saturday, every sector 
of the community will concentrate on how to confront this crisis with more 
conviction, clarity and creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Modeled after the successful Crack Cocaine and the African American Family 
Conference in San Francisco last year, this conference hopes to launch an 
extensive network of providers, community activists, corporate leaders, 
educators, social service agencies, media representatives, elected officials, 
parents, ex-users, clergy and law enforcement officials to attack this problem. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerned about one of the most serious crises to face the nation, this 
city and the African American community in particular refuse to be resigned to 
these miserable conditions and will not rely largely on a punitive approach. 
Instead, the call is for a comprehensive approach that rescues this nation from 
the catastrophic consequences of prevailing policies and arrests the problem 
that has gripped the lives of the guilty and innocent alike.

HAWTHORNE EXTENDS APARTMENT LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne City Council voted unanimously Thursday to extend by 10 months 
and 15 days a moratorium on building apartments with four or more units. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium, which took effect when it was approved at a special council 
meeting Thursday, extends a 45-day moratorium that the council approved on Jan. 
8. The action is intended to give the city time to draft construction standards 
that would decrease density and increase parking and open space. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Betty J. Ainsworth said the moratorium was prompted by residents' 
complaints about the increasing density in apartment projects throughout the 
city. The moratorium, which will run until January, 1991, applies to all 
projects currently being reviewed by the city Planning Department.

WEALTHY CITY OF BRADBURY KEEPS RUSTIC ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On foot, His Honor the mayor of Bradbury enters a tunnel of overhanging trees. 
A mourning dove coos. Small animals scurry in the underbrush. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd scarcely know that 12 million people are out there," John Richards said. 
Walking along a shaded lane, the mayor had just left his house, nestled on 
seven acres among oaks, camellias and pines. 
</P>
<P>
A molecular biologist at Caltech, Richards, 59, is a rangy man dressed for a 
Saturday of leisure: sweat pants, running shoes and a bulky cardigan sweater to 
ward off February's cool. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I like. Once you are through that gate, all the hassles of LAX 
and the professional kinds of lives that we lead, they just drop away. And you 
are here in this nice, quiet, green place." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, and surrounded by 
Monrovia, Duarte and the Angeles National Forest, is Bradbury. Locked gates 
seal off three-quarters of the two-square-mile city. The main entrance has a 
guardhouse. 
</P>
<P>
With just over 900 residents, Bradbury ranks as one of California's tiniest and 
most elite cities; one of just a handful that are totally single-family 
residential. It has no apartments or condominiums. Neither is there a gas 
station, a library, a post office or a school. Not even a news rack. And, of 
course, no traffic lights or sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't even buy a cup of coffee or a gallon of gas," said City Manager 
Dolly Vollaire, one of three city employees. 
</P>
<P>
Once, at the turn of the century, Bradbury was the domain of San Gabriel Valley 
land baron Louis Bradbury. The city's silver jubilee in 1982 featured champagne 
at City Hall, a cream-colored stucco building that once was a caretaker's 
cottage. It's the only public structure in "The City of Rural Tranquility." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor pointed out the sights: A Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house set like 
a bunker on a hillside. A luxurious horse-training farm owned by flamboyant 
evangelist Gene Scott. A five-acre cactus patch. The house where race-car 
driver Mickey Thompson and his wife, Trudy, were shot to death. (The first and 
only such incident since the city was incorporated in 1957, the 1988 killings 
robbed Bradbury of its treasured privacy.) 
</P>
<P>
Later, touring the city by car, Richards passed ancient groves of oranges, 
thick avocado trees and lush green paddocks ringed by dirt tracks and white, 
wooden fences. A white Rolls-Royce motored slowly by on a narrow, winding 
asphalt road. The wind carried the distinct scent of horses. Some famous 
thoroughbreds, including Secretariat, have made Bradbury their home while at 
Santa Anita Park in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
A tax attorney, dressed in riding gear and astride a well-groomed mount, 
bounced by Richards' open car window. They exchanged good-mornings. Overhead, a 
red-tailed hawk circled in a robin's-egg blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
From a 360-degree vista, Richards surveyed the scene. Canyons of the San 
Gabriel Mountains gave way to inclines and then flatlands. The scent of 
chaparral filled the air. "There's downtown. At night it's gorgeous from here: 
An ocean of light." Sunlight glinted off the Foothill Freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone who is wealthy wants to live here, he said. "Real estate people 
call this a specialty market. . . . It's not the Beverly Hills entertainment 
kind of community with people trying to one-up each other." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury consistently ranks among the nation's 10 most expensive suburbs. Much 
of that can be attributed to zoning that requires large lots. In one 
neighborhood, a single-family house must sit on at least five acres.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: LA JOLLA STEAKHOUSES: ONE SIZZLES, ONE FIZZLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many epitaphs were written in the 1980s for the all-American steak and for the 
all-American steakhouse, but as yet the demise of neither seems imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Two new steakhouses recently opened in the La Jolla area, the consummately 
beefy P.J. Wolf in the Golden Triangle's trendy Aventine development and the 
more modest Prime Steakhouse in a La Jolla Boulevard location that over the 
last few years has been occupied by a succession of eateries. 
</P>
<P>
P.J. Wolf -- a compound of the names of proprietors P.J. Macaluso and Bill 
Wolf, who also operate the brand new Paparazzi next door and La Jolla's hugely 
successful Manhattan -- may do the best job yet of defining for San Diego the 
nature of the traditional, big-city steakhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Although it hardly needs mentioning that the beef at this sort of place is 
expected to be excellent, the steaks form the centerpieces of meals that must 
include other simple but hearty foods. Potatoes prepared with great attention 
are essential, and the menu also should include creamed spinach (only fresh 
spinach need apply), robust salads and desserts rich enough to knock out any 
appetites still left standing after so Brobdingnagian a dinner. P.J. Wolf meets 
these requirements quite handily and adds several refinements of its own, 
including a good daily selection of fresh fish and a few preparations that 
leaven traditional steakhouse lavishness with Italian kitchen sense. 
</P>
<P>
Macaluso contributes the Italian accents to the cooking and has even gone so 
far as to swab the prime, aged, Iowa-fattened steaks with melted garlic butter, 
which may seem an outrage to those raised under the impression that the best 
steaks are susceptible to salt and pepper only. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the butter adds a velvety richness to meat that -- in the case of an 
exceptional New York strip -- already is so tender that it seems to melt 
between the teeth. This particular cut is the restaurant's grandest, with the 
exception of a Porterhouse served for two. This steak should be a good 
challenge to almost any appetite, and there is victory in defeat for anyone 
unable to finish it, since the leftovers translate into fine sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
The menu does not list many steak choices; besides the New York and Porterhouse 
cuts, there are top sirloins, rib eyes and small and large filets mignon. 
Rather daringly for these parts, the menu excludes prime rib, and declines to 
list items such as lamb, veal and pork chops. There may be a beef special of 
the day, however, such as a recently offered variant on pepper steak that 
doused a pair of small, buttery filets with an excellent brown sauce flavored 
with green peppercorns and brandy. 
</P>
<P>
Among seafood offerings are crab-stuffed shrimp; a Mediterranean-style stew of 
lobster, shrimp and clams in tomato; such daily fish as salmon and halibut and 
Australian lobster tail, something of an aberration for this menu, since beasts 
from Maine would better suit the P.J. Wolf style. 
</P>
<P>
Another requisite for the big-city steakhouse is that it be expensive, a 
requirement that takes some of the fun out of the experience but is nonetheless 
inescapable. P.J. Wolf meets this criterion just as successfully as it does the 
others; starters run from $4 to $8.50, and steaks and seafoods from $16.95 to 
$29.95. The strictly a la carte menu also requires that garnishes be ordered 
separately, but softens this rule by serving portions that in most cases can be 
shared. 
</P>
<P>
Garnish choices include a massive platter of mixed steamed vegetables, sauteed 
or creamed broccoli or spinach, sauteed mushrooms and several kinds of potato 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen takes a particularly nice approach with the creamed spinach, 
cooking the leaves as briefly as possible to leave a toothsome texture, and 
adding a jolt of freshly chopped garlic. The potato list includes baked and 
French fried, as well as the more interesting au gratin -- very American, very 
rich and served in a great, steaming heap -- and the thoroughly successful 
potatoes lyonnaise. This classic dish appears virtually nowhere these days, 
although it is relatively easy to make, and calls simply for cubed potatoes to 
be sauteed in one pan while sliced onions sizzle and melt in another. The two 
are then combined, and bound into a kind of savory hash with a drizzle of 
vinegar and a sprinkle of thyme. 
</P>
<P>
Starters are equally grand, and include such niceties as the DiMaggio salad -- 
a table-tossed jumble of spinach and other greens with chopped egg, bacon, 
mushrooms and such -- and the definitive shrimp cocktail, a pile of cold, 
chopped prawns enrobed in a sauce that seethes with horseradish. A novel house 
carpaccio combines paper-thin slices of raw beef with slices of lobster tail, 
the whole drizzled with olive oil; more typical are the oysters on the half 
shell, the oysters Rockefeller and the baked mushroom caps stuffed with shrimp 
and crab. 
</P>
<P>
Macaluso and Wolf have hired an Italian baker from New York to service their 
three restaurants, and the cart includes several richly indulgent offerings, 
among which the chocolate cannoli may rank as the most outrageous, and the 
langousta ("lobster") as the most clever. This last consists of overlapping 
crisp pastry rows that imitate the armored plates of a lobster's tail; when the 
crust is broken, it yields a smooth cream filling. 
</P>
<P>
New York designer Debra Natsios gave the restaurant an angular, thoroughly 
contemporary interior that is quite unlike any in San Diego, and, except for 
the fact that the tables could be better spaced, the restaurant is luxurious in 
a rather casual and modern way. A wine room hangs suspended over the dining 
room, and, besides forming a certain focus, it holds the bulk of the extensive 
list, which features good depth and a few affordable bottles in addition to the 
vintages priced for the expense-account set. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner for two with a glass of wine each, tax and tip will cost about $70 to 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla's Prime Steakhouse takes a more traditional and local approach to the 
steakhouse theme, and offers a basic, moderately priced menu that begins with 
chopped sirloin at $6.95 and progresses through top sirloin, New York strip, 
Porterhouse, filet mignon (at $15.50 the top-priced item), pork chops, 
barbecued back ribs, chicken and prime rib. 
</P>
<P>
A menu note mentions that the restaurant serves nothing less than 1-pound cuts 
of "quality cornfed beef." It had a strange way of interpreting this 1-pound 
cut in the case of a recently sampled filet, however, which unexpectedly 
arrived in the form of two broad, thin steaks. The meat was tough and 
unappealing, whereas a thick steak of the same weight might have been good. 
</P>
<P>
The accompanying french fried potatoes, conversely, were the thick-cut, skin-on 
variety, which do appeal to some diners. However, the waiter would have done 
well to issue a warning that the skins had not been removed, since these sort 
of potatoes fry up tough and are quite disagreeable. Western-style chili beans 
also garnished the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The barbecued baby back ribs, served in a generous slab, also had been dealt 
with in a perfunctory manner, and the meat was not nearly as tender as it might 
have been. 
</P>
<P>
This menu also offers several pastas, Australian lobster tail, Alaskan king 
crab and a fish of the day. A meal for two, including a glass of house wine 
each, tax and tip, should cost $25 to $45.

Caesars World Inc.: The Los Angeles-based hotel and casino company said 
second-quarter profit fell 86% to $1.4 million, primarily because of 
substantially lower win percentages at its casino operations in Nevada. Revenue 
totaled $202.9 million, down 5% from the same period a year ago. The company 
said higher casino payroll and operating costs and higher provisions for bad 
debts also affected the Nevada results.

Bank of New England Corp.: The Boston-based institution said that it lost $1.11 
billion in 1989 but that it would not immediately report fourth-quarter results 
because it was reviewing loan-loss provisions taken during the year. 
</P>
<P>
The company said on Jan. 19 that it expected a fourth-quarter loss of about 
$1.2 billion after boosting its reserves against losses to $1.65 billion. The 
bank earned $281.7 million in 1988. Banks in the region have suffered because 
of the area's slumping real estate market, but analysts say Bank of New England 
has been hurt because of aggressive lending during a construction boom in the 
mid-1980s.

The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials plunged 30 points in the last hour of 
trading Thursday after a last-minute selloff sparked by a rumor about a 
Japanese scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The closely watched index closed lower for the fourth straight session, ending 
at 2,574.77, off 8.79 points. The Dow has fallen 74.78 points since Feb. 15, 
its last gaining session. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was a strong 184.3 million shares on the New York Stock 
Exchange, compared to Wednesday's 159.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, advancing issues nearly matched declining issues in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 715 up, 753 
down and 508 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The market was sharply higher for most of the day, as investors hunted for 
bargains and drew optimism from remarks by Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan 
Greenspan. The market also benefitted from renewed strength on the Tokyo market 
and from a firming in the price of U.S. government debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon L. Smith, a managing director at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc., a 
Baltimore brokerage, said computerized sell programs linked to stock-index 
futures kicked in during the last hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
The robust advance earlier in the day was fueled partly by lessening concerns 
about inflation. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that he did not 
see inflation accelerating despite a 1.1% jump in consumer prices last month. 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer dropped 4 1/2 to 59 1/4 on renewed fears about product-liability cases

Auction Results Give Bond Prices a Lift 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose sharply as traders were reassured by the results of an auction 
of Treasury notes and by Greenspan's comments on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond, which rose 5/16 point Wednesday, picked 
up 23/32 point, or about $7.19 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield 
dropped to 8.56% from 8.64% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, down from 8/313% late Wednesday.

CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Mostly Lower Except Against Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in lackluster trading but finished 
mostly lower against other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the spotlight was fixed on the Japanese yen, which lost ground 
against most major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose to its highest level since September against the yen, which 
languished amid dimmed prospects for higher interest rates. The market had been 
expecting the Bank of Japan to raise the nation's key discount rate. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Europe, the dollar put in a mixed performance while confined to 
well-established ranges. When trading shifted to the United States, the dollar 
appeared to firm but ultimately finished lower against all major currencies 
except the yen. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.23 yen, up 0.08 yen from Wednesday's close. 
Later in London, the dollar traded at 145.90 yen. In New York the dollar 
continued to rise, closing at 146.53 yen, up from 145.50 yen on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound held steady at $1.7145. In New York it cost 
$1.7133 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.7125. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell worldwide. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for 
current delivery settled at $415.70 an ounce, down $2.30 from late Wednesday. 
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $416.20 an 
ounce, off $1.60. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $417.45 an ounce, from $418.85 bid 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Silver prices also fell. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current 
delivery slipped to $5.268 an ounce, from $5.272 on Wednesday. In London the 
metal fell to a late bid price of $5.28 an ounce, from Wednesday's $5.33.

<P>
Coffee Futures Hit 7-Month Highs 
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures prices reached seven-month highs on New York's Coffee, Sugar 
&amp; Cocoa Exchange in a rally fueled by supply worries and strong technical 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, precious metals weakened; petroleum futures rose; 
wheat and corn futures advanced while soybeans retreated, and most livestock 
and meat futures moved higher. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee futures settled 1 cent to 2.25 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in March up 1.52 cents at 91.16 cents a pound, the highest close for 
March coffee since July 21 and the highest for a near-month coffee contract 
since July 6. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts linked the advance to perceptions that high-grade coffee beans are 
becoming more difficult to obtain and speculation that more coffee-producing 
nations may be forced to cancel coffee shipments due to dwindling old-crop 
supplies and poor growing conditions for the new crop in South America. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico reportedly canceled some of its export commitments two weeks ago.

COIN SCAM: A JAPANESE GOLD MINE; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT MINTED A TRIBUTE TO THE LATE EMPEROR, IT DIDN'T BANK ON AN 
$80-MILLION SWINDLE. MAYBE IT SHOULD HAVE READ THE TV SCRIPT.

<TEXT>
<P>
Joji Abe, a reformed yakuza bookmaker, ex-convict and now a popular novelist, 
says it didn't require much imagination to conceive of the perfect 
counterfeiting crime. The Japanese government pointed the way. 
</P>
<P>
Abe took writing inspiration from the Finance Ministry's seemingly avaricious 
plan to generate quick revenue by minting a commemorative gold coin and selling 
it off to the general public -- as legal tender -- at a face value more than 
twice its actual gold content. 
</P>
<P>
The government unloaded 11 million of these coins in 1986 and 1987, 
capitalizing on swelling private wealth and a nascent fever for gold in Japan. 
Each coin contained 20 grams (0.7 ounces) of pure 24-karat gold, now worth 
about $275, and had a face value of 100,000 yen, or about $700 at current 
exchange rates. The idea was to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the reign of 
Emperor Showa (Hirohito). 
</P>
<P>
Abe figured it would be easy to share in the imperial windfall. All one had to 
do was acquire gold bullion and forge an exact replica of the coin from a mold 
of an original. He laid bare his criminal genius in a screenplay, dramatized 
last year on national television as "Gold Nugget Mission Impossible: The Urban 
Octopus Trap Master." 
</P>
<P>
Abe's scenario was a prophetic one: Japanese officialdom has been reeling for 
weeks at disclosures that a counterfeit gang operating out of Switzerland, or 
perhaps somewhere in the Middle East, succeeded in making pure gold copies of 
the Emperor Showa coin that were so perfect that the Bank of Japan redeemed at 
least 103,000 of them. 
</P>
<P>
"The forgery of that coin was inevitable -- it was so painfully obvious it had 
to happen," said Abe. "Who could resist the temptation of taking $275 to make 
$700?" 
</P>
<P>
The real-life counterfeiting apparently started in early 1988, and the coins 
flowed into Japan under the cover of ostensibly legitimate foreign exchange 
transactions. Only at the end of last month, when a clerk at a downtown Tokyo 
branch of Fuji Bank noticed a slight discoloration in the plastic seal on one 
of the bogus coins, did the scam begin to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
Intrepid Japanese investigators have since followed a trail of numismatists and 
currency speculators from Tokyo to London and to Lugano, Switzerland, a small 
town near the Italian border notorious for money-laundering. There, signs point 
toward a shady Panamanian trading company and mysterious contacts in the Arab 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Where the case will lead from now is anybody's guess, but one thing is certain: 
The Japanese government has been swindled out of about $400 for every 
counterfeit coin it redeemed. With estimates of the number of fakes in the 
central bank's vaults at 200,000 or higher, total losses could exceed $80 
million, apparently the largest coin fraud ever. 
</P>
<P>
Although Swiss authorities are cooperating in the investigation, Abe 
(pronounced AH-bay) believes the perpetrators are Japanese and that they will 
get away with it. That was the case in his television drama. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll bet they never find the people who made the coins. I'll even give you 
20-to-1 odds," Abe said. "These people are concealed behind a long chain of 
dealers and secret transactions. All it takes is for a single link in the chain 
to be broken and the police are at a dead end." 
</P>
<P>
The government, it appears, had been banking on tough criminal sanctions to 
deter forgery of the Showa coin. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum sentence for currency counterfeiting in Japan is life imprisonment, 
noted Hiroyuki Ujikane, a bureaucrat in the Finance Ministry division that 
designed the Showa coin. Other precautions were taken as well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we struck the coin we took every technical measure available to us to 
prevent counterfeiting," Ujikane said. 
</P>
<P>
But Hironori Kubo, an official with Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K., Japan's 
largest gold and platinum retailer, said the Finance Ministry made three 
serious mistakes: 
</P>
<P>
First, the 11 million they minted were far too many, making it impossible to 
keep track of the issue and giving counterfeiters a vast pool of genuine coins 
in which to float their imitations. Second, Kubo agrees with Abe that the huge 
difference between the coin's face value and gold content was an "invitation to 
fraud." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the coin's transparent plastic seal was a fussy, unnecessary detail -- 
apparently unprecedented -- that made it extremely difficult to inspect for 
microscopic flaws. The forgeries had tiny streaks, invisible to the naked eye. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth error might be characterized as bureaucratic hubris -- the assumption 
that no one would dare counterfeit the Showa coin, with its austere imperial 
chrysanthemum on the obverse and pair of pheasants on the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
Now, officials are preparing to mint yet another imperial coin, this one 
commemorating the formal accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in November by 
Emperor Akihito. (Emperor Showa, known during his lifetime as Hirohito, died at 
the beginning of 1989 after reigning 62 years). 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the coin will weigh in at 0.7 ounces and bear a face value of 
100,000 yen. But Ujikane said officials intend to strike fewer coins -- only 
3.5 million -- to maintain tighter control over distribution. They have not 
decided yet whether to seal it in plastic this time. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, the government will have little trouble selling the new Akihito 
coins. People formed long lines at banks to buy the Showa coins in 1986. Since 
then, Japan's gold rush has accelerated into a kind of mania that transcends 
mere speculation. Conspicuous consumers not only wear gold in quantity but also 
have acquired a taste for eating it. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for gold jewelry rose 20% last year to 130 tons, or more than one gram 
of gold for every man, woman and child in Japan, noted John M. Casey, a gold 
analyst in Tokyo for the French-owned brokerage W. I. Carr. He spotted 
gold-plated chocolate bars on confectionery shelves before Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that the Japanese now have so much money it's inevitable they'll 
keep picking up gold," Casey said. "But some of the things they're buying are 
insane -- solid-gold golf putters and gold-infused ramen (noodles). Gold is a 
liquidity sponge, far beyond the point of being a rational investment hedge." 
</P>
<P>
Japan regained its title as the world's largest importer of gold last year, 
again buying more than Taiwan to take in nearly 300 tons of it. That sum 
included about 13 tons of bullion coins, such as the Canadian Maple Leaf and 
the South African krugerrand. Unlike the Showa coin, the value of bullion coins 
fluctuates with the price of gold, making them unlikely targets for forgery. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the boom in demand, Japanese gold retailers are worried that the Showa 
coin scam may hurt their industry. News reports suggest sales are down sharply 
at some bullion coin outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid gold is going to get a bad reputation with all the publicity 
about the counterfeiting," said Kubo of Tanaka Kikinzoku. "On the other hand, 
if we get our message across that gold is a safe investment, it could go the 
other way. This could turn out to be good p.r. (public relations)." 
</P>
<P>
Already, there are indications that the prevailing speculative mania will soon 
wipe out any trace of shaky confidence in gold. Some rare coin collectors in 
Tokyo are reportedly offering 200,000 yen -- double the face value and more 
than four times the gold value -- for counterfeit Showa coins.

MALATHION DOGFIGHT ENDS WITH SCARCELY A WHIMPER 
</P>

<P>
In the end, it was more an exchange of polite radio messages than outright war. 
</P>
<P>
On one side of the strange aerial dance that took place Thursday in the dark 
morning skies above Pasadena were six state helicopters, carrying a load of 
malathion for a 53-square-mile assault on the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side was a single Pasadena police helicopter buzzing nearby, 
waiting to enforce a new and novel city ordinance designed to stop malathion 
spraying by banning low-flying aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Just before 1 a.m., both sides met. The air-to-air radios crackled. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes sir," Pasadena Police Lt. Terry Blumenthal messaged. "This is the Pasadena 
Police Department. . . . We have you flying in formation over Pasadena below 
700 feet in violation of ordinance No. 9.42.010 and I have to ask you to, uh . 
. . cease and desist." 
</P>
<P>
"Affirmative," a state pilot answered briskly. "We acknowledge your 
transmission." 
</P>
<P>
"OK, thank you very much," the officer said. A long pause. "I assume that means 
you're going to keep on spraying?" 
</P>
<P>
"That is correct." 
</P>
<P>
"OK. Thank you," Blumenthal answered. 
</P>
<P>
End of confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
In the first test of Pasadena's ordinance, the fleeting aerial confrontation 
between the city and the state of California was more a dainty waltz than what 
one state official had jokingly dubbed earlier "a showdown in the air." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all very civilized," said Gera Curry, spokeswoman for the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Other than some posturing by officials on both sides of the simmering issue, 
little actually happened. No citations were issued and the state pilots did not 
miss a beat in their pesticide spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a job to do and we understand they have a job to do," said Pasadena 
police spokesman Gregg Henderson, adding that the city prosecutor may file a 
case against the state pilots in Pasadena Municipal Court next week. "No reason 
to get mad about it." 
</P>
<P>
But in an unexpected move Thursday, just hours after the spraying ended, Gov. 
George Deukmejian, Department of Food and Agriculture Director Henry Voss, 
Department of Health Services Director Kenneth W. Kizer and Assemblyman Pat 
Nolan (R-Glendale) arrived in Pasadena to discuss the issue of malathion 
spraying with city officials. 
</P>
<P>
But after the one-hour session at the Doubletree Hotel ended, neither side had 
budged. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said the spraying will continue and Pasadena officials said they 
have no intention of repealing the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's aerial maneuvering with the state is one of the strangest incidents 
yet in the growing opposition to aerial malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous cities have passed resolutions against the spraying, fired off protest 
letters to the governor and even sued the state to try to ground the 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the cities of Los Angeles, Glendale and Burbank and the Natural 
Resource Defense Council formally filed two separate suits in Los Angeles 
Superior Court in an attempt to stop the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
But Pasadena has taken a different tack, creating a seemingly incomprehensible 
ordinance outlawing formation flying of aircraft below 700 feet between half an 
hour after sunset and half an hour before sunrise without city permission. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal officials jumped on the ordinance, saying it was legally 
ridiculous, because the city has no authority to control air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
But Pasadena Vice Mayor Jess Hughston said: "We may not stop the spraying, but 
we're going to give it a shot. We're not going to roll over and play dead." 
</P>
<P>
The much ballyhooed aerial confrontation was choreographed from the beginning 
to make sure no one would be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Blumenthal flew to El Monte hours before the spraying to explain the 
situation to the state pilots and ask them if they wouldn't mind spraying 
Pasadena first to save everyone some time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to stay up all night," said the 25-year police veteran. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots politely declined, taking off on schedule at 9 p.m. in their 
helicopters, each loaded with 175 gallons of pesticide and bait. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal and his crew waited at the Pasadena police helipad near Devil's Gate 
Dam for word on the squadron of state helicopters, slowly working its way 
toward Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
It took four hours but finally, at 12:20 a.m., Blumenthal, Sgt. Tom Oldfield, 
Cmdr. Donn Burwell and City Director Rick Cole took off to intercept the state 
helicopters that had just crossed the city line. 
</P>
<P>
Three television news helicopters lifted off after them, with one cameraman 
hanging out an open door. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lots of helicopters out there," one of the Medfly pilots could be 
heard to say over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"Dress it up guys, we're on TV," another Medfly chopper pilot said. 
</P>
<P>
The aerial confrontation at 12:55 a.m. was short, polite and businesslike. 
Within 15 minutes the Pasadena helicopter turned back for the police landing 
pad. 
</P>
<P>
"Mission accomplished," Cole said as he entered the heliport terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal took off again to fly to El Monte Airport to verify the identities 
of the state pilots and talk with Jim Josephson, pilot and owner of the company 
contracted by the state to spray malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal told Josephson his pilots had violated the law, but that they would 
not be cited at that time. 
</P>
<P>
After his aircraft was reloaded, Josephson returned to his helicopter and took 
off with Blumenthal and his crew following behind. But this time, they weren't 
in pursuit to enforce the law, only to watch. 
</P>
<P>
They gazed at the Medfly helicopters, staggered in a slanting line called an 
echelon formation, as they made a pass over a 1,000-foot-wide stretch. They 
then made a graceful S turn for a return sweep. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, they really do have that down to a science," said Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks good," agreed Oldfield.

CAMP O'NEAL HAS HISTORY OF VIOLATING STATE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, This article was reported by Times staff writers John Hurst, 
Jenifer Warren, Kevin Roderick, Joel Sappell and Cathleen Decker, and was 
written by Hurst.

<TEXT>
<P>
Camp O'Neal, the youth facility in charge of three teen-agers who died in the 
Convict Lake tragedy, has been repeatedly cited over the last two years for 
violating state licensing standards -- including improperly supervising and 
medicating residents, failing to train staff adequately and supplying 
inadequate clothing for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some pretty chronic problems there," said Kathleen Norris, 
public information officer for the state Department of Social Services, the 
agency responsible for licensing private group homes for troubled youngsters, 
such as Camp O'Neal. Norris said that the camp had shown some improvement in 
the last year and no action to revoke its license is being taken. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbi Trott, camp director, said that the facility is the victim of unfair and 
overzealous inspectors working out of the state's licensing office in 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a chronic problem with the local agency," she said. 
</P>
<P>
An official of Mono County, where the camp is located in the Eastern Sierra, 
said local youngsters are no longer sent to Camp O'Neal partly because of its 
alleged problems with the care and treatment of the disturbed delinquent boys 
it serves. 
</P>
<P>
Probation department officials in Tulare and San Bernardino counties, who have 
sent youngsters to the camp, have praised the facility and said they were not 
aware of chronic problems cited by licensing authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Licensing officials said that the camp has had chronic troubles but declined to 
compare the facility to others in the state. 
</P>
<P>
State licensing reports of alleged violations over a three-year period at Camp 
O'Neal make up scores of pages in a two-inch-thick file. By comparison, a 
six-year file on Boys Republic, a Chino facility for delinquent youth which is 
also inspected by officials from Riverside County, makes up about 10 pages. The 
Boys Republic houses 151 youths, whereas Camp O'Neal's capacity is 34. 
</P>
<P>
State and local authorities continued their investigation into Monday's 
incident in which seven drowned. There have been no allegations that camp 
personnel were responsible for the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Trott disclosed that one of the youngsters who died in the frigid 
waters of Convict Lake had been diagnosed as having a condition that made him 
"manic, extremely hyperactive with poor impulse control." 
</P>
<P>
The youngster, with three others, had strayed from a group of 16 camp 
residents, who were on an outing under the supervision of two counselors, one 
of whom was working his first day on the job, Trott said. As the youngsters 
strayed toward the center of the lake, the new counselor, Randy Porter, tried 
to warn them that the ice was not safe, according to camp spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
Four youths plunged through the ice as Porter and veteran counselor Dave Meyers 
went to their aid and also fell through the ice. Two other would-be rescuers 
also went down. One youngster survived, but the others perished. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why a hyperactive, impulsive youngster was allowed to go on an outing at 
the potentially dangerous lake, Terry Christensen, a member of the camp's board 
of directors, said: "The kid had begun to make improvements." 
</P>
<P>
Camp officials have hired a Newport Beach public relations firm, Professional 
Image, which on Thursday issued to local newspapers a press release lauding the 
behavior of counselors on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"The ratio of supervision here was one (counselor) to eight (students)," the 
release read. "One of the victims' parents told me his child was never so happy 
in his life as he was with us." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Epstein of Professional Image said he was contacted by camp officials 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very concerned," Epstein said. " . . . The impression everyone is 
left with when they see a story like this is there was irresponsibility in some 
way on the part of the camp and camp counselors. 
</P>
<P>
"The rescue efforts were heroic. That's the part they want people to understand 
-- they haven't done anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Privately run facilities for delinquents such as Camp O'Neal are inspected 
annually by state licensing officials who also make visits if complaints are 
received. Inspectors monitor the quality of housing, clothing, food, clients' 
rights, medical care and other services provided by the facility. If the care 
is not up to standard, the facility is cited for a "deficiency" and fined if 
the violation is not corrected or if the transgression is considered especially 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, licensing officials accused Camp O'Neal of tranquilizing youngsters 
against their will. 
</P>
<P>
"Clients are provided psychotropic drugs to mask (control) such behavior as 
aggressiveness, hyperactivity, etc.," the report said. It also said such policy 
is against state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Trott maintains that the state inspector, Paul Zimmer, is not qualified to 
reach conclusions regarding improper medications and that he had not reviewed 
the clients' medical files. She said one-third of the youngsters in the camp 
are on medication and many came there already using such drugs. 
</P>
<P>
During the same visit last month, the state inspector reported that youngsters 
were inadequately clothed. 
</P>
<P>
Trott said that the inspector thought the youths looked like "ragamuffins" 
because "shredded jeans are in style." She said the camp attempted to buy 
adequate clothing, but that some of the youngsters demanded expensive 
acid-washed jeans. 
</P>
<P>
The camp was cited for lack of supervision last December when an inspector 
discovered that a resident had attempted sexual acts with nine other youths. 
</P>
<P>
"It is evident that the staff were lacking in care and supervision if this one 
client was able to (attempt to) commit so many acts of sodomy and oral 
copulation . . .," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"We got rid of the kid," Trott said, adding that it is not feasible to provide 
a staff member to supervise each child. 
</P>
<P>
The facility also was cited for inadequate staffing in 1988 when 21 incidents 
were reported of youths leaving the grounds without permission. 
</P>
<P>
Trott maintained that several of those "AWOLs" were the same youth running out 
the door and explained that camp personnel are not allowed to physically 
prevent youngsters from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
Both state officials and former staff members complained that the camp does not 
provide adequate training to deal with the troubled delinquent youngsters it 
serves. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, the camp was cited by the state because it allegedly had "no 
plan for orientation, development and training of staff." 
</P>
<P>
"The money that was coming in, I couldn't see it going back to the kids or to 
staff training," said Lynn Morris, a child care supervisor at the camp who left 
in October, 1988, because of his dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Trott said new staff members receive on-the-job training and an hour of 
instruction per week. 
</P>
<P>
Mono County turned over the camp, which had been run by its probation 
department, to Camp O'Neal Inc. in March, 1987, after officials decided the 
facility was too expensive to run. 
</P>
<P>
Trott, who had overseen the camp as a probation department employee, became the 
secretary of the new nonprofit corporation and continued to run the facility. 
Tim Christensen, who helped arrange the transfer from the county, serves as 
vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1987, after the county withdrew school services to the camp, 
Christensen said he was forced to open his own school on the grounds and 
established the for-profit High Sierra School. Christensen and Trott were 
married the next month. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters sent to the camp by various counties are deemed in need of special 
education and attend the school run by Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
Camp O'Neal charges $32,220 per client per year and High Sierra School charges 
$30,960. 
</P>
<P>
Some former employees and critics of the camp said that Trott and Christensen 
have a financial incentive to keep the camp beds filled and to expand by 
accepting clients regardless of whether they are amenable to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Watkins, a former office aide at the camp, said that when the camp had 
difficulty filling its beds, Trott began to accept more severely troubled boys. 
Watkins, who was at the camp for 13 months, said she resigned because of her 
dissatisfaction with the way the camp was run. 
</P>
<P>
But, Christensen said: "We are here to help the kids. We take a child because 
we feel we can work with him. . . . We don't take violent or heavy-duty kids. 
We take kids that need a break and a highly structured environment. 
Unfortunately we don't succeed with everyone."

BOMB-LADEN TRUCK DEFUSED ON WESTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Bomb experts disarmed and removed five 55-gallon steel drums filled with 
explosive chemicals near an Internal Revenue Service office in West Los Angeles 
Thursday, ending a daylong threat that forced evacuation of thousands of people 
from their homes, kept hundreds away from work and created massive traffic 
jams. 
</P>
<P>
The detonator-equipped drums, loaded into the back of a pickup truck, 
apparently had been set to go off early Thursday when the truck was found 
burning on Colby Avenue near Olympic Boulevard, police said. The truck had been 
ticketed several times, indicating it had been parked there for some time, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It did have the potential of being a very large explosion, perhaps the largest 
we've ever had," said Assistant Los Angeles Police Chief Robert Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't say at this moment that it would have flattened so many blocks, but 
we have to assume the worst," Vernon said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries, although the truck containing the explosives was 
heavily damaged by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
While bomb experts cautiously examined the suspicious drums near the 15500 
block of Olympic Boulevard, police officers ordered residents out of a 16-block 
area, going house-to-house later in the day to warn them about a "dangerous 
bomb." Residents were allowed back in the area after 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The original evacuation area straddled Olympic, extending a block north to 
Mississippi Avenue, a block south to Tennessee Avenue, east to Sawtelle 
Boulevard and west to Barrington Avenue. By early afternoon, the zone had been 
extended and traffic restrictions tightened. 
</P>
<P>
Police blocked intersections, snarling traffic on one of the most heavily 
traveled corridors in the city. Motorists, diverted to side streets from busy 
Olympic Boulevard, moved slowly through the evacuation area during the morning 
rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
While authorities could provide no motive for the potential bombing, they noted 
that an IRS office, with up to 350 employees, is located on the fifth floor of 
the nearby six-story Olympic Plaza. The complex also houses the City National 
Bank Building. 
</P>
<P>
The same office building was rocked by explosions in September, 1988, when five 
separate bombs were set off in a stolen car in an underground parking garage. 
Police said they were left without direct leads to suggest a motive or a 
suspect. No one was injured in the blasts. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not ignoring similarities between this and the other bombing incident," 
police spokesman Fred Nixon said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But he declined to discuss details of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
IRS spokesman Rob Giannangeli said he thought it was a "natural assumption" 
that the federal tax-collecting agency might have been the target of Thursday's 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the second incident at that building," Giannangeli said. "We have a 
tendency to believe that would be the case, just from the nature of the work we 
do. But until someone is apprehended, I don't think we'll ever know. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California's had a history of the tax protest movement, and some of 
these people are not exactly enamored (of) us." 
</P>
<P>
But, Giannangeli said, there is also a possibility that the motive is that of 
"some disgruntled guy who was turned down by the bank for his loan." 
</P>
<P>
The bomb threat developed from what seemed at first a relatively minor incident 
that began to unfold at about 2 a.m. Firefighters extinguished a burning pickup 
truck parked on Colby Avenue near Olympic Boulevard, just across the street 
from Fire Station 59. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Nord, a 21-year-old tow truck driver, said he was going to breakfast 
Thursday when he saw firefighters pouring water on the burning truck. As the 
truck burned, Nord said he heard popping noises that sounded like "shotgun 
blasts." 
</P>
<P>
The truck fire had burned out and firefighters had gone when Nord returned 
between 3:30 and 4 a.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
When authorities examined the charred remains of the truck about two hours 
later, however, they became suspicious that the metal drums in the bed of the 
pickup might contain volatile liquids arranged with detonators to explode. 
</P>
<P>
They immediately ordered the evacuation of the area, setting off a day of 
confusion and concern for nearby residents and workers. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds were forced to park blocks from their offices and walk to work, only 
to be turned back by police and fire lines and warnings of a possible bomb in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
One of those who reached her office on foot, Geegee Auger, 43, secretary in a 
law firm down the block from Olympic Plaza, said police came in shortly after 1 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"First they strongly suggested that we leave," she said. "Then we were told 
that we must leave. They didn't say why." 
</P>
<P>
As the day wore on, a command post was set up at Stoner Playground, about half 
a mile northwest of where the truck had burned. Hundreds of police officers and 
firefighters moved into the neighborhood and were joined by FBI and Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents. 
</P>
<P>
Police and fire officials brought in large portable command posts. Dozens of 
fire engines were assembled and half a dozen paramedic units stood by. 
Motorcycle officers patrolled the evacuation area. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-afternoon, specialists opened the drums and found an unidentified liquid 
inside, Nixon said. The barrels were lifted out of the bed of the burned truck 
with a forklift and taken away for analysis and disposal.

SHARING THE WEALTH;

<P>
4 WINNERS WILL GET $17.1-MILLION SLICES OF RECORD LOTTERY JACKPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A 41-year-old Simi Valley woman with six children, 11 grandchildren and a host 
of unpaid bills will share a record $68.56-million Lotto jackpot with at least 
three other Southern California residents, lottery officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
There were four winning tickets in Wednesday night's Lotto 6/49 drawing, each 
worth $17.1 million. Other winning tickets in the lottery's largest payoff were 
purchased in Laguna Niguel, West Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Lydia Neufeld, an employee at a Simi Valley collection agency, said her winning 
ticket was one of 15 she purchased at a nearby 7-Eleven store. She said her 
good fortune came at a time when she was just making ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, we have gone through some struggles," Neufeld said as friends, 
relatives and television news crews descended on her home. "For a while, our 
house was in jeopardy and my husband was unemployed because of an accident he 
had at work." 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld's husband, a plasterer, recently returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
After taxes, the four winners will collect annual payments of $685,000 for 20 
years, lottery officials said. Neufeld said that sum will be a considerable 
improvement over the $50,000 she and her husband, Dave, earned last year. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners were Joan Young of Laguna Niguel and Michael Yang of Valencia, 
who purchased his ticket at a West Los Angeles gas station and mini-market. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials said the holder of the fourth winning ticket, purchased at 
Ranch Liquor &amp; Deli in Long Beach, had not come forward as of Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
But store manager Frank McDonald said an elderly pensioner and frequent 
customer had come to the store with his wife to tell workers he had won. "He's 
still in kind of a state of shock," McDonald said. "He looked kind of tired. I 
think he's been up all night." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said he could not remember the man's name. But Barbie Tizon, the 
store's night manager, said the man and his wife had bought several hundred 
dollars worth of tickets only hours before the drawing. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County's affluent Laguna Niguel neighborhood, a winning ticket was 
purchased by Young at a Circle K store. 
</P>
<P>
After the numbers were announced on television Wednesday night, Young called 
the Circle K to check the numbers and make sure she was a winner, according to 
the store's manager, Maher Altahan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful surprise," Altahan said. "When the customer called and told 
me (she) had all six numbers . . . I didn't know what to say. I was so 
excited." 
</P>
<P>
The winning tickets also are valuable to the four stores that sold them. Each 
retailer will get 0.5% of the value of the ticket sold, or more than $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Altahan said Circle K corporate officials will have the final word on what 
happens to the store's winnings. "It's up to the company," he said. "I think 
some of it should be divided among the employees." 
</P>
<P>
The odds of picking all six winning numbers in the lottery are formidable -- 14 
million to 1. But that didn't stop Californians from lining up across the state 
in record numbers to buy lottery tickets. 
</P>
<P>
More than 6.2 million of the $1 tickets were sold between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. 
Wednesday, shattering the old single-hour record of 4.5 million tickets set 
only two hours earlier, lottery spokesman John Schade said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's ticket sales started at 5 a.m., an hour earlier than normal. When 
sales closed at 7:45 p.m., more than $50.5 million of Lotto tickets had been 
sold at a rate averaging 951 tickets a second, breaking the single-day record 
of $31.5 million set Oct. 29, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
California's previous jackpot record was $61.98 million on Oct. 29, 1988. 
Forty-eight people shared the prize, including a group of 15 San Diego County 
hospital workers. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's jackpot was the third largest in the nation and the second largest 
for the game of Lotto, eclipsed only by a $114-million jackpot at a keno-type 
lottery game in Pennsylvania and a $70-million Lotto jackpot in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very exciting these last few days," lottery spokeswoman Joanne 
McNabb said. "It's like working on the Olympics or a political campaign. . . . 
The most fun part is getting to talk to the winners." 
</P>
<P>
Neufeld, the Simi Valley winner, said she plans to retire after 27 years of 
working to support her family. She had her first child at age 14 and now has 
four daughters and two sons, the youngest of whom is 22. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother-in-law is on Social Security and she needs taking care of," Neufeld 
said. "I'm still in shock. I'm getting all of these phone calls and now the 
reality is starting to set in. I guess I'll really believe all of this has 
happened when I get that first check."

LAKE TRAGEDY GIVES RISE TO SAFETY DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
SURVIVAL: THE SEARCH FOR THE LAST BODY FROM CONVICT LAKE IS SUSPENDED TO LET 
DIVERS REST. OPINIONS ON HOW TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS ARE DIVIDED.

CONVICT LAKE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The search for the last of seven people who drowned in this frozen Sierra lake 
was suspended Thursday to allow divers to rest and organizers to bring in more 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But as the recovery efforts quieted, a debate began over what, if anything, 
officials can do to guard against future tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
Recovery efforts were curtailed after the Truckee, Nev., Fire District took 
back the air-propelled boat that had aided teams working on the ice-capped 
lake, where three teen-agers and four would-be rescuers died after they fell 
through the ice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department diving team, which Wednesday 
recovered five bodies from the lake bottom, also left for home and will be 
replaced by another team when the search for the body of Dave Meyers, 53, 
resumes within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers was a counselor at Camp O'Neal, a residential facility where five of the 
victims lived or worked. Officials at first believed they had spotted his body 
with an underwater camera late Wednesday, but now believe they may just have 
seen his jacket. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to five bodies recovered Wednesday, another was brought to the 
surface on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The youths who perished in the lake accident were 15-year-olds David C. Sellers 
of Tulare and Shawn Rayne Diaz of Dinuba, and Ryan McCandless, 13, of Redlands. 
Also killed were U.S. Forest Service employee Clay Cutter, 31, volunteer 
firefighter Vidar Anderson, 58, and camp counselor Randy Porter, 36. 
</P>
<P>
Mono County Sheriff-Coroner Martin Strelneck said the search was called off 
until more equipment and fresh divers could reach the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"We're regrouping for another attack," he said. The air-propelled boat was 
returned to Truckee because it might be needed for rescues in thawing lakes 
there, Strelneck said. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths have caused a schism of sorts within the community between those 
arguing that officials should do more to guard against drownings and those who 
feel that common sense, not signposts and warnings, should govern conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra is populated with independent, outdoors-oriented people who are 
familiar with local conditions. But the area also is dependent on tourists, who 
know little of the dangers inherent in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is "drastically important" to the economy of eastern Sierra resort 
towns, according to Donna Forrester of the Mammoth Lakes tourism office, and 
officials have portrayed the area as a playground for winter sportsmen. A 
Convict Lake brochure lists ice-skating as one of the area's popular winter 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
The cable television station that serves the area routinely airs a promotion 
showing skaters enjoying ice-covered Convict Lake on a sunny winter day. The ad 
was pulled immediately after Monday's deaths, but returned to the air within a 
day or so. After a reporter raised questions about the ad on Thursday, station 
officials said it would be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials have fought efforts to open the lake to winter 
fishing, which, like ice-skating or hiking, would bring people onto the lake. 
Monday's tragedy began when teen-aged hikers ventured onto the lake. 
</P>
<P>
An effort by the state Department of Fish and Game to open the eastern Sierra 
for winter fishing was tabled last year after opponents, including Mono 
County's Strelneck, argued that it would raise the risks of accidents like the 
one Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The current fishing season runs from the last Saturday in April until Oct. 31. 
The plan would have allowed fishing year-round at Convict and other local 
lakes. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern was that this would increase the hazardous situation because of the 
increased number of people walking on the ice," Strelneck said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that tourists and residents should exercise "common sense" before 
venturing onto lakes. "We have to rely on the intelligence of individuals who 
come up here to be able to use their heads," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper in Mono County, the Review-Herald, Thursday sharply 
criticized the absence of signs warning of the dangerous conditions at Convict 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
"For reasons which are all too obvious and painful, it's time that the powers 
that be in the Eastern Sierra take action to assure that the scenario . . . is 
never replayed," the paper declared. 
</P>
<P>
"One hopes that these seven people have not died in vain, that we can learn 
from their misfortune," the paper added in a second editorial. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of the drowning victims have said that they will work to have signs 
posted at the lake to prevent another tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"They definitely need signs out there," said Tracey Wood, a friend of Clay 
Cutter, one of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
"I know people are going to be rebellious, but before they advertise a lake for 
ice-skating they better let people know how thin the ice is." 
</P>

JURY'S AWARD IN DRUG-TEST FIRING UPHELD; 
</P>
<P>
PRIVACY: A STATE APPELLATE COURT SUPPORTS A RAILROAD EMPLOYEE WHO LOST HER JOB 
FOR REFUSING TO PROVIDE A URINE SAMPLE DURING A RANDOM TEST. THE $485,042 
AWARDED TO HER BY A SAN FRANCISCO JURY STANDS. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state Court of Appeal, citing the constitutional right to privacy, on 
Thursday upheld a $485,042 damage award to a railroad employee who was fired 
for refusing to submit to an employer-ordered drug test. 
</P>
<P>
The court, ruling in one of the first legal challenges to random workplace drug 
tests in California, said an employee in a non-safety-related job could not be 
forced to undergo testing. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member panel noted that the work of a computer programmer in the case 
did not involve the actual movement of trains or other dangerous activities 
that the courts have said may justify testing despite its intrusion on privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The court upheld a landmark award by a San Francisco jury against the Southern 
Pacific Transportation Co. for the wrongful termination of Barbara A. Luck, who 
was dismissed after she refused to provide a urine sample as part of an 
unannounced, company-mandated test for drugs, alcohol and medications. 
</P>
<P>
The panel rejected the company's contention that the right to privacy, placed 
in the state Constitution by the voters in 1972, did not apply to urinalysis. 
It also turned down Southern Pacific's claim that a private employer -- unlike 
a governmental agency -- is not required to observe privacy guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
"Appellate courts have repeatedly held that the right to privacy is an 
inalienable right which no one may violate," Justice William R. Channel wrote 
in a 47-page opinion joined by Justice James F. Perley. 
</P>
<P>
The panel held that Southern Pacific's invasion of Luck's privacy was 
unjustified and that the company had fired her in "bad faith," violating an 
implied agreement with the worker that she could only be dismissed for good 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
However, the court, over a dissent by Justice Marc Poche, rejected a separate 
claim by Luck that her firing also constituted a violation of "public policy" 
-- an aspect of the case that could have further expanded the company's 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was the third by an appeals court in a drug-testing case in recent 
months that has held that the state constitutional right to privacy applies to 
private employers, as well as the government. However, in one case -- now 
pending before the state Supreme Court -- an appellate court upheld drug 
testing for job applicants, finding that a mandatory urine test was only a 
"limited invasion of privacy" and did not violate the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Southern Pacific said the company was "disappointed" with 
Thursday's ruling and will consider an appeal to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Lake, an Oakland attorney representing Luck, praised the decision for 
clearly distinguishing between drug tests for non-safety jobs and safety jobs 
-- such as for employees carrying firearms or working in nuclear power 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"This ruling is very important because it's the first one that really defines 
the parameters for drug testing of private employees and upholds the need for a 
compelling interest for testing," Lake said. "This will make employers rethink 
their drug-testing policies and do fewer random, across-the-board testing in 
the workplace."

Luck began work for Southern Pacific in 1978, rising from a signal department 
draftsman to computer programmer by 1985. In that capacity, she collected 
information for the engineering department, wrote computer programs, compiled 
reports on employee activities and kept track of the location of company 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1985, she and all other Southern Pacific engineering department 
employees were told to provide urine samples in connection with drug tests. She 
refused, saying she considered the request offensive, and was fired for 
insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
Luck contended in a lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court that she had been 
wrongfully terminated and had suffered intentional infliction of emotional 
distress. A jury upheld Luck's claims, awarding her $180,092 for lost pay and 
benefits, $32,100 for emotional distress and $272,850 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
The company took the case to the Court of Appeal, arguing that in jobs like 
Luck's, there were indirect and potential safety factors that justified drug 
tests. In any event, the railroad said, other non-safety interests -- such as 
efficiency, competence and ensuring public confidence in the industry -- were 
sufficient to justify the tests.

UNOCAL TO PAY $5.5 MILLION TO END LAWSUIT; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: CIVIL SETTLEMENT IS THE LARGEST REACHED UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT. 
SUIT CHARGED THAT THE COMPANY POLLUTED SAN FRANCISCO BAY.

<P>
In the largest civil settlement reached under the Clean Water Act, Unocal Corp. 
of Los Angeles has agreed to pay $5.5 million -- including $2.7 million to an 
environmental group -- to end a lawsuit filed against the company for polluting 
San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, which claimed that 
Unocal knowingly and illegally discharged tons of toxic waste into San 
Francisco Bay throughout the early 1980s, polluting the water and fouling 
sensitive wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.7 million will go to the Trust for Public Lands for the purchase and 
restoration of fouled wetlands. The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund will be paid 
about $1.3 million in lawyers fees. The remaining $1.5 million will be split 
between the federal Environmental Protection Agency and the state Water 
Pollution Cleanup and Abatement Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"We're elated," said Stephan Volker, the Sierra Club lawyer who filed the suit 
in 1984. "This should send a message to other polluters: Clean up your 
operations or face the prospect of being hauled into court and paying a 
substantial penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Unocal, in a prepared statement, said the alleged violations were the result of 
a misunderstanding of its responsibilities under federal law. The company 
denied any malicious intent, and said it has since installed a $64-million 
waste water treatment facility at its refinery in Rodeo, Calif., about 18 miles 
northeast of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club lost its original 1985 suit after a one-week trial in U.S. 
District Court in San Francisco. But that decision was reversed by the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals in 1987. The appellate court decision was, in turn, 
vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Sierra Club suit was consolidated with a lawsuit filed by the 
State Regional Water Quality Control Board. That suit was scheduled to be heard 
earlier this month, but was delayed by negotiations that led to the settlement 
disclosed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleged that whenever polluted waste water built up at Unocal's 
plant, the company would purge the excess by bypassing its legally required 
treatment facility and dumping waste directly into the bay. That waste 
allegedly exceeded state and federal standards for a variety of pollutants, 
from oil and grease to inorganic toxics and bacteria. The suit also accused the 
company of failing to tell pollution officials when the excessive discharges 
occurred, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal said that most of the alleged violations resulted simply because the 
company failed to fully understand the requirements of its federal waste water 
discharge permit. Unocal said it did not realize it was prohibited to bypass 
its waste water treatment system, because the waste received partial treatment 
elsewhere in the plant and was diluted with fully treated effluent. 
</P>
<P>
Once informed by the state in 1985 that such bypasses were illegal, Unocal said 
it "immediately changed its method of operation." 
</P>
<P>
The marginally treated waste water flowed into San Pablo Bay, the northern 
section of San Francisco Bay and the site of many of the Bay Area's remaining 
wetlands. Those marshy lands are valuable habitat for spawning fish, migrating 
birds and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
The Trust for Public Lands, a private, San Francisco-based organization that 
raises money to buy environmentally valuable property for preservation or 
donation to state and federal parks, said it will use its share of the Unocal 
settlement to protect not only wildlife habitat, but scenic and recreational 
resources as well. 
</P>
<P>
"This settlement makes it possible for us to redouble our efforts to protect 
areas critical to the health of the bay, and to secure for the public some of 
the acreage that is fast giving way to development," said Martin J. Rosen, 
president of the nonprofit land trust. 
</P>
<P>
The Trust for Public Lands already has assembled and bought 500 acres of prime 
waterfowl habitat along adjacent Suisin Bay for protection by the State Lands 
Commission.

CHENEY URGES JAPAN TO RAISE SHARE FOR DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: HE TELLS TOKYO THAT U.S. FORCES IN THE PACIFIC WILL SHRINK, AND ASIAN 
ALLIES MUST BEAR MORE OF THE COST.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Japanese officials Thursday that the United 
States intends to withdraw over the next three years 5,000 to 6,000 of the 
57,000 troops it now has stationed in Japan, but offered reassurance that Japan 
remains the "linchpin" of U.S. Pacific strategy. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the American military umbrella over the region, Cheney asked 
Tokyo to assume a significantly greater share of the $7-billion annual cost of 
maintaining U.S. forces here and to relax restrictions on transfer of Japanese 
technology to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's four-day visit to Japan concludes a two-week swing through East Asia 
in which he presented a marked shift in the U.S. defense posture in the 
Pacific. Because of a sharply reduced Soviet threat and a Congress determined 
to slash the Pentagon's budget, Cheney said U.S. forces in the Pacific will 
shrink while Washington will demand that its Asian allies assume a far greater 
share of the region's defense burden. 
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary noted that South Korea and Japan have become economic 
powerhouses capable of spending more on their own defenses, while the United 
States is undertaking a fundamental reassessment of its costly global military 
role. All the while, he sought to reassure the Asian allies that the United 
States is not abandoning them. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's message comes at a time of widening strains in the U.S.-Japan 
relationship, particularly over trade. But officials of both governments 
described the Cheney talks with senior Japanese leaders as cordial. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech today in Tokyo, Cheney outlined the continuing military threats in 
Asia, from the still-formidable Soviet navy to internal instability in many 
Asian nations to proliferation of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Given these potential dangers to regional security, it should be clear that 
the United States could not ever think of a withdrawal from Asia," the Pentagon 
chief said. "However, it is true, as you have probably heard, that we are 
thinking about making some force adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question after the speech, Cheney disclosed publicly for the 
first time that the Pentagon plans to withdraw over the next three years about 
10% of the 120,000 U.S. troops now based in East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's message unsettled the South Koreans, who fear that a precipitous U.S. 
retreat will embolden the hostile communist North Koreans to attack. The 
Filipinos reacted with anger, because Cheney indicated that the United States 
would be unable to meet earlier pledges of military and economic aid. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, however, accepted the cuts with more equanimity and expressed an 
appreciation for the bind Cheney is in, according to officials who attended the 
meetings between the defense secretary and senior Japanese leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama cautioned Cheney, however, that adjustments in 
U.S. forces must be based on objective conditions in Asia -- which he called 
"unclear and complex" -- and should be subject to periodic review, a Foreign 
Ministry official said. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu joined Nakayama in 
expressing to Cheney the belief that forward-deployed U.S. forces in the 
Pacific are "essential and indispensable" to regional security, but both said 
they are aware of competing demands on the U.S. budget. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Pentagon official traveling with Cheney concurred. "They understand 
the American political system. They understand the strategic environment is 
changing. They think it is a positive development that we're looking out over 
several years rather than letting Congress dictate" military policy, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese, without providing specific promises, said they would increase 
their contribution to the cost of maintaining U.S. soldiers, sailors and air 
force personnel here. 
</P>
<P>
Japan currently pays $2.4 billion of the $7-billion annual cost of supporting 
U.S. troops on the islands, but has budgeted 468 billion yen ($3.2 billion) for 
fiscal 1990, which begins April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Washington would like Tokyo to increase that share to 60%, or more than $4 
billion a year, by picking up the tab for utilities, telecommunications and 
local labor at U.S. installations. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese leaders privately said they would provide some, if not all, of the 
requested increase. "The Japanese are very understanding and very much willing 
to help as much as they can," one U.S. official who participated in the 
meetings said. 
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of reassurance to the Japanese, Cheney announced that the U.S. 
Navy would transfer the aircraft carrier Independence to Japan when the World 
War II-era carrier Midway, now stationed at Yokosuka, Japan, is retired next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Both carriers are conventionally powered, as opposed to nuclear, a subject of 
great sensitivity here for obvious historical reasons. The Japanese are the 
only people to have suffered the devastation of atomic bombs. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese had feared that the Midway would be pulled out and not replaced. 
Both Kaifu and Nakayama thanked Cheney for deciding to transfer the 
Independence, commissioned in 1959. The move, however, represents a loss for 
San Diego, the ship's home port. 
</P>
<P>
In two hours of meetings Thursday, Cheney told his counterpart, Juro Matsumoto, 
director of the Japan Defense Agency, that the troop cuts "will be done without 
affecting our combat capabilities," Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said. "We 
will continue to modernize and upgrade our forces in the region," he quoted 
Cheney as telling Matsumoto. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also met with former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and former Foreign 
Minister Shintaro Abe, a ruling party strongman widely expected to be Japan's 
next prime minister.

MOVE TO HONOR ARMENIANS FAILS IN SENATE

Senate supporters of a resolution commemorating the killings of 1.5 million 
Armenians by the Ottoman Turks early this century were unable to end a 
filibuster Thursday by senators who wish to avoid offending Turkey and who fear 
the resolution could create a major diplomatic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
After more than two days of emotion-charged debate, the Senate split down the 
middle, voting 49-49 on a procedural motion to cut off debate. The outcome was 
a setback for supporters of the resolution, who needed 60 votes -- a 
three-fifths majority -- of the Senate to break the filibuster and proceed to a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The filibuster was led by Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) who called the 
resolution "a foreign policy disaster in the making." 
</P>
<P>
Noting the narrowness of the vote, however, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R.-Kan.) vowed to try again next week after making changes in the resolution 
that he said will satisfy the Bush Administration's objections. 
</P>
<P>
Senate aides said the two senators not present for the vote -- Dan Coats 
(R-Ind.) and Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) -- are both likely to side with Dole 
when the motion comes up again next Tuesday, leaving the Republican leader 
still nine votes short. 
</P>
<P>
Dole said that in addition to having its language changed, the measure would be 
offered again in a different, non-binding form that would not require a 
presidential signature -- and that he hopes the changes will persuade enough 
senators to switch sides by next week. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, sponsored by Dole, would have the Senate honor the memory of 
1.5 million Armenians killed by the Ottoman Turks by designating April 24 a 
national "day of remembrance" on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of "the 
Armenian genocide of 1915-23." 
</P>
<P>
While Congress routinely passes commemorative resolutions having little or no 
practical policy impact, the unusually bitter controversy surrounding this one 
stems from one emotionally charged word: genocide. 
</P>
<P>
No one disputes that hundreds of thousands of Armenians died during the waning 
days of the Ottoman Empire. But Turkey, now an important North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization ally, disputes the manner of their deaths and vehemently denies 
allegations of genocide. In an intensive lobbying campaign, its representatives 
here have warned that passage of even a symbolic resolution will provoke a 
crisis in U.S.-Turkish relations if the word genocide is mentioned.

U.S. ARTISTS OFFER TRIBUTES TO HAVEL;

DIPLOMACY: THE CZECHOSLOVAK LEADER ALSO RECEIVES A DEGREE FROM COLUMBIA AND

Major American figures in the arts, literature and theater paid tribute 
Thursday to colleague Vaclav Havel, the playwright who endured confinement and 
official recrimination during decades of Communist domination in 
Czechoslovakia, but whose work carried him to the presidency of his country 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, who has gained stature as a dramatist in the tradition of Eugene Ionesco 
and Samuel Beckett, was praised at impressive ceremonies at New York's 
Cathedral of St. John the Divine after receiving an honorary degree at Columbia 
University. 
</P>
<P>
He entered the huge arched gray stone church to a fanfare mixed with the 
tinkling of tiny gold bells that were handed out to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sorry I had no opportunity to write my speech because I was not today two 
hours in a prison," Havel said, calling the tribute a "big and moving 
celebration." 
</P>
<P>
"I thank all who participate. . . . We will feel it as sympathy and support for 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak president lit a candle for freedom. Thousands of candles were 
held high by the throng in the cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
The cathedral ceremony was symbolic of deepening artistic ties between Eastern 
Europe and the West. It had its roots in a January visit to Prague by a group 
from New York's Actors Studio, who presented Havel's play "Audience." Havel, 
who spent years in prison, had never seen the play staged. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's tribute in New York brought kudos to a politician-playwright with a 
sardonic sense of irony who once said in an interview: "Every morning I fight 
depression -- a black mood, guilt that I am not writing." 
</P>
<P>
The day's program featured appearances by a host of major figures in the arts 
ranging from Nobel Prize-winning author Elie Wiesel to Paul Newman and producer 
Joseph Papp. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been in the presence of some great artists. I have been in the presence 
of some great statesmen," Newman said. "I have never been in the presence of an 
artist-statesman." 
</P>
<P>
Havel replied to cheers from an audience at an Actors Studio reception before 
the tribute began. Standing next to Newman, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"I am very glad that I am among my colleagues. I will not speak a very long 
time because I am very nervous." 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak president said Newman loomed as large as a legend and that "I 
didn't think Mr. Newman physically existed." There was great laughter and 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Havel, 53, who was elected Czechoslovakia's president Dec. 
29, mixed international affairs with artistic politics. He visited the Council 
on Foreign Relations, held a news conference at the United Nations, visited the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art and met New York Mayor David N. Dinkins for 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't run for president," Havel told Dinkins. "I was raised to that post by 
public opinion, public pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Guests at the breakfast included Papp, fellow playwrights Arthur Miller, Edward 
Albee and Wendy Wasserstein. 
</P>
<P>
Havel said he enjoyed a "wonderful evening" while touring pubs in Manhattan's 
East Village with film director Milos Forman. Havel and Forman, an emigre, 
attended boarding school together in Czechoslovakia 43 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If a playwright succeeds to orchestrate the overthrow of a dictatorship 
without one bullet being fired, it is a miracle," Forman told the audience at 
the packed cathedral. He added: "We are all here to show you our faith, our 
admiration, our support, our affection -- and if you ask for it, our help."

SOVIET PARTY DISMISSES 2 DEFIANT INVESTIGATORS; 
</P>
<P>
CORRUPTION: THE OUSTING OF A PAIR OF POPULAR HEROES COULD SPARK ANTI-COMMUNIST 
PROTESTS AT RALLIES FOR MORE DEMOCRATIZATION.

<P>
Two fiery, outspoken government investigators whose unprecedented crusade 
against corruption in the Soviet leadership made them heroes of the common man 
were kicked out of the Communist Party, officials said Thursday -- a move that 
could lead to deeper public disaffection with the party itself. 
</P>
<P>
Their supporters warned that the action against Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai 
Ivanov could spark angry anti-Communist protests at a rally scheduled to be 
held Sunday in the capital, during which demonstrators intend to call for 
greater democratization of Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
"We are being dragged through the mud, and we don't have the right to express 
our own viewpoint within the party," Gdlyan said in a telephone interview. 
"People who themselves are involved in corruption gave false evidence against 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the decision to dismiss Gdlyan and Ivanov from the party, which 
once would have been a severe punishment, today is likely to add to their 
public luster and increase dissatisfaction with the party. 
</P>
<P>
The latest move against the pair, taken in a closed-door meeting Wednesday 
night, came nine months after they tantalized the country by announcing that 
Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, a leading conservative and President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's main adversary, had taken money or gifts in return for 
protecting corrupt officials. 
</P>
<P>
They also said two former Politburo members, Grigory V. Romanov and Mikhail A. 
Solomentsev, as well as a former Supreme Court chief justice were under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev unequivocally denied the allegation against him and it was dismissed 
by a special parliamentary commission. The two investigators were fired from 
their posts, allegedly for "gross violations of law," including threatening 
witnesses and jailing them for months without due cause. 
</P>
<P>
But even after questions arose about the methods the two used in their inquiry, 
both were elected overwhelmingly to the Congress of People's Deputies -- the 
national legislature -- on the basis of their personal popularity and 
widespread suspicion of an official cover-up to protect the top party 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Gdlyan and Ivanov are seen here by many as courageous, defiant critics of a 
party whose corruption reached all the way up to members of the family of 
former leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday night's meeting in Moscow, Gdlyan and Ivanov were accused of 
violating party rules and deviating from the party line, and the overwhelming 
majority of the 350 party leaders present voted to expel them, according to an 
official at city party headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling to evict us from the party is probably not all a bad thing," Ivanov 
said in a telephone interview from Leningrad. "The decay of the Communist Party 
of the Soviet Union races along, and I think by the end of this year the party 
will no longer exist. 
</P>
<P>
"But without doubt, this was an order from the Kremlin," he contended. "The 
leadership of the country and the party as well is more and more openly 
demonstrating their desire to protect all organized criminals. On the other 
hand, people who display the desire to fight against corruption are more and 
more deemed unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet prosecutor's office said earlier this month it plans to ask the 
Soviet Parliament to lift the parliamentary immunity that was protecting Gdlyan 
and Ivanov and then to bring charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations have been held in Moscow and other cities sporadically over the 
last several months, with protesters asserting that Gdlyan and Ivanov are being 
harassed. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 14, about 20,000 workers in the Zelenograd district of Moscow walked 
off their jobs to attend a rally in support of the pair. 
</P>
<P>
The two also were among the leaders of a pro-democracy demonstration on Feb. 4 
by about 200,000 people outside the Kremlin, the biggest gathering of its kind 
since the Bolshevik revolution. At the demonstration, Gdlyan urged protesters 
to burn their Communist Party cards.

Labor Party leaders threatened Thursday to dismantle Israel's rickety coalition 
government if, within two weeks, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir makes no 
progress on holding peace talks with Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Although such threats have been a staple of the 14-month-old coalition that 
center-left Labor shares with Shamir's rightist Likud, this one was novel: For 
the first time, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who is considered the keystone 
of the partnership, joined his Labor colleagues in issuing the warning. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimatum comes on the eve of a visit by Foreign Minister Moshe Arens to 
Washington where he will meet with Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Baker 
has tried to arrange a meeting with Arens and Egypt's foreign minister, Esmat 
Abdel Meguid, to work out a list of Palestinian delegates to hold talks with 
Israel. The plan is bogged down in disagreements over the makeup of the 
Palestinian panel. Rabin thinks that compromises are on the horizon that Israel 
should accept. 
</P>
<P>
"Reasonable answers were given by the Egyptians to the United States on 
everything that is linked to the composition of the Palestinian delegation," 
Rabin said in a radio interview. "If there is a delay here, I doubt if there is 
any point in the continuing existence of the government." 
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been fronting for the Palestine Liberation Organization in 
preliminary talks with Washington and Israel. A compromise is in the works that 
would permit not only Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
to take part, but also residents of Arab-populated East Jerusalem and 
Palestinians who have been sent into exile. 
</P>
<P>
An elaborate fig leaf has been designed to subdue Israeli opposition to talking 
to anyone other than Gaza and West Bank residents: The Jerusalem participants 
must have second homes in the occupied areas. Selected Palestinians-in-exile 
will be permitted to come home first. 
</P>
<P>
In order to mask PLO approval of the package, Egypt would announce the makeup 
of the delegation. The Palestinian peace panel is supposed to work out details 
of Shamir's proposal to hold elections in the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
Labor's 107-member party bureau voted to insist on a Cabinet decision on peace 
talks by March 7. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for an immediate decision on issues that will ensure the 
continuation of the peace process and that a further delay will cause serious 
harm to Israel," a party statement said. "The Labor Bureau and the party's 
Parliament faction again emphasize that the condition for the continuation of 
the National Unity government is the continuation of the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
While backing the proposal, Rabin modified it somewhat in public comments. If 
the Cabinet is discussing the issue, the deadline can be postponed until a vote 
takes place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shimon Peres was more emphatic. 
</P>
<P>
"We have within the coming two weeks to make a clear decision as far as Israel 
is concerned, and the clear decision is either yes or no," he said of the peace 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
Likud members, already in turmoil because of accusations by hawkish members 
that Shamir will make significant compromises, were incensed by the Labor move. 
Deputy Foreign Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said flatly: "I don't believe in 
ultimatums. I don't deal with them, and I don't yield to them." 
</P>
<P>
It is Likud dogma that a role for Arabs from East Jerusalem will put Israel's 
control over its own capital at risk. The inclusion of outside members is 
viewed as making way for participation by the PLO -- and with it, demands for 
an independent state and the right of Arab refugees to return to their former 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"Deportees and East Jerusalem Arabs! This is something that is not included in 
the initiative of the Israeli government," said Ronnie Milo, the environment 
minister and a Likud supporter of Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tough talk, Shamir's office has hinted that some form of compromise 
as outlined by Rabin might be acceptable. Shamir has ordered Arens to hear 
Baker out and not reject any compromise formulas out of hand but rather to 
bring them back to Israel for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
These hints of compromise prompted rivals of Shamir to challenge his 
leadership. Ariel Sharon, fresh from quitting Shamir's Cabinet, is carrying on 
a public campaign to unseat the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
"Shamir should reject the Labor ultimatum immediately," Sharon said, pouring 
oil on his inflamed battle with Shamir.

Former President Ronald Reagan's testimony in the case of his former national 
security adviser, Adm. John M. Poindexter, occurred under unusual circumstances 
and was released Thursday in an equally unusual manner. 
</P>
<P>
Out of deference to the former President, Reagan was allowed to give his 
testimony in the form of a deposition before Poindexter's trial rather than 
being required to attend the trial itself, which is scheduled to begin early 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony, which included cross-examination, was recorded on videotape in 
Los Angeles and will be shown to the jury once the actual case begins. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, because of public interest in what the former President had to 
say, Judge Harold H. Greene ordered a full transcript of the testimony 
released. In addition, reporters were allowed to go to the courthouse here 
Thursday to watch the eight-hour videotape of the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
But to avoid prejudicing potential jurors, Greene declined to release the tape 
for broadcast. He imposed no such restriction on reporting the tape's contents.

REAGAN TESTIMONY: A COMPARISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A comparison of some of former President Ronald Reagan's answers to his 
interrogators in the case against John M. Poindexter, his former national 
security adviser, and what has been said previously on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: "Did you authorize the diversion of funds from the Iran arm sales to 
the Contras?" 
</P>
<P>
REAGAN: "I had no knowledge then or now that there had been a diversion . . . . 
All I knew was that there was some money that came from some place in another 
account and that the appearance was that it might have been a part of the 
negotiated sale, and to this day I don't have any information or knowledge that 
. . . there was a diversion." 
</P>
<P>
THE RECORD: Congressional Iran-Contra committees reported in November, 1987, 
that $3.8 million was diverted from the arms sales to the Contras. Poindexter 
has testified that Reagan was never told about the diversion of funds to the 
Contras. 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: "Tell the jury generally about what you knew about what Oliver North 
was doing with regard to helping the situation in Central America vis-a-vis the 
freedom fighters?" 
</P>
<P>
REAGAN: "You have to have people that can be available to make contact with the 
leaders of the Contras and so forth, sometimes closer than just writing a 
letter . . . . It was my understanding . . . that that's what he was doing . . 
. . I know there was another area too in which he participated. Well, for 
example, in the meeting with the Iranians, he was involved in that." 
</P>
<P>
THE RECORD: North has acknowledged that he not only assisted in negotiating the 
sale of weapons to Iran, but also directed a supply operation for the 
Nicaraguan resistance which raised $34 million from other countries and $2.7 
million from private contributors, secured weapons from international suppliers 
and arranged for shipments of arms. 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: "Do you recall being informed generally about that shipment" of U.S. 
Hawk missiles to Iran in late 1985 by Israel -- the first of the arms sales to 
Iran -- during a 1985 meeting in Geneva with Secretary of State George P. 
Shultz and National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane? 
</P>
<P>
REAGAN: "I don't have any recollection of when I was told about that or who 
told me . . . . I don't have a clear recollection of what might have been 
discussed in that meeting of that kind over there in Geneva, there were so many 
meetings and so many different places . . . . 
</P>
<P>
THE RECORD: McFarlane testified he told Shultz and Reagan that Israel was about 
to deliver 80 Hawk missiles to Iran from a warehouse in Portugal and that 
Israel wanted the United States to replace those missiles. The President 
earlier signed documents approving the sale to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
QUESTION: "In a 1985 White House document approving the Iranian arms sale it 
says: 'As part of these efforts, certain foreign material and munitions may be 
provided to the government of Iran which is taking steps to facilitate the 
release of American hostages.' " 
</P>
<P>
REAGAN: "There was no involvement of the government of Iran in this at all and 
so, it was private citizens . . . . And our reward to them for taking that 
action was to sell them the missile shipment that they had asked for." 
</P>
<P>
THE RECORD: The Iran-Contra committees reported that American officials knew 
that the February, 1986, TOW missile shipment to Iran went to the ayatollah's 
Revolutionary Guards. The so-called Second Channel, the Iranian with whom they 
negotiated later shipments, was identified by the congressional panel as a man 
"who had distinguished himself in the ranks of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard 
Corps in the war with Iraq."

EXCERPTS: TOLD AIDES TO ACT 'WITHIN LAW,' REAGAN SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
Here are excerpts from former President Ronald Reagan's testimony as a defense 
witness in the Iran-Contra trial of his former national security adviser, John 
M. Poindexter. Richard W. Beckler, Poindexter's lead attorney, questioned 
Reagan about internal Administration meetings on the "Iran initiative": 
</P>
<P>
Question: Maybe you could tell the jury a little bit about what you recall 
about those meetings and the fact that there was disagreement and so on? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes. I do recall that word had come back from our people dealing with 
the Iranians that they wanted something, some evidence, that would make them 
confident that they were meeting with people who had access to the top levels 
of government in our country. 
</P>
<P>
And the thing that the Iranian representative had suggested was a single 
shipment of TOW anti-tank missiles to be sold to them, not given . . . . 
</P>
<P>
And my word back to our people was that we had a policy that we did not do 
business with a government that supported terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
The answer that came back was that these individuals did not support terrorism, 
and there was some documentation to the effect that they had shown an 
opposition to terrorism wherever they had an opportunity . . . . 
</P>
<P>
And I made the decision that there was one thing upon which we could base 
selling them this single order of TOW missiles that could be transported in a 
single -- in one airplane, and that was that we had some nine hostages being 
held by the Hezbollah, which had a kind of philosophical relationship with 
Iran, and that, if they would use their efforts to get our hostages freed, yes, 
we would make this sale. 
</P>
<P>
They agreed that they would do that. And so the shipment was sent. And I can't 
place the timing, but very shortly thereafter, we had received two of the 
hostages, not together -- one at a time -- and were told that two more would be 
available within probably 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
And it was at about this time that the little weekly newspaper in Beirut 
printed an erroneous story that we were doing business directly with the 
Khomeini and trading arms for hostages. 
</P>
<P>
If you want the disagreement that occurred between our people, some of the 
people said that this would -- they didn't say that it was trading (arms) for 
hostages 'cause it wasn't. My answer -- they said it would be made to appear 
that way if it ever came to light. My answer to that was that, if I had a child 
kidnaped and held for ransom, and if I knew of someone who had perhaps the 
ability to get that child back, it wouldn't be dealing with the kidnapers to 
ask that individual to do that. And it would be perfectly legitimate for me to 
reward that individual for doing this. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Mr. President, perhaps you could explain to the members of the jury whether 
the Contra support, the freedom fighter support, was one of -- was a very 
important issue that concerned you during your tenure as President? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, it was very important. Here was one of the countries in the Americas 
that had evidently been picked for becoming a Soviet satellite. The 
Sandinistas, the revolution to overthrow the dictator, the Sandinistas were a 
part of the revolutionary group. The revolution was also made up of other 
people and citizens of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
And the Sandinistas and the revolution sent to the Organization of American 
States a request that they urge Somoza, the dictator, to step down and end the 
killing in that revolution. And the Organization of American States asked for a 
report as to what were the aims of the revolutionaries who were making this 
request. And they gave those aims, and it was multiple parties. It was freedom 
of choice. It was freedom of press. It was all the things we believe are pure 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
And so the organization asked Somoza, and he said: "If it will save killing 
more people, I will step down." And he did. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Sandinistas were the only organized group in the revolution. They 
seized power. They even exiled some of the leaders of the revolution, jailed 
some of them, and they took over the government. They announced that the 
revolution would not stop at their borders, that they were going to carry it on 
to other countries. They made it very plain that they were going to create what 
they had created, a communist government. 
</P>
<P>
And the people of Nicaragua began trying to revolt, but they would wind up 
herded into jail. I was visited in Washington by two clergymen, neither one of 
whom had any ears. The Sandinistas had cut his ears off. And not a word of that 
had ever appeared in our public press, even though I introduced one man to a 
great group of the press in the East Room of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
And they had a great disinformation campaign, which divided the people outside 
Nicaragua as to who should get support -- the Sandinista government, or the 
group that had seized the government, or the Contras, who were freedom 
fighters, who wanted to have what we have in our own country and that the 
result of the revolution would be a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Now, did there come a time, Mr. President, in 1984 -- early 1984 -- when it 
looked like funds that Congress had provided for Contra support were running 
out? Do you recall that time frame? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you recall what your instructions were to your top people at that time as 
to what ought to be done about this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. My instructions were that whatever we did in trying to maintain the 
existence of the Contras should be done within the law. I emphasized that at 
every time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Mr. President, you said before that getting funds for the Contras was an 
important item for your Administration. Is that correct? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: And -- 
</P>
<P>
A: May I explain? Would this be helpful or would this be appropriate if I 
explained why I feel so strongly about this? 
</P>
<P>
Q: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
A: We know that there were guerrilla groups all over Latin America, all of them 
being supplied with their military power by Castro in Cuba, and which -- and he 
in turn was supplied by the Soviet Union. We only had to heed the words of 
Lenin, which was guiding them, when Lenin said that the Soviet Union would take 
Eastern Europe. It would organize the hordes of Asia, and then it would move on 
to Latin America. And once having taken that, it wouldn't have to take the last 
bastion of capitalism, the United States. The United States would fall into 
their outstretched hand like overripe fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Well, history reveals that the Soviet Union followed that policy and almost up 
to the present head man there. And so, when this was taking place down there, 
when we knew that the Nicaraguan government -- the Sandinista government -- was 
determined that it was going to join the spreading of communism to other 
American countries, there was no way we could sit by in our position here and 
let that happen without giving those freedom fighters the opportunity to fight 
for their freedom. And I saw nothing wrong with that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Now, Mr. President, in addition to this phone call, as I mentioned a little 
while ago, you also had a meeting on May 21 with President Suazo (then the 
president of Honduras) . . . . Once again, this meeting with President Suazo, 
do you recall where it took place? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, I have to recall. I see right here. Took place in the Cabinet room, 
which was usually the meeting place for such things. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you tell the members of the jury what the purpose of this meeting was 
with President Suazo, as best as you can recall? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, I think the description down here of it is pretty accurate. It was to 
provide a public demonstration of the close relationship between our two 
countries and our commitment to their sovereignty and territorial integrity in 
the event that the Nicaraguan government should -- should threaten them with 
any action. And that we were going to continue our support for the -- for the 
freedom fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Mr. President, during some of these meetings, were you given something like 
a 3-by-5 card you would perhaps refer to from time to time to guide you in your 
meetings? I mean, you had so many meetings, I am sure that you would be given 
something. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. And it was simply to outline the subjects of things that I was to see 
if they didn't bring up that we brought up, that we should talk to together . . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Q: Looking at that first paragraph on that page, and I refer you to the 
statement where it says: "Without making the linkage too explicit, it would be 
useful to remind Suazo that in return for our help in the form of security 
assurances as well as aid, we do expect cooperation in pursuit of our mutual 
objectives." 
</P>
<P>
A: Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Perhaps you could explain basically what that refers to? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, again, I think it is the same tone. That we don't want to press them 
to go too far that they challenge the Sandinista government and wind up in open 
hostilities with them. And the -- it would be useful however to remind them for 
our help in the form of security assurances as well as aid that we do expect 
cooperation. That we feel that there is an obligation on their part too. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In 1985 and 1986, did you know -- just tell the jury generally about what 
you knew about what Oliver North was doing with regard to helping the situation 
in Central America vis-a-vis the freedom fighters. 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, you have to have people who can be available to make contact with the 
leaders of the Contras and so forth, sometimes closer than just writing a 
letter. And it was my feeling and my understanding -- I did not meet 
individually with him to any extent at all. But it was my understanding, 
because his name would crop up in memos and so forth, that that's what he was 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
And I am trying to think what the other angle (was). I know that there was 
another area too in which he participated. Well, for example, in the meeting 
with the Iranians, he was involved in that, and I think was actually there in 
the meetings with them. Whether all of the time or not, I am not familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Dan K. Webb, cross-examining Reagan about a letter Poindexter sent 
Congress on July 21, 1986, about National Security Council involvement in 
aiding the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Let me ask you this question based on your role as chief executive of this 
nation. If the information that Robert McFarlane provided to you in 1985 is 
false, contained lies and deceived and obstructed Congress, would it still be 
your belief that John Poindexter should readopt those false statements in 
responding to Congress on July 21, 1986? . . . 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, I simply -- no, I did not have this information, but I have a great 
deal of confidence in the man who was quoted as sending those letters, 
McFarlane. And I have never . . . caught him or seen him doing anything that 
was in any way out of line or dishonest. And so I was perfectly willing to 
accept his defense. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I understand. But I am just asking you, as I understand it -- am I correct, 
Mr. President, that the letter that you were looking at there from John 
Poindexter dated July 21, 1986, you, yourself, actually did not approve and 
authorize those letters at the time they were sent? Is that correct? 
</P>
<P>
A: I have no recollection of doing so. But that could be my memory. I don't 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I take it as the chief executive and as President of the United States, you 
did not want or did you authorize your top officials of your Administration to 
provide false information to Congress? Is that a fair statement? 
</P>
<P>
A: That is a fair statement. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Let me call your attention to one specific thing that I think you testified 
to on direct. 
</P>
<P>
As I understand, on direct examination, you related to some extent that your 
attorney general, Ed Meese, on or about Nov. 24, 1986, after making some type 
of evaluation and inquiry into the Iranian arms sale initiative advised you 
that he had discovered that there was some Swiss bank accounts involved, and 
that money out of the Iranian arms sales appeared to have gone in some way to 
assist the Contras. Do you recall that? 
</P>
<P>
A: What I testified is that that's what was being published and carried on by 
the press. But to this day, all I know is that some sum of money over and above 
the $12.2-million purchase price appeared in a Swiss bank account in which it 
was said that account had been used on other occasions to provide help to the 
Contras. And to this day, I still with all the investigations that have been 
made, I still have never been given one iota of evidence as to who collected 
the price, who delivered the final delivery of the weapons, or what was -- 
whether there was ever more money in that Swiss account that had been diverted 
someplace else. I am still waiting to find those things out and have never 
found them out. 
</P>
<P>
Q: . . . My question only to you, sir, is: To the extent that there was in fact 
a diversion of proceeds, did you in any way approve or authorize that while you 
were President of the United States? 
</P>
<P>
A: For heaven's sake, no. And when I was once asked about that extra money and 
said if it was an added sum to the purchase price, what would I do, I said I 
would have given it back. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Mr. President, when your Tower Commission reported back to you in March of 
1987, did the Tower Commission not tell you, Mr. President, Oliver North and 
your National Security Council were involved in 1985 and 1986 in assisting the 
Contras militarily and paramilitarily? Do you recall that being told to you by 
your Tower Commission? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't recall that, and I can only tell you that my interest in that 
commission was to find out the thing that I still do not know, and that was how 
did there turn out to be more money than the 12 million two for the TOW 
anti-tank missiles, who delivered and who -- obviously, it seemed to me that 
someone must have raised the price for those, but that was never found out. I 
still do not know.

Tornadoes touched down Thursday in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia as a 
powerful storm surged through the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the twisters and accompanying thunderstorms damaged dozens of 
homes and left at least 15 people injured. 
</P>
<P>
The first two tornadoes touched down just after midnight in Pass Christian, 
Miss., on the Gulf Coast about 25 miles west of Biloxi. At least 30 homes were 
damaged, but no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next several hours, heavy rain flooded two dozen homes and washed out 
a bridge in Hattiesburg, Miss., forcing the closing of about 40 streets. 
</P>
<P>
A tornado touched down just before dawn at Opp, Ala., injuring about 10 people 
and toppling trees and power lines throughout the town, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm knocked out power and covered streets with the mangled remains of 
trees. Witnesses said windows were blown out in downtown stores, and some 
neighborhoods had widespread damage. 
</P>
<P>
As the storm moved northeast, it left a path of destruction across several 
rural Alabama counties. At least 15 people were injured in Alabama. A tornado 
touched down at Columbus, Ga., but there were no reports of injuries or major 
damage.

WAIT FOR B-2 TESTS, CONGRESS URGED; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: INVESTIGATORS FAVOR A SLOWDOWN UNTIL THE BOMBER IS SHOWN TO PERFORM AS 
ADVERTISED. THE AIRCRAFT'S BACKERS SAY DELAYS WILL BOOST COSTS.

In a blow to supporters of the B-2 Stealth bomber, the General Accounting 
Office said Thursday that it would be "prudent" to reduce funding and 
production until tests show whether the plane can perform as advertised. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the current acquisition plan, 31 aircraft will be on order and over $48 
billion will have been appropriated before anyone knows whether the B-2 will do 
its job," a top official of Congress' investigative agency told the House Armed 
Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Frank C. Conahan, who heads the GAO's defense section, suggested that the 
agency favors suspending or drastically cutting production for three years 
while tests are conducted on the B-2's ability to evade radar and perform 
complex electronic tasks. 
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that the GAO lacks data on how much delays would cost 
and whether it would be worth the risk, instead, to continue with production 
and correct any errors with retrofits. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in presenting a 26-page report on problems in the program, Conahan urged 
that the Pentagon provide cost estimates on alternatives to the full-paced 
production requested by President Bush for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has asked for $5.3 billion in fiscal 1991 to build five planes beyond the 
16 already in the pipeline, only one of which has actually flown. The Air Force 
has proposed building a total of 133, at a projected cost that has grown in 
four years from $58.2 billion to $70.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the B-2 program immediately seized on the GAO report as ammunition 
in what is expected to be one of the most fiercely fought battles over defense 
spending this year. 
</P>
<P>
B-2 proponents sharply attacked the report, protesting that it failed to 
estimate costs of dramatically slowing production. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Norm Dicks (D-Wash.) claimed that the Air Force and Northrop Corp., the 
prime contractor, figure that a one-year shutdown would cost $4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
And Rep. William L. (Bill) Dickinson (R-Ala.) expressed the fear that idling 
production lines would drive up costs and doom the program. 
</P>
<P>
Stretching out production, he said, could escalate per-unit costs from the 
current estimate of $530 million to as much as $1 billion, making the B-2 an 
easy target for budget-cutters. 
</P>
<P>
"As the target gets bigger, people say, 'Hell, we don't need that, let's take 
that money and keep that base open in my district or build the V-22" Osprey 
tilt-rotor aircraft, another controversial program, Dickinson said. 
</P>
<P>
And delays could severely disrupt production lines in California and elsewhere, 
he added. The bulk of the work for the B-2 is done in Northrop plants in Pico 
Rivera and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got several thousand people who have gone through (security) clearances 
to get a job," he said. "We can't keep these people in limbo and put them 
through retraining and recertification. I think that would be the surest way of 
killing the program, if we put it on a one- or two-year hold (while we) finish 
answering all the questions." 
</P>
<P>
The House odd couple that is spearheading opposition to the B-2 -- liberal Rep. 
Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) and conservative Rep. John R. Kasich (R-Ohio) -- 
praised the GAO findings but suggested the agency should have recommended 
canceling the program outright. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I'm disappointed that you did not draw the only logical conclusion 
you could draw," Kasich said. 
</P>
<P>
Dellums said that even if the cost and test results were "reasonable," the new 
plane has "very dubious value" as a strategic weapon intended to penetrate 
Soviet air defenses. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement responding to the GAO report, the Air Force called the B-2 "both 
affordable and essential" and said that flight tests to date have been 
successful. It noted that on-board testing of sophisticated electronics 
equipment will begin on schedule in fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"Any slippage of the production schedule will only create program instability 
and increase costs," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop spokesman Loye Miller, asked for comment on the GAO report, said only 
that the Air Force response was about "as succinct a positive statement that 
they've given on the B-2 in quite a while." 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson chided Conahan for not including in his report "good news" about the 
B-2's successful tests. 
</P>
<P>
Conahan said that only 31 hours of a 3,600-hour test program had been 
completed, focusing on airworthiness. The B-1 bomber also was successful in 
early tests, he noted, but ran into severe difficulty later with electronic 
systems that required expensive retrofits. 
</P>
<P>
He said that production should be slowed in other costly programs, such as the 
SSN 21 submarine, until testing is completed.

STUDY FINDS CONTRACEPTIVES SAVE $1.8 BILLION EACH YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Public money invested in family planning services saves taxpayers an estimated 
$1.8 billion a year in funds that would otherwise be spent on medical, welfare 
and nutritional costs resulting from unplanned pregnancies, according to a new 
study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly funded family planning services prevented up to 3.1 million unwanted 
pregnancies, according to the report issued by the Alan Guttmacher Institute. 
It estimated that without government support for these family planning 
services, between 1.2 million and 2.1 million unintended pregnancies would 
occur each year, and at least four in 10 of these would end in abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The report provides the first data since 1979 on the cost effectiveness of 
publicly funded family planning services. It said the services "play an 
important role in the United States by allowing substantial numbers of women to 
prevent unintended pregnancies, births and abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"The amounts spent to provide these services are small relative to those for 
many other types of health care, but they result in large savings," added the 
study, which is being presented at the National Family Planning and 
Reproductive Health Assn. meeting here today. Almost one in four American women 
who use contraception relies on a publicly funded source of care, either a 
family planning clinic or a private physician reimbursed by Medicaid, the 
report said. (The figures did not include sterilization.) The institute, a 
nonprofit organization that conducts research and policy analysis on 
reproduction and health care issues, was formerly associated with Planned 
Parenthood but has been independent for the past 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1987, federal and state governments spent $412 million on 
contraceptive services for women who otherwise might not have been able to 
obtain them, the study said. Without such services, the additional public 
expenses for medical care, welfare and supplementary nutritional programs, or 
for publicly funded abortions, would have cost an estimated $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"These savings represent an average of $4.40 saved for every dollar of public 
funds spent to provide contraceptive services," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
But the report added that public spending for contraceptive services, when 
adjusted for inflation, has actually declined during the last 10 years. It also 
noted that "political conflict about family planning services has meant 
continual battles over the existence of such services and the form they should 
take, as well as over levels of program funding." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Tew, a spokeswoman for the institute, said that she couldn't "understand 
why anyone opposed to abortion could oppose contraceptive services. One reason 
we have so many abortions is because we have so many unintended pregnancies in 
this country." 
</P>
<P>
But Doug Johnson, a spokesman for the anti-abortion National Right to Life, 
said that "in recent years, these (family planning) programs have become 
entangled in abortion-related services. Some groups are trying to advance a 
pro-abortion agenda under the cloak of contraception." 
</P>
<P>
He called the timing of the Guttmacher study "no accident," since the Senate is 
about to take up re-authorization for Title X of the Public Health Service Act, 
which provides support for family planning and education services. Since it was 
enacted in 1970, the law has provided millions of low-income women with access 
to comprehensive family planning, basic health screening and referral 
information. While no Title X funds may be used to pay for abortions, clinics 
may nevertheless refer women to other facilities that perform them. 
</P>
<P>
The study referred to the recent decision by Gov. George Deukmejian to allow a 
$20-million family planning bill to become law without his signature. The study 
noted that in 1989 he had cut state funding to family planning clinics by 
two-thirds, saying he did not believe the services had saved the state any 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Tew said that the institute was studying the California figures and was 
planning to look at the specific cost/benefit ratio there. "We hope to have 
that information in a couple of months," she said. "We really want to point to 
that."

FOR UNINDICTED DEPUTIES, THE CLOUD WON'T GO AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He reads, he watches television, he tinkers with the family car. He talks on 
the telephone. At night, he tries to sleep, but the question is always on his 
mind: Will he be indicted? 
</P>
<P>
"You're awake all night," he said, describing the pattern of his life for 
nearly five months. "There are times I watch TV all night. Just all-night 
movies." 
</P>
<P>
Like seven of his colleagues, the veteran sheriff's deputy is still in limbo, 
living under a cloud. He was among the fortunate ones Thursday -- those not 
named in indictments handed down by a federal grand jury. But he remains a 
suspect in the far-reaching money-skimming investigation, in which 10 Los 
Angeles County sheriff's narcotics officers are now formally accused of 
stealing cash confiscated in drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been five months of waiting, listening to rumor," said the deputy, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. "I know I haven't done anything (wrong). But I 
feel confident they're going to dig something up, even if they're going to have 
to invent it. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know what silly thing these people are going to do next." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Thursday, investigators offered few clues about the 
possible fate of the remaining eight suspects. But several officials, including 
Lawrence Lawler, FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, stressed 
that the probe is continuing. Lawler urged the public to help with additional 
information that might advance the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who has knowledge . . . should come forth to the Sheriff's Department, 
the Internal Revenue Service or the FBI so we can make sure the investigation 
is done thoroughly and that it's over with as quickly as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal, one of the largest ever to rock the Sheriff's Department, broke on 
Sept. 1, when an FBI sting operation implicated nine members of an elite 
drug-enforcement team headed by Sgt. Robert R. Sobel. Nine other deputies were 
suspended on Oct. 3 as the investigation broadened. 
</P>
<P>
All eight deputies who escaped indictment were members of the group suspended 
in October. The unindicted officers are Deputies John Edner, Roger Garcia, 
Edward Jamison, J. C. Miller, Leo Michael Newman, Stephen Nichols and Sgts. 
Robert Tolmaire and Kenneth Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"This does nothing for me; I'm still in limbo," Jamison said after Thursday's 
indictments. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McDermott, attorney for Newman, said: "His misfortune was having a 
business with one of the original nine (suspended deputies)." Newman was a 
partner of Deputy Daniel M. Garner in a classic car restoration shop in the 
city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"After we released his business records, the investigators assured us he was no 
longer being scrutinized," McDermott said. "The shop wasn't the extravagant 
money-laundering operation they thought it was." 
</P>
<P>
Newman himself has refused to comment, saying he hopes to be reinstated in the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols could not be reached. But his attorney, Brian A. Sun, said, "Our view 
is that we deny that he skimmed drug money and we expect him to be cleared." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols' teen-age son, Ryan, said the family was relieved that Nichols was not 
indicted. "It's been tough," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Other deputies reached by The Times declined to publicly discuss the case, 
expressing fears of being fired or facing other kinds of reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
The one deputy who spoke anonymously complained about the way he has been 
treated. He said investigators found nothing when they searched his home, but 
the sheriff suspended him and ordered him to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
"You're confined to your home from 8:30 to 5," he said. "What it boils down to 
is, you're under house arrest." 
</P>
<P>
The deputy called the investigation "ludicrous," saying he is sure of his own 
innocence as well as that of several colleagues. The suspicions will 
permanently blacken his reputation, even if he is later exonerated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension has placed stress on his family, he said. Former friends now 
avoid him. Much of his moral support comes from the other deputies under the 
same cloud, whom he talks with regularly by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to describe . . . the idleness, the embarrassment," said the 
veteran narcotics officer. "It's like you're out there all by yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"They're grabbing at anything and destroying people's lives," he said. "What 
astounds me is the amount of money and time and manpower that have been spent 
(on the investigation). This money and manpower weren't available to us to go 
out and put real criminals in jail.

RTD GENERAL MANAGER LOSES POWER TO AWARD BIG CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rapid Transit District General Manager Alan Pegg, under increasing pressure 
from RTD board members who have criticized his judgment, was stripped Thursday 
of his power to award contracts in excess of $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pegg, 44, has run the RTD since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He has recently come under heavy attack from at least five members of the 
11-member board, in part for awarding a $99,500 contract to a firm that hired 
Long Beach City Councilwoman Jan Hall the same day she resigned from the RTD 
board to become a lobbyist for the transit district. 
</P>
<P>
Although the board later rescinded the contract, citing a conflict of interest, 
Pegg's judgment was further questioned after it was disclosed that he had also 
awarded a $99,000 contract to another firm to provide an assistant general 
manager in charge of the Metro Rail subway project. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 7 to 3 to limit Pegg's authority to award contracts without its 
consent to $25,000, instead of the $100,000 limit he previously had.

KERATOTOMY FOUND EFFECTIVE BUT UNPREDICTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two-thirds of those who had eye surgery to correct nearsightedness were able to 
see without glasses four years later, but doctors still cannot predict the 
outcome of the costly operation, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
"Our study and others have demonstrated fairly well that there are some adverse 
outcomes, but they are relatively rare," said John Carter, coordinator of the 
study, based at Emory University in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery, known as radial keratotomy, is painless and can be performed on an 
outpatient basis. It involves making cuts in the cornea in a pattern resembling 
the spokes of a wheel. The purpose of the procedure, introduced in 1976, is to 
reduce the cornea's curvature. It costs about $2,000 per eye, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
For four years, researchers tracked 390 patients who had undergone the surgery 
on one eye between March, 1982, and October, 1983. Visual sharpness was 
improved to better than 20/40 in 76% of eyes, the researchers reported. 
</P>
<P>
Most patients -- 69% -- had visual sharpness of 20/200 or worse before the 
operation, and none had sharpness better than 20/40, the researchers reported 
in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But 11 patients who had 20/20 vision or better with corrective lenses before 
the surgery suffered a significant loss of visual sharpness after the 
procedure, even with glasses or contact lenses, they reported. 
</P>
<P>
Infections developed in two patients, who were successfully treated with 
antibiotics and without vision loss, Carter said in a telephone interview 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 323 patients who had both eyes operated on, 64% said they wore no 
corrective lenses four years after the surgery, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is generally thought to be a safe procedure -- and effective -- and it does 
result in the reduction of myopia," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
"A major qualifier is (that) no surgeon can tell a patient exactly what his 
outcome will be," Carter said. "There's unpredictability." 
</P>
<P>
The study did reveal that patients who started with the most visual acuity, or 
sharpness, before surgery came closest to full restoration of acuity after the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
But the unpredictability of the outcome of the procedure remains 
"unacceptable," the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's safe to say that the predictability is better now than it was, 
but there's still a range of outcomes," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Perry S. Binder of UC San Diego cautioned that radial keratotomy "is not 
intended for all myopic patients just because they wish to see without 
spectacles or contacts." 
</P>
<P>
Besides unpredictability and instability of the eye's effectiveness as a lens 
after surgery, the tissue being operated on is healthy, making surgeons who do 
not specialize in the procedure leery of it, Binder said in an editorial in 
Friday's Journal.

COUNTING ON SPRING STREET TO BOUNCE BACK; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: NEW STATE OFFICE BUILDING, OPENING LATER THIS YEAR, WILL BRING 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND -- MOST BELIEVE -- A RESURGENCE FOR THE AREA.

Although it can discourage customers, the World Wide Travel Agency on 4th 
Street in downtown Los Angeles operates behind firmly locked doors. 
</P>
<P>
"We have locked the doors since we were robbed at gunpoint last year," 
explained Allcia Imp, who founded the agency 39 years ago. But Imp and her son, 
Victor Almacellas, who run the agency, are hoping to unlock those doors by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
A block away, George Kalebdjian, manager of the flagship store of the 29-outlet 
Eagleson's Big &amp; Tall haberdashery chain, is upgrading his window displays 
and all but rubbing his hands in anticipation. "Three-thousand employees and 
10,000 (people) in and out daily," he said, smiling. "Somebody has to see us. 
We have got to do a little bit of business with that." 
</P>
<P>
What fuels the thinking of these entrepreneurs is the partially completed 
Ronald Reagan State Office Building, scheduled to open in December, that 
occupies most of the downtown block bounded by 3rd, Main, 4th and Spring 
streets. The building will include office space for 30 state agencies and the 
state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The tenacious larger tenants of surrounding storefronts are remodeling and 
gearing up for a comeback from the disastrous slump their businesses underwent 
after Los Angeles' financial center abandoned Spring Street a decade or so ago. 
</P>
<P>
But at the corner of 4th and Main, a far less enthusiastic Matel Jimenez 
wonders if high rents, the opening of the new building and other new 
construction will drive his 24-year-old food stand, Taco Neta, out of business. 
He is thinking of moving, or simply retiring. 
</P>
<P>
"They will have a cafeteria so they won't come to my stand," Jimenez said. 
"It'll be like the RTD (a block south). They have maybe 2,000 people there, but 
they have a cafeteria and they don't go out much." 
</P>
<P>
Some other small business operators, who have suffered from the noise, dirt and 
blocked sidewalks of the construction years, are wondering the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Young Kim, who operates Pete's Grandburger, a 12-stool diner at 3rd and Main 
that serves about 100 customers a day, doesn't see the huge state office 
complex as a potential gold mine. He also is considering retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Redevelopment Agency, with offices next to the Reagan building at 
4th and Spring, waged a major effort to locate the new complex in the rundown 
neighborhood just south of City Hall specifically to upgrade the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The area includes several historic 80-year-old buildings that have stood vacant 
and decaying since the city's financial center moved west to the 
Flower-Figueroa area a decade ago. The Spring Street area has attracted the 
homeless because of nearby service agencies like the Union Rescue Mission on 
Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA's plan already appears to be working. 
</P>
<P>
When the project began in 1981, said CRA Administrator John Tuite, land on the 
west side of Spring Street was selling for $110 a square foot, while land east 
of Main, the old Skid Row area, went for $50 to $60. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Tuite said, prices have risen to $150-$160 a square foot west of Spring 
and $100 east of Main, primarily because of the new state office complex and 
the activity it is expected to generate. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the newly built or remodeled retail and office space in the area still 
stands vacant, but optimistic owners feel certain that once the 30 state 
agencies move in, lawyers, contractors and others who do business with the 
state will follow, with restaurants and other service-oriented businesses close 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
"In a nutshell, the Reagan office building will act as a catalyst and 
stabilizing force by bringing 3,000 white-collar workers downtown," said 
Leonard G. Glickman, president of the Spring Street Assn., which promotes 
redevelopment along the historic commercial thoroughfare. "It is sort of like 
the honey, and now the bees will start to come." 
</P>
<P>
Ari Sikora, development director for LCF Corp., which owns a 13-story, 
78-year-old office building at 311 S. Spring, said her firm has been preparing 
for "the golden goose" the last two years with a massive renovation program. 
When the state building opens, she expects her own building's former 80% 
occupancy rate to soar to full with a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
No tenants have been evicted, she said, but many low-budget importers and bail 
bondsmen have already left the building voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people just saw the state construction going up and made assumptions 
about the upgrading of the neighborhood, and our building, and future rent," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Mansour, owner of the 33-year-old Europa Grocery Co., a delicatessen at 
3rd and Main that serves 550 customers a day, is trying to expand the offerings 
in his limited space in anticipation of additional customers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the optimists, Mansour believes the presence of 3,000 office workers 
across the street will mean greater safety, cleanliness and general prosperity 
for the area after some lean years. 
</P>
<P>
"They will clean up the neighborhood. There won't be the bums laying around," 
he said confidently. "We will have better customers and less headaches." 
</P>
<P>
Of the handful who feel their businesses have been hurt by the project, Ruth 
Moscoso is the most outspoken. 
</P>
<P>
Moscoso owns Ruth's Shrimp House, a take-out storefront at 357 S. Main in the 
rundown, largely vacant Barclay Hotel. Standing in her dusty, empty shop one 
recent weekday lunch hour, Moscoso said business has dropped off by at least a 
third during the two-year construction of the state building. 
</P>
<P>
She pointed with disgust to the two lanes of one-way northbound Main Street 
occupied by construction machinery and vehicles blocking drive-up access to her 
shop. A sign at 4th Street restricting sidewalk use, she said, also discourages 
walk-in customers. 
</P>
<P>
Because access to their businesses has been curtailed, Moscoso and Ricardo 
Custodio, owner of the neighboring L.A.F.E. Shoe Repair, were paid up to $13 a 
day for 18 months of the construction. But the work has continued beyond the 18 
months. Moscoso complains that contractors failed to fulfill other promises. 
The result, she said, is that customers have a hard time finding her. 
</P>
<P>
"They were supposed to give me a sign and lights. You call that a sign?" she 
exclaimed, pointing to the bent tin sign above her front door proclaiming 
'Ruth's Shrimp House, Shrimp, Chili, Hamburgers, Food to Take Out.' 
</P>
<P>
"That is a poster!" she said. "They said, 'What the hell do you want -- like in 
Las Vegas?' I said that would be a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
Like many of her neighbors, Moscoso can't decide her own future until her 
landlord acts. She may move. Now 70, she also thinks of retiring. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the pessimists is Jimmy Bell, who has operated a women's discount 
clothing store on 3rd Street for 32 years, once in a bustling third-floor loft 
where the new Reagan building now stands, and now in a small street-level shop 
across 3rd. 
</P>
<P>
"We have suffered during the construction because we don't have any parking on 
the street," he said, sadly surveying his empty shop. 
</P>
<P>
He is afraid to rely on state employees patronizing his shop and fears rent 
hikes and even ouster if a developer should move to tear down the strip of 
ramshackle storefronts and build something new. 
</P>
<P>
"I am too young to retire," Bell said, "but the way business has been going, 
maybe I can't continue." 
</P>
<P>
Parking has always been "the Achilles heel" for Spring Street, according to 
Glickman of the Spring Street Assn. But he and the CRA believe that problem 
will be eased by the new Broadway-Spring Center parking structure across Spring 
Street from the new state building. The structure, which also has lease space 
for shops and restaurants, has 650 parking spaces for state employees and 
another 624 for the public. The new office building itself has 250 parking 
spaces for state officials. 
</P>
<P>
The man who owns Joe's Auto Park surface lots on Spring, 3rd and Main and at 
the Broadway-Spring Center is cautiously optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been waiting for this for the last 10 years," said Henry Lumer Sr., who 
started the parking and development firm with his father, Joe, on the site of 
the new state building 33 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Business has been really, really bad, because all the buildings around here 
are vacant," said Lumer, who is now trying to lease two floors of office space 
vacant since the 1971 earthquake in the Eagleson's building he owns. "I am sure 
this is going to be a change for the better . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Back at their 4th Street travel agency, Imp and Almacellas, who have had to 
make "house calls" to customers in the downtown area, are particularly eager 
for the improved security they believe the Reagan building will bring. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a vast improvement for our business because . . . the CRA has 
committed itself to clean up the streets," said Almacellas. "So as soon as the 
state employees actually move in, there will be more security. The area will be 
cleaned up as to the vagrants, the drugs, the prostitution." 
</P>
<P>
The CRA's Tuite shares that belief, noting the agency has worked diligently 
with the Los Angeles Police Department to beef up patrols and booking 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"The more people down here to do business, the more secure the neighborhood 
will be," Tuite said, bolstering the hopes of Imp and Almacellas that they can 
soon safely unlock their doors to welcome more customers.

MOVE OF UCLA LAB SCHOOL TO PROCEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA will proceed with a controversial plan to move its prestigious laboratory 
elementary school to a nearby public school district, university officials 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Going ahead with the move of the 108-year-old Corinne A. Seeds University 
Elementary School to the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District is 
contingent on its independence being assured, said UCLA Executive Vice 
Chancellor Murray L. Schwartz. Chancellor Charles E. Young, who made the 
decision, was out of the country this week and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a done deal," Schwartz said, "but we believe this is an exciting and 
important experiment -- taking an excellent school and seeing whether the 
techniques developed there can be successful in a more urban setting." 
</P>
<P>
The decision was denounced by leaders of the Family School Alliance, a group of 
laboratory school parents and others who charge that the primary motivation for 
the move is to free up the nine-acre site for other uses on the increasingly 
crowded Westwood campus. UCLA officials, while conceding that space is a 
problem, deny that it is the reason for the move. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really disturbing that UCLA seems bent on (the move) without regard to 
what faculty of the Graduate School of Education, UES staff, parents and alumni 
have had to say about it," said Kathy Seal, one of the parents opposing the 
move. "We really question their assertion that the autonomy of the school can 
be preserved in a public school setting." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the state, the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District and 
others must give permission before the relocation can take place, Seal said the 
alliance plans to "redouble our efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We will fight this through the courts, the Legislature and every other avenue 
that is open to us," Seal said. 
</P>
<P>
Tentative plans call for UCLA to construct an elementary school for the Santa 
Monica school district. The school and an adjacent university research center, 
to be built on a park in the economically and ethnically diverse Ocean Park 
neighborhood, would be staffed and run by UCLA for at least 25 years. State 
funds to the Santa Monica district would be used to operate the new school, 
according to district Supt. Eugene Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said Thursday that school board members, who will not vote on the 
proposal until a contract has been worked out, have assured UCLA that it would 
continue to have "complete autonomy" over the experimental school. The students 
would be drawn from the surrounding neighborhood, but any parent who 
disapproved of the non-graded, highly experimental nature of the lab facility 
could choose another school in the district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heidi Brandt, Family School Alliance president, said the school's independence 
is a key issue, and added she has long been concerned about lack of detailed 
assurances that it can indeed be maintained. "Words are cheap . . . but we have 
not been shown how autonomy can be guaranteed in a public school setting," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Consideration of the move, which has been vigorously opposed by staff, parents 
and alumni of the lab school and others, began more than a year ago when UCLA 
made plans to build a new graduate business school on part of the elementary 
school's site along Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not surprising but it is disappointing, especially since another 
option (to allow the lab school to share the site with the management school 
and build an educational research center there) has the support of most of the 
(graduate school) faculty and others," said Richard Williams, lab school 
director and professor of education. 
</P>
<P>
"It does indeed put them one step further down the road, but there are so many 
problems that they haven't yet even begun to deal with," said Williams, who, 
like the rest of the faculty, received a memo Thursday telling of the 
chancellor's decision. Lab school parents were sent letters the same day, UCLA 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really going to heat up now. . . . It will be a major, major test" of 
whether the move is feasible, Williams added. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis C. Solmon, dean of the Graduate School of Education, which runs the 
laboratory school, hailed the decision as an "exciting, interesting challenge . 
. . and an opportunity to do some innovative things in the public schools." 
</P>
<P>
"This could really be a benchmark collaboration between the university and a 
school district. We could do some very important applied research on the 
relevant education issues in our society today." 
</P>
<P>
Solmon said he and others met with education officials in Sacramento last week 
about the possibility of getting certain waivers from the state to enable the 
school to continue its innovations and got a "very enthusiastic" response. 
</P>
<P>
The lab school's 450 students, ages 4 to 12, are drawn from throughout Los 
Angeles County and are chosen to reflect the nation's population distribution 
ethnically and economically. 
</P>
<P>
Students are studied by UCLA researchers and others, and the staff has long 
been free to experiment with techniques. The students are taught by teams of 
teachers who have generous blocks of time for preparation, and no grades or 
tests are given.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY INVITES MANDELA TO SPEAK AT RALLY 
IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley has invited anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela to stop in 
Los Angeles to address a rally for interracial harmony when Mandela visits the 
United States, the mayor's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The rally could be held in the 92,000-seat Memorial Coliseum, Bradley said in a 
letter sent to Mandela in care of the African National Congress representative 
at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said the city would pay for all expenses related to Mandela's visit 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, freed earlier this month after 27 years in prison in South Africa, has 
already accepted an invitation from President Bush to come to Washington, but 
no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Vallee Bunting, the mayor's press deputy, said Bradley has not yet received a 
response from Mandela.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WORKERS MARCH TO DOOR OF EX-EMPLOYER, 
DEMAND PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four undocumented workers who said they were cheated out of $1,600 in back pay 
by their former employer marched down a quiet suburban street to the man's 
rented hilltop home in Granada Hills Thursday, demanding payment. 
</P>
<P>
The men were joined by about 20 other immigrant workers in a demonstration 
outside Fernando Esquivia's two-story home on Elnora Place. 
</P>
<P>
Many carried placards with the messages, "No More Abuse for Undocumented 
Workers," and "We Are Not Animals. We are Human Beings. Exercise Social Justice 
for Undocumented Workers." 
</P>
<P>
The men, accompanied by reporters and representatives from the Coalition for 
Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles, knocked on the door of the home, but no 
one answered. 
</P>
<P>
Esquivia, in a later interview, said that he did not owe the men any money. 
</P>
<P>
"They're liars," Esquivia said. "If I owed them money, I would give it to them. 
I'm not guilty."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GILLESPIE ASSAILED FOR 'PASSIVE STANCE' ON 
AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen AIDS activists from the ACT UP Los Angeles organization demonstrated 
Thursday at the Los Angeles offices of Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, 
protesting what they said was Gillespie's failure to try to stop discrimination 
by health insurers against AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
"As the AIDS epidemic enters its second decade, insurers are systematically 
conspiring to diminish their policy holders coverage," said a statement from 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
It went on to accuse the Department of Insurance of taking "a passive stance" 
as many persons have been denied coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie responded by having aides hand out a statement that said her 
department has tried to consult with concerned parties on the problem, but that 
there have been few actual complaints. The statement said that this, in part, 
was because people with AIDS are afraid they will be identified publicly if 
they make complaints.

SCREENING FOR SICKLE-CELL ANEMIA TO BE EXPANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Health Director Kenneth Kizer said that next week the state will 
offer expanded screening of babies for sickle-cell anemia as part of an effort 
to lower the black infant mortality rate. Kizer announced the plan Thursday 
during a tour of Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
/Drew Medical Center in Watts, one of four hospitals statewide that will share 
a grant of $1.3 million to expand prenatal services to black women. 
</P>
<P>
The infant mortality rate statewide is 8.6 babies for every 1,000; the rate 
among blacks is 15.8 per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said that, beginning Wednesday, the state will make sickle-cell anemia 
screening available to each of the estimated 525,000 infants born in California 
each year. The $365,000 set aside for King will go toward a collaborative 
effort with the Watts Health Foundations to expand maternal services in Compton 
and South Los Angeles. The state also awarded grants to the West Oakland Health 
Council, the East Bay Perinatal Council and San Joaquin General Hospital.

DECADE ENDED IN BLAZE OF HATE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIMES: THE NUMBER OF THREATS AND ASSAULTS AGAINST BLACKS, JEWS AND GAYS LAST 
YEAR WERE TOPS IN THE '80S, THE COUNTY'S HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In January of last year, a black family in Tujunga discovered a noose hanging 
from a tree on their front lawn. A racial epithet was chalked on the tree 
trunk. 
</P>
<P>
In February, a young "skinhead" in La Crescenta threatened his Jewish teacher 
with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
In June, two "gay bashers" attacked a man in Hollywood, beating him with bricks 
and rocks until his leg and ribs were broken. 
</P>
<P>
Those were just three of 378 hate crimes -- those motivated by race, religion 
or sexual orientation -- that were reported in Los Angeles County in 1989, 
making it the worst year for such activity in the past decade, according to two 
studies released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The reports, released by the county's Commission on Human Relations, say hate 
crimes rose throughout the county last year, with racially motivated crimes 
outnumbering those prompted by religion for the first time since the commission 
began collecting statistics a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the commission said, 167 race-related crimes were reported, 
representing a 75% increase over 1988. Meanwhile, crimes against religious 
groups went up 12.6% in the same period, from 111 to 125. The panel also 
documented 86 hate crimes based on sexual orientation, a 41% increase from 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Mornell, the commission's executive director, described the findings as 
"extremely disturbing." However, he noted, the studies did reveal one bright 
spot: authorities made 90 arrests for hate crimes in 1989, three times the 
previous record for annual arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who held a press conference 
Thursday to announce the findings, added: "There is both bad news and good news 
in these reports, although unfortunately the bad news outweighs the good." 
</P>
<P>
The commission, created in 1944, is one of the oldest agencies of its kind in 
the United States. It is charged with promoting racial and religious harmony as 
well as monitoring violence between ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commission believes hate crimes are still vastly under-reported, 
Mornell said the rising statistics may be attributed in part to increased 
reporting by victims. But mostly, he said, population shifts have caused ethnic 
tensions to rise, particularly as whites have become a minority in many areas 
of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Mornell said, the problem is likely to get worse before it gets 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"The population is changing," he said, "and people will continue to feel 
fearful and threatened." 
</P>
<P>
Although hate crimes against Latinos, Middle Easterners and Asians are 
increasing, blacks and Jews are by far the most frequent targets, the 
commission reported. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission believes that anti-Jewish and anti-black bigotry are perhaps 
the most firmly entrenched forms of prejudice in our society," the panel wrote 
in a review of the past 10 years called "A Decade of Bigotry." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, during the 1980s, 62% of all racially motivated crimes were directed at 
blacks, while 92% of all religious crimes were directed at Jews. By comparison, 
Muslims were the second-most frequent target of crimes against any religious 
group, accounting for just 3% of all such incidents in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
David Lehrer, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith, 
said the county's findings generally parallel those of his organization. Lehrer 
cited skinhead youth gangs -- who are often associated with white supremacist 
causes -- "trash TV talk shows" and a "decline in public civility," as reasons 
for the rise in crimes against Jews. 
</P>
<P>
The commission reported that young white men are most often responsible for 
hate crimes, and that graffiti -- insulting remarks scrawled on homes, 
businesses and houses of worship -- is the most common form of such crime. 
</P>
<P>
But violent acts certainly played a role in the statistics, especially in 
crimes against lesbians and homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
During 1988 and 1989, the only years that the commission has gathered 
statistics on crimes motivated by sexual orientation, assaults accounted for 
nearly two-thirds of such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The commission reported that some victims suffered long-term disability from 
the attacks. "The term gay-bashing," it wrote, "is unfortunately accurate." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Coleman Jr., coordinator of an anti-violence hot line run by the Los 
Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, agreed. He said verbal abuse 
against gays is decreasing but violence is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
"People are being shot at, being beaten, being robbed and during the robbery, 
during the beating, people will make references to sexual orientation and that 
really does concern us," he said. "It represents not only a problem as far as 
individuals but it's also an attack against us as a community."

SONY SILENT ON ITS PLANS FOR COLUMBIA PICTURES LOT; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: RUMORS FLY ON WHAT WILL BE DONE WITH THE OLD MGM SITE. A POND 
FOR KOI ? A "SONYLAND IN SUNLAND" PARK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since the blue letters spelling Columbia Studios appeared on the gates of 
the former MGM lot last month, Hollywood has been rife with speculation about 
Sony Corp.'s supposedly grand plans for the property. At least a few things are 
clear: 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Sony's Columbia Pictures unit envisions some fancy new buildings on the 
Culver City movie lot that it acquired from Time Warner Inc. -- sooner or 
later. 
</P>
<P>
No, "Batman" set designer Anton Furst doesn't have a secret plan to remake the 
lot's famous Thalberg building, erected back when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer still 
owned the property. But he says he's willing to come up with one. 
</P>
<P>
As for rumors that Columbia's free-wheeling co-chairmen, Peter Guber and Jon 
Peters, plan to buy a former mortuary next to the studio's front gate and turn 
it into a koi pond or to collect old Columbia movie sets for a mini-theme park 
somewhere -- a kind of "Sonyland in Sunland," as one intimate of the pair put 
it -- nobody as yet is willing to say. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the conceptualization stage," said Columbia's filmed entertainment 
president, Alan Levine, who has remained tight-lipped about precise plans for 
the Culver City lot. "I'm faced with trying to temper my excitement about this. 
. . . When it's all over, we're going to have the showcase of the West Side, as 
far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Under an extraordinary settlement of Guber-Peters' movie production contract 
with Warner, Sony/Columbia received the Culver City lot in exchange for 
Columbia's 35% of the Burbank Studios, which the two companies had jointly 
inhabited since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Warner had acquired the MGM lot when it merged with Lorimar-Telepictures in 
early 1989. Lorimar, in turn, had bought the lot in 1986 from Turner 
Broadcasting System, which purchased it that same year from MGM/UA 
Entertainment Co. In a touch of theater-of-the-absurd, a successor company to 
MGM/UA simultaneously moved the studio's giant "Leo the Lion" sign across the 
street, where it now perches atop Filmland Corporate Center. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia insiders estimate that about 1,500 employees will move to Culver City 
from Burbank over the next few months even as hundreds of Warner employees make 
the reverse trek to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said it is too early to know exactly how many employees will move or 
when. For the foreseeable future, he said, at least some Columbia units will 
remain in the Studio Plaza building, an adjunct to the Burbank lot that still 
belongs to Coca-Cola, which sold Columbia to Sony last year. 
</P>
<P>
Other Columbia employees will be transferred to the West Coast from New York, 
although a skeleton staff will remain in the East. Eventually, the studio's 
operations are likely to be consolidated on the tightly built, 44-acre Culver 
City site, where Levine foresees "a lot of work" and "several new buildings," 
none of which has yet been planned. 
</P>
<P>
According to published reports, the ebullient Peters has tried to lure 
executives and producers to Columbia with promises that their offices would be 
designed by Furst, whose Gotham City sets for "Batman" won him an Academy Award 
nomination last week. Reached in New York, where he's been working on designs 
for Columbia's "Awakenings," Furst said Peters has asked him to get in touch 
regarding some "big schemes" for the lot, but the two have never had a detailed 
conversation about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the scale of the job is," Furst said. "I think (Peters) 
would like to make it somehow representative of the (movie) industry. But I've 
never even seen the Thalberg building." 
</P>
<P>
However those plans develop, major change isn't likely to be easy or cheap. 
Culver City, already known for a somewhat restrictive attitude toward 
development, is considering a pair of ballot propositions that would further 
control growth, including one that would limit any new building in the city to 
a height of 56 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lot's massive rooftop sign, which still reads Lorimar Studios, 
is already a protected landmark under Culver City law -- the wording can 
change, but only within limits -- and other buildings on the 75-year-old movie 
lot are being reviewed for possible historical preservation. (Founded by movie 
industry pioneer Thomas Ince, the studio housed the Samuel Goldwyn Co. before 
formation of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.) 
</P>
<P>
Under a requirement that dates to Warner's ownership, moreover, Columbia is 
supposed to present the city with a detailed schedule for submitting a master 
plan for the lot by the end of March -- or interim improvements could be held 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of parking needs to be addressed," said Culver City's development 
director, Jody Esser. "Things need to be remodeled. We've all been very 
concerned about the age and usefulness of some buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be normal for Culver City not to permit one small building or area to 
be addressed," Esser said. "We would want a master plan to show what will be 
the final result." 
</P>
<P>
Warner's Lorimar unit -- which filmed such TV shows as "Falcon Crest" and 
"Perfect Strangers" at Culver City and will continue to rent some sound stages 
from Columbia -- spent about $20 million to refurbish facilities and bring the 
aging Thalberg office building into compliance with the city's health and 
safety codes. The architecture firm of Gensler &amp; Associates is now helping 
prepare the graceful white office building for Columbia's arrival but hasn't 
undertaken major modifications. 
</P>
<P>
One person familiar with the lot said it is generally in good shape despite 
cracked plaster and peeling paint on many of its drab, beige structures. But he 
added that its underground utilities may need extensive replacement, at a cost 
of $20 million or more -- an issue that Columbia hasn't investigated, according 
to Levine. 
</P>
<P>
On the home front, the pending move from Burbank has already triggered 
grumbling at Columbia, where some employees who live in the San Fernando Valley 
aren't charmed by their lengthening commute. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll find that people from the junior executive level on down are 
unhappy," said one Columbia employee, who declined to be identified. "The 
company has responded (to complaints) the way studios always respond: 'This is 
the movie business. There are a hundred people in line for your job.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, several union officials who represent Columbia workers at Burbank say 
they haven't heard serious complaints from members. "We may hear more down the 
line," said a spokesman for Office and Professional Workers Local 174, which 
represents over 400 Columbia employees. "But right now there is no prevalent 
voice of complaint. We have people living on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
Levine declined to comment on the "Sonyland" talk or on any plans to acquire 
property outside the lot -- although it appears clear from other sources that 
Columbia may have its hands full if it is really planning a Japanese-style pond 
for koi, or carp, at the studio gate. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Hardison, a Louisiana investor whose Filmcorp Properties I bought the 
former mortuary that adjoins the lot's Madison Avenue entrance for $550,000 in 
1984, said he might be willing to sell, though almost certainly for more than 
the $900,000 offer he said he received for it two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Harvey Seymour, a self-described innovator who leases the property and is 
working on a product that will affect "both the entertainment and the produce 
industries," said Columbia officers had better think twice about trying to move 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"If Jon Peters said (he wants the property), he'd better run like a turkey," 
said Seymour. "You just don't go around displacing people because you're a 
young genius."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S. J. DIAMOND: STATE LOTTERY IS NO BIG WIN FOR EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
They were buying tickets for the California state lottery this week at the rate 
of 1,250 a second, drawn by a record jackpot of $67 million. 
</P>
<P>
But don't think that this is just gambling. It's a state lottery, with the 
money going for a good cause -- public education. As some of the early lottery 
ads put it, "Our schools win too." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the lottery began in 1985, however, California's superintendent of 
public instruction Bill Honig was saying, "I wouldn't bet on it." Four years 
later, the lottery was pulling in $2.6 billion a year, 39% of it, or $1.04 
billion, earmarked for education. But state education officials say the gain is 
offset by cuts in legislative funding. Many schools, expecting individual 
allotments, are getting nothing because school districts are appropriating the 
money to cover their budget deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Lotteries have historically been an accepted way of funding everything from 
public works to private colleges, although they have periodically fallen into 
disgrace. Now, since New Hampshire instituted its state lottery in the 
mid-1960s, lotteries have been proposed in almost all 50 states, and 32 states 
plus the District of Columbia have them. Some form multistate lotteries, 
knowing, says Paul Dworin, editor of New York-based Gaming &amp; Wagering 
Business magazine, that "a lot of people will only play when the stakes are 
huge." 
</P>
<P>
Lotteries appeal to taxpayers and legislators alike as a way of raising money 
without raising taxes. Actually, gambling of all kinds seems appealing now. 
With annual gambling revenues estimated at almost $250 billion, the $15 billion 
from state lotteries is just a small but significant part. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this is gambling, justified by the cause and the assumed governmental 
controls. Some states put money into general funds. Two-thirds have targeted 
specific funds -- public education, senior citizens (Pennsylvania), parks 
(Colorado), economic development (Oregon), even a fund for treatment of problem 
gambling (Iowa). Most give half the winnings to winners, 35% to 40% to the 
state fund, and up to 15% to the cost of operation (administration, marketing, 
retailer commissions). 
</P>
<P>
State lotteries do have detractors, often on moral grounds, and not just church 
lobbies (whose objection may include competitive concern for their own 
lucrative bingo games and Las Vegas nights). Lotteries also offend the American 
work ethic, being an undeserving, unproductive, thoughtless, effortless way to 
make (not earn) money. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, linking gambling to education, say critics, makes gambling 
acceptable, even commendable, to the nation's children. It's touted as good, 
clean fun, and anyone can play. "The lottery is the cheapest ticket in town," 
says Dworin, "the most accessible, most benign form of gambling." The marijuana 
of gambling, it could be a first step toward addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Some object on grounds of fairness, saying that lottery contributions, while 
voluntary, are like regressive taxation. The middle class may put more money 
into lotteries, but the money poor people put in represents a higher percentage 
of their income. The burden of funding schools is unequally spread. 
</P>
<P>
There are also practical problems. California's PTA, among others, "opposed the 
ballot proposition on the grounds that lotteries are not a stable source of 
funding for education," says Harriet Borson, the state PTA's director of 
legislation. Ticket sales are unpredictable and disbursements naturally 
periodic, and "you don't know how much you have," says Borson, "till the end of 
each quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is getting it guaranteed. New York has dedicated lottery funds to education 
for two decades, but the legislature simply canceled the gift when money was 
needed elsewhere -- to fund the 1980 Winter Olympics, or just to balance the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Many objections are wiped out when people think the lotteries work, i.e. raise 
money for the chosen goal. And they do raise money, passing over to state 
governments now an average of 38.5% of revenues (New York is tops at 45%). 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it may be just a drop in the particular bucket. California's 
lottery money has never contributed more than 4% of the annual K-12 education 
budget. Florida's education commissioner calculated that the lottery funds 
received for education in 1988-89 covered just five days of school.

MEXICAN PACT COULD DOUBLE CLOTHES EXPORTS; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: A NEW AGREEMENT, OPPOSED BY MANY U.S. MANUFACTURERS, ELIMINATES OR 
INCREASES MOST QUOTAS. EXPERTS SAY FEW U.S. JOBS ARE AT RISK.

<P>
Mexican clothing and cloth exports to the United States could double to $1.3 
billion over the next two years under a new pact that a U.S. trade official 
called "the most liberal agreement we've ever negotiated in textiles." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Mexican agreement eliminates quotas on more than half of Mexican-made 
textiles and increases most remaining quotas by one-fourth. Mexico also will be 
allowed to request increases in its export limits as needed. 
</P>
<P>
In disclosing details of the agreement Thursday, Mexico's chief foreign trade 
negotiator, Miguel Angel Toro, said that, if Mexico can take full advantage of 
the new two-year agreement, exports to the United States could double from the 
1989 level of $646 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although many U.S. textile producers and apparel manufacturers have opposed the 
trade pact, which was signed last week, a number of experts said there would be 
few, if any, jobs lost at American companies because of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Z. Brown, president of the Coalition of Apparel Industries in 
California, said apparel makers are reluctant to do business in Mexico because 
of product quality and transportation problems in the past. Nor does he expect 
attitudes to change quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"No one I know is trying to get more production out of Mexico," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts also noted that Mexico is not one of the top textile and apparel 
exporters to the United States, shipping far less than China, South Korea, 
Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
William Kay Daines, general counsel to the National Retail Federation, said 
that any domestic business lost by textile companies would be offset by 
increased shipments to Mexican apparel makers. 
</P>
<P>
Daines, who said he helped U.S. trade officials craft the agreement with 
Mexico, also maintained that the extra apparel exports from Mexico would tend 
to be inexpensive merchandise that generally would replace imports from other 
nations rather than domestic goods. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Daines said, the agreement should bring consumers lower prices on 
apparel. He explained that it is much cheaper to ship merchandise by land from 
Mexico than by air or sea from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some observers regarded the agreement as a bad omen for two domestic 
industries that already have been battered by increasing imports. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Mishel, research director for the labor-backed Economic Policy 
Institute, said the agreement was a "short-sighted" measure that will eliminate 
jobs for immigrants, minorities and others who have struggled to break into the 
U.S. labor market. 
</P>
<P>
"We need our own industry in order to provide employment to Third World people 
here. Government should stop giving away the industry," Mishel said. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Edward P. Schrum, president of the American Textile 
Manufacturers Institute, called the agreement "one of the biggest concessions 
made by the U.S. government in the entire history of the U.S. textile/apparel 
import program." 
</P>
<P>
"In only four years' time, between 1985 and 1989, textile and apparel imports 
from Mexico have more than doubled . . . This apparently is not enough for 
Mexican exports; they want more. The new agreement assures that they will get 
it," Schrum added. 
</P>
<P>
According to the textile manufacturers group, the share of the U.S. apparel 
market garnered by imports rose from 28% in 1980 to 60% last year, when imports 
hit a record high of $26.5 billion. Over that period, apparel industry 
employment dropped from 1.26 million to 1.09 million, and further declines are 
expected in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the nationwide job declines, apparel and textile employment climbed in 
Los Angeles during much of the 1980s, and it currently is the county's 
second-largest manufacturing employer. 
</P>
<P>
The United States regulates imports of clothing and other textiles by assigning 
quotas to more than 40 countries. Mexico, which ranks sixth among the countries 
exporting textiles to the U.S. market, has protested that the quotas are 
protectionist, particularly given the increased access U.S. garment makers have 
to the Mexican market. 
</P>
<P>
"They made a good case," said U.S. chief textile negotiator Ron Sorini. He 
called the arrangement "the most liberal agreement we've ever negotiated in 
textiles." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a recognition that we are exporting significant amounts of textiles to 
Mexico," he said in a telephone interview from his Washington, D.C., office. 
</P>
<P>
The changes are expected to be especially helpful to apparel-manufacturing 
maquiladoras, plants in Mexico that make garments from U.S.-made cloth. 
Maquiladoras account for 85% of Mexico's textile exports, according to Alfonso 
Bustamante, president of the Mexican Maquiladora Assn. 
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of the 278 garment-making maquiladoras are concentrated in 
Tijuana, he said, with the rest scattered among cities on the border and in the 
interior of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important as the 86% increase in garment quotas, he said, is the 
greater flexibility that will allow garment makers to respond to changes in 
fashion and demand. 
</P>
<P>
That will help prevent situations such as that which occurred last year when 
Mexico used less than three-fourths of its overall quota. Quotas for some 
products were filled early because of high demand, while others were not filled 
because products did not sell well. 
</P>
<P>
Non-garment textile categories, which account for a smaller portion of overall 
exports, will be allowed a greater percentage increase. Cloth exports, for 
example, would be allowed to rise 150% and exports of miscellaneous textiles 
could triple, Toro said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rodolfo Garcia Muriel, president of the Northern Textile Chamber, 
whose members produce almost one-third of Mexico's cotton cloth, said Mexican 
manufacturers will not be able to take advantage of the opportunity unless they 
have funds available to invest in modernizing their plants.

Greyhound Drivers Set Strike Date: Greyhound Lines Inc., the only nationwide 
intercity bus system, said its drivers have called a strike for March 2 because 
of a breakdown in contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound said it would operate a reduced schedule in the event of a strike by 
the union, which represents 6,300 drivers and 3,075 office and maintenance 
workers. The union has notified the company of its strike threat, said George 
Gravley, a spokesman for the Dallas-based company. No new talks have been 
scheduled.

U.S. NEGOTIATORS COMPLAIN OF JAPANESE ATTITUDE; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: AMERICANS CALL FOR A COMMITMENT TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMMERCE.

<P>
Complaining that Japanese bureaucrats stubbornly insist on "defending the 
status quo," U.S. officials on Thursday called upon Prime Minister Toshiki 
Kaifu to make a political commitment to remove structural barriers to trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Too often today, instead of hearing new ideas, we heard simply a defense of 
the status quo," a member of a delegation from Washington told reporters after 
a third round of talks began here on the so-called Structural Impediments 
Initiative. The talks had been postponed for a month because of last Sunday's 
election in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the election is behind us," the U.S. official said, "we need to hear 
from the political leadership of Japan." 
</P>
<P>
He and two other members of the delegation met with reporters after more than 
10 hours of talks on the first of two days of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economic newspaper Nihon Keizai quoted an official of the 
Japanese Finance Ministry as saying acceptance of a U.S. demand that Japan 
increase spending on public works would "deprive the Japanese government of 
sovereignty to control the domestic economy through fiscal policy." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted him as saying further that the U.S. proposals were 
"inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials described Thursday's talks as "heated," but one of the 
American officials characterized them as focusing on a "mutual search for 
solutions -- not pure confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to note that some progress has been made, but frankly much more 
needs to be done," the American added. "We have a tight time schedule." He said 
an interim report, which had been planned for March, is now expected in early 
April. He also said "at least one more meeting" will be needed before the 
report can be completed. A final report is to be issued in July. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans, he said, presented "detailed ideas on how to remove structural 
impediments (to trade) in Japan, and we expect to receive a reply soon." 
</P>
<P>
One of the other Americans said they reminded the Japanese that the purpose of 
the talks is "not to engage in a debate but to identify and solve problems." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has made these talks the centerpiece of its economic 
policy toward Japan, and the outcome is expected to have a critical impact on 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of a visit to Tokyo earlier this month, Ryohei Murata, Japan's 
ambassador to Washington, said the next six months will be a critical period 
for U.S.-Japan economic relations. He urged Prime Minister Kaifu to produce an 
interim report "to demonstrate Japan's will to make progress on trade issues." 
</P>
<P>
"If our relations are not handled smoothly," Murata told the newspaper Asahi, 
"a frigidity will emerge, and there is a danger that relations will fall into 
an extraordinarily unfavorable condition." 
</P>
<P>
None of the U.S. officials here for the talks would disclose the categories in 
which they charged that Japanese were defending the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
But they cited as examples of progress plans to bolster the staff of Japan's 
Fair Trade Commission and to improve the distribution system, and a new land 
law specifying that public use of land should be given priority over private 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Even on those points, one of the U.S. officials said, the Japanese "have not 
done enough creative thinking, nor have they presented enough bold 
suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said the United States urged Japan to increase, within three 
to five years, its spending on public works for sewers, roads, airports and 
harbors to 10% of the gross national product from the current 6.7%. Raising 
investment and lowering savings at home theoretically would increase demand, 
including demands for imports. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was rejected out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
Public works spending here, Japanese officials said, is already at a level 
comparable to that in the United States and Europe. Any increase at a time of 
high growth in the domestic economy, they said, would ignite inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said the U.S. delegation demanded that Japan abolish a law 
limiting the establishment of large-scale retail stores and amend its 
anti-monopoly law to curb collusive business practices. 
</P>
<P>
Japan had rejected both proposals earlier but did offer to relax the rules on 
large retail stores and to strengthen enforcement of the anti-monopoly law. 
</P>
<P>
The rules for establishment of large retail stores will be revised, beginning 
April 1, to reduce a 10-year waiting period to two years, the Japanese said 
they told the U.S. delegation. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides were expected to spend today discussing Japanese proposals for 
reforms of structural barriers to trade in the United States.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: SINGLE MOMS DO DOUBLE DUTY AS ENTREPRENEURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting a new business saps the energy of even the most determined 
entrepreneur, but for a single mother it can be overwhelming. Yet single 
mothers who own successful small businesses say their ventures not only fulfill 
their financial needs but provide a way for them to regain control of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
The three single mothers featured here were forced into supporting themselves 
out of necessity. Lacking professional experience, they relied on their wits 
and personal experiences to create their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
All said they feel a certain amount of guilt over dividing their time between 
their children and their ventures. To counteract the inevitable resentment and 
jealousy children feel toward a demanding small business, the mothers suggested 
that all business owners share their entrepreneurial dreams with their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"After my husband and I split up six years ago, it took me six months to get 
over the initial shock and figure out what I was going to do with the rest of 
my life," said Phyllis Henson, a divorced homemaker who founded the Kids 
Hollywood Connection in Newport Beach to advise parents on how to introduce 
their children to show business. 
</P>
<P>
Because she had no professional skills, Henson stuck with what she knew best -- 
being a mother who was trying to help her kids break into Hollywood. Now 
teen-agers, Wendy, Kelly and Eric Henson began their acting and modeling 
careers in Japan when they were featured in an ad for a Japanese department 
store. Through the years, the Henson children have earned thousands of dollars 
from their appearances in television commercials and on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I wasted their first years in the business," said Henson. "We had the 
wrong agents and the wrong photographers -- I even dressed them all wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Learning from her own mistakes, Henson set up a consulting business to help 
other parents find their way around Hollywood. She is a kind of a show-biz 
strategist, providing guidance for a basic fee of $225. 
</P>
<P>
"I started my business with nothing -- I didn't even have $10 saved," said 
Henson, who struggled for years to keep the family afloat on alimony and child 
support payments. 
</P>
<P>
In between the long treks from Orange County to Los Angeles for auditions, 
Henson built her business by seeking referrals from all the agents and other 
show business people she met. Many times, she said, her own children's careers 
suffered while she devoted her energy to helping other children. Today, her 
office walls are covered with pictures of her clients. 
</P>
<P>
"As a single mother in business, your time is torn between the business and 
your children," said Henson. "I feel a lot of guilt when I'm not at home taking 
care of them. They've almost raised themselves for the past four years." 
</P>
<P>
At times, Henson said she could barely pay the bills. Today, she is living 
comfortably, if not lavishly. "I have a really good feeling when I see one of 
the kids I've helped on television." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Henson, who at 14 is returning to show business after a few years off, 
said it is important for children to get involved with their mother's business. 
</P>
<P>
"You should try to help your mother," she advises. "I go down to the office and 
help her file things or answer the phone." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Henson said she and her 13-year-old brother and 18-year-old sister 
appreciate how hard their mother works. "But she never left us alone and she 
hasn't had to worry about paying the bills lately." 
</P>
<P>
Another single mother ended up supporting both her infant son and her 
ex-husband when their marriage ended 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Salant-Mirfield, chairwoman and chief executive of Mirant Industries in 
North Hollywood, went back to work when her son Sam was about 2 weeks old. When 
Sam was 4, she set up her first company, which provided toiletry and gift items 
to airlines. That business evolved into the multimillion-dollar Mirant 
Industries. 
</P>
<P>
"Fourteen years ago, there weren't that many women in business," said 
Salant-Mirfield. She said it was especially difficult to stand up to the 
criticism from her family over the long hours she spent away from her young 
son. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling was that if you spent quality time with your children, it's OK," 
said Salant-Mirfield. Now Sam is 18 and attending Princeton University. His 
mother says one lasting effect of her son's spending much of his youth with a 
series of housekeepers is his current passion for the consistent quality of 
food in the school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy Collins is another single mother who parlayed her personal knowledge and 
interest in people into a thriving business. A mother of four, Collins had 
previously held only one job: as a greeter for the Welcome Wagon in Bedford, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
On her own, she moved to Huntington Beach in 1986 to begin a new life. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing a need for a neighborhood welcoming service, Collins raised $2,000 by 
cashing in an insurance policy and started Bright Beginnings. The company works 
with local civic leaders and the Chamber of Commerce to provide newcomers with 
a packet of information about the city, gift certificates from merchants and 
ads from local doctors, dentists and others. Bright Beginnings operates in 
eight Orange County cities and is now registered with the state to sell 
franchises. The Irvine-based company charges $11,000 for the franchise, which 
includes computer software to run the business. Franchise holders also pay a 
10% monthly royalty. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started this business at home, people thought I was playing office," 
said Collins. "But the business gave me emotional stability and made me feel 
creative." 
</P>
<P>
Collins' daughter, Melanie Hodgson, is a single mother with a 6-year-old 
daughter. She joined her mother's company three years ago to develop the 
computer systems that form the heart of the business. 
</P>
<P>
"We offer a viable form of marketing because businesses pay us to do this 
word-of-mouth advertising," said Hodgson. She said Bright Beginnings is a good 
business for single mothers because it is easy to start up and is home based. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Empathy Said to Be Key to Higher Sales 
</P>
<P>
Walter Hailey started out as a flour salesman. He ended up being one of 
America's most successful insurance salesmen -- selling $1 billion worth of 
insurance policies primarily to the people involved in the food industry. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Hailey teaches his sales secrets to business owners and managers at his 
"Power of Persuasion" seminars conducted on his 1,000-acre ranch in Hunt, Tex. 
Hailey shared a few of his secrets with the Los Angeles chapter of the CEO Club 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"To be successful, your salespeople must be ego-driven and have empathy with 
the customers," said Hailey. "Empathy is important because people buy when they 
feel like your salesperson understands them." 
</P>
<P>
According to Hailey, ego-driven salespeople are equally pleased with a $10 sale 
and a $10,000 sale. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of holding boring morning sales meetings, Hailey suggests putting your 
sales staff out on the street or on the phones between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. "This 
is when the people with money are up and making decisions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also stresses the importance of developing your "natural existing economic 
relationships." For instance, he advises business owners to begin cultivating 
all relationships, including the people you meet at church. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggests setting up an appointment with the top person at a company you 
do business with to hand-deliver the money you owe them. At this point, you 
have the owner's total attention and can ask them to start buying the goods or 
services your company sells. 
</P>
<P>
"Figure out who you are spending your money on because the trolley runs in two 
directions," said Hailey.

THE NATION'S FIRST ELECTED BLACK GOVERNOR HAS THEM GUESSING: WILL HE BE A 
BIG-SPENDING LIBERAL OR A BRIDGE-BUILDING 'GOOD OLD BOY'?; 
</P>
<P>
THE NEW VIRGINIAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Making history is a roll of the dice and Virginia's new governor, Lawrence 
Douglas Wilder, knows it. This elemental lesson rises like vapor from the 
swampy, treacherous waters of the Old Dominion's politics, where the bones of 
losers are picked clean and dumped in the murky depths of oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, obscurity is the least of Democrat Wilder's worries at the moment. 
As the nation's first elected black governor -- chosen in a state that once was 
the heart and brain of the Confederacy -- he has the bright aura of an 
electoral magician. By virtue of this uniqueness, Wilder, whose cachet includes 
being the grandson of slaves, has achieved overnight national prominence while 
many of his rivals and peers continue to splash fitfully in the gloom of media 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
This day, for instance, Wilder -- dressed in an immaculate blue pinstripe suit 
and recently minus his mustache -- seems immensely telegenic, more than 
handsome enough to get a running start in public opinion polls. Moreover, he 
looks much younger than his 59 years and when he smiles or laughs -- as he does 
often -- another decade fades away, giving him the priceless political gift of 
youthfulness. 
</P>
<P>
But -- and there's always a but, isn't there? -- from the perspective of the 
state capital, Wilder claims that his seemingly unbounded future is about as 
clear as the James River that roils muddily through this city of 220,000. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he says, slouching back in his chair, relaxed and cheerful in the small 
office of the Capitol that Thomas Jefferson built, people are pressing him to 
start a "Wilder national movement." The subject came up in a meeting this very 
morning, he says, chuckling. Even so, the friend and political ally who 
broached the topic agreed that it's a "trivial" matter, he says. 
</P>
<P>
He has only been in office since Jan. 13, Wilder notes, and his four-year term 
stretches before him like unmapped territory. 
</P>
<P>
Who can tell whether he'll be on a mountain or a molehill by 1994? 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a question of where you are, what have you done, where is your 
impetus, what's the stride, what's the step, what is your motivation, what is 
available, and what's possible," he explains in the cadences of a veteran stump 
speaker. "I've always believed in the art of the possible. I believe there's a 
difference between brave-heartedness and foolishness and I believe in whatever 
I'm going to do, if I don't see success somewhere through the tunnel of that 
vision, I don't even bother with it." 
</P>
<P>
These cautious words come from a politician who learned in 20 years of climbing 
to the top that personal metamorphosis and public perception are key to 
political survival -- especially in Virginia, where the faintest whisper of 
radicalism or unorthodoxy can sound like a Guns N' Roses concert. (A magazine 
writer observed during last year's campaign that Virginia's most liberal 
Democrats would be moderate Republicans anyplace else.) 
</P>
<P>
Once seen as a black activist and outsider, Wilder, a flamboyant former 
criminal defense lawyer, state senator and lieutenant governor, transformed 
himself into, as one local attorney put it, "a good old boy" who built bridges 
to white colleagues instead of burning them. Throughout the campaign last fall, 
Wilder appealed to "the new Virginia mainstream . . . that group which looks 
forward rather than behind, that builds rather than destroys and brings people 
together, rather than to divide them." 
</P>
<P>
Much of his strategy, he says, was to combat the assumption that "any Democrat 
would be a big spender. And certainly, if you are a minority, as in my case, 
that I'd be more than just a big spender and that I'd be turning the keys of 
the jails over to the prisoners and things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's most liberal position during the campaign was his pro-choice stand on 
abortion, an issue believed crucial in the close race. On the other hand, 
Wilder years ago reversed his opposition to the death penalty to project a 
tough-on-crime image. 
</P>
<P>
Former Richmond Mayor Henry L. Marsh III, who roomed with Wilder at Howard 
University law school, believes that Wilder's successful balancing act in a 
conservative state with a more than 80% white electorate will bring both 
symbolic and substantial rewards to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Being governor of Virginia is like being emperor of the world," says Marsh, 
who continues to serve on the City Council. "Doug's service as governor is a 
way of overcoming a lot of historical resistance to blackness. If Doug does an 
outstanding job for all people, it breaks down a lot of barriers." 
</P>
<P>
Marsh concedes, however, "There are apprehensions among some blacks that we may 
not get much out of this except the symbolism." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Wilder's most vociferous and longtime critic in the local black 
community is Sa'ad El-Amin, a radical lawyer. El-Amin -- who concedes he is 
practically a minority of one in criticizing the governor -- charges that 
Wilder, with his links to conservative Democrats such as Virginia's U.S. Sen. 
Charles Robb, will be used to "sell" a rightward-shifting party to blacks on a 
national level. "The good old boys will have their cake and eat it too," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
In general, though, the prevailing moods in the state range between euphoria 
and pleased surprise, Marsh says. "Some people feel sort of amazed that it's 
working out and maybe this guy isn't too bad after all." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone agrees that Wilder has never been afraid of taking a stand or applying 
pressure. Two oft-cited examples are his campaign to change the state song, 
"Carry Me Back to Old Virginny," because of the lyric "this ol' darkie's 
heart," and his ultimately successful battle to make the Rev. Martin Luther 
King Jr.'s birthday a state holiday. To win the holiday fight, Wilder agreed to 
a compromise that shared the King holiday with Confederate Generals Robert E. 
Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Nonetheless, insiders paint Wilder as an adroit 
behind-the-scenes worker with a stubborn streak that can drive opponents to 
distraction. 
</P>
<P>
But now that he has won the governor's chair -- and by the narrow margin of 
fewer than 7,000 votes at that -- Wilder believes that he must be doubly 
careful not to let the elation of victory lead him into the temptations of 
foolish pride. 
</P>
<P>
"If I fail or say things that people could say, 'Well, I told you so,' it would 
set a lot of things back and that would be more detrimental to me in terms of 
what I had in mind than anything I know," he says. 
</P>
<P>
This attitude finds favor in an office not far from Wilder's, that of A.L. 
Philpott, 33 years a member of the House of Delegates and Speaker of the House 
for 12. A white-haired, pipe-smoking former segregationist who drew the line at 
closing the state's public schools during "massive resistance" to integration 
in the 1950s, Philpott gives Wilder grudging but sincere credit for being a 
smart politician. 
</P>
<P>
The new governor is "a highly intelligent person who is unlikely to make any 
foolish mistakes," Philpott says. In some quarters, Wilder was "expected to 
fall flat on his face" almost as soon as he was sworn in, Philpott continues, 
noting that Wilder has "disappointed" these expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Philpott readily acknowledges that "Doug and I haven't always been the best of 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
This turns out to be something of an understatement. Wilder and Philpott were 
once political enemies, so much so that Wilder threatened to work for 
Philpott's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Philpott, who has a record of getting himself in hot water for 
racial gaffes, who threw a 1985 breakfast to introduce Wilder, then running for 
lieutenant governor, to politicos on his home turf. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, Philpott is optimistic about what Wilder will do for the 
state. "I think it's going to have a very positive effect on the political and 
social life of Virginia," he says of Wilder's governorship. He finally puts a 
match to the pipe he has been toying with. "Perhaps we can get rid of some of 
that image that we're rednecks stuck in the 1820s." 
</P>
<P>
And yet Philpott apparently still can't quite believe that Wilder outmatched 
everyone to become governor, an office more coveted and revered in Virginia 
than the Presidency of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He expected Marshall Coleman, Wilder's Republican opponent, to win the 
election, he says, noting that many Democrats told him they were sitting out 
the election because they would not vote for a black man. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Philpott says he did not give credence to widely publicized polls 
that showed Wilder winning by several percentage points, when, in fact, he 
squeaked into office. The polls were the subject of a post-election controversy 
over whether and why voters lie in opinion surveys about race. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe it when we nominated him for lieutenant governor," Philpott 
says. "I didn't even believe it when we nominated him for governor." 
</P>
<P>
Philpott's comment accents the tension between change and tradition -- both 
good and bad -- in this state of 6 million. The capital city itself seems to 
symbolize that tension. 
</P>
<P>
While Virginians talk proudly of the state's rapid growth and its attendant 
rush into modern times, to a Los Angeles resident, Richmond seems a city 
steeped in the past, a town of red brick buildings where the 19th and 18th 
centuries are enshrined and made palpable. 
</P>
<P>
It's almost impossible to walk down the street without rubbing against a plaque 
commemorating a historic house or skirting around a statue honoring a native 
son for greatness in battle or statesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this is a city of statues. One major street, Monument Avenue, is 
devoted to the display of sculpted likenesses of major Confederates. The only 
one not on a horse is Jefferson Davis, the luckless president of the 
secessionist states. Generals Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and J. E. B. 
Stuart tower over the politician in bronze meldings of men and horse flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, there's another telling measure of the veneration of the past. 
One of the city's most expensive restaurants proudly occupies a former stable 
that supposedly sheltered Lee's faithful mount, Traveller. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Marsh says that the celebrations of Confederate heroes are 
generally accepted by local blacks, noting that the council recently 
appropriated money to refurbish the statues on Monument Avenue. Marsh is quick 
to point out, too, that Richmond contains its share of landmarks that are 
important to black people. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much history in the air," he says, gesturing outside his law 
offices to the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Though much less visible, these shards of black history were part of the 
consciousness he and Wilder shared as they grew up in a totally segregated 
city, Marsh says. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among them is Richmond's Jackson Ward area, a neighborhood that was a 
center of black "intellectual thought and innovation from Reconstruction to the 
1920s," he explains. The area contains the "oldest black insurance company in 
the country and the oldest black bank in the country," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson Ward also has at least one statue, a tribute to Bill (Bojangles) 
Robinson, the famed tap dancer who was born in the neighborhood in 1878. 
</P>
<P>
But Richmond's chief shrine is the state Capitol itself, a 1785 building 
designed by Jefferson along the lines of a classical temple. Here, under the 
rotunda, stands Houdon's famous statue of George Washington, object of a 
thousand school group tours. Here, too, is the home of the Virginia General 
Assembly, "the oldest legislative body in the Western hemisphere," a local 
guidebook informs. 
</P>
<P>
And it is with the living politicians of the Legislature that Wilder will have 
to work his magic if he is to move beyond the boundaries of the state. 
</P>
<P>
In town for a 60-day session, legislators can usually be identified by the lack 
of attention they pay to the Capitol building's artistic tributes to 
politicians of yore. Preoccupied by the business of the present, Virginia's 
representatives hurry by the paintings and sculptures as if to say, "Those guys 
will never have to run for reelection again." 
</P>
<P>
The governor and Speaker Philpott claim that the session has gone well -- 
despite the budget crunch that led Wilder to call for establishing a 
$200-million reserve against revenue shortfalls. Indeed, Wilder drew bipartisan 
praise last month for his fiscally tough State of the Commonwealth Address that 
promised no tax increases. One legislator told the Richmond News Leader, "The 
people in this state that were worried about a liberal governor have had their 
fears allayed." (The 1990-92 $26-billion state budget is largely the work of 
Wilder's predecessor. Virginia's governors get only one crack at a budget they 
fully can call their own, the spending plan they concoct for their final two 
years in office.) 
</P>
<P>
But Wilder and Philpott are fuming over a Feb. 1 News Leader article, based 
largely on anonymous sources, that characterized Wilder as getting a grade of 
"D . . . for disinvolvement" with the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder says he told one legislator quoted in the story, "If everything I'm 
going to say to you is going to be in the press, then let me write it out and 
give it to you and put it in the press." He adds that in a speech to the local 
press he told reporters, "I always know exactly who that anonymous source is 
and I know exactly why they're anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Wilder -- and his calls for fiscal austerity -- again took jabs from 
the press with reports that his new Lincoln limousine costs well above the 
price of his predecessor's official transportation, a Cadillac -- $37,923 vs. 
$19,949. Wilder's office blamed the difference on the rise in car prices and a 
drop in trade values. But, traditionally, Virginia's governors get new cars. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's sensitivity to some publicity may stem from earlier media 
exposure of his warts. Since entering public life in 1969, Wilder has weathered 
a number of personal controversies. These include his apparently stormy 1978 
divorce, late payment of property taxes, his former ownership of a run-down 
vacant house that neighbors contended was a public nuisance and a reprimand 
from the Virginia Supreme Court for procrastinating in a personal injury suit. 
</P>
<P>
None of these matters, including a $52,000 property settlement won by his 
ex-wife, ever seriously damaged Wilder. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh says his friend seems to share a "Teflon" political trait with another 
politician. "I think he possesses a Reagan-like quality of being able to 
overcome these kinds of obstacles." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wilder demonstrated a capacity for candor in revealing interviews 
with biographer Donald P. Baker, chief of the Washington Post's Richmond 
bureau. Among other things, in numerous long sessions with Baker, Korean war 
veteran Wilder recounted that one of 20 North Korean prisoners he had helped 
capture was killed by a fellow American soldier as the two escorted their 
charges into captivity. Wilder was awarded a bronze star in the action at Pork 
Chop Hill, which included throwing grenades into bunkers to drive the enemy 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Baker says he still doesn't know if the governor has read all of "Wilder: Hold 
Fast to Dreams," published last fall. But Baker says Wilder had gotten an early 
copy to peruse "the bad chapters." 
</P>
<P>
The biography also paints a charming picture of Wilder growing up in modest but 
adequate circumstances in Richmond's Church Hill neighborhood. Wilder is the 
next to youngest of eight children, and as a youngster, his favorite chore was 
chopping heads off chickens bound for the family table. Since then, he has come 
a long way financially. He is thought to be a millionaire, thanks to his legal 
skill and a sharp eye for real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder himself maintains that that all the skeletons in his closet have been 
exterminated. "I told the press the other day . . . that the only reason that 
anything hasn't been printed about me is that people just didn't know it," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the embarrassments of the past and the current troubles of black 
politicians Marion Barry and Tom Bradley, Wilder says he willingly accepts the 
goldfish-bowl aspect of public life. 
</P>
<P>
"It is in a bowl and I don't think you should complain about it because you can 
get out of that bowl any time you want. . . . If you're going to lead, you do 
what the tautology demands -- you set forth, you move out," he says. "You can't 
afford to fall down to the extent that you say, 'Well, why don't you treat me 
like everybody else?' I don't think it's a double standard and I don't think 
its an invidious standard." 
</P>
<P>
On a less lofty level, Wilder says that his unmarried state makes him a target 
for social joshing. "I get chided about that every evening at some reception," 
he says. "Someone will say, 'Well who's going to be the First Lady or hostess 
at the mansion?' " The social fate of Virginia is not in the balance, he adds, 
because "we have a mansion staff." 
</P>
<P>
His marital state could change, too, he suggests. "I'm not a confirmed 
bachelor. I just happen to be one," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back from the vantage point of the governor's office, Wilder takes 
pride in his life, all of it spent in Richmond except for stints of higher 
education and military service. 
</P>
<P>
"You see some people who say, 'I know him, he used to shine my shoes,' " he 
says, laughing again. "You see the next guy and he says, 'Yeah, we were raised 
together and we're very pleased.' I think it means more to me to show what 
could happen in Richmond by being here. . . . I always believed that many of 
the greatest gains people would achieve would be right in their own back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's son, Lawrence Douglas Wilder Jr., a lawyer in his father's firm, says 
that as a parent the governor was "definitely stern but not unfair." For 
himself and his two sisters, Wilder always insisted that schoolwork and chores 
took precedence over play. "He doesn't tolerate fools lightly," Wilder Jr. 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing his father, the son says: "He is his own man, period. It's a constant 
about him. He is himself. He is very direct. He will say what's on his mind, I 
don't care who it is. . . . What you see is what you get." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the governor's office, Wilder admits that his career has left him 
vulnerable in one area -- guiding his son's future. His remarks may also say 
something about the personal price of political life. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he (Lawrence Jr.) has this latent desire to get involved in politics," 
Wilder says. "I don't know whether he should or not. I mean, if I were to run 
it for him, I think I would want him to just do well in terms of his law 
practice and live a more comfortable life." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder chuckles briefly. "I would never tell him that because I think he's 
already got his mind set on something like that. How could I tell him: Don't do 
it?" 
</P>

BEHIND THE WHEEL: PONTIAC GRAND PRIX MUSCLES IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Dealer inventories are shrinking a notch. Sales are growing a smidge. Profits 
aren't skidding quite so wildly -- and implacable pens of the motoring media 
are again writing conciliatory things about domestic cars. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Lincoln Town Car: "A vehicle that's more efficient and quite pleasant 
to drive . . . a cleaner, more contemporary shape," noted Automobile magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Cadillac Allante and Eldorado Touring Coupe: "Good cars . . . not 
great cars, but good enough so that either must be considered seriously," said 
AutoWeek. 
</P>
<P>
And now comes the Pontiac Grand Prix Turbo coupe, America's newest muscle car. 
</P>
<P>
It clearly was not built to challenge the big performers and expensive lookers 
from Europe and Asia. But it certainly proves that when it comes to cars 
capable of kicking domestic derrieres, there's more in American showrooms than 
the Dodge Daytona Shelby, Ford's Taurus SHO and the supercharged Thunderbird 
SC. 
</P>
<P>
And with the Turbo coupe comes the message that although American-built cars 
remain far from the world's best at any level, Detroit does seem to be trying. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three apparently have realized that the fit and finish of a domestic 
luxury car should at least equal that of a mid-size Japanese product. 
Manufacturers are listening to our pleas for multivalve engines, anti-lock 
brakes and suspension technology that goes beyond the vertical travel of wagon 
springs. 
</P>
<P>
The Turbo coupe, the two-door flagship of Pontiac's 1990 Grand Prix fleet, is 
one of General Motors' aggravating "limited production" models; i.e., with 
production limited to actual orders for the car, not some rigid, predetermined, 
mold-smashing total for all time. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 production run for the Grand Prix Turbo coupe, as an example, is 4,000 
vehicles -- unless 35,000 people decide they want the car, in which case 
production will be unlimited until demand is satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
The intent of the vehicle, said a Pontiac spokesman, "is to be an image car, a 
halo for a Grand Prix line that has been around since 1960." There is no 
question, he added, that Pontiac was after "the whole package, of striking 
looks and high performance to challenge domestic cars like the Taurus SHO." 
</P>
<P>
Quick comparisons: At its base of $25,560, the Turbo coupe is several thousand 
dollars more expensive than the Taurus and its stable mate Super Coupe, which 
list for about $20,000 apiece. Acceleration times, however, are comparable. Top 
speeds are not, with Pontiac claiming 128 m.p.h. for its coupe, while Ford's 
Super Coupe and the SHO are capable of haring along in excess of 140 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
All run off V-6s. The Thunderbird is rear-drive while the Turbo Coupe and SH0 
are front-wheel drive. The SHO has a multivalve engine, the Thunderbird is 
supercharged and the Pontiac coupe is turbocharged. The Pontiac comes with 
anti-lock brakes but no air bag. You pay your money, you take your choice. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
If there is any clear edge, it is with the visuals. An SHO looks very much like 
a Taurus, and a Super Coupe looks awfully like a Thunderbird. But the Pontiac 
Grand Prix Turbo coupe -- well, it looks more European than just anything 
coming out of Bavaria these days. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a conversion by ASC Inc., of Kansas City, the car's body panels and 
wheel arches have been lowered to give just a hint of slink to the whole. 
</P>
<P>
Being a two-door certainly adds to the advertisement of compactness and punch. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the car's gorgeous gold-lace Alcoa wheels; broad-mouthed, 
stainless steel exhaust pipes that growl, and a pair of long, louvered air 
scoops adding a definite sneer to the hood. 
</P>
<P>
Underneath that hood lurks 205 horsepower, compared to only 140 for less 
gussied Grand Prix in the line. So when the sign says one car per lane per 
green, you'll be hauling into freeway traffic before Bill Cooper can say: "Car 
98, out." 
</P>
<P>
The mid-range acceleration is just as efficient and the rate doesn't start to 
flatten out until well into the 80s. Steering is firm -- although its castering 
action might be a little too pushy for the weak of wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to big Goodyear Eagle Gatorback tires on 16-inch wheels, the car has 
tons of grab -- although the suspension isn't quite tight enough to soak up all 
the body rolls on squirrelly back roads. 
</P>
<P>
Turbo lag -- a low-end power discrepancy while the turbocharger is winding up 
-- is at a minimum with the car. 
</P>
<P>
Torque steer -- something to be anticipated whenever you plant 200 horsepower 
atop front wheels that are expected to steer at the same time -- is not 
noticeable when accelerating the car hard in a straight line. But to get deeply 
into the power from rest and while turning is to feel the front wheels 
transcribing a pretzel. 
</P>
<P>
A good car. But as the magazine said, not a great car. 
</P>
<P>
Today -- and certainly in Pontiac's Turbo coupe -- American car production 
seems to be short one essential worker: an engineer who supervises the entire 
car from pencil sketch to first production model. Harry Hardnose should be a 
nit-picking, dissatisfied, unyielding cynic who pounds on tables when 
accountants and stylists look at a low bid or a quick fix and say: "That's good 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Good enough no longer is. 
</P>
<P>
The bucket seats on the Turbo coupe certainly are good enough -- but even when 
using every permutation on a console panel loaded with position and support 
controls, seating remains marginally backbreaking. Incredibly, anyone over 
6-foot-2 will have headroom problems in this car. 
</P>
<P>
The parking brake is a foot pedal that must be pumped (and to the sound of a 
clattering ratchet) to engage. Said a Turbo coupe passenger: "What year are we 
in?" 
</P>
<P>
Adding a compass (when heading north up the Hollywood Freeway, our needle 
always pointed south) and a "heads up" display projecting a digital readout of 
the car's speed on the windshield must be dismissed as expensive gimmickry -- 
especially on a $25,000 car priced beyond its competition. 
</P>
<P>
If there is to be a key-chain remote control for unlocking doors and trunk, it 
should work beyond a range of six inches. And let's hear a kloink when the 
latches disengage. 
</P>
<P>
Radio controls mounted in the steering column are safe, convenient and 
admirable innovation -- but also take up room that in this era of legislated 
passive restraints, should be reserved for an air bag. 
</P>
<P>
Talking of restraints. The mounting of the three-point seat belt in the Turbo 
coupe has been changed from center post to the door itself. That places the 
harness forward. So when a front seat is slid fully back, the lap strap goes 
from left to right across mid-thigh leaving the upper body with greater freedom 
to move from A-thru-Windshield. 
</P>
<P>
In short, all the pieces needed to create a really great car are between the 
wheels and beneath the hood of the Pontiac Turbo coupe. 
</P>
<P>
But conjunction isn't there. 
</P>
<P>
It all sounds rather like a report card cliche: "Has ability. But needs to 
apply itself."

CLASSIC NEIL SIMON SHINES AT GASLAMP

<P>
Timing, always a strong suit of Neil Simon's, is gone over lovingly in 
"Broadway Bound," the playwright's ode to his own development as a comedy 
writer. 
</P>
<P>
The grandfather of his alter ego, Eugene Jerome, has wonderful timing, which 
makes him funny despite his dislike of jokes, Eugene points out in one of his 
many asides to the audience. Even his mother, the enigmatic heart of the play, 
gets her apotheosis when she slips in a few funny turns of phrase during her 
story about the evening she danced with George Raft. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a sense of humor," Eugene says reverentially. That, from Eugene's 
viewpoint, is clearly the highest compliment one can pay anyone. 
</P>
<P>
How fortunate that the timing of the show at the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre's Hahn 
Cosmopolitan is also wonderful -- not just because it kicks off the Gaslamp's 
10th season in high style, but because it will overlap with the premiere of 
Simon's latest, "Jake's Women," at the Old Globe Theatre on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
If "Jake's Women," which deals with a writer and the women in his life (dead 
wife, ex-wife, mother, daughter, therapist) proves to be as 
semi-autobiographical as the "Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi Blues," 
"Broadway Bound" trilogy, theatergoers might want to plan on seeing both plays 
as a two-parter. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's "Rumors," which premiered at the Old Globe in 1988, comes 
chronologically in between, but thematically it was an exercise in farce, a 
sabbatical from seriousness, an inky door that allowed the playwright to escape 
from himself through rapid-fire jokes. 
</P>
<P>
The great escape in "Broadway Bound," Simon's finest until now, is a Broadway 
future and Eugene's conviction -- so poignantly a young man's conviction -- 
that he will never make the same mistakes as his parents. "Jake's Women" is 
likely to deal with whether this 23-year-old really knew what he was talking 
about. 
</P>
<P>
In "Broadway Bound," as in life, there are also a number of smaller escapes, 
each of which allows the actors a telling moment of metamorphosis. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene's brother, Stanley, played by a scene-stealing David Ellenstein as the 
ultimate hothead, escapes from a sales job in boys clothing to a life of easy 
money and easy women by setting a fire under Eugene's talent and making it work 
for both of them. 
</P>
<P>
And a fire is just what James Saba needs as Eugene. Saba has timing and talent 
to spare, but he conveys the desire to write comedy without convincing us of 
his need to write comedy. That desperate conviction that humor is the only 
knife he has that can cut his way out of his coffin is the edge that is missing 
from an otherwise likable performance. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the ensemble, under the firm, unsentimental direction of guest 
director Larry Arrick, provides a consistent, tensile strength that makes the 
jokes -- coming as they do amid the tears -- bounce very high indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene's father, achingly played by Tavis Ross, escapes from a life of quiet 
desperation by running into the arms of another woman. 
</P>
<P>
Howard London is the genuine, endearingly crotchety article as Eugene's 
grandfather, who escapes from his wife and her upscale Miami migration through 
his dedication to Trotsky's socialist principles. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene's Aunt Blanche, a small part sensitively if lightly sketched by Allison 
Brennan, escapes from Brighton Beach poverty -- and acceptance -- through 
marriage to a rich man. 
</P>
<P>
Only Eugene's mother, Kate, doesn't escape. She stays at home, abandoned in 
turn by husband, sons and father, polishing so religiously the table her 
grandfather carved for her grandmother that you imagine that she can see the 
faces of the departed in its lustrous gleam. 
</P>
<P>
It is that picture of her, frozen in time, that makes this play Simon's Jewish 
"I Remember Mama." But the play is not mere sentimental canonization. The 
suppleness of Simon's writing here leaves for ambiguities in the interpretation 
of Kate's character. April Shawhan plays on Kate's taut control and 
self-restraint, but she also captures her brittle fragility, a whiff of steel 
magnolias curling around the tempered Brooklyn steel. Linda Lavin, as seen in 
an excerpt of the play in a Tony awards broadcast (she won Best Actress for 
this role), was tough as they come -- no sugar on that pill. 
</P>
<P>
There is room for both Kates because, like the family the Jerome brothers write 
about in their first radio sketch, Kate may have been modeled on one very 
particular woman (Simon's mother, as the playwright has said in previous 
interviews), but the character's range is great enough to be stretched to 
portray so many others. 
</P>
<P>
To the Gaslamp's credit, professionalism gleams from this production as surely 
as the sheen from the table. The company started off right by hiring Arrick. 
Guest directors, a relatively new move by the Gaslamp, can usher in fresh ideas 
as Arrick does here. And the technical support is as solid as always, from the 
handsome two-story set by Nick Reid -- realistic, lower class -- the muted hues 
of Jeanne Reith's costume design and the urban sound design by Michael Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
"Broadway Bound" whets the appetite for the next Simon, now in pre-production a 
few scant miles away and it augurs well for the new Gaslamp season. Just what 
the good "Doc" (as Simon has been nicknamed for his script-doctoring skills) 
might have ordered.

RED RODNEY TAKES JAZZ ON TRIP BACK INTO THE '40S AND '50S AT ELARIO'S

<TEXT>
<P>
Be-bop trumpeter Red Rodney's current stay at Elario's gives you three bands in 
one. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's opening night, a trio kicked off the second set, spotlighting 
Los Angeles pianist Frank Strazzeri, whose quirky, ambling improvisations are 
reminiscent of Thelonious Monk's. Strazzeri chose Monk's "Aronel" as his first 
tune. 
</P>
<P>
The trio became a quartet when San Diego saxman Gary LeFebvre took the stage, 
and his bright tenor soared over the rhythm section. LeFebvre, who was 
virtually invisible for a few years, has been working hard lately, and it's 
paying off with some fine playing. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was the quintet completed by Rodney, whose career has enjoyed a 
renaissance because of the portrayal of him as Charlie Parker's sidekick in the 
movie "Bird," about Parker's life. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the years have aged Rodney's playing gracefully. Some of his best 
moments came when he switched to fluegelhorn. His slurry, smooth ramblings, 
punctuated by stinging highs, made a perfect counterpoint to LeFebvre's sax. 
Closing your eyes, you might have thought you had stepped back to some of the 
great trumpet-sax cutting contests of the '40s or '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney chose a broad range of material for the band's first night together. 
</P>
<P>
The swinging "No Turn on Red," the title song from his latest album, included 
solos from Rodney, LeFebvre and Strazzeri, whose unusual phrasings combined 
emotion with intellect. 
</P>
<P>
LeFebvre and Rodney were surprisingly tight, tossing musical ideas back and 
forth, or joining in tandem to harmonize on melody lines. 
</P>
<P>
"How Do You Know," written by Rodney's collaborator Garry Dial, again featured 
Rodney's buttery-smooth fluegelhorn, his improvised lines climbing and dipping 
just enough to keep things inter esting. 
</P>
<P>
In the bop tradition, Rodney and LeFebvre took a popular standard, "The Girl 
from Ipanema," and turned it into an electrified speed burner, with the melody 
coming so fast you didn't recognize the song at first. By now, the band was 
smoking, and Rodney laughed out loud with pleasure, clapping LeFebvre on the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney's version of "Greensleeves" provided a base for some John Coltrane-like 
modal soloing on the part of both LeFebvre and Rodney, before segueing 
seamlessly into Coltrane's "Giant Steps." The horn men stated the familiar 
theme in unison before LeFebvre took the first solo. 
</P>
<P>
A a follow-up, Rodney put down his horn and beamed like a Christmas tree as he 
sang a be-bop takeoff on a nursery rhyme, bettering the version by the actor 
who played him in "Bird." A medium tempo blues closed the set, with Rodney on 
trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
The band seemed to please its distinguished leader. Rodney complemented the 
precision of Strazzeri, LeFebvre, and locals Bob Magnusson and Jim Plank on 
bass and drums. 
</P>
<P>
With two nights under its belt, the group will undoubtedly provide some even 
tighter, brighter musical moments during this short engagement, which ends 
Sunday.

DRAMA: 'MEN DON'T LEAVE' TELLS OF LOVE, LOSS AND LIFE'S BLISSFUL 
UNPREDICTABILITY.

<P>
Ever been so wretched that you ate Spaghetti-Os cold from a can? That the clean 
unsorted laundry piled up until it threatened to overrun the place? That's 
major depression, and the wonder is that its numbing realities could be part of 
a movie with the surprise and the elation of "Men Don't Leave" (throughout San 
Diego County). The year's first tonic, it's a tender, beautifully acted, 
diabolically droll film on the subject of love, loss and the sheer blissful 
unpredictability of life. 
</P>
<P>
It's that unpredictability that holds the movie's charm, not the picture's 
subject matter, which is moving but far from startling. It's the what-if 
nightmare familiar to every neurotic worthy of the name: "What would I do if I 
lost you?" Renovating their comfortable house in the suburbs of Baltimore, the 
Macauleys -- John (Tom Mason) and Beth (Jessica Lange) and their sons, teen-age 
Chris (Chris O'Donnell) and 9-year-old Matt (Charlie Korsmo) -- are a 
close-knit, cheerfully ordinary family until tragedy hits. 
</P>
<P>
Director Paul Brickman, in his first film since "Risky Business," and his 
co-writer, Barbara Benedek (of "The Big Chill" and, alas, "Immediate Family"), 
give this not-uncommon situation unexpected delights of character. While "Men 
Don't Leave" is rooted in real emotions, it also has the highest concentration 
of grand and endearingly offbeat characters since "The Accidental Tourist." 
</P>
<P>
They include Joan Cusack as a preternaturally self-assured hospital X-ray 
technician; Kathy Bates as the Baltimore gourmet shop owner who finally employs 
the widowed Lange, and Arliss Howard as a witty, laconic composer whose music 
is scored for typewriters, full orchestra and pedal steel. The secret, of 
course, is that none of the three consider themselves offbeat; they simply go 
about their lives at an oblique angle to the rest of the functioning world. 
</P>
<P>
Lange's first months on her own with her sons are a litany of necessary 
adjustments: the crackerbox Baltimore apartment that takes the place of their 
overmortgaged, underinsured house; Lange's desperately overbright job 
interviews and the boys' unexpected choices of new friends in the big city. For 
O'Donnell, it's Cusack, a ditsy "older woman" in their apartment building; for 
Korsmo, it's a friendly fellow fourth-grader who uses a switch-blade to divide 
his Milk Duds and whose after-school activities would give his parents 
nightmares, if they ever suspected them. 
</P>
<P>
The screenplay is most perceptive as it suggests the ways that even the most 
closely knit family can unravel. Lange must cope with her 17-year-old's playing 
man of the house -- at her house and Cusack's; with her 9-year-old's poignant 
search for an ideal family, and with her own growing depression as she tries to 
keep every base covered at once. 
</P>
<P>
The script may strain our good will slightly with its lottery-ticket subplot or 
with Arliss Howard's deadpan Charles Simon, who seems to have every virtue -- 
including being recently unattached. Immediately intrigued by Lange, his remedy 
for her sadness is an uninhibited night out at a polka hall "where everybody's 
fatter than you and there's no shame." A lusty, measurable attraction springs 
up between the two, both recovering souls, but unfortunately Howard arrives too 
soon in her mourning process. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Macauley emerges as a performance of heart, complexity and enormously 
subtle shadings, Lange's best since "Tootsie." It's nice to have an outlet for 
Lange's humor again, in physical moments like her hilarious polka scene, or as 
she snarls in outrage as the professionally soothing Cusack marches in to treat 
her clinical depression. 
</P>
<P>
"Men Don't Leave" (rated PG-13) doesn't depend on Lange's virtuosity alone, 
however; it's ensemble stuff in the hands of an uncommonly sensitive and 
inventive director. Its most poignant scene goes to Chris O'Donnell, pleading 
his mother's case with Howard. Brickman wisely keeps his camera on the boy's 
agonized face and lets the scene run until it cracks the heart. 
</P>
<P>
In among these adult pros -- including a Cusack at the very top of her form and 
a hell-for-leather character for Kathy Bates -- what Brickman has gotten from 
these two young debuting actors is stunning. Subject to a barrage of 
conflicting emotions, O'Donnell is sensitive, funny and furious, by degrees, 
and the younger Korsmo seems likely to take over from the gifted Lukas Haas as 
that actor grows into older roles. 
</P>
<P>
Every single technical credit is fine: Bruce Surtees' moody, evocative lighting 
camera work; Richard Chew's impeccable editing; Susan Becker's deliberately 
unchic costumes for Lange; the production design of Barbara Ling and Curt 
Frisk's sound recording, which turns the noise of that X-ray, buckling in 
O'Donnell's hand as he prepares to meet adulthood, into witty aural 
punctuation.

PREVIEW: HOLLYWOOD POSTERS ARE ART TO PHOTOGRAPHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last 3 1/2 years, photographer Don Weinstein has been on the artistic 
equivalent of a scavenger hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein, who owns a custom photo lab in Hollywood, scours the streets there, 
keeping tabs on the posters that go up on buildings and construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the posters advertise some form of entertainment: movies, rock 
bands, records, magazines. Weinstein takes mental notes as they go up and keeps 
track as they are battered by weather, dirt and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
When the moment is right, he swoops in with his camera. The resulting pictures 
are fascinating. Like much good photography, they combine a fine art 
sensibility with a journalist's look at contemporary society. Often the 
photographs look like collages, for the posters of Hollywood are plastered one 
on another, only to peel and tear away like layers of decaying skin. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein's works are well worth the trip to the Pierce College Art Gallery, 
although finding the gallery is only slightly easier than nosing out art on the 
streets of Hollywood. It is in a low building near the top of a hill in the 
center of the campus. Weinstein said he is pleased to have a show at the school 
because he studied photojournalism at Pierce in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the photos evoke emotion. One such is of Marilyn Monroe. The late 
actress has been the subject of so many posters and paintings, it is difficult 
to imagine a fresh treatment of her. But Weinstein's shot makes Marilyn a 
haunting apparition as she looks out from behind graffiti and streaks of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
"The subjects are very difficult to find," said Weinstein. "The Marilyn one is 
a good example. The poster is the cover of an L.A. Style magazine. They 
plastered it all over. I waited and waited for something interesting to happen 
with one of them, but it never did. Then the posters disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, he came upon the weathered Marilyn. 
</P>
<P>
Juxtaposition is a key element in the works. One has a wane, lonely man 
appearing to watch a voluptuous chorus girl. In truth, the characters are from 
two different movie posters. Another shows part of Madonna's face and, on an 
adjoining poster, the words "rock 'n' roll" in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein said he composes the works in the camera, sometimes zeroing in on a 
small area. He usually takes just one shot and does little darkroom 
enhancement. The photographs are startling in their sense of dimension. Often 
the rips seem to be in the pictures themselves, not in the posters that were 
photographed. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein said posters come and go more quickly than ever in Hollywood, making 
it increasingly difficult to find subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'll find posters piled up 20 layers thick," he said. "We're a 
throwaway society, and that's something I try to get across." 
</P>
<P>
 "Posters and Portraits," a show by photographer Don Weinstein will run through 
March 13 at the Pierce College Art Gallery, 6201 Winnetka Ave., Woodland Hills. 
Gallery hours are noon to 4 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays and 6 to 8:30 p.m. 
Tuesdays and Wednesdays. For information, (818) 347-0551.

AT THE GALLERIES: THE SHOUTS OF OVEJERO'S WORK DISSOLVE INTO WHITE NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEAH OLLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From its meandering title to its rapacious command of space, Graciela Ovejero's 
exhibition at the Centro Cultural de la Raza drums on the senses with a bold, 
nervous energy. The lush, pulsing strokes of her paintings and the surprising 
forms of her installations engage mind and body alike, shifting each into a 
state of mild disorientation, laced with disdain. 
</P>
<P>
Ovejero's works surround, threaten, confront and confuse. They shout, but their 
voices dissolve into a chorus of white noise -- loud but indistinct. 
</P>
<P>
The artist, born and educated in Argentina, lives in San Diego, where she has 
participated in several group shows. "Waste Contesting the Rewards of Crusading 
for a Flat Earth" (through March 11) is being billed as her first one-person 
show in a professional gallery in this country. It is dense with ambition and 
fervor but far too short on focus and resolve. 
</P>
<P>
"The works explore different aspects of contemporary and universal human 
conflicts," Ovejero writes in a wall statement, "basically denouncing a faded 
sense of compassion under the exaltation of ideals of grandeur and the 
constantly refined mechanisms of power surveillance at social and individual 
levels." 
</P>
<P>
Images and situations related to the ideas expressed here emerge in Ovejero's 
work, but only vaguely. In her paintings, all untitled, figures display this 
"faded sense of compassion" through their alienating distance from one another, 
and their sealed, impenetrable eyes. Despite the visual richness of the 
paintings, with their braids of mellow and vibrant color, they tell of 
psychological distress. 
</P>
<P>
Postures are exaggerated, contorted, and often figures are twisted like rope. 
Many lack legs or arms. A faceless bureaucrat, a news maker prodded by 
microphones, a religious leader, an eerily hooded laborer and many anonymous 
figures, arms wrapped around themselves in self-protection, haunt the canvases, 
rooted neither to the earth nor each other. Their gaping mouths and smeared 
features allude to horrors that are never defined. Angst, canvas after canvas, 
begins to feel like affectation. 
</P>
<P>
Ovejero's installations recycle objects and textures from the everyday world. A 
rough crust of mud coats a group of chairs, making their way, caterpillar-like, 
down a wall and across the floor. A refrigerator filled with chunks of asphalt 
casts a long, yellow, human-like shadow. In "Pieta," two wood-framed figures 
hover over an Astroturf platform littered with miniature military equipment. 
And, in the most imposing installation, an adult's torture is paired with a 
child's game. An immense, foam-rubber figure tied to a stake looms forward over 
a hopscotch game, whose circles and squares are framed by shoes painted white. 
A gray foam sack, marked "Western-Made," covers the figure's head. 
</P>
<P>
Though polemical in spirit, the works' passion seems undirected. 
Interpretations can be overlaid, but rarely do they fit snugly or even 
convincingly. 
</P>
<P>
One untitled installation, for instance, can be read as a dialogue between 
chaos and compartmentalization. Eight identical, sculpted briefcases form a low 
hedge before a broad canvas. Above, a huge constructed heart hangs inches above 
a fishing net. The canvas itself is divided into three parts. In the center, a 
box opens to reveal a light bulb in one of its four partitioned sections. 
Surrounding the box are further compartments, formed of stiffened and painted 
rags, that contain various quantities of bread rolls. 
</P>
<P>
To either side of this sprawling center section are painted images of swirling 
maelstroms. A silhouetted figure makes its vertiginous fall into the eye of 
each storm, while flames, sword-bearing stick figures and horrific variants on 
the Mona Lisa swim in the surrounding space. 
</P>
<P>
The individual, sucked into the abyss, is framed by pressures: the regulated 
anonymity suggested by the briefcases; the imposing genius of those who came 
before, such as Leonardo; the controlled allocation of resources, hinted at by 
the unevenly distributed bread, and finally, the weight of emotion and instinct 
that, in the shape of the heart, hovers over all our actions. 
</P>
<P>
Such interpretations slide off Ovejero's work just as easily as they slide on, 
for there are too many loose ends for any single concept to stick. Although 
this can often be a positive attribute, here it is a symptom of an artist's 
abundant energy spread too thin.

CLIPPERS DEAL FOR GARLAND; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: HE ISN'T THE BIG-NAME PLAYER L.A. WANTED, BUT HE COST ONLY TWO NO. 2 
PICKS AND COULD BE A STARTER SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Danny Ainge stayed in Sacramento and Jeff Malone in Washington, capital players 
both, but the Clippers still got some much-needed help in a trade before the 
deadline passed at 6 p.m. PST Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He has playoff experience, can play both backcourt positions, and, best of all, 
came relatively cheap. It's just that Winston Garland isn't really a household 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly not getting the high-impact player they wanted, the Clippers 
acquired Garland, a third-year guard, from the Golden State Warriors for 
second-round picks in 1990 and '92, a modest sum to pay for a potential 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
The deal appears to be sound for the Clippers. For one thing, Garland is a 
guard who ran Golden State's up-tempo offense last season to a surprising 43-39 
record and a first-round playoff upset of the Utah Jazz. Secondly, the Clippers 
surrendered only two No. 2 draft choices in years they still have two No. 1s, 
thanks to the Ron Harper trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers in November. 
</P>
<P>
It's far more curious for the Warriors, who are left with one point guard, 
rookie Tim Hardaway. It was apparently the high regard Don Nelson, Golden 
State's coach and general manager, had for Hardaway that made Garland 
expendable. 
</P>
<P>
But with the Clippers -- their starting backcourt of Gary Grant and Harper out 
for the season with injuries and key reserve Tom Garrick playing hurt -- 
Garland figures to become an integral member, especially this season. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to make his first appearance Sunday against the San Antonio 
Spurs at the Sports Arena, will have a good chance to start soon, and is looked 
upon as a solid backup to Grant in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been difficult for anybody in the second round to come here and 
make this team in the future," Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor said. 
"Also, he is a proven player. You're not going to find a guard in the second 
round as good as Garland." 
</P>
<P>
A second-round pick by the Milwaukee Bucks in 1987, Garland fit perfectly into 
the role of the Warriors of 1988-89, largely a rag-tag group that became one of 
the NBA's success stories. He was signed by Golden State in November of 1988 
after being cut from the Bucks, only to be released the next month. A few days 
and a short Continental Basketball Assn. stint later, Nelson brought him back. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Garland started in all 79 of his appearances, averaging 6.4 
assists and 2.2 steals, both team highs, and 14.5 points. In February of 1989, 
he was signed a four-year contract worth a reported $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
He was averaging just 5.3 points, 3.1 assists and 17.5 minutes at the time of 
the trade. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a positive move for myself and the Clippers," said Garland, from 
Southwest Missouri State. "It's an opportunity to play a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers made no secret of their interest in Ainge and Malone, but felt 
that the asking prices were far too steep. Baylor made his final calls about 20 
minutes before the deadline, but nothing had changed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot more frustrating than hectic," Baylor said.

KING ANSWERS DOUGLAS-MIRAGE SUIT BY FILING HIS OWN AGAINST THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boxing promoter Don King, slapped with a lawsuit Wednesday by heavyweight 
champion Buster Douglas and the Mirage Hotel, responded in kind Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
King, in a suit filed in U.S. District Court in New York against Douglas and 
the Mirage, seeks several million dollars in damages and an injunction to 
prevent Douglas from fighting anyone without King as promoter. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas and the Mirage are seeking to break King's exclusive promotional clause 
in the contract Douglas had to sign in order to fight then-champion Mike Tyson 
in Tokyo Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
King's suit names the Mirage and Golden Nugget, Inc., parent company of the 
Mirage, as interfering with King's contract with Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
The Mirage said Wednesday it had signed Douglas to a "conditional agreement" 
for his first title defense in September, probably against Evander Holyfield, 
providing his contract with King can be broken in court. 
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, new details trickled out on the Douglas-Mirage deal. It was 
reported that it is actually a two-fight deal, with Douglas getting $25 million 
for the first fight and, if successful, $35 million to fight Tyson. Douglas 
will also acquire, if successful in both fights, an option to buy 100,000 
shares of Golden Nugget stock, the Associated Press reported. EARL GUSTKEY

STEVE JOHNSON GOES TO SUPERSONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Disgruntled center Steve Johnson, who has feuded with Minnesota management 
since being picked third in the 1989 NBA expansion draft, was traded Thursday 
night to Seattle in exchange for forward Brad Sellers. 
</P>
<P>
The Timberwolves also would give Seattle their 1991 second-round draft pick if 
they make a contract offer to Sellers by July 1 or if they sign Sellers to a 
contract that covers at least the 1990-91 season, according to the 
Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers, the former Ohio State star who was the No. 1 pick of the Chicago Bulls 
in the 1986 draft, is averaging 4.8 points and 1.6 rebounds in 45 games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics acquired the 7-foot, 227-pound Sellers from Chicago in exchange 
for Seattle's first-round draft pick in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who often has asked to be traded this season, has not scored while 
playing only 17 minutes in four games for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was the No. 1 pick of the Kansas City Kings in the 1981 draft. He also 
played with Chicago, San Antonio and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Other centers were on the move as well, as the Charlotte Hornets traded former 
UCLA 7-footer Stuart Gray to the New York Knicks for a second-round draft pick 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a exchange of West German 7-footers, the Golden State Warriors sent Uwe 
Blab to the San Antonio Spurs for Christian Welp. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, obtained from Indiana for Charlotte's second-round pick in the 1989 
draft, was expected to be the answer to Charlotte's woes in the middle, but he 
averaged only 2.6 points and 3.4 rebounds in 39 games.

BLACKMAN'S HOMECOMING MISSING SOMETHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rolando Blackman should be getting excited about returning to New York, where 
he moved from Panama when he was 7. On Tuesday, he will stop by Rolando 
Blackman Park in Brooklyn, see old friends, then play the Knicks, the team he 
idolized during his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
He knows, however, that despite the Mavericks' recent record -- five 
consecutive victories and 12 victories in their last 14 games prior to Thursday 
night's game at Milwaukee -- a lot is missing: Excitement. Fear. Respect. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, very simply, are not an attraction, and Blackman knows it. But 
that does not prevent him from dreaming how it could have been. If not for two 
drug-related suspensions of star forward Roy Tarpley, and if only Mark Aguirre 
had been as dedicated to basketball as Blackman, it could have been different. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have had a viable basketball team," Blackman said. "We could have 
whupped anybody. Anybody." 
</P>
<P>
And that would have made the Knicks-Mavericks game special, particularly for 
Blackman, a 6-6, 200-pound prototype shooting guard who graduated from William 
Grady High School in Brooklyn and patterned his game after his favorite Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
He loves to twirl and spin when driving in the lane. "That's Earl Monroe," he 
says. He utilizes quick footwork and a variety of head and shoulder fakes to 
free himself for jump shots. "That's Walt Frazier." And the picture-perfect 
jump shot delivered after he is freed by a screen? "That's Bill Bradley." 
</P>
<P>
But instead of focusing on Blackman, whose career shooting percentage of .503 
makes him one of the most accurate outside shooters in NBA history, most of the 
attention has been on the Mavericks' problems: Aguirre, who was traded to the 
Pistons, and Tarpley, who has drained Blackman of patience. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not emotionally married to the (Tarpley) situation anymore," Blackman 
said. "We're not married to Roy where if he's gone, we're going to die. We're 
not going to be shocked." 
</P>
<P>
Blackman admits he sometimes wonders about how it would have been without the 
distractions. 
</P>
<P>
"With a scorer like Mark in a good mood and ready to play, with Roy Tarpley 
next to him, we could have been one of the top four basketball teams in the 
league," Blackman, a four-time All-Star, said. "And when we came to the Garden, 
or every time we'd go into an arena, people would have hated us and booed us, 
which is an honor. They would come in, buy their popcorn, and give us hell. 
That's what you want. 
</P>
<P>
"But with us, it's been like a soap opera. When you talk about us, it's not 
that we have a six-game winning streak, it's who's missing and who's not; who 
wants this and who wants that. It was just terrible." 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks received a lot of credit for building their franchise from an 
expansion team in 1980 to a conference finalist in 1987, but they never have 
been an attraction. Blackman has to wonder what it would have been like if, 
instead of drafting talented losers, the Mavericks would have drafted more 
winners like himself. 
</P>
<P>
Magic General Manager Pat Williams is a part-time comic, so it's not surprising 
he had a few observations on the reported five-year, $27.5-million contract 
recently awarded to Commissioner David Stern: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "One of David's sons asked his father if he could buy a chemistry set. 
David went out and bought the Dupont company." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "David is now about to move into a neighborhood where the Girl Scouts go 
door-to-door selling croissants ... Every spring, kids sign up for Little 
League polo ... The Salvation Army band has a string section ... The bird 
feeders have salad bars." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "David sends his kids to an exclusive camp where they tell stories sitting 
around the microwave." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "David is going to have to get a new 50-foot yacht. The other one got wet." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "All I know is that on airplane trips, David's wallet will be considered 
carry-on baggage." 
</P>
<P>
Mark those calendars. In September, the made-for-TV movie starring the Laker 
Girls will be televised, and it promises to be exciting -- that is, if your 
idea of entertainment is watching a two-minute dance routine for two hours. But 
the Laker Girls have big aspirations. Singer Paula Abdul was once a Laker Girl, 
so who knows? 
</P>
<P>
The strangest part of the movie, however, is the site. It's being filmed at the 
Clippers' home, the Sports Arena, instead of at the Forum, which is booked. 
Hopefully, that doesn't mean one of the Laker Girls will suffer a major knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
It was already going to be difficult taking a film starring the Laker Girls 
seriously, but filming anything to do with the Lakers in the Sports Arena gives 
it even less credibility. It's a little like filming the Walt Frazier story at 
Meadowlands Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Spurs forward Zarko Paspalj of Yugoslavia recently told Hawks forward Alexander 
Volkov of the Soviet Union he would not return to play for the Spurs next 
season. Paspalj, who has played in fewer than half the Spurs games and averages 
seven minutes when he does play, is unhappy with his playing time. Last summer, 
he turned down a lucrative offer to play in Spain. According to Volkov, he said 
he wants to go play somewhere where he is respected. 
</P>
<P>
That's understandable, but leaving America and the NBA is a little radical. All 
he has to do is ask for a trade to the Nets, a team that obviously has a great 
deal of respect for anyone who resembles a basketball player.

Roy Marble of the Atlanta Hawks was suspended by the NBA for the remainder of 
the season Thursday for violating the league's substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
The team announced that Duane Ferrell, a former member of the Hawks, has been 
signed to a 10-day contract as a roster replacement for Marble. 
</P>
<P>
Marble, a 6-foot-6, 190-pound guard from Iowa, was the 23rd player chosen in 
June's draft. 
</P>
<P>
Hawk spokesman Arthur Triche said the team had no comment on the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Marble averaged 2.1 points and one rebound in 24 games with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrell, a former Georgia Tech star who was cut during training camp, averaged 
24.3 points and 6.3 rebounds in 40 games this season with Topeka of the 
Continental Basketball Assn. Ferrell averaged 2.4 points in 41 games with the 
Hawks last season.

MEMORIES SOMETIMES BLUR IN 10 YEARS SINCE 'THE MIRACLE ON ICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT CALABRIA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 10 years this week that the U.S. Olympic Hockey Team stuck its foot into 
the glass slipper and walked away with a gold medal at Lake Placid, a fairy 
tale if there ever was one, and, boy, where does the time go? Herb Brooks 
looked so young and mean back then, and like his players it's hard to imagine 
him ever growing old. And now Herb Brooks is 52. 
</P>
<P>
The legend of Lake Placid has aged, too, a few of the details growing fuzzy, 
the mind playing a few tricks. But the story endures because the kids from the 
U S of A did more than just capture a championship. They began the Olympics as 
longshots; they left as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
They wrote a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
These weren't high-priced superstars tooling around in Ferraris and hanging out 
at Elaine's. They were collegians and failed minor-leaguers giving it their 
best shot and, what the heck, seeing what could happen. The Soviets were big 
and powerful -- invincible, we all thought. Team USA was made up of youngsters 
from down the block who mowed your lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a meeting we had early on, after the team was picked," said Rob 
McClanahan, then a center and now a sales broker in Chicago. "Herb gave us a 
talk and although he didn't say this exactly, the message was something like, 
'If we play very well, get some breaks, we could win a bronze medal. If we play 
over our heads, catch a huge break, we can get a silver. The gold is the 
Russians'. Forget about it."' 
</P>
<P>
But it's been a long time, so every once in a while the memories become 
blurred. A guy will say, "Remember the night the USA beat the Soviets and won 
the gold medal?" And, of course, it didn't happen that way at all. The United 
States beat the Soviets all right, but it was two days later -- Feb. 24, 1980 
-- that the Americans clinched the gold medal by defeating Finland. Odd, but 
that game is like a footnote now. 
</P>
<P>
"Know what?" said Mark Johnson, who plays for the New Jersey Devils these days. 
"Everyone thinks we won the gold medal in the game against the Russians, except 
the people who were there." It's, like, as long as they beat the Soviets, 
nothing else matters. 
</P>
<P>
But it does. Those upstarts from small towns like Grand Rapids, Minn., and 
Charleston, Mass., tossing their sticks in the air, Mike Eruzione collapsed in 
tears, Jim Craig wrapped in an American flag and asking, "Where's my father?" 
-- that was like something out of a TV movie that, naturally, it became. If you 
happened to miss it, it was called "Miracle on Ice." 
</P>
<P>
"The movie?" McClanahan said. "To me, it was a little sappy." 
</P>
<P>
Like anything else, the movie exaggerated a few facts, ignored some others, and 
squashed eight months of practice, travel and competition into three hours in 
prime time. It came across like a real tearjerker, all hearts and flowers. The 
fact is, the Olympians rode a bumpy path to Lake Placid. People forget that. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Americans arrived, they were exhausted and cranky from a 
nationwide tour. There was some squabbling. And the country really didn't take 
much notice of the team until the game against the Soviets, a story in itself. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets had demolished the United States, 10-3, in a pre-Olympic game at 
Madison Square Garden. So Brooks figured he'd better have something good to say 
to inspire his young players. 
</P>
<P>
The locker room was hushed when he stood up before the game, reached into his 
pocket and fished out a wrinkled slip of paper. And then he said: 
</P>
<P>
"You are born to be a player. You are meant to be here at this time. This is 
your moment." 
</P>
<P>
As speeches go, it was right up there with Knute Rockne telling Notre Dame to 
win one for the Gipper. But, it turns out, Brooks really hadn't been sure of 
what he wanted to say. He scribbled down a few notes and phrases and then kind 
of blurted them out, not exactly the way the story's been passed down. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks laughs about it now. "It just sort of came out the way it did," he said. 
"Let me tell you something, it was no Gettysburg Address." 
</P>
<P>
Let's just say it did the job. Johnson's shot with one second left in the first 
period pulled the United States into a 2-2 tie and the Soviets, panicking, 
yanked their famous goalie, Vladislav Tretiak. Behind 3-2 in the third period, 
the Americans fought back with goals by Dave Silk and Eruzione, won the game, 
4-3, and the fable began to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
The natural reaction was to think that the dispirited Soviets had nothing but 
contempt for the Americans. It also was natural to think the Americans loved 
sticking it to the Soviets, them being Communists and all. But as Eruzione 
said, "We were athletes, and to us it was an athletic event. We didn't think of 
it as a political event." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, they were too busy slapping helmets and trying to grasp the 
enormity of their victory. And the Soviets, well, they understood and 
appreciated just what the U.S. players had achieved, although it wasn't until 
later that congratulations were passed along in a whisper and a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after leaving the ice, Johnson was in an office supplying a urine 
sample to the drug-testing people when he caught the eye of Boris Mikhailov, 
the Soviet captain, sitting on a bench across the room. Mikhailov motioned 
Johnson closer. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys play very well," he said, his thick accent right out of a spy flick. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprised me," Johnson said. "I didn't expect it. To be honest, he sounded 
happy for us." 
</P>
<P>
That victory got the puck rolling. The Americans, cast in the role of upstarts, 
had a wholesome appeal, even if some of it was contrived. True, they were 
bouncy, happy, working-class kids, but their closeness has always been a little 
overstated. Remember, some teammates got bugged when Brooks bent the rules and 
let defenseman Ken Morrow keep his beard. 
</P>
<P>
"We were close," Morrow said. "But we also had a lot of different groups -- 
cliques -- guys from Boston, guys from Michigan, a big Minnesota contingent. 
There was always a lot of kidding going on, a lot of rivalry. What I'm trying 
to say is, we were just like any normal team." 
</P>
<P>
Morrow would go on to win four Stanley Cups with the New York Islanders after 
winning the gold medal, which must be some kind of record, and now is an 
assistant coach with the New York Rangers' farm team in Flint, Mich. Craig 
rebounded from a brief, checkered NHL career, eventually was cleared of 
criminal charges stemming from a fatal automobile accident and currently is a 
sales representative in Brockton, Mass. Mark Pavelich, who always skated to his 
own beat, hunts and fishes in the Minnesota woods. 
</P>
<P>
But it's funny how things work out sometimes. Johnson and Viacheslav Fetisov, 
the great Soviet defenseman, are teammates now with the Devils. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of the Olympians, plus Brooks and assistant coach Craig Patrick, rode 
the wave of popularity to careers in the NHL. For most of them, though, there's 
been nothing like the afternoon they beat the Finns, 4-2, for the gold medal 
while the crowd in Lake Placid chanted, "U!S!A!" 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we write history books," Brooks said. "It gives us perspective. And 
the perspective we have now is that we proved that certain ingredients and the 
proper intangibles shared by a group can make things happen for the betterment 
of that group; that a work ethic, comradeship, and love and respect for 
teammates can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"And we learned good things happen if the group has its head screwed on right." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the line that everyone remembers is Al Michaels shouting: "Do you 
believe in miracles?" Now, the word "miracle" gets a lot of exposure, what with 
every game-winning, ground-rule double immediately videotaped and immortalized. 
The Americans, all freckles and goose bumps, coming out of nowhere to beat the 
odds and win the gold, that may not exactly qualify as a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
But it's close.

FORGIVE HIM IF HE MAKES SOME WILD CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Gianquinto is a college basketball official and if there's one thing he 
really enjoys, it's blowing a call. 
</P>
<P>
But when Gianquinto blows a call, he isn't making a mistake on goaltending or a 
three-second violation, he's calling a pintail or a mallard or a teal or a 
widgeon. The creator of three instructional videotapes, Gianquinto explained 
his off-the-court work: "I teach people how to call ducks." 
</P>
<P>
That would seem easy enough. Just look up their numbers in the book. But, hey, 
let's get serious. The true duck hunter knows how vital a good duck call is out 
there on those cold, drippy mornings. This is where Gianquinto comes in. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old San Francisco native, who has been calling West Coast 
Conference and Big West basketball games for 10 years, has waterfowl-calling 
schools in Santa Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
Gianquinto said he found his inspiration one night during a timeout of a game 
he was officiating. 
</P>
<P>
As he blew softly through his referee's whistle, Gianquinto realized that he 
could develop a new duck call. Later, he modified the whistle by filing its 
insides and sliding a piece of cork inside the mouthpiece. 
</P>
<P>
"All ducks quack, but most ducks whistle," Gianquinto said. "Most people don't 
know that." 
</P>
<P>
Once a duck hears Gianquinto's whistle, he's probably through traveling. The 
secret is not to think like a pintail. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thinks of a duck, they think of . . . a mallard," Gianquinto said. 
"See, the most abundant duck we have here on the West Coast is what we call a 
pintail. And that's a whistling bird. It very rarely quacks." 
</P>
<P>
Gianquinto went to City College of San Francisco, where he played football with 
O.J. Simpson, then on to the University of Idaho and San Francisco State. He 
was the football coach at Piner High in Santa Rosa for 13 years before getting 
into the duck-calling business. When Gianquinto isn't carrying his whistle into 
the field, he's carrying it onto the court. He will officiate his 46th game of 
the basketball season tonight when Loyola plays host to the University of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said of Gianquinto's officiating: "I think he's a 
good, solid official. He just calls a good, consistent, but not flashy game. 
That's all you can ask, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Joe Harrington of Cal State Long Beach is anticipating Gianquinto's 
appearance at one of the 49ers' games: "When he comes out, maybe he'll give me 
a quack." 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong fisherman, Gianquinto didn't begin hunting until he was 18. And his 
first experience with hunting provided no clue that, as far as occupations go, 
ducks would eventually fill the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated to duck-hunt because I went out in the cold weather one time and I 
fell in the water with my boots on and almost drowned," Gianquinto said. "I 
told the guy, 'If you ever ask me to do this again, I'm gonna punch you right 
in the chops.' But I went again and fell in love with it." 
</P>
<P>
Gianquinto may be widely known in duck-calling circles, but only recently have 
basketball fans begun associating the duck caller with the official. After he 
had conducted a duck-calling seminar in Seattle, he officiated a game at 
Gonzaga, across the state in Spokane. A group of spectators who had been to 
Gianquinto's seminar blew duck calls each time he made a call. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Gianquinto received an honorary degree at San Francisco State. 
</P>
<P>
"They made me doctor of quackology."

Shark attack: After The Times reported Sunday that player Anthony Jones drove a 
sports car belonging to a Nevada Las Vegas supporter during the 1985-86 season, 
an apparent violation of NCAA rules, Coach Jerry Tarkanian took his case before 
a friendly audience. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian went on the offensive Tuesday at his weekly talk to members of the 
Rebel Athletic Club before about 100 in the Thomas &amp; Mack Center. His 
remarks were interrupted by sustained applause. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian berated the press for its coverage of his program and charged that 
reporters are swayed by their perception of Las Vegas as a city. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad thing is that around the country so many people take shots at UNLV and 
Las Vegas. . . . The perception everywhere is that we have hookers and the 
Mafia," he said. "That's what other schools tell a recruit's mom. Then she's 
afraid some hooker's going to get her son." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian also criticized media reports on the suspensions for fighting handed 
UNLV players Chris Jeter and Moses Scurry after a brawl at a game against Utah 
State earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think everybody would gather together, including the media," Tarkanian 
said. "I know you media guys have a job to do. But you TV guys don't need to 
run (videotapes of the fight) every hour. And you writers don't need to attack 
a 19-year-old (Jeter)." 
</P>
<P>
Knightline: Newest 900 phone number is the one for Indiana Coach Bobby Knight, 
featured on the Personality Line, of Columbus, Ohio, a company that also is 
negotiating with new heavyweight boxing champion Buster Douglas. Advertisements 
for the new call-in feature claim Knight will be "fiery . . . infuriating." 
</P>
<P>
This week, though, callers heard Knight criticize late starting times for 
weeknight games because of television, one of his pet peeves. 
</P>
<P>
Callers then could tape questions for Knight and among them were how he 
maintained his winning edge, why he had someone on his television show and 
whether he was a wimp for once pulling his team off the floor during an 
exhibition game with a Soviet basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Knight answered some of last week's questions. He said he liked 
Dick Vitale; admired such women as Joan of Arc, his grandmother, mother, wife 
and his sister in Ft. Wayne, Ind. -- "not necessarily in that order" -- likes 
the six-foul rule and likes country music, especially singer Ray Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
The fiery and infuriating stuff must be coming next week.

FILM MAKERS URGE ACADEMY TO CHANGE SELECTION SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
OSCARS: LETTER SEEKS A WRITE-IN VOTE TO REMEDY THE EXCLUSION OF 'ROGER &amp; 
ME,' TERMED 'THIS YEAR'S MOST VISIBLE, BITING DOCUMENTARY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Controversy and the Academy Awards are inextricably linked. But in recent 
times, the best documentary selections seem to have stirred up more than their 
share. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the uproar centered on the exclusion of "The Thin Blue Line" from 
the list of Oscar contenders. This year, the protest took the form of a letter 
sent, two days ago, to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
expressing "shock and outrage" over the omission of "Roger &amp; Me" -- Michael 
Moore's popular, if controversial, look at the impact of GM layoffs in Flint, 
Mich. The film has grossed more than $5 million since it was released Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Signed by 44 film makers including Haskell Wexler ("Medium Cool"), Robert Young 
("Triumph of the Spirit") and Mira Nair ("Salaam Bombay"), the letter called 
for a restructuring of the academy's nominating committee as well for a 
write-in vote to remedy the exclusion of what it termed "this year's most 
visible, biting documentary." 
</P>
<P>
The group calls for the academy to change its selection system so that the 
nominations reflect "the best, most diverse and innovative films in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, most Oscar nominations are made by professional 
groups within the movie industry: the directors branch of the academy nominates 
directors; cinematographers select cinematographers and so on. 
</P>
<P>
But, because there is no documentary branch, nominations in that category are 
currently made by a committee composed of about four dozen writers, actors, 
editors and some documentary film makers. The committee is also dominated by 
persons who live in the Los Angeles area and, say the critics, is not 
representative of the nation-wide documentary film community. 
</P>
<P>
This year the committee screened 59 films. It took six hours a week over a 
two-month period to see all the movies so few people with busy schedules are 
drawn to the task in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have here is a volunteer committee of good-hearted but fairly 
out-of-touch senior citizens acting as a roadblock against the advancement of 
those films which don't conform to its old-fashioned standards," says Chicago 
Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert, whose syndicated column appearing this week 
outlines some of the alleged inequities in the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
"Awards are everything to a documentary film," Ebert says. "Without them, they 
can't get distributed." 
</P>
<P>
The group of film makers who wrote to the academy want the same kind of 
treatment that other professionals in the industry receive. 
</P>
<P>
"Documentary nominations should be made by active documentary film makers -- a 
panel of peers across the nation," says documentarian Pamela Yates, a friend of 
Moore's who drafted the letter. "Hollywood is only the feature-film capital." 
</P>
<P>
According to Bruce Davis, executive director of the academy, prospects for the 
creation of a documentary branch of the academy are dim. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three board members for each of the 12 branches of the academy -- 
and enough examples of unwieldy boards around town to convince us that we're 
already pushing the outer edges of the envelope. We've tried to revise the 
system, however, limiting membership on the executive committee to a period of 
nine years to insure some turnover and expanding the membership of the 
screening committee to dilute the impact of any individual." 
</P>
<P>
One individual in question is Mitchell Block, an influential member of the 
documentary screening committee since 1979. Though Block was not directly 
mentioned in the Yates letter, an accompanying press release alluded to the 
fact that his firm, Direct Cinema -- a Los Angeles distribution company 
specializing in documentary films -- represents three of the five 
feature-length documentaries nominated this year, as well as one of the shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Though Block declined to be interviewed for this article, a Direct Cinema 
company spokesman acknowledged that, over the past 10 years, the company has 
handled about 20% of all documentary nominees and 35% of the winners. As 
required by the academy, Block has submitted a conflict-of-interest statement 
each year and has refrained from participating in discussions about any of his 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Block has never tried to lobby for his films," says Chuck Workman, an 
Oscar-winning documentary film maker ("Precious Images") who sits on the 
committee. "As far as I know, his behavior this year has been good across the 
board. The members are quite independent-minded and would be offended at the 
suggestion that he in any way affected their votes." 
</P>
<P>
Even Haskell Wexler, one of the signers of the protest letter, is uncomfortable 
with the suggestion that the statistics are a sure sign of guilt. "I don't know 
the man, but Mr. Block may just be very good at his business . . . someone with 
good taste." 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, someone is upset because a film hasn't been nominated," says an 
executive at Block's Direct Cinema. "And every year, Mitchell -- and the 
process -- become a convenient scapegoat. Having our company handle a film 
doesn't increase the chance of it receiving an Oscar nomination because, from 
the moment a producer signs with us, Mitchell is forced to disqualify himself 
from any involvement in the decision-making process. You'd think he'd be 
exactly the kind of member the critics are looking for: a person involved in 
the field who takes the time to watch the movies . . . someone who's under 60 
years old. " 
</P>
<P>
Though there have been no substantiated allegations of wrongdoing, the 
potential for conflict-of-interest precipitated an attempt to remove Block from 
the committee in 1986. No action was taken, however, after Block pointed out 
that it was a problem endemic to the academy as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true, as Mr. Block points out, that there is conflict-of-interest in all 
categories," acknowledges the academy's Bruce Davis. "Actors can vote for 
themselves. Studios vote on their own releases. But in most areas the pool is 
so vast that those things cancel themselves out. Documentaries are a relatively 
small world. We've always been extremely sensitive to the 'Caesar's wife' 
argument . . . that Caesar's wife must be above suspicion. There's no 
possibility of a write-in vote . . . they've been banned since 1936. But the 
letter will cause us to take a good look at the composition of the committee. 
Even the appearance of impropriety will receive our conscientious attention. 
We're very finicky about this type of thing."

ROY ORBISON TRIBUTE TO BENEFIT THE HOMELESS; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: ORBISON'S WIDOW ORGANIZED THE CONCERT, FEATURING AN ALL-STAR LINEUP 
THAT INCLUDES BONNIE RAITT'S FIRST APPEARANCE SINCE HER GRAMMY TRIUMPH. 
</P>

"Roy always said that inside each rock performer there's a homeless person, 
because you start out by sleeping on people's couches," said Barbara Orbison, 
speaking about her late husband Roy. "Now Roy's music is actually helping 
people maybe to have a place to put their heads at night." 
</P>
<P>
The widow of the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer was discussing Saturday's 
Universal Amphitheatre tribute concert to Orbison -- a benefit for the homeless 
that will mark Bonnie Raitt's first performance since her Grammy sweep on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
She'll be joined by a lineup that includes John Fogerty, Emmylou Harris, B.B. 
King, John Hiatt, Iggy Pop, Patrick Swayze and original Byrds Chris Hillman, 
David Crosby and Roger McGuinn. Pete Townshend will made a video appearance 
from London, as will Johnny Cash from Nashville, and surprise appearances are 
expected. Actor Dean Stockwell will serve as host. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Orbison may have been the singer laureate of the lonely, but he was 
obviously anything but lonely. The roster is testimony to the legacy of 
Orbison, a veteran of the '50s Sun Records glory years with Elvis Presley and 
Jerry Lee Lewis who in the early '60s achieved fame with such enduring songs as 
the haunting "Only the Lonely" and the lusty "Oh, Pretty Woman." 
</P>
<P>
Before he died at age 52 of a heart attack on Dec. 8, 1988, Orbison had again 
become a star following his induction into the Hall of Fame and as a member of 
the Traveling Wilburys with Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Tom Petty and Jeff 
Lynne, who just won the rock group vocal Grammy. The quintet's album went to 
No. 1 following Orbison's death. The bespectacled singer's own "Mystery Girl" 
album, recorded shortly before he died, was also a posthumous success. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for Saturday's concert, said the show's executive producer Barbara 
Orbison, came after Royal Crown Cola approached her last year about using "Only 
the Lonely" in a series of public service advertisements about the homeless, 
the soft-drink company's official charity. She was in favor of it, but the 
rights to the song could not be obtained from the publisher. 
</P>
<P>
But the offer nudged Barbara to go ahead with a concert tribute, with Royal 
Crown as corporate sponsor. The event will be taped for later airing as a 
one-hour Showtime cable television special. 
</P>
<P>
Orbison had wanted to mount such a venture ever since her husband's death, but 
first had to get over some emotional hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like I got up one morning and said I wanted to do this," she said. 
"The last year has been the most special and toughest of my life, walking 
through without Roy." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Orbison, 38, was born and raised in Bielefeld, West Germany, where her 
father owned a candy store. She met the singer when he was living in London in 
1968. They were married the next year and had two children (Roy Kelton, 19, and 
Alex, 14) in addition to raising Wesley, Roy's son by his first wife, 
Claudette, who died in a motorcycle accident in 1966. (Two other of Roy's sons 
died in a fire in 1968.) 
</P>
<P>
The point of the show, Orbison said, is not so much to have stars say how much 
they owed her husband, but to act out what he stood for. 
</P>
<P>
"To really put musicians where there is a bond going on, this is what it is all 
about," Orbison said, sitting in her publicist's West Hollywood office. 
"Renewing old friendships and making new ones and remembering what music is all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the format of the concert will differ from the standard 
parade-of-stars tribute. The music will be handled by two backing bands -- the 
musicians who worked on Roy Orbison's "Black and White Night" 1988 cable TV 
special under the direction of T Bone Burnett, and the band Was (Not Was). Most 
numbers will involving groupings of stars rather than individuals. 
</P>
<P>
One spot that Barbara Orbison is especially looking forward to will feature a 
group of female singers assembled by k.d. lang (who won the female country 
vocal on Wednesday, and shared a Grammy with Roy last year for their duet 
"Crying") to perform "Oh, Pretty Woman." Among those joining her will be Raitt, 
Harris, Talking Heads' Tina Weymouth, Michelle Shocked and rocker Cindy 
Bullens. 
</P>
<P>
The concert is just one of several Orbison memorial projects in the works. 
Barbara Orbison is putting the finishing touches on a book about Roy's life, 
which the singer himself started before his death, and a movie is planned. 
Barbara is also working on a documentary about Roy. But perhaps her favorite is 
the upcoming videocassette release of Roy's lone movie, the corny, 
singing-cowboy flick "The Fastest Guitar Alive." The mere existence of this 
strictly grade-B concept (Orbison totes a hybrid guitar/rifle) helps deflate 
the solemnity inherent in memorials. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara laughed heartily when asked about the movie. "Roy and I watched it two 
years ago. It was really funny watching it with him and our sons. He had a 
great ability to laugh at himself, and we all kidded him about the movie 
unmercifully."

The reputation of Ellis Marsalis, now well established in the jazz community, 
has been acquired, ironically, not through his contributions as a pianist, 
composer and educator, but vicariously through his achievements as a father. He 
is the father of six sons, two of whom, Wynton and Branford, are world-class 
names; two others, Delfeayo and 12-year-old Jason, seem destined for comparable 
musical success. 
</P>
<P>
The reflected glory has earned him personal recognition; he's now playing major 
club dates of his own. Leading a quartet, he opened a six-day run Tuesday at 
Catalina Bar &amp; Grill. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to being in Los Angeles again," said the senior Marsalis 
in a phone call from his New Orleans home. "I used to jam there when I was in 
the Marines, around 1956-58." 
</P>
<P>
For his sons, learning about jazz was no problem, given the countless private 
teachers and public institutions available to students since the 1950s. A 
question arose, though: How did Ellis Marsalis, born when jazz education was in 
its infancy, acquire his own knowledge? 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't hard," he said. "For formal study of European music I went to Xavier 
University Junior School of Music; then I studied at Dillard University, with a 
major in music education. For jazz, there were ample opportunities for those of 
us who were adventurous in spirit. A lady at the Bop Shop on Rampart Street 
would spread the word any time a new Charlie Parker record came in. We also had 
a local radio show around 1948 that played Dizzy, Bird, Charlie Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got to high school age I found out how many great players we had right 
in the city. There was no TV, and nightclubs were the primary source of 
entertainment for the black community. I began playing for strippers, 
comedians, dancers, and after hours we'd meet all the jazz guys at jam 
sessions." 
</P>
<P>
He landed his first paying gig at 13, playing on weekends during high school. 
"Eight bucks a night was a lot of money then. My kids wound up doing the same 
kind of thing, but they were so much wiser and better paid." 
</P>
<P>
At Dillard, Marsalis met saxophonist Harold Batiste, whom he calls a major 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
After his two years in the Marines, Marsalis led his own quartet, worked at the 
New Orleans Playboy Club, and recorded with Cannonball Adderley. Then came 
marriage, the decision to settle down, and two years in the Louisiana backwoods 
as a choral director and high school band leader. Returning to the Playboy Club 
in 1967, he met Al Hirt, who offered him a job. 
</P>
<P>
His music education degree served Marsalis well in 1974 when the New Orleans 
Center for Creative Arts offered him a post on the faculty. He stayed there 
more than a decade before teaching for two years at Virginia Commonwealth 
University in Richmond. Last year, back home, he took a teaching job at the 
University of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Marsalis played four of his own compositions in an LP called "Fathers 
And Sons," along with Wynton and Branford. He is a featured soloist on a new 
album by British saxophonist Courtney Pine, whose group follows Marsalis into 
Catalina's next week. 
</P>
<P>
The children, however, are not unaware of their debt. As Branford Marsalis put 
it the other day: "My dad is a great, charismatic guy. I never studied with him 
but I watched him; he leads by example. I can't really say enough about him. I 
love him to death."

BREA-OLINDA ROLLS DESPITE OFF NIGHT 
</P>

<P>
It certainly wasn't vintage Brea-Olinda High School basketball, what with a 
make-shift lineup used throughout the game and state Division III player of the 
year Aimee McDaniel on the bench for three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
But even off-speed Lady Cat basketball is better than most. It was good enough 
to defeat Foothill, 51-33, in a Southern Section 3-AA girls' quarterfinal game 
Thursday night at Foothill. Brea-Olinda (28-0), which extended its 
school-record victory streak to 50, will play fourth-seeded Alemany (20-6) in 
the semifinals Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda, the division's top-seeded team and the defending champion in the 
3-A and the state, forced Foothill (15-10) into 22 turnovers by getting the 
ball inside to Jinelle Williams and using a full-court pressure defense. 
</P>
<P>
Williams led all scorers with 23 points. She had nine in the first quarter as 
Brea took a 13-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill's game plan was to handle Brea-Olinda's pressure, stop the Lady Cats' 
outside shooters and have a good shooting night itself. Well, one of three 
isn't bad. 
</P>
<P>
With Foothill pressuring the perimeter, point guard McDaniel resting an ankle 
she sprained in practice two days ago and Brea Coach Mark Trakh mixing starters 
and reserves freely, Brea-Olinda got consistent outside shooting from only one 
player -- Tammy Blackburn. Blackburn made six of 11 from the field and finished 
with 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to keep them from scoring on the outside and they scored all 
those baskets on the inside," Foothill Coach Sheila Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill also had difficulty against Brea's press. The Lady Knights turned the 
ball over six times in the second quarter. Brea-Olinda took advantage, 
outscoring Foothill, 20-6, to take a 33-12 lead at the half. Brea-Olinda held 
Foothill scoreless for the first 5 1/4 minutes of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches substituted often in the second half. Adams played all 11 of her 
players. Shannon Ebert was the only Foothill player in double figures with 10 
points on five of eight shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we did a good job," said Adams, who coached Foothill to the 3-A 
championship in 1985. "I was very pleased except for that second quarter where 
we turned the ball over a bunch of times. They made us go faster than what we 
could play." 
</P>
<P>
Trakh did not start regulars Jody Anton and Allison Bickell, saying, "I wanted 
to see how they would do coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"We won the game by 18 points and everybody played. The continuity wasn't there 
because we used so many different players."

Eight Orange County girls' teams remain in the Southern Section basketball 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
All of the semifinal games will be played Saturday night at neutral sites, so 
there are no home-court advantages. 
</P>
<P>
However, winners of Thursday's coin flips were designated as the "home team." 
Being designated the home team gives schools the advantage of playing at a 
gymnasium near their school. 
</P>
<P>
Only two county teams -- Ocean View and La Quinta -- lost coin tosses. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the pairings for each division involving county teams. All of the 
games, except in the 2-AA division, begin at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
5-A Division -- Fourth-seeded Ocean View (26-2) makes its first appearance in 
the semifinals. The Seahawks, who have set a school record for victories in a 
season, travel to Ventura High for their game against top-seeded Buena (25-0). 
</P>
<P>
4-AA Division -- Unseeded Loara (16-10) is the designated home team against 
unseeded Ventura (18-9) at Savanna High. 
</P>
<P>
4-A Division -- Third-seeded La Quinta (25-3), led by Amy Jalewalia, last 
season's state scoring leader, takes on second-seeded Palm Desert (25-2) at 
College of the Desert near Palm Springs. The Aztecs make their first appearance 
in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
3-AA Division -- Unseeded Estancia (14-12) is the home team against 
second-seeded Palos Verdes (26-4) at University High. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda, which beat Foothill Thursday night, plays fourth-seeded Alemany 
(20-6). The home team will be determined by a coin flip today. 
</P>
<P>
3-A Division -- Making its first appearance in the semifinals, top-seeded 
Rancho Alamitos (20-3) plays host to San Dimas (16-6) at Bolsa Grande High. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Costa Mesa (15-11), led by standout freshman Olivia DiCamilli, plays 
host to second-seeded South Hills (19-5) at Estancia High. 
</P>
<P>
2-AA Division -- Fourth-seeded Santa Margarita (20-6) is the home team against 
unseeded Beaumont (18-6). The game will start at 7 p.m. at Saddleback College.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP;

IRVINE LOSES EIGHT-RUN LEAD, THEN WINS IN 11TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine lost an eight-run lead in the ninth inning but came back to win, 
13-12, in 11 innings Thursday in a nonconference baseball game against Cal Poly 
Pomona at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters scored 10 runs in the first inning and led, 12-4, to start the 
ninth. But the first 10 Pomona batters reached safely and the Broncos tied the 
score, 12-12, and had two runners on with nobody out. Pomona had the bases 
loaded with one out when Irvine second baseman Jon Damusch caught a line drive 
to start an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11th, Billy Bardens had a two-out single to score Shelby Niss with the 
winning run. Niss started the inning with a single, was sacrificed to second by 
Joe Sewell and went to third on a groundout. 
</P>
<P>
Al Rodriguez and Craig Plumley had three hits and three RBIs each and Fred 
Combs had two hits and three RBIs for Irvine. Plumley had a three-run double in 
the first for Irvine (7-6). Pomona is 3-12. 
</P>
<P>
In other nonconference games: 
</P>
<P>
Southern California College 5, Western New Mexico 1 (11 innings) -- Brett 
Howard hit a grand slam with nobody out in the 11th for host SCC (5-3-1). 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards took a 1-0 lead on a home run by Alex Andrade in the fifth, but 
starter Larry Jacinot allowed a one-out home run in the ninth that tied the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11th, Joe Aversa walked and took second on a throwing error. Sean Maharg 
walked and Doug Rystrom's bloop single loaded the bases. Aversa (2-0) pitched 
the final 2 1/3 innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Christ College Irvine 3, Redlands 1 -- Lou Simon had an RBI double in the sixth 
and Rodney Nelson had a two-run single in the seventh to give Irvine a 3-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
In nonconference softball: 
</P>
<P>
Southern California College 8-5, Occidental 0-0 -- Stephanie Wills tripled 
twice, scored a run and had four RBIs and Torrey Serapion pitched a 
three-hitter, striking out four and not allowing a walk, to lead SCC (4-4) in 
the first game. Nancy Sala (2-3) got the victory, allowing three hits in the 
second game. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman 2-6, Cal State San Bernardino 0-3 -- Jackie Blake (2-0) allowed two 
hits and had 11 strikeouts and Laura Papadas and Rose Conner had RBI singles in 
the sixth for Chapman in the first game at San Bernardino. Shelly Mahon had a 
two-run double in the sixth in the second game for Chapman.

San Diego State 67, UC Irvine 54 -- Julie Evans scored a game-high 30 points on 
11-of-17 shooting from the field to lead visiting San Diego State (5-21, 4-11). 
Yvonne Catals had 16 points and Jenny Lee added 12 for Irvine (1-25, 0-16).

Las Brisas in Laguna Beach recently resumed serving breakfast Mondays through 
Saturdays from 8 to 11. It's buffet style, with an omelet station, eggs 
Benedict, Mexican-style eggs, fresh fruits and muffins, for $6.95. 
</P>
<P>
Owners Tony and Janina Musci have changed the name of Adriano's in Santa Ana to 
Armonia (Italian for peace and happiness). The Muscis say they wanted to avoid 
a battle over the use of the name with Lancia Inc., which has a restaurant 
called Adriano's in Los Angeles. But, they promise, nothing else about their 
restaurant has changed. 
</P>
<P>
It's Mardi Gras at Remick's in Irvine Tuesday, beginning at 5 p.m. with a 
complimentary buffet of Cajun and Creole specialties. There'll also be a cold 
seafood bar and wine-tasting; a Dixieland band will play, and souvenir photos 
will be snapped. Information: (714) 553-1305. 
</P>
<P>
Sapori in Newport Beach has a new lunch menu, designed to try to move you in 
and out quickly. It includes pizzas, vitello tonnato for $6.75 and seafood 
salad. Reservations: (714) 644-4220. 
</P>
<P>
Il Ristorante Bagata in Newport Beach has started offering a pre-theatre menu 
between 6 and 7 p.m.: Italian mixed salad, fresh pasta and choice of entree for 
$25 per person. Reservations: (714) 675-4020. 
</P>
<P>
Le Meridien in Newport Beach is packaging an evening's entertainment on March 
10. For prices starting at $259, you'll get dinner for two, two tickets to the 
ballet "Romeo and Juliet" at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, two 
after-the-theatre cordials and overnight accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
GOINGS AND COMINGS: Just Like Perry's in Mission Viejo has closed. . . . Paul 
and Judy Astbury have opened Gibson's Food Emporium in Irvine at the former 
site of Irvine Ranch Farmers Market, in the Walnut Village Center at Culver 
Drive and Walnut. There's a salad bar with 40 selections and 10 house-recipe 
dressings; a deli case, and hot dishes.

Emperor's Fortune is the kind of Chinese restaurant where every table is set 
with linen, silver, china, crystal . . . and a delicate orchid. There's 
expensively mounted Oriental art and a gold-streaked, pink marble floor. 
Waiters wear smart tuxedoes and serve dishes solemnly, from long, sleek 
trolleys. The maitre'd's name is Klaus. 
</P>
<P>
What comes out of the kitchen is equally mannered. Chef Kin Sheck prepares 
edible works of art that please the eye as much as the palate. Dishes are 
carefully plated, elaborately garnished. Beautifully lacquered Peking duck, 
presented whole to the table, glimmers like an edible jewel. Tiny, steamed 
loaves of corn and whole-wheat breads are served piping hot from little bamboo 
baskets. It's all designed with the goal of transporting the elegance of a 
first-class Hong Kong dining room to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But there is trouble in paradise: Business is slack; initial notices have been 
mixed. This surely puzzles management because everyone is clearly trying so 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
One problem may be the restaurant's upscale prices. This is haute Chinese in 
its latest incarnation, and it's going to take a little getting used to. 
Another explanation may be that the kitchen tends to play it safe too often. 
This is a menu limited to foodstuffs that Western diners are comfortably 
familiar with: beef, chicken, duck, lobster, even the un-Chinese salmon. Squid, 
offal and cold meat dishes may not appeal to mass tastes, but they do appeal to 
just the sort of people who patronize these restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
I enjoyed everything I ate at Emperor's Fortune, but much of the food seemed 
slightly bland. There were few of the exaggerated flavors for which Chinese 
cooking is famous. The owner, China-born restaurateur Bill Liu, responds to his 
critics by saying that they don't understand Chinese food. But in a restaurant 
where chop sticks are brought only on request, that reply seems a trifle 
gratuitous. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are good things to be had. The Emperor's chicken appetizer is a 
real delight. It's minced chicken, Chinese mushrooms, pine nuts and Sichuan 
mustard eaten from a lettuce leaf, Chinese New Year's-style. Scallops with 
squash (little, carved zucchini) are stir-fried in a light oyster sauce -- I 
haven't had a better version in a long time. And I certainly wouldn't miss that 
Peking duck; it's the restaurant's best dish. 
</P>
<P>
There's amazingly crispy skin on one half of a large serving platter, waiting 
to be eaten in crepes smeared with plum sauce and stuffed with scallions. The 
other side of the platter contains the boned shreds from the choicest pieces. 
It has been mixed with red and green pepper, onions and a delicate sauce. 
</P>
<P>
I was surprised by how much I liked the New Zealand mussel appetizer; the 
mussels glistened with a spicy-sweet garlic sauce that gave them the look of 
candied fruits. 
</P>
<P>
But you can get too much of a good thing: When I bit into the Sichuan lobster, 
I was disappointed to find a nearly identical sauce. Nanking pork loin 
(stir-fried pork medallions) and the Hong Kong filet mignon also shared similar 
sauces -- this one tasting of Worcestershire, garlic and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Every attempt has been made to put together a serious wine list. There are even 
first-growth Bordeaux. But the people who can afford the likes of Chateau 
Lafite-Rothschild generally prefer to see the vintages listed -- a little 
detail the management has overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
At lunch, prices are considerably more down to earth. There is a pleasant patio 
and several untraditional dishes are perfect for a light lunch. A salad with 
avocado, greens and a ginger-balsamic dressing is terrific. So is the house 
chicken salad served on romaine with jicama, rice noodles and cashews. 
</P>
<P>
I also highly recommend a dish with the silly name of Shrimp Go Nuts. It's a 
stir-fry with walnuts, cashews, macadamia nuts, asparagus spears and sauteed 
shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts have been given careful consideration -- they come from Grand Finale, 
one of the county's most respected dessert makers. The fresh plum tart, for 
instance, is a wonder. But is it Chinese? You decide. 
</P>
<P>
Emperor's Fortune is moderately expensive. Lunch items are $5 to $12. A 
three-course, pre-theater menu is served from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. for $23. At 
dinner, appetizers are $5 to $7, entrees are $16 to $28.

ANN CONWAY: SPORTS CLUB PLANS HOOP-LA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
And you thought you'd died and gone to Laker heaven when they came to the 
ground breaking. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar choppered south in helicopters last year 
to hobnob in a tent and sink their shoes in cement. And you stood next to them, 
stunned. You never thought they'd come to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Well, think again. They're not only coming back on March 31, they're bringing 
Lakers Coach Pat Riley with them to attend the newly opened Sports 
Club/Irvine's "Superstar Sports Spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a boogie," promises the bold and beautiful Nanette Pattee 
Francini, partner with billionaire Marvin Davis and Michael Talla in the 
$30-million club, a sister complex to Sports Club/LA. 
</P>
<P>
We believe it. Helping to orchestrate the "slinky/black-tie optional" affair 
for 2,000 guests is PR wizard Gloria Zigner, the gal who gave you your first 
gala laser show when she opened Le Meridien in Newport Beach, your first taste 
of gourmet rattlesnake when she opened Embassy Suites in Santa Ana, and your 
first glimpse of a woman diving onto a mattress in a hotel atrium when she 
opened the Newport Beach Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Zigner and Francini got together at the Irvine club -- 
"actually, an urban resort," Francini says with a laugh -- to munch on 
thin-crust duck-sausage pizza and gab about the $150,000 gala opening. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hot and sexy," says Francini, a former Miss Aspen and a 
member of the international ski set (who met Donald Trump in Colorado last 
December when the flurry of rumors about his alleged liaison with Marla Maples 
was getting started. "He was utterly charming," she says.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're turning the main gym into a disco where the band Billy and the Beaters 
will play. And we'll have a Brazilian band and rappers and break dancing in 
other parts of the club," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention enough carbohydrates to pump iron for days. "There'll be our 
gourmet pizza," says Francini, sinking her perfect teeth into a wedge of the 
scrumptious stuff. "And pasta. And Brazilian food. And sushi. And dim sum." 
(And yes, there'll be alcohol. The 130,000-square-foot club not only has its 
own restaurant, but it also has its own bar, hair salon and clothing boutique.) 
</P>
<P>
The "Sports Spectacular" concept is nothing new for Francini, who says she'll 
probably don her slinky "Dorothy Lamour sarong" for the affair. "We've done it 
in L.A. for three years," she says. "We use it to honor sports greats -- give 
them our Superstar Sports Award." Past recipients have been Raiders' star 
Marcus Allen, and Lakers heroes Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar. Riley will receive 
this year's award at the $75-per-person event, with half the proceeds 
benefiting DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) and Athletes and Entertainers 
for Kids. 
</P>
<P>
Who gets to go? "Members and their guests only," says Francini, adding that 
Sports Club/Irvine already has 3,600 members. "We know we can handle 2,000 
guests. And we'll invite some of our L.A. club members," she says. (Among those 
on its roster: Tom Selleck, Dyan Cannon, Molly Ringwald and last summer, John 
F. Kennedy Jr.) "But only by word of mouth. The party is going to be hot. But 
we don't want to get it too hot!" 
</P>
<P>
Shocked about the Trumps: Lois Cannon Aldrin can't believe it. "Donald and 
Ivana looked so happy, marvelous, stunning!" Aldrin and her husband, former 
astronaut Buzz Aldrin, attended the International Ski Ball chaired by Ivana 
Trump at the Plaza Hotel in New York last November. 
</P>
<P>
The Aldrins spent about 15 minutes with the Trumps, even had their picture 
taken with them. "They looked happy," Lois says. 
</P>
<P>
So when word reached her that the couple were apart, her heart sank. "I was 
shocked," she says. "Usually it's the frumpy wife who gets dumped. Ivana has 
kept herself so beautiful. When we met them, I thought to myself: 'Well, they 
are gorgeous, rich, and a team.' I figure if a couple looks like they're a 
team, it's working. If they had any underlying problems, they weren't apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"When they came into the cocktail party, Donald had his arm around her waist," 
Lois says. "And there she was, in charge of the party, and Donald had come to 
support her. They looked lovely." 
</P>
<P>
Lois has taken sides, she says. "I have to say I'm on Ivana's side. With my 
religious background, I think it's important to have one marriage with 
children. It was not my choice to break up my former marriage. I feel family is 
so important." 
</P>
<P>
The Aldrins, regulars on the international society circuit, have just returned 
from St. Moritz, where they did a cameo appearance for Roger Moore's new movie, 
"Fire, Ice and Dynamite." 
</P>
<P>
As she travels around the world with her famous husband, does Lois worry about 
other women? "Not so much now that we're married," says the platinum blonde, 
who married her famous husband on Valentine's Day two years ago. When we first 
started dating, I noticed how some women would get very aggressive with Buzz, 
want to stand close to him when they talked to him, make eye contact. But now 
that we're married, I don't notice it so much. But of course I noticed that 
women tend to want to talk to him, not me. They try to impress him for their 
egos. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a quote once that says it all: 'When a woman marries, she fulfills her 
fantasy, to have one man to love her. When a man marries, he loses his fantasy, 
which is to have many women.' When you're famous," she says, "a man has more 
opportunity to come in contact and achieve that fantasy, more than the Joe Blow 
on the street who wants them but can't get the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I say to Donald: 'You've got a great thing going there. Why don't you put your 
new excitement and energy into your marriage? You're just going to get tired of 
somebody else.' "

SINGLE LIFE: THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY FINALLY RETURNS, BUT LOOK WHO'S WRIGGLING ON 
HOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN CUMMINGS, Evan Cummings is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do you ever think about the one who got away? Ever wonder how you would react 
if he or she reappeared and asked you out again? Ever fantasize about how 
events might be different the second time around? 
</P>
<P>
The one who got away from me seven years ago was named Don. 
</P>
<P>
Our relationship had been short-lived but intense. Together, we stalked the 
steamy jungles of unbridled passion and dove into the sizzling depths of wild 
abandon. 
</P>
<P>
Charisma? Mel Gibson looked about as appealing as "Weird Al" Yankovic compared 
to Don. He had the grace of Mikhail Baryshnikov, the humor of Woody Allen, the 
intelligence of John Lilly. He was the only man who ever got under my skin. 
</P>
<P>
When Don unceremoniously dumped me, I envisioned that faraway day to come when 
he would call again. Deep in my heart there burned a tiny flickering flame that 
had never been extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
And then, when I had almost forgotten him, the phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
I had always imagined that when he did call, my voice would be soft and 
alluring, radiating confidence; nothing but deft and witty banter coming from 
me. All the right words would fall trippingly off my tongue -- no "you knows" 
or "ummms" that often sabotage a display of self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
In my fantasy, he begged for the pleasure of my company, and I, of course, 
turned him down flat. Hanging up, I laughed like Joan Crawford in a 1940s 
melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
But when he did call, I turned into a gob of goo. 
</P>
<P>
He asked me out for the following Saturday evening, suggesting that we dine at 
this week's "in" spot in Newport Beach. I accepted. This would be my night to 
shine. Part of me wanted to knock him dead. Another part -- no doubt my evil 
twin -- wished him dead. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing days, I fantasized the entire evening in exhausting detail. He 
would appear at my front door, unable to speak, so transfixed by my beauty. I, 
on the other hand, would comment on how much he had changed: "Oh, poor baby, 
you've lost all your hair; but I do like the way you torture those few strands 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
I was going to devastate him and then dump him. I sifted through my wardrobe 
looking for an outfit that made the perfect statement. My Nolan Miller cocktail 
suit would do nicely. Its matching beaded silk camisole was subtle; the 
ensemble elegant, yet sexy. 
</P>
<P>
When Saturday arrived, I went through my exercise routine, then headed for the 
beauty salon where I treated myself to "the works" from a new hair style to a 
massage. I probably would have had plastic surgery if I could have fit in it. 
</P>
<P>
A stop at a local wine shop yielded a lovely Chateau Margaux, goose liver pate, 
cheese and water biscuits to serve while we chatted. I spied a stunning crystal 
wine caddy. My silver-plated ice bucket was declasse by comparison; however, 
this extravagant purchase mandated a swift but sure rationale: It would be nice 
to have when entertaining special guests. "Wrap it up," I announced. Palms 
sweating and fingers trembling, I handed over my credit card. 
</P>
<P>
Then it hit me. 
</P>
<P>
In my zeal to upend he who had "done me wrong," I had been seized by a 
compelling, primordial urge to join a club unworthy of my membership. I began 
running a mental tab; I felt like one of those cartoons -- dollar signs 
spinning on my eyeballs, cash registers ringing. Aside from the crystal caddy, 
I had purchased expensive earrings, Ferragamo pumps and a handbag. 
</P>
<P>
All this for a transitory kick, an ego boost. 
</P>
<P>
That old bugaboo, false pride, was entering at warp speed. 
</P>
<P>
Who would have the last laugh now -- me, him or Mastercard? 
</P>
<P>
The next few hours passed in slow motion. The clock was ticking like the 
metronome on "Jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
He was due at eight-ish, I was fully dressed by 7:09. I fluffed pillows and 
dusted for the 18th time. I garnished the hors d'oeuvres platter with baby 
gardenias. Then, I put Beethoven on the CD player and attempted to settle my 
nerves with a crossword puzzle. Name a seven-letter word meaning "foolhardy." 
Tossing the puzzle aside, I went to the kitchen and bid Chateau Margaux a fond 
hello. A few sips later, the doorbell rang. The moment of truth had arrived. No 
turning back now. 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't you know it? There he was, handsome as ever, flashing that 
million-dollar smile. He stared. I stared. Why did he have to look so good? 
</P>
<P>
I offered him a glass of wine, but he asked for a beer. As I fetched him a 
Heineken, he unconsciously grabbed the TV remote control and clicked on a 
hockey game. "Just want to check the score, OK?" I quietly excused myself while 
I went back to the bar, retrieved the wine bottle from the crystal holder, 
dried off the caddy and placed it in the box from whence it came. "Thank you, 
God -- I owe you one," I whispered. 
</P>
<P>
At dinner we talked not of the past, but of the here and now. His here and now. 
</P>
<P>
He had recently ended a relationship. Why? "Oh, I don't know. She started to 
get on my nerves after a couple of months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He had always liked bright women, but any attempts at "meaningful conversation" 
fell upon deaf ears. I broached the subject of apartheid and later the American 
Trader oil spill. He responded with "Wow, it's really something, huh?" to both 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
Huh, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Wizard had transmogrified into Mr. Magoo. 
</P>
<P>
"Say, I really love your hair like that. You look great, babe." (For the 
record: You can cheat me, you can lie to me -- you can even slander my name -- 
just don't call me "babe.") 
</P>
<P>
Mercifully, it was getting late. As we finished our espresso he reached for my 
knee and winked. "So. Shall I call you in the morning for breakfast or shall I 
just nudge you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Write me," I replied.

POLL REFEREES: Rep. Robert K. Dornan, a veteran monitor of seven foreign 
elections, says independent observers can make or break public confidence in 
election results. . . . In Panama and in the Philippines, U.S. observers' 
reports of widespread fraud led to governments' being overturned, he noted. Now 
awaiting permission to enter Nicaragua for Sunday's elections, Dornan says:

DIANNE KLEIN: COUNTY DITTY IS CORNY -- BUT DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY

Go figure it. For some reason, Orange County has not been much of an 
inspiration for songwriters. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, if Randy ("I Love L.A.") Newman can boast about that place, what's to 
stop, say, Fine Young Cannibals from setting Orange County to vibes? 
</P>
<P>
Or if the Cans are just a tad busy these days, how about James Brown? I hear he 
could use the work. 
</P>
<P>
I really think that a snappy tune about Orange County could go a long way 
toward improving our collective psyche. 
</P>
<P>
Just think about all the local gloom and doom lately: the oil spill, malathion 
wars, traffic woes, smog, high prices, Rep. Chris Cox being shut out of 
Lithuania. . . . I could go on and on. 
</P>
<P>
If you ask me, what we need is a pick-me-upper, something along the lines of 
Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy." Granted, Not Worrying did get a 
little old fast -- think of those stupid yellow happy faces of a few years back 
and you'll recognize the phenomenon -- but while McFerrin was hot, you saw a 
lot of goofy grins on everyone's face, didn't you? 
</P>
<P>
Still, no sense fretting about whether some temperamental artiste will deign to 
leave his heart in Orange County. I understand there are other considerations. 
Even "New York New York" was no chart topper, after all. 
</P>
<P>
And these days, when you can practically guarantee yourself a platinum record 
with some bass-heavy ditty about cheatin' hearts in sleazy times, well . . . it 
doesn't look good for a disco mix about Orange County either. 
</P>
<P>
I think there's hope, however. I say this because I called Dr. Demento for some 
guidance. I figured that maybe somebody had already set Orange County to song 
and if anybody would know what's out there, Dr. D would. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor is an expert in the field of municipal musicology. He's got a radio 
show on KLSX every Sunday night where, as you are surely aware, he catapulted 
"Pico and Sepulveda" -- the lyrics consist entirely of Los Angeles street names 
with "La Brea Tar Pits" as the hook -- into a cult classic. 
</P>
<P>
Turns out that just the other week, the doc did one of his dueling cities gigs. 
I missed the show, however, so Demento dug out what I was interested in and 
played it over the phone. He says he found it in a thrift shop about 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This seems to be the one for Orange County," he says. "I think you'll find it 
a bit camp." 
</P>
<P>
It's a 45 called "Orange County" -- with the heretofore unheralded "Mulholland 
Drive" on the flip side -- which was produced by Spartan Records in 1964. It 
was written by Keith Harman and Charles Murchison -- your guess is as good as 
mine -- and sung by a nameless chorus of male and female vocalists. 
</P>
<P>
As for the melody, I suggest you invent your own. The one Harman and Murchison 
thought up could use some work. 
</P>
<P>
The women go first: 
</P>
<P>
 The golden West where easy living's best, California is best in lovely Orange 
County. Knott's Berry Farm is there. Ghost Town will let you share a mining 
town's history.... 
</P>
<P>
 It's majesty, breathtaking as can be, where orange trees grow for you to 
consume every blossom's perfume. A dream come true, a blend of old and new, 
where folks will welcome you to a lovely, friendly Orange County.... 
</P>
<P>
 Then the men: 
</P>
<P>
 Couples are hand in hand walking through Disneyland, the happiest place on 
earth, the place to be where work and play agree and mountains touch the sea in 
friendly Orange County.... 
</P>
<P>
 Then the chorus: 
</P>
<P>
 It's majesty, breathtaking as can be.... 
</P>
<P>
 Then the men: 
</P>
<P>
Orange County spending the afternoon, swimming at Newport dunes. It's only a 
part of lovely Orange County.... 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, th chorus again and that's it. 
</P>
<P>
All right, so "Orange County" is a little out of date. A little freshening here 
and there wouldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
But it is upbeat and beggars can't be choosers. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, all together now: 
</P>
<P>
It's majesty, breathtaking as can be.... 
</P>
<P>
 I bet you feel better already.

CLEANUP: NEARLY ALL OF THE OIL SPILL'S FEATHERED VICTIMS HAVE EITHER DIED OR

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a shapeless creature wrapped tightly in a flowered bedsheet was lifted out 
of a pickup truck Thursday morning, rescue workers were waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of its arrival at the Huntington State Beach lifeguard station, 
the protective wrappings were cut away and a California brown pelican emerged, 
bedraggled and terrified, its dark feathers matted with oil. 
</P>
<P>
As the pelican strained to move its heavy wings, bird expert Marge Gibson held 
it immobile but spoke to it softly, soothingly. 
</P>
<P>
"Had a bad morning, hey guy," she said as she settled the pelican's black 
webbed feet atop a white-covered worktable and matter of factly set about 
caring for it. 
</P>
<P>
For the oiled pelican, discovered about an hour earlier near the Newport Beach 
Pier, there were more indignities to come. Gibson, director of the station, 
took its temperature rectally with a baby thermometer, then gently forced a 
long red tube filled with nutrients into its beak. 
</P>
<P>
That done, she and volunteer Betty Pridy lifted the pelican into a towel-lined 
cardboard box and placed it beside a portable heater. It was only "moderately 
oiled" Gibson said; it should survive. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two weeks -- ever since a Feb. 7 tanker spill off Huntington 
Beach created an environmental disaster for Orange County's shore life -- a 
back room at the main state lifeguard station here has served as a field 
hospital for oil-covered birds -- among them Western grebes, surf scoters, 
Pacific loons and pelicans, an endangered species. Its mission has been to 
stabilize the birds, then send them on to a major bird rehabilitation center at 
Terminal Island, there to be washed of the oil and prepared for release. 
</P>
<P>
The station's medical supplies were simple -- latex gloves and cotton jumpsuits 
for the workers, lots of Pedialyte, Murine and cotton swabs (for cleaning avian 
eyes irritated by crude oil), and donated towels, bedsheets and cardboard boxes 
to keep the feathered patients warm. 
</P>
<P>
But this bird recovery station -- which at its peak had the frenetic pace of an 
army MASH unit -- was closing Thursday. By now, nearly all the birds oiled in 
the spill are thought to be either captured or dead, state wildlife biologists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 12, the station's busiest day, the Huntington Beach facility handled 
151 birds, and Gibson and her 15-year-old daughter worked at least 16 hours 
straight. In the first week of the spill they were joined by at least 15 
volunteers including Pat Shea, a garden club officer from Fountain Valley who 
took it upon herself to make chili and sandwiches for up to 40 workers a day. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast Thursday, activity was clearly winding down. Gibson cared for just 
five birds -- one limp and very ill Pacific loon, suspected of having ingested 
oil, and four oil-coated pelicans. 
</P>
<P>
For Gibson, much of the recovery effort was a success story. Of 452 birds 
brought alive to the lifeguard station and medically "stabilized" there, only 
three died there. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not far from her worktable were two large commercial food freezers 
marked with bright yellow labels that said "EVIDENCE." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, stashed in plastic bags and frozen hard as a rock, were the bodies of 
more than 100 birds -- pelicans, surf scoters, grebes, cormorants that died of 
hypothermia when oil robbed their feathers of their insulating power, or that 
ingested the poisonous stuff. Their bodies are to undergo necropsies and kept 
indefinitely by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as evidence against the 
firms involved in the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, director of the Birds of Prey Center in Villa Park, has seen the 
evidence of oil spills before. She helped rescue bald eagles oiled last year in 
the much larger spill that occurred when the tanker Exxon Valdez went aground 
off Valdez, Alaska. For that spill she was temporarily employed by 
International Bird Rescue, a Berkeley firm hired to clean the birds. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that working on badly oiled birds can be terribly upsetting. 
"I think any time you see any animal that's obviously distressed, and there's a 
question as to how he's going to survive, you do your best," she said. "But 
sometimes you feel terrible. Because it is a man-involved accident. They did 
not do anything. They were just swimming." 
</P>
<P>
For all that, Gibson said she was not angry at British Petroleum, whose oil it 
was that spilled. Rather, she is concerned that "people are going to forget 
this once the beaches are clean." 
</P>
<P>
After all, she said, "British Petroleum didn't mean for (the oil spill) to 
occur. But we're all responsible because we all use oil."

CREWS PREPARE FOR FINAL PUSH TO REMOVE OIL

HUNTINGTON BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the tanker American Trader steamed into San Francisco Bay for repairs, 
cleanup crews marshaled their forces Thursday for a final effort that could 
take weeks to remove the remnants of a 394,000-gallon oil spill that fouled 
miles of Orange County coast. 
</P>
<P>
Although it will be a while before the last oily residues are picked up, 
cleanup officials say, stretches of once-blackened shoreline between Newport 
Beach and Huntington Beach might be reopened to the public within several days. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's gone very well so far, but there is still more work to do," said 
U.S. Coast Guard Capt. James C. Card, who is supervising the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the American Trader -- with a concrete patch over two holes in its 
hull -- sailed under Coast Guard escort into San Francisco Bay, where it docked 
about 3:30 p.m. at Southwest Marine Inc., a shipyard at Pier 70. 
</P>
<P>
The 811-foot ship received a 3-foot by 
</P>
<P>
5-foot gouge in the bottom of a forward oil storage compartment when it struck 
one of its 12.5-foot-long anchors during routine mooring operations on Feb. 7 
off Huntington Beach. A second, smaller hole was opened but no additional oil 
leaked. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard helicopters flew over the tanker as it approached the Golden Gate 
Bridge, then a 41-foot cutter picked up the escort and enforced a strict safety 
zone around the ship. Two Coast Guard officials boarded the tanker for the 
final few miles of its voyage from the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In the days ahead, a 15-foot square piece of hull -- weighing 8,000 pounds -- 
will be removed and preserved so Coast Guard investigators and others can 
inspect the damage to the inch-thick steel plating. Repairs are expected to 
take about a week. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators suspect that the tanker punctured its hull by rolling atop its 
port anchor while attempting to moor at an underwater oil terminal owned by 
Golden West Refining Co. of Santa Fe Springs. The accuracy of navigational 
charts has come into question, and authorities are conducting tests to 
determine if the waters around the mooring are shallower than indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Orange County, about 35 Coast Guard officers, government officials and 
representatives of British Petroleum, which owned the spilled oil, met at 
Huntington Beach City Hall on Thursday morning to discuss final cleanup 
operations and a timetable for reopening beaches. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation, workers tested sand-cleaning equipment, cleared debris with 
rakes and shovels and cordoned off stretches of beach with yellow tape to 
identify areas where oil had accumulated under the sand to depths of up to a 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
Of concern to cleanup managers and government officials is the discovery of 
pockets of buried oil along at least six miles of beach from the Huntington 
Beach Municipal Pier south to 18th Street in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimate that 500 to 1,000 gallons of oil residue and crust might 
have been driven under the sand by last week's heavy rain and pounding surf. 
Most of it will have to be removed or sifted from the sand with rakes, shovels, 
drag lines or other mechanical devices. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole process of the cleanup's second phase will try to find out where all 
of this is," said Charles Webster, a crisis manager for British Petroleum. 
"When we are done, we would like to say with a high level of confidence that we 
have addressed it and successfully dealt with it." 
</P>
<P>
Between Newland Avenue and the Huntington Beach Municipal Pier, workers made 
test runs Thursday morning with two beach-cleaning vehicles that British 
Petroleum hopes to get approved by the state for use in the spill area. 
</P>
<P>
One is a tractor-drawn device that scoops up sand, runs it through a filter and 
deposits it back on the beach. The other is a disc device that can be used to 
overturn the sand and expose oil so it can be broken down by sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, more than 350 workers, including 100 members of the California 
Conservation Corps, took to a 14-mile stretch of beach for a variety of mop-up 
procedures. Some crews equipped with low-pressure water hoses scoured patches 
of oil that were stuck to jetties in Newport Beach and rocky bluffs at Bolsa 
Chica. 
</P>
<P>
Others scooped oil-stained sand from the beach into plastic trash bags. Debris, 
including trash and branches, also was removed from the Santa Ana River mouth 
on the Newport Beach-Huntington Beach border. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just raking up sticks and stuff, so we can come back over and get the 
oil down in the sand," said Les Wilkins, 37, a cleanup worker from Anaheim. 
"It's keeping us busy." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most difficult and tedious tasks remained for 64 workers assigned to 
the jetties at the Santa Ana River mouth, where quarter-inch-thick black crude 
coated the rocks. Workers in yellow slickers dabbed at the oil with absorbent 
cloths, while others sprayed it with warm water. The process is expected to 
take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
To keep oil sheens from entering the nearby wetlands during the cleanup, crews 
were planning to restore the sand dike across the Santa Ana River mouth, which 
was washed out last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like a beach, where you have just one surface," explained Rick 
Humphrey, an area supervisor for British Petroleum. "You have to reach behind 
everything, you have to deal with the tide. Its real time-consuming." 
</P>
<P>
So far, beaches have been reopened from 15th Street in Newport Beach to Newport 
Harbor and areas south of the harbor mouth, including stretches of Corona del 
Mar such as Pelican Point, Crescent Cove and Treasure Cove. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have placed high priorities on reopening Bolsa Chica State Beach and 
certain stretches from the Huntington Beach pier to Newland Avenue in 
Huntington Beach. They hope to open those sections within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
Remaining areas along the 14-mile stretch between the Newport Beach Pier and 
rocky bluffs near Bolsa Chica -- some of the hardest to clean -- will be some 
of the last reopened. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to reopen some beaches in Huntington Beach will hinge upon tests 
by the city to determine the extent of pollution. Those results will be 
forwarded to county health authorities, who will decide whether the beaches are 
clean enough for public use. 
</P>
<P>
With cleanup operations winding down, federal health and safety officials said 
Thursday that, considering the size of the work force mobilized to clean up the 
spill, the number of worker injuries has been "minimal."

FAMILY-CARE PLAN NEARS COMPLETION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city is in the final stages of planning what will be Anaheim's first 
publicly financed facilities to care for children and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 family-care specialists, community representatives and city officials 
have been working on the project since the Family Care Consortium started in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
The completed plan will be released in April. 
</P>
<P>
The centers will probably include centers for infants and school-age children. 
Before- and after-school care is a priority in the city since the Anaheim City 
School District is starting a year-round schedule in June. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, tentative plans call for increased parental education and training 
programs for family day-care providers who care for children at home. The city 
may set up a telephone hotline to distribute this information. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Hogrefe, child-care coordinator for the city, said the consortium has 
developed a rough draft of the family-care proposal. A cost estimate will be 
issued after consortium members hold their final meeting next month.

ENROLLMENT DOUBLES AT NEW CSUF BRANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Enrollment has doubled at a Cal State Fullerton satellite campus in South 
County, leading university administrators to declare the new facility a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
The campus opened last fall with 384 students, and officials say that spring 
semester enrollment will be between 700 and 800 students. 
</P>
<P>
"There is such a demand for classes and programs in South County, we had 
projected doubling enrollment (for the spring) and it will probably double 
again in the fall," said George Giacumakis, director of the Mission Viejo 
campus. "I'd say this proves the trend toward greater demands for higher 
education in South Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
After nearly 10 years of planning, the university opened a branch campus on the 
grounds of Saddleback College. Last year, more than 4,000 Cal State Fullerton 
students commuted from the South County area, Giacumakis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had so many other students say that if they didn't have to drive 30 to 
35 miles to Fullerton, they would take classes with us," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Students enrolled at the Mission Viejo campus take advanced courses in 
business, communications, computer science, mathematics and social science. 
</P>
<P>
The jump in enrollment frees the university to proceed with plans to expand the 
satellite campus, Giacumakis said. University officials will now consider 
building a 75,000-square-foot building on the Saddleback campus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, university officials hope to enroll up to 4,000 students at the 
branch campus. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the extension campus will be renovating another structure now 
being used by Saddleback. The building should be ready for the spring semester 
in 1991, Giacumakis said. FRANK MESSINA

SHERIFF FILES PETITION IN BID FOR 5TH TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates submitted more than 2,700 signatures to the 
county registrar of voters office Thursday to qualify his bid for a fifth term 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
Gates submitted the signatures in lieu of a $1,015 filing fee because he said 
it demonstrates his "broad-based, grass-roots support." 
</P>
<P>
"I am proud to serve the citizens of Orange County as the sheriff-coroner," 
Gates said. "I have decided to seek reelection because there are still many 
challenges facing Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the opportunity to continue our war on drugs, which has mobilized our 
entire community to significantly decrease the demand for drugs," he said. 
"Jail overcrowding is another critical issue that needs to be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
No one has yet filed nomination papers to run against Gates, who has served 15 
years as Orange County's sheriff-coroner. The filing deadline for the election 
is March 9.

MEDICAL CENTER AT UCI URGED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANICA KIRKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A special committee is set to propose construction of an on-campus medical 
facility at UC Irvine, the latest salvo in a longstanding debate over the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee who studied the issue at the request of the Academic 
Senate said the facility is essential to the future of the College of Medicine, 
according to Edward Arquilla, a professor of pathology and chairman of the 
committee that developed the one-page proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that unless we have something on this campus, this medical school is 
going to be strapped as far as academic growth," Arquilla said, noting that 
professors are angry about the inconvenience involved in commuting between the 
campus in Irvine and the UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting worse," Arquilla said of the traffic. "It used to take me 15 to 
20 minutes (to get to the medical center). Now it's 45 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
The Academic Senate's Executive Committee has already unanimously endorsed the 
special committee's report, and an assembly of the medical school approved it 
Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which includes few details, is expected to be considered by the 
voting members of the Academic Senate on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The special committee asked that "the highest priority be given to the planning 
and implementation of the On-Campus Center for the Health Sciences in the 
10-year academic plan being formulated by the College of Medicine." 
</P>
<P>
Leon Schwartz, UCI's vice chancellor of administrative and business services, 
said: "The idea here is to have a center where you would have the basic 
research taking place in close proximity to clinical facilities . . . a quick 
exchange from research to bedside." 
</P>
<P>
Committee members shied away from calling the new facility a hospital, an idea 
the faculty has endorsed before and one that has been vehemently opposed by the 
community. There were concerns in the past that a new medical facility would 
not be community-oriented at a time when health-care options for the poor were 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
But Schwartz said the center won't be a traditional hospital with an emergency 
room that largely dictates the activity of the staff. Instead, the so-called 
On-Campus Center for the Health Sciences will focus on particular studies in 
medicine, such as neurosciences. 
</P>
<P>
Under such a plan, patients with Alzheimer's disease would more likely be 
treated than a patient needing heart surgery, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind an on-campus medical facility has refused to die, despite 
opposition by the community and a 1983 order by the UC Board of Regents to drop 
the plan. The board would ultimately have to approve plans for the campus 
center before it could be built. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz said he hopes this time the facility will receive a favorable 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it will get a great deal of support," he said. "The difficulty 
will be getting the funding to bring all this together." DANICA KIRKA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;

<P>
NEW DEVICE HELPS SAVE LIFE OF MAN 
</P>

Murray Brown is lucky to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa man came home from Nevada on Wednesday night after surviving a 
near-drowning. Had it not been for extraordinary luck and medical technology, 
he would have died. 
</P>
<P>
It was a cold and rainy night in Las Vegas on Jan. 18 when Brown's Jeep skidded 
into a freezing flood-control channel. Brown was submerged in water for more 
than 20 minutes while rescue workers struggled to free him from his vehicle. By 
the time he was taken to a hospital, his body temperature had dropped to 86 
degrees and he had no signs of neurological activity. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was taken to University Medical Center, where a staff doctor's newly 
invented blood-warming machine saved Brown from severe hypothermia -- and a 
sure death. 
</P>
<P>
The machine, devised by trauma specialist Larry Gentilello, had been tested on 
animals but never on a person. 
</P>
<P>
Except for nerve damage to his hands -- the aftereffects of frostbite -- Brown 
has recovered from the accident. "I shouldn't even be here, but I'm glad I am," 
said Brown, who celebrated his 27th birthday while in the hospital Monday. "I 
was bubbling when we drove up to the house. 
</P>
<P>
"It still doesn't feel real to me. Did I actually go through that?" 
</P>
<P>
Although Brown believes that the blood-warming machine was "greatly beneficial" 
in saving his life, he largely attributes his miraculous recovery to higher 
powers. "I think God had the biggest role," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The machine continuously drains, heats and recycles the blood of a hypothermia 
victim, Gentilello explained. "Our experience in the past with victims as 
critical as Murray has been that you call the family and give them bad news, 
with no room for hope," he said. "Murray has a very warm, close-knit family. To 
see them go through pain and grief, and then to turn that around and give him a 
new lease on life was a very rewarding experience." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the youngest child and only son in a family of eight, is now basking in 
the family's delight at having him home. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw him after the accident, I said my goodbys," recalled his 
father, Richard Brown, who stayed at his son's side at the hospital throughout 
the past month. "I mourned him for a week until his condition improved. My wife 
tells me I'm a pessimist." 
</P>
<P>
Yvette Brown, on the other hand, refused to believe that her son would die. "I 
prayed for 100% recovery, and that's what we almost have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
If he does not regain full use of his hands, Brown will have to find another 
profession: "I'm a craftsman; I install ceramic tile. I depend on my hands to 
make a living," said Brown, who is single and lives with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Now," he joked, "I may have to go back to school and learn to use my brain to 
make money." SUSAN CHRISTIAN

Betty Leidal and Jeff Bergan have only met once. But they think about each 
other often. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Leidal's 14-year-old son, David, was killed on the morning of Sept. 20, 
1988, when he was hit by a car. One of his kidneys was transplanted to Jeff 
Bergan, a part-time wrestling and football coach at Mission Viejo High School 
who was suffering from failing kidneys and a strained heart. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Bergan, 28, once too weak to even get out of bed, has been pronounced 
healthy by his doctors. He is going to pursue his bachelor of arts degree, a 
goal that he had all but given up. He says he can now think about his future. 
</P>
<P>
"With my kidneys failing and all, I felt everything was taken away from me," 
Bergan said recently. "I had no energy to do anything. Now I'm back to normal 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Leidal is still trying to cope with the death of her youngest son. A lawsuit 
has been filed against the driver, who was 17 at the time, and five other 
students who were passengers in the car that hit her son, as well as their 
families. As the director of the UCI Foundation, Leidal has kept herself busy. 
But while the numbness and shock resulting from her son's death have worn off, 
she said she still feels the pain. 
</P>
<P>
"I see David's friends are growing up," Leidal said. "Some of them are six feet 
tall and are just starting to grow whiskers on their faces. My David was frozen 
in time, his voice hadn't even changed." 
</P>
<P>
David had played freshman football at University High School. He was number 79, 
a good-humored boy who played the cello but loved rock and roll. 
</P>
<P>
Leidal said the toughest day she has suffered since David's death was the first 
anniversary of the accident. In September, she flew to visit her older son, 
Erik, a student at Rice University in Houston. When she came back, the 
emotional weight of David's death seemed heavier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"It hits you hard," Leidal recalled. "You know his death is really forever. 
He's never coming back. He's never going to make it to college." 
</P>
<P>
Leidal said she hopes Bergan will succeed in whatever he wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
It is rare for the recipient of a transplant to know the donor or his family, 
medical officials say. Bergan and Leidal found each other by cruel chance. 
Bergan, who had waited for a kidney transplant for more than two years, had 
been featured in several articles in The Times in 1988, including one that was 
printed a day before David was killed. David and his mother read the article 
and even talked about it. The next day, David was dead. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're dealing with something so horrible, you keep thinking that there's 
got to be something good in it. I just knew I had to donate his organs. I 
remembered the story about Jeff and I thought that David would want so bad to 
help him," Leidal said. 
</P>
<P>
Leidal was told she might not have enough time to find Bergan or that even if 
she found him, his blood type might not match her son's. But the search for the 
ailing coach gave Leidal a purpose, something she could hold onto. The next 
day, hospital officials found Bergan, whose blood type matched perfectly. The 
ailing coach received one of David's kidneys in a 2 1/2-hour operation. Nine 
days later, he was recovering at home. 
</P>
<P>
David's corneas, his liver and the other kidney were donated as well. Leidal 
does not know any of the other recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Bergan and Leidal met each other for the first and only time a month after the 
operation. The meeting was hard for both of them. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you say to a mother whose son died and now I'm living because of him?" 
Bergan asked. 
</P>
<P>
He said he told her he was grateful. He told her that he couldn't thank her 
enough. And he told her that he was not only living for himself now, he was 
living for David, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It was beautiful, very special. I know David is alive in a way through Jeff," 
Leidal said. 
</P>
<P>
Bergan and Leidal both said that they want to know each other better. But both 
know that seeing each other again could be painful. For now, they keep in 
contact through a mutual friend. And Bergan's mother and Leidal exchange 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
Bergan talks about David when he is asked to speak in Mission Viejo High School 
biology classes about his experience. He tells them that the 14-year-old boy 
saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask me how I am and how my kidneys are treating me. I always tell them, 
'We're fine.' It's the truth, I have part of her son in me and we're both doing 
fine," Bergan said.

CAPIZZI'S APPOINTMENT IS UPHELD; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: AVDEEF CONCEDES DISAPPOINTMENT, VOWS TO STEP UP EFFORTS IN D.A. RACE. 
CRITICISM FLIES AT CANDIDATE FORUM.

Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef lost an appeal seeking to overturn the 
appointment of Michael R. Capizzi as district attorney but vowed Thursday to 
step up his campaign for the office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing news, I agree," Avdeef said. "But not totally discouraging 
news. We are still going forward." 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef learned of the 4th District Court of Appeal action late Thursday at a 
candidates forum here before the South Orange County Republican Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors on Jan. 2 appointed Capizzi to replace Cecil Hicks, 
who resigned to become a Superior Court judge. Avdeef has sought to have 
Capizzi's appointment overturned on grounds the board lacked jurisdiction to 
make it. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef and others contend that the appointment gives Capizzi an advantage in 
the June 5 election as incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi, for his part, said he was happy that the appeal process was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always maintained that their argument was lacking and was without merit. 
It was a distraction, and I am glad it is behind us," Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
During the forum, Capizzi heard criticism of high turnover in the district 
attorney's office. Avdeef said the office has lost 50 deputy district attorneys 
in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi denied turnover was that high, saying that in fact it is consistent 
with that of other district attorney offices of similar size. 
</P>
<P>
He was also hit with an allegation that he showed favoritism toward a judge who 
had allegedly broken the child-support laws. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Novick, who was a deputy district attorney for 12 years before retiring 
two years ago, charged that Capizzi had instructed him not to prosecute a 
sitting judge who Novick claimed was two years behind in child-support 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said that no such conversation ever took place. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's debate provided an opportunity for challengers Avdeef and Assistant 
Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman to question their new boss. In addition to 
turnover, they brought up pay, which Avdeef said was too low and was driving 
prosecutors into private practice, and what Freeman described as a lack of 
innovation and aggressiveness in the office. 
</P>
<P>
Before his appointment to the top post, Capizzi was chief assistant district 
attorney, a title bestowed upon him by Hicks in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef's first legal challenge to Capizzi's appointment was rejected by 
Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore on Feb. 8.

MALATHION CLOUD FORMS OVER 72ND RACE

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democrat Jerry Yudelson hoped to turn the brown malathion mist into political 
gold Thursday as he launched his campaign against Republican Assemblyman Curt 
Pringle by attacking the incumbent's response to the controversial medfly 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue of helicopters spraying pesticide over Garden Grove's 72nd 
Assembly District loomed as a possible major issue between all three candidates 
in the race, as each strongly protested the malathion spraying Thursday and 
emphasized the steps he is taking to halt its use. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the first of two late-night sprayings over Garden Grove, 
Yudelson said he organized a citizens opposition group to fight the use of the 
pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
"I've testified against the spraying more than half a dozen times; I've written 
letters to the community newspapers, and now I am organizing a campaign to 
pressure the state commissioner of food and agriculture to come here to Orange 
County and hold hearings on this issue," Yudelson said at a press conference in 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Where, we might ask, has our state Assemblyman Curt Pringle been during all of 
this?" he said. "We haven't seen him at a single public hearing on the issue. 
We were told early on that he wrote a letter to the governor expressing 
concern. . . . Big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said Thursday evening that Yudelson is "just dead wrong about my 
response." 
</P>
<P>
The freshman assemblyman said he has supported two bills to regulate the 
spraying, including one Democrat-led proposal that would halt the spraying 
until the governor's health panel rules that malathion is safe. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are running for office against me are coming in and saying, 
'Look at the wonderful things I am doing for you,' and all they're doing is 
attending rallies," Pringle said. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Tom Umberg, a candidate in the June 5 primary against Yudelson, said 
Thursday that he also opposes the spraying and that he agrees that Pringle's 
response has been weak. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg said he is working with Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) -- whose 
district is also being sprayed -- to make sure "Orange County is included in 
any effort to stop the spraying." 
</P>
<P>
"We've been bouncing around various suggestions . . . everything from 
overflight height limitations to restricting the helicopters from taking off at 
Orange County airports," Umberg said. "My house is being sprayed too, and I 
have three little kids. I am concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The race for the 72nd Assembly District is shaping up as one of the most hotly 
contested campaigns in Orange County during the 1990 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Umberg has the backing of some of the county's most wealthy and influential 
Democratic Party leaders. Yudelson has been endorsed by Orange County 
Democratic Chairman Michael Balmages, who was at his side at the press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson, who ran unsuccessfully against Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) 
in 1988, is an environmental consultant and a former state environmental 
officer under former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. Umberg is a former U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson also said Thursday that he would run his race against Pringle, and not 
against a fellow Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Both Democrats have promised to attack Pringle for his role in the decision to 
place uniformed guards at several polling places in Latino neighborhoods on 
Election Day in 1988. Federal and local agencies are investigating whether it 
violated the voters' civil rights.

TITANS' DONATELL LEAVES TO BECOME A JETS' ASSISTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Donatell, a Cal State Fullerton assistant football coach, has accepted a job 
as an assistant with the New York Jets, he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just delighted to have the opportunity to coach at this level," said 
Donatell, who coached the Fullerton secondary last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a great opportunity for me." 
</P>
<P>
Donatell, 33, worked with Pete Carroll, the Jets' defensive coordinator, at the 
University of the Pacific in 1983. He will be a defensive assistant with the 
Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll and Bruce Coslet, who was named the Jets' head coach this month, played 
at Pacific. Donatell was a coach at Pacific from 1983 to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Before moving to Fullerton prior to last season, Donatell was the secondary 
coach at Idaho for three seasons. He also has coached at Washington and Kent 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy for him," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "I'm always happy 
for someone to make an ascending move, and that's really an ascending move."

MARKETS: SINCE 1987, THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES SELLING STOCK FOR THE FIRST TIME 
HAS DROPPED SHARPLY. BUT THE TIDE MAY TURN BEFORE YEAR'S END.

In mid-January, Tri-Care Inc. announced plans to raise $10.4 million in an 
initial public offering. The Santa Ana-based firm, which provides medical 
evaluations used to resolve disputed workers' compensation claims, completed 
the stock sale Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
In early February, I-Flow Corp., an Irvine-based start-up company developing an 
intravenous drug-delivery product, raised $2.6 million with the issuance of an 
IPO. 
</P>
<P>
And on Feb. 12, Tokos Parent Co., a Santa Ana home-health-care company that 
makes a device for detecting the onset of premature labor, said it would raise 
$30 million next month with its first public stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the first significant public offerings in the county in the last 18 
months," said Jeff Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities, a Costa Mesa 
securities brokerage firm that closely follows Orange County public companies. 
</P>
<P>
Other local companies are considering going public as well. For instance, 
Advanced Logic Research, an Irvine personal computer maker, is expected to make 
a long-contemplated public debut soon. 
</P>
<P>
This cloudburst of activity in Orange County would seem to indicate that the 
long dry spell for IPOs is over. But stock market forecasters are quick to 
point out that its takes more than a couple of downpours to end an extended 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had that kind of scenario for nearly five years, and we are grossly 
overdue for such a period," said Kilpatrick, who said poor market conditions 
are hobbling some small, up-and-coming Orange County companies that need an 
infusion of public money to continue their growth. 
</P>
<P>
Most industry analysts do not believe an explosion of IPOs is on the horizon 
for several reasons, including the stock market's recent gyrations and concerns 
about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock market has been very volatile, and people are predicting the end of 
a bull market, and that bodes poorly for IPOs," said Aaron Pressman, staff 
writer for Going Public: The IPO Reporter, a weekly newsletter published by 
Investment Dealers' Digest in New York. 
</P>
<P>
According to the newsletter, the number of companies going public in the 
country fell sharply after the October, 1987, stock market crash and has 
remained low ever since. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, 694 firms made initial public offerings and raised $18.26 billion, 
compared to 216 firms that went public in 1988, raising $5.95 billion, and 203 
that went public in 1989, raising $6.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kilpatrick said a resurgence of IPOs could occur in the next six months 
if the securities market is stable and the economy remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor that could spur more IPOs, securities industry officials say, is 
the disenchantment with junk bonds newly experienced by investors and 
underwriters who, as a consequence, are looking for other kinds of ventures to 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Also, passage of a proposal before Congress to reduce the capital gains tax 
could make the entire stock market, including IPOs, more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
For young companies to get a good price for their stock in an IPO today, market 
experts said, they must show exceptional earnings potential. Also, it doesn't 
hurt for them to be in one of the handful of industries that are currently 
"hot" on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
All three of the Orange County firms that recently chose to go public are in 
one such field: health care. 
</P>
<P>
Pressman said the 11 health-care companies that went public last year 
outperformed IPOs in every other business sector. During the year the value of 
their stock increased an average of 71%, contrasted with an average increase of 
17% for all IPOs. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also say the stock market is especially receptive to oil service, 
computer software and environmental technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
"For certain niches, IPOs are growing. But on the whole, it (the market for 
IPOs) is pretty cold," Pressman said. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to raising expansion capital on the stock market, some 
companies have arranged private sales of stock to institutions or have merged 
with larger corporations in leveraged buyouts. In other cases, venture capital 
investors that fund companies in their initial stages are waiting to liquidate 
their investments until stock market conditions improve. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies are eager for the stock market window to squeeze open a little 
more so they can obtain money they need to take advantage of a pressing 
business opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Velie, chief executive and major owner in Velie Circuits Inc., a private 
Costa Mesa firm that makes printed computer circuit boards, said that although 
the 5-year-old company has shown substantial growth, stock market investors 
wouldn't regard it as having the same "sizzle" as a health-care business.

INVESTORS GROUP INCREASES STAKE IN NEC TO 4.2% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of investors has raised its stake in Irvine-based National Education 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Richard C. Blum, a San Francisco investment manager, and several others 
purchased 273,180 shares in the vocational and industrial training school 
company, bringing their total investment to 4.2%, or 1.2 million common shares. 
</P>
<P>
The group bought the shares between Feb. 5 and Feb. 20 for $4.93 to $5 each, 
according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. 
</P>
<P>
Blum, who serves on NEC's board of directors and is the husband of 
gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein, has said he is only interested in the 
company as an investment, according to NEC officials. 
</P>
<P>
NEC has recently been suffering from flat enrollments at its vocational schools 
and administrative problems at a major subsidiary, Applied Learning.

THE EVER-EVOLVING STYLE OF MILES DAVIS; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: HE'S BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS, BUT HIS MUSIC CONTINUES TO BE VITAL. HE AND 
THE CURRENT CROP OF MUSICIANS IN HIS BAND PLAY THE COACH HOUSE TONIGHT.

<P>
One of the reasons I like playing with a lot of young musicians today is 
because I find that a lot of old musicians are lazy . . . resisting change and 
holding on to the old ways. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Miles Davis, "Miles: The Autobiography" 
</P>
<P>
A sizzling keyboard anthem dissolves into a mess of percussion, frying up in a 
fatback bass line. Edgy guitar chords stir through the brew. Miles Davis, 
blowing muted trumpet, stretches a bluesy line into something that almost 
resembles be-bop, then adds his own considered punctuation. The band behind him 
is as tight as Arnold Schwarzenegger's Levi's. 
</P>
<P>
"My Funny Valentine" it ain't. The tune, "Jilli," off Davis' latest album, 
"Amandela," was written by the band's newest member, percussionist John Bigham. 
The go-go style rhythm and dynamic contrasts of the piece are perfect for the 
kind of slick, backbeat-heavy attack Davis has favored over the last few years. 
Although Bigham wrote the tune and, along with Marcus Miller, gets a production 
credit, he wasn't in the band when the album was cut. In fact, he's not even a 
percussionist. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a guitarist first and foremost," Bigham said in a phone interview earlier 
this week in Montreal, where the band was appearing. "Miles asked me about a 
percussionist and I referred him to a friend that never got back to us. Then I 
decided, wow, that I would really like to try to do it. I'd never played 
percussion before in my life, except on my songs, and I knew Miles likes the 
way I write. 
</P>
<P>
"So I said to him, 'Look, man, I can do the percussion. And he said, 'Forget 
you, man.' But then he began asking me how I would do it, and I told him I 
would use a sampler and other electronic percussion." 
</P>
<P>
Davis went for it. Bigham rehearsed one day with Davis' drummer Ricky Wellman 
before heading out on the latest tour, which began with a stint on the island 
of Guadaloupe in the Caribbean, included few Canadian dates and continues 
tonight at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
How does he like his new status as a part-time percussionist? 
</P>
<P>
"Usually a percussionist will have all kinds of things sitting around," Bigham 
said. "I don't have to stay busy. I'm a 'pocket' player, I just stay in the 
pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Wellman, who's been with Davis for almost three years, says Bigham fits well 
into the band's rhythmic scheme. "Miles always wants things to be more 
simplified, and John is a great, simple-type player, just working in between 
the beats. That's exactly what Miles is looking for, someone who won't get in 
the way of the rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
The type of players Davis has surrounded himself with over the years has always 
influenced his musical direction. In his autobiography, he claims that he'd 
still be playing like those "old musicians" if not for the influence of Herbie 
Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter and Tony Williams in the '60s. The sources 
from which he's drawn the current crop of band members (saxophonist Kenny 
Garrett; guitarist Foley, who goes by just the one name; keyboardist Kei Akagi, 
and bassist Benny Rietveld round out the band) say a lot about his style of 
playing today. 
</P>
<P>
Bigham, a 30-year-old Chicago native who has lived in Los Angeles for the last 
four years, has played guitar locally at underground clubs like Funky Reggae 
and Peace Posse with his own group, Big Thang. He also appears with the 
notorious 28-piece band Trulio Disgracious, which has played larger venues such 
as the Palace in Hollywood and includes members of Fishbone and the Red Hot 
Chili Peppers. Drummer Wellman spent 11 years with the Washington-based group 
Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers, which had a disco hit in 1978 with their 
album "Bustin' Loose." 
</P>
<P>
Wellman has no illusions about being a jazz drummer. 
</P>
<P>
"Miles heard my drumming on a tape a friend of mine gave him, and he really 
liked it. He called my home and sent me a couple of tapes with his material to 
work on. I knew who Miles was, but I hadn't followed his music that closely. 
When we talked, I expressed to him that I was no jazz drummer. He mentioned my 
tape and said, 'You can play this kind of music, can't you?' So I learned it." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 40 years, getting the call from Davis has been the stuff of legends. 
But the event seemed matter-of-fact for Los Angeles-based Kei Akagi, a 
keyboardist and synthesizer player who had worked with Al DiMeola, Jean Luc 
Ponty and the late Joe Farrell among others, in addition to leading his own 
band, Playroom, at clubs around L.A. Davis, who's expressed high praise for his 
current keyboardist in recent interviews, called early in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Miles lost both of his keyboardists at once," Akagi explained. "I was 
recommended for the job through the grapevine by people who knew my work with 
DiMeola." 
</P>
<P>
Akagi learned the band's material from a tape he was sent. Rehearsals, held 
before the band went out on the road, were usually low-key. 
</P>
<P>
The keyboardist says that, because of his background, he has no trouble 
adjusting to the improvisational shifts and dynamic changes that are the 
trademark of Davis' live performances. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've been playing jazz as long as I have, you get a feeling for what 
parameters are going to stretch and which are going to stay intact. You know 
how to judge when to stay with the arrangement, and when to let it go." 
</P>
<P>
Being with Miles has obviously influenced the music of saxophonist Kenny 
Garrett. Garrett, always seen as more of a jazz purist because of his work with 
Mel Lewis, Woody Shaw, Art Blakey, early editions of the neo-bop group Out of 
the Blue and the Ellington Orchestra, has a new recording, "Big Ol' Head," on 
which Davis makes a guest appearance. The album is a lot more funky than the 
more mainstream recordings he did for the Dutch label Criss Cross. But then 
Garrett didn't have his own American recording contract when he was playing 
straight jazz. 
</P>
<P>
This fact hasn't gone unnoticed by Bigham and Wellman. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going into jazz," Wellman said. "It doesn't open doors. There's just 
not a lot of sales in jazz. My direction is more commercial. I plan to record 
my own album someday, still play live and break into the big time." 
</P>
<P>
Bigham's association with Davis has led to more specific developments. 
</P>
<P>
"Miles has opened up a door for me at Warner Bros. . . . I hope to be doing my 
own album soon; it's in the works. And it's all due to this thing with Miles." 
</P>
<P>
 Miles Davis and his band play tonight at 8 and 10:30 at the Coach House, 33157 
Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $29.50. Information: (714)

RESIDENT TROUPE SOUGHT FOR BREA'S CURTIS THEATER;

Have theater, will rent. 
</P>
<P>
This city's Community Services Department has embarked on a lengthy audition 
process for arts troupes interested in becoming resident companies at the 
199-seat Curtis Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for groups who want to make Brea a home," said Ret Wixted, 
director of Community Services. "I hope after a year we'll have a working 
knowledge of the talent and the groups that are out there." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Black Actors Theatre, one of several prospective candidates, 
will be the first to showcase itself at the Curtis. The company will stage the 
Fats Waller musical revue "Ain't Misbehavin' " from March 17 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
Wixted said Thursday that Ballet Pacifica, currently based in Laguna Beach, and 
Stop-Gap, a Santa Ana-based theater troupe, also have expressed interest in 
presenting their works at the theater, along with others ranging from light 
opera companies to comedy groups to poetry associations. 
</P>
<P>
Resident companies would be required to coordinate their schedule with the Brea 
Theatre League, a community troupe that already books the Curtis 16 weeks a 
year for a three-play season, Wixted said. 
</P>
<P>
Black Actors Theatre, which has administrative headquarters in Santa Ana but no 
performing space of its own, has been seeking a permanent home for years. The 
troupe hopes eventually to produce three plays a year at the Curtis, said Brea 
cultural arts manager Emily Sabin, who is negotiating with various groups. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Brea will not provide financial support to resident companies, 
Sabin said, but it will offer the regular use of the Curtis at a substantial 
discount off the usual rental fee of $300 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Sabin said the theater, which was built as part of the Brea Civic Center 
complex about decade ago, started out with four resident troupes: the Brea 
Theatre League, the Young Americans, Cabaret Repertory Theatre and the Lilliput 
Players. 
</P>
<P>
All except the League abandoned the Curtis for varying reasons during the 
mid-'80s. The Young Americans wanted to tour. (They have since declared 
bankruptcy.) Cabaret Rep dissolved. The Lilliput Players, a children's theater 
troupe, relocated to Tustin as part of L.P. Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
"After they all left," Sabin said, "the city presented plays for a while. But 
we aren't experts at that. So we decided to get out of the producing business." 
</P>
<P>
The Curtis has been a rental facility for the last four years.

An 18-month-old girl drowned in a man-made pond Thursday after wandering 
outside an apartment in Fullerton, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Krystal Lynn Marquis apparently was playing unattended downstairs in the 
apartment of her mother's fiance, Brian Nauenberg, in The Streams complex in 
the 1200 block of Deerpark Drive about 2 p.m., Sgt. Neal Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Nauenberg, who was downstairs, thought Krystal was upstairs with her mother, 
Keary Lynn Sharp, 19, from Garden Grove, police said. When Nauenberg noticed 
the apartment was quiet, he realized the girl had wandered out the patio door. 
Police said Nauenberg ran outside and saw Krystal unconscious in about a foot 
of water in a pond that meanders through the apartment complex. Paramedics were 
called, but the child was pronounced dead at Placentia-Linda Community 
Hospital.

VALLEY ROBBERY SUSPECTS CAUGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
Two men suspected of carrying out a recent string of convenience-store 
robberies in the San Fernando Valley were arrested this morning in Granada 
Hills after sheriff's deputies followed them from a failed robbery in La Canada 
and tracked them down using police dogs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Cruz, 23, and James Bailey, 24, of Pacoima, were taken to USC Medical 
Center for treatment of dog bites to their arms and heads. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey was reported to be in stable condition at the hospital. Cruz was being 
held at the Los Angeles County Central Jail facility, a sheriff's detective 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested on suspicion of auto theft and attempted robbery. Bail 
was set at $11,000 for both men, Det. Marvin Cheyno of the Sheriff's 
Department's Crescenta Valley station said. 
</P>
<P>
The two allegedly drove a stolen car to a gasoline station mini-mart on Angeles 
Crest Highway near the 210 Freeway in La Canada Flintridge, where they tried to 
break down a locked door just after midnight. The mini-mart was closed but an 
attendant was inside to serve gasoline customers. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyno said the attendant called police and deputies on patrol spotted the 
suspects on the 210 Freeway.

2 VICTORIES FOR PRO-CHOICE ADVOCATES; 
</P>
<P>
INDIANA SENATE KILLS ABORTION BAN; MICHIGAN BILL VETOED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pro-choice forces won two battles when the Indiana Senate defeated legislation 
to ban abortions in public hospitals and Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard 
vetoed a bill today requiring minors to obtain permission for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights activists in Indianapolis clapped in the Senate gallery and 
hugged in the hallway when senators turned back the public hospital ban on a 
26-23 vote Thursday night. The move followed a two-hour debate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to be debating this issue again in the Indiana Senate during 
this session," said Dinah Farrington, a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood Inc. 
"Attempts will be made to bring it back, but I really don't think we're going 
to see it on the Senate floor again for a vote." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Blanchard announced his veto of the Michigan bill, which would have 
required minors to get permission either from their parents or a court. The 
governor said that he supports parental involvement in such decisions but that 
the bill "takes a woman's right to help herself away from her." 
</P>
<P>
The actions marked the latest swings in the seesawing fortunes of abortion 
legislation around the country. Earlier in the week, legislatures in South 
Carolina and Michigan gave final approval to bills requiring parental consent 
for teen-agers seeking abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The veto of the measure in Michigan leaves only one question in the abortion 
dispute in the state -- whether abortion foes will make a doomed override 
attempt or head straight to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Blanchard's counterpart in South Carolina, Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr., has 
not taken action on the parental consent bill passed there this week but has 
said he supports it. 
</P>
<P>
The Indiana legislation would have prevented doctors in public hospitals or 
clinics from performing abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the 
life or health of the mother is threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, no public money can be used for abortions, but some public 
hospitals perform the procedure by using private donations and fees. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also would have required doctors to perform viability tests before 
performing abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. Doctors failing to 
conduct the tests could have been jailed.

It also required doctors planning to perform abortions to first test any fetus 
over 20 weeks to determine if it could live outside the womb.

FORMER SALVADOR PRESIDENT DUARTE DIES

Jose Napoleon Duarte, who became El Salvador's first democratically elected 
president in 50 years but was unable to end a civil war that battered his 
nation, died today of cancer. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
The ex-president's personal physician, Jose Luis Saca, said Duarte died at 
11:50 a.m. at home in the fashionable San Benito neighborhood on the south side 
of San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, doctors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington 
diagnosed the cancer and removed 60% of Duarte's stomach, but the cancer had 
spread to his liver. At that time, they gave him from six to 18 months to live. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte governed from 1984 until June, 1989, when his Christian Democrats lost 
control of Congress and he had to turn the presidency over to Alfredo 
Cristiani, leader of the rightist Arena Party supported by the oligarchy that 
Duarte fought so long. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte, who was once arrested, beaten and exiled for his fidelity to democracy, 
called his inauguration in 1984 "a light in the long night of horror," and he 
likened himself to Moses delivering a people from their tribulations. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte was crucial to the replacement of an authoritarian, semi-feudal system 
with incipient democracy. But he finished his term, and his life, burdened by 
failures, compromises, frustration and dashed hopes. 
</P>
<P>
The war with the leftist Farabundo Marti Liberation Front continues after 10 
years. Poverty remains endemic in this small Central American nation of 5 
million, where the staggering economy is dependent on U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't work miracles," said a high-ranking U.S. diplomat who served in El 
Salvador for most of Duarte's term. "But he must be credited with instituting 
the democratic system itself. His great legacy is the transition (of 
government). The rest pales by comparison." 
</P>
<P>
Duarte's opponents criticized his bombast and messianic complex. Some of his 
top aides were accused of corruption. His supporters hailed his idealism and 
fighting spirit. But adversaries and fans agree Duarte played a historic role 
in El Salvador.

NASA today postponed for a third time the flight of Atlantis on a secret 
military mission, saying that its commander had recovered from a cold but that 
the threat of storms still prevented the launch. 
</P>
<P>
National Aeronautics and Space Administration managers ordered the delay until 
at least Sunday, blaming a weather front that moved into the area this morning, 
packing rain and brisk winds and bringing the threat of thunderstorms. The 
forecast for Sunday is much better with an 80% chance of favorable conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement came just hours after doctors pronounced Atlantis commander 
John O. Creighton fully recovered from a cold that, along with the weather, 
forced two earlier postponements.

The nation's highest court today cleared former Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp 
of violating official secrecy, a charge that ended her chances for the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The five-judge panel of the Federal Criminal Court ruled that Kopp had not 
violated official secrecy laws when she made a telephone call warning her 
husband to quit a company suspected of laundering drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
The court said it could not be proved that she revealed secret information 
deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
A guilty verdict would have made Kopp Switzerland's first government minister 
disgraced by a criminal conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Kopp, 53, was forced to resign from the government in the unprecedented case 
that cost her a chance to be Switzerland's first woman president. 
</P>
<P>
Kopp telephoned her husband Hans on Oct. 27, 1988, to tell him to resign as 
vice chairman of Shakarchi Trading Co., a Zurich-based foreign exchange and 
gold-trading firm about to be linked to a "Lebanon Connection" money-laundering 
probe.

President Bush's press secretary gave a lighthearted tongue-lashing today to 
the nation's lawyers, saying they "deserve all the criticism they can get." 
</P>
<P>
Marlin Fitzwater made his comment at his regular daily briefing when a reporter 
asked if Bush was criticizing lawyers when he said in a Baltimore speech 
Thursday that the government would help "restore common sense and fairness to 
America's medical malpractice system." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, who is not a lawyer, said, "Lawyers certainly deserve all the 
criticism they can get." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Bush, also a non-lawyer, shared his feelings, Fitzwater laughingly 
said: "Those are universally held feelings by everyone who's ever dealt with 
the legal establishment. . . . I'm sure all my good friends who are lawyers 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, who is divorced and recently closed on a new house, did not explain 
the basis of his feelings.

The names of illegitimate children of British aristocrats have been printed for 
the first time in a famous guide to bluebloods. 
</P>
<P>
It's something of a revolution for "Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage," the 
weighty reference book that first came out in 1769 and appears every five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have put them in at the request of those families who wanted the names of 
natural children to appear," said editor Charles Kidd at the launch of the 
latest edition Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Across the country, about one in every four children is born out of wedlock. 
If parents agree, we believe that Debrett's should record illegitimate issue to 
ensure the book is comprehensive, although these children still cannot inherit 
a title," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kidd said about 200 names have entered the huge book as a result of changing 
social attitudes.

FLETCHER, REPUBLICAN MODERATE, NOMINATED TO HEAD RIGHTS BOARD

<P>
President Bush today nominated Arthur A. Fletcher, who has served in several 
Republican administrations, to be chairman of the Civil Rights Commission, the 
White House announced. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush hopes Fletcher will 
reinvigorate the commission, which has been buffeted by congressional criticism 
for a series of actions it took during the Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it helps anybody to start criticizing past performance except to 
say we think they can do a better job," Fitzwater said in announcing the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, a moderate Republican who runs a consulting business in Washington, 
was an early black political supporter of Bush. The President sought to name 
him nearly a year ago but was unable to because the then-chairman of the panel, 
William B. Allen, refused to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, whose term ran through 1992, did resign late last year with a blast at 
Bush as being "too reticent . . . to contribute to the debate on civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher was assistant secretary of labor under President Richard M. Nixon, 
deputy assistant for urban affairs under President Gerald R. Ford and an 
adviser to President Ronald Reagan. He also served with Bush at the United 
Nations in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Bush met briefly with Fletcher at the White House after the nomination was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush wants to see the commission restored as "an effective 
institution." 
</P>
<P>
"We have felt that it could be stronger and more forceful in representing the 
concerns of minorities and others. We expect it to operate in that fashion," 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
He said another vacancy on the eight-member commission will be filled soon. The 
President and Congress each appoint four members to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Rights Commission has been criticized in Congress for some positions 
it adopted during the Reagan Administration, including opposition to 
affirmative action programs. Major civil rights groups have denounced the panel 
since Reagan appointees assumed control. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's tenure at the agency had been marked by controversy and by 
confrontation with other commissioners. A speech he delivered last year titled 
"Blacks? Animals? Homosexuals? What is a Minority?" was formally condemned.

BRITAIN LIFTS SOUTH AFRICA INVESTMENT BAN

Britain lifted a ban on new investment in South Africa today and Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher dismissed suggestions that Britain stood isolated by acting 
out of concert with its European Community partners. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed to comment on the British move, Thatcher sounded defiant after talks 
with Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti. 
</P>
<P>
"I am accused of being out of step and isolated. It is pretty cozy isolation, 
pretty crowded, judging by the numbers of foreign statesmen who are talking to 
us. It is very cozy and very crowded being isolated if that is the right word, 
which it is not," she told a news conference in a lightly mocking tone. 
</P>
<P>
Britain was alone at this week's EC foreign ministers' meeting in Dublin when 
it confirmed the Thatcher government's decision to break ranks and lift 
voluntary sanctions imposed against South Africa in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The unilateral move was the first step by any country to relax sanctions 
against Pretoria in response to South African President Frederik W. de Klerk's 
reforms and the freeing of black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley said in announcing the move in 
Parliament: "We have made clear our view that the steps President de Klerk has 
taken have transformed the political climate in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"He has opened the way to a peaceful end to apartheid through negotiation. This 
deserves a constructive response from the international community." 
</P>
<P>
Ridley also announced an end to a ban on the promotion of tourism to South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was among black South African leaders who had urged Thatcher not to 
lift sanctions against Pretoria until the state of emergency is lifted and 
apartheid is dismantled.

House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) suggested today that congressional 
Democratic leaders this election year may drop their 1989 policy of refusing to 
back tax increases without first winning President Bush's support. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after a joint news conference with Senate Democratic 
leader George J. Mitchell of Maine, Foley said Democrats may opt to go out on 
the tax increase limb on some issues despite White House opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Foley was asked if last year's Democratic leadership position of refusing to 
propose any tax increases without first getting Bush's support had changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure," Foley said. "It's essentially still the policy that we're not 
interested in engaging in quixotic activities that are not going to produce 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
But pressed further, he said a Democratic push for some revenue measures that 
lack Bush's support may occur this year. 
</P>
<P>
"That's possible," he said. "I don't want to lay down hard and fast rules here. 
There's no purpose in trying to decide at this juncture what possibly could or 
could not be done and announce irrevocable policies about it." 
</P>
<P>
During the news conference, Mitchell noted that during the eight years of the 
Reagan Administration, Reagan "proposed and supported and signed into law 13 
tax increases and in the process convinced everyone in America that he was 
against all of them." 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush has got the (anti-tax) words down right but it remains to be 
seen whether he has the political skill to (accomplish) the same result," 
Mitchell said.

Lloyds Bank of Britain posted a pretax loss of $1.2 billion today after a huge 
provision against loans to developing countries undermined hefty profits made 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that our 1989 figures show a substantial loss arises from the large 
provision we have made for Third World debt," Lloyds Chairman Sir Jeremy Morse 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result we are fully covered for that part of the debt which is doubtful, 
and the worst of this long-running problem should be behind us," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyds Bank PLC became the third of the top four British commercial banks to 
see shrunken profits after making a provision of $2.9 billion to cover the debt 
of less developed countries, amounting to 70% of total exposure.

Sweden's car maker Volvo and Renault, the French state-owned automotive 
concern, today announced acquisition of major equity stakes in each other's car 
and truck production operations in a bid to become more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said they also intend to enter into an "extensive cooperation 
agreement" under which they will coordinate product development programs, 
purchasing operations and investment plans. 
</P>
<P>
But they said each company will maintain its trademarks and distribution 
organizations and will continue assembling and marketing its own cars, trucks 
and buses. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement in the Dutch capital capped months-long rounds of negotiations 
between the two companies, whose sales have been under pressure in an 
increasingly competitive world market. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Volvo and Renault will swap 45% of the shares in their 
truck and bus operations and exchange 25% of stock in their car divisions, 
according to Raymond Levy, Renault's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Pehr Gyllenhammar, president of Volvo, said the agreement means both companies 
will "maintain their integrity . . . and will give them the size, breadth and 
depth well above the critical mass necessary to survive in this fiercely 
competitive industry." 
</P>
<P>
The stock swap covers an auto conglomerate that will account for production of 
about 2.3 million units a year, or about 20% of the European market, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The combination will produce more than 155,000 trucks, beating the current 
leader in that field, Daimler Benz of West Germany, by a margin of 40,000 
units.

ROONEY'S '60 MINUTES' SUSPENSION MAY END SOONER THAN EXPECTED

Andy Rooney is expected to return to "60 Minutes" shortly, perhaps as early as 
next week, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Talks involving Rooney, David Burke, president of CBS News, and those close to 
the suspended commentator were held during the last 48 hours. By Thursday 
night, however, no decision had been reached about when Rooney might be 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Sources cautioned that CBS management was still weighing how, and when, to lift 
the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Burke called Rooney and asked for a meeting. Both men met at 
the CBS News Broadcast Center Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview late Thursday, Rooney said, "We had a very pleasant 
conversation and he conceded that there was nothing personal. I like him fine." 
</P>
<P>
Rooney added that "it would not be inaccurate" to say that a return is 
imminent. He also said, "I honestly don't know" when the suspension would be 
lifted. Burke did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Rooney, in anticipation of an early return, has prepared a piece 
for this Sunday's edition of "60 Minutes." But it now appears viewers may have 
to wait until at least March 4 to see it. 
</P>
<P>
Burke suspended Rooney Feb. 8 for three months, for racist remarks he was 
quoted as making in The Advocate, a gay magazine based in Los Angeles. Rooney 
denied making the remarks, but Burke enforced the suspension anyway. Rooney was 
not expected to return to the air until May. 
</P>
<P>
Now CBS brass is rethinking its position. In the three weeks following the 
suspension, Burke and CBS News have come under enormous pressure from viewers 
calling for Rooney's reinstatement. Pressure has also come from within CBS 
News. Don Hewitt, executive producer of "60 Minutes," would like to see the 
popular commentator back on the show soon. 
</P>
<P>
There may be another reason for lifting the suspension, sources say. By getting 
back Rooney, CBS hopes to bolster the show's ratings, which have declined 
slightly since Rooney has been off the air.

OBSCENITY CONVICTION REVERSED

<P>
A jury Thursday reversed the conviction of a music store owner found guilty 
last year of violating obscenity laws for selling a rap music tape with 
sexually explicit lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
A jury of nine men and three women deliberated about an hour and a half before 
finding Tommy Hammond innocent of the misdemeanor charge. 
</P>
<P>
The case centered around a tape titled "Move Somethin"' by the rap group The 2 
Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, the owner of Taking Home the Hits music store in Alexander City, had 
been convicted and fined $500 for violating the city's misdemeanor obscenity 
ordinance in a nonjury trial, but under state law was allowed to take the case 
before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claimed the tape, which included lyrics with graphic descriptions 
of sodomy, sadomasochism and human genitalia, violated the city's 1983 
obscenity ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
According to attorneys and legal experts, Hammond would have been the first 
person convicted in a jury trial of selling obscene recordings. His lawyers 
said a guilty verdict would have put a chill over the entire recording 
industry, with artists and record companies becoming reluctant to release any 
material that might be deemed offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, who stopped selling the tape after his arrest, said he would continue 
to sell recordings by The 2 Live Crew but probably not the release that landed 
him in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I will ever sell the tape again," he said. "I think I've had 
enough of 'Move Somethin.' "

IRS CITES FOXX EXPENDITURES

<P>
Comedian Redd Foxx was paid $500,000 for his role in the movie "Harlem Nights" 
and spent $373,000 of it on "wine, women, song and gambling," the Internal 
Revenue Service says. 
</P>
<P>
Such expenditures make it unlikely that the IRS can reach agreement with Foxx 
on his tax troubles, IRS attorney Rollin Thorley told a federal bankruptcy 
judge Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Foxx, who gained fame playing a junk dealer on the TV show "Sanford and Son" 
and who now performs at a Las Vegas resort, filed for protection from creditors 
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law in 1983. He owes the IRS more than 
$900,000 in taxes, penalties and interest. 
</P>
<P>
The earnings on the recent movie were revealed as Foxx appeared in court to try 
to block a public auction of more than 400 items of personal property seized in 
an IRS raid in November. 
</P>
<P>
The items, including his Las Vegas home, several cars and jewelry, were to be 
sold last month. The sale was delayed while a federal judge tried to decide 
whether the IRS or the bankruptcy court had first claim on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy Judge Clive Jones ordered the property seized by the IRS to be held 
"in limbo" for 60 days while lawyers try to reach agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Foxx failed in bids to block the IRS from seizing his paychecks for back taxes.

Impressionist Rich Little is seeking custody of his 1-year-old daughter, whose 
mother is fighting him over child support. 
</P>
<P>
Little's lawyer, Gerald Z. Berkowitz, says he succeeded in having the child 
support argument heard in Delaware, where the mother, Lalette Cottrell, and 
child, Lindsay, live, rather than in California, where the comedian lives. 
</P>
<P>
Little is willing to pay support but wants an amount "consistent with the needs 
of the child," his lawyer said. If the case were heard in California, Little 
would have to pay from $5,000 to $10,000 a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the Delaware courts would give her that," Berkowitz said. "And I 
don't think a child needs $5,000 to $10,000 a month." 
</P>
<P>
Little, of Los Angeles, also filed for custody because Cottrell has "resisted 
permitting him to visit his daughter," Berkowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Cottrell and her lawyer, Daniel F. Kelleher, would not comment.

A Seattle man pleaded guilty of attempting to extort money from the lawyer of 
Seattle SuperSonics guard Dale Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
"I attempted to get money from an attorney in exchange for giving favorable 
trial testimony on behalf of his client," wrote Guy Thomas, 24, in his plea 
agreement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, a nightclub bouncer here, entered the plea to the crime of "bribe 
receiving by a witness" before King County Superior Court Judge J. Kathleen 
Learned. 
</P>
<P>
The crime stems from Ellis' pending case on drunken and reckless-driving 
charges. A hearing has been set for March 20 in Seattle District Court. He has 
pleaded innocent to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis is still recuperating from injuries he received Jan. 12 when the car he 
was driving was involved in a single-car accident on a northbound on-ramp to 
Interstate 5. He suffered a collapsed lung and three broken ribs.

CHRISTENSEN GOES OUT FOR NEW CHALLENGE -- BASEBALL

<TEXT>
<P>
A player wearing a green Oakland A's jersey, No. 32, stretches near the batting 
cage. He has a muscular upper body. Long, curly strands of hair extend beyond 
his baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
The man looks a lot like Todd Christensen, a former football player, the guy 
who played tight end for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Funny. It is Todd Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
He wears no shoulder pads, no silver and black. He does not run a post pattern 
toward second base. He wields a baseball bat and steps into the box. 
</P>
<P>
He bunts the first two pitches. Then he sends the next one soaring toward the 
right field fence. Tell it goodby. 
</P>
<P>
"That was pretty exciting," Christensen said later. "I thought, 'What's there 
to this? It's easy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Christensen injected color into another faceless, emotionless day of Lockout 
'90. He came to Scottsdale Community College for a tryout with the world 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
Though he did not expect an instant contract offer -- and didn't get one -- 
this was not an exercise in comedy. Christensen seldom smiled. 
</P>
<P>
His agent, Alan Hendricks, called A's General Manager Sandy Alderson last week. 
Alderson, remembering a 1987 interview with Christensen on ESPN's "SportsLook," 
gave the request more than idle thought. 
</P>
<P>
When told of Christensen's inquiry, Walt Jocketty, the A's director of baseball 
administration, laughed. After watching Thursday's tryout, he figures it was 
worth a couple of hours on an otherwise quiet February day. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it as a favor," Jocketty said. "I think he wanted to get some sense of 
what we thought of his ability. 
</P>
<P>
"There are definitely some basic skills there. But at his age, there's too much 
to do in too little time." 
</P>
<P>
Christensen is 33. That's two years too young to play in the senior baseball 
league, a more likely destination for this strange odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders released him last fall after a decade as one of the NFL's top tight 
ends. He caught 95 passes in 1986. He played in four Pro Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
But he had not played baseball since his days at Sheldon High School in Eugene, 
Ore. His career there was impressive enough for him to be taken in the 1974 
baseball draft. 
</P>
<P>
But Christensen preferred to play tight end at Brigham Young. Baseball waited 
for more than 15 years. Then, driven partly by curiosity, partly by 
competitiveness and partly by ego -- not, he stressed, by money -- he began 
working out in Los Angeles in December.

Smith collapsed at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at the Ft. Carson boxing gymnasium

MCENROE LOSES APPEAL OF FINES; COULD FACE BAN FROM GRAND SLAM

<P>
John McEnroe has lost his appeal against fines imposed during the Australian 
Open and could be banned from playing other Grand Slam tournaments if he runs 
into further trouble this year, tennis officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The fiery American was disqualified from the Australian Open last month and 
fined $6,500 after incurring three code violations during his fourth-round 
match against Sweden's Mikael Pernfors. 
</P>
<P>
"All the fines have been upheld and McEnroe is now $1,000 away from being 
denied entry to the following Grand Slam if he incurs more fines," 
International Tennis Federation spokesman Ian Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Any player who collects fines totaling $7,500 in the Grand Slam events within a 
12-month period is banned from the next of the big four tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe has yet to decide which events he will take part in this year, but if 
he played the French Open and was penalized he could be barred from Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said McEnroe's appeal was considered by Grand Slam tournaments 
administrator Bill Babcock in London earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes emphasized that today's decision by the federation applies only to Grand 
Slam events. McEnroe still could accrue fines at regular ATP tournaments and 
not be forced to miss any of the Grand Slam events this year. 
</P>
<P>
In his match against Pernfors, McEnroe first was warned for unsportsmanlike 
conduct, then was docked a penalty point for racket abuse and was assessed a 
fine of $500. 
</P>
<P>
He was then defaulted after verbally abusing the referee and supervisor. The 
third code violation cost McEnroe another $5,000, plus an additional $1,000 
penalty for being disqualified.

<P>
Heavyweight boxer Harold Reitman opens his right fist, the one that knocked an 
opponent unconscious for nearly four minutes in a recent fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Feel my hand," Reitman says. "Smooth as a baby's tush." 
</P>
<P>
The same hand can also slide a camera lens the size of a pinhead into a knee 
before arthroscopic surgery or replace a useless hip joint with an artificial 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Reitman, 3-0 as a professional boxer, makes his living as an orthopedic 
surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't do either one halfway," he said. "The stakes are too high." 
</P>
<P>
Reitman, who will turn 40 next month, has drawn national attention by knocking 
out all three opponents in less than two rounds. His fourth fight will be a 
black-tie affair Saturday night against 200-pound Vale Payton, 28, who will 
make his pro debut at St. Andrew's Country Club in Boca Raton. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you seen the doctor fight?" asked Allie Ridgway of Miami, who has trained 
boxers for 52 years. "He's vicious. The way he's been taking care of his 
opponents, they should be ringing his doorbell for free consultations." 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-11, 212-pound Reitman, who lives in the Ft. Lauderdale suburb of 
Plantation, is married and the father of a 7-year-old girl. Because of his age, 
Reitman needed special permission from the Florida State Athletic Commission to 
get his professional boxing license last November. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an unusual case, an excellent physical specimen who obviously has some 
talent," said Harry Brennan, assistant executive director for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand he's a very successful surgeon. Why he would want to get in a 
ring is beyond my comprehension. This is America, I guess, as Don King would 
say." 
</P>
<P>
Reitman acknowledges that the American Medical Assn. has taken a stance against 
boxing, but he said he weighed the pros and cons of that opinion. His 
conclusion: "Boxing isn't for everyone, but it's for me." 
</P>
<P>
Reitman began boxing as a 13-year-old in Jersey City, N.J. He won the New 
England Golden Gloves championship during medical school at Boston University 
in 1971, then stopped boxing to pursue his medical career. 
</P>
<P>
Daughter Rebecca's fight for life in 1985 spurred Reitman's return to the ring. 
Rebecca, now fully recovered, had two vascular brain tumors removed during two 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"In my prayers," Reitman said, "I told God if my daughter could be OK, I'd box 
the biggest fighter I could find." 
</P>

He did just that, losing a split decision to 6-5, 315-pound Steven Elmore in 
the 1985 Sunshine State Games in Tampa.

Then when boxing trainer Tommy Torino became a patient of Reitman's in late 
1988, the doctor started to talk seriously about fighting professionally.

<P>
Torino is now his trainer and manager.

"The deal is, I box for as long as I can compete or until Tommy pulls the 
plug," Reitman said. "If he thinks I can't handle it anymore, it's over. 
Period."

Sometime just before the Berlin Wall was dismantled, I walked into a baseball 
card store a confident and capable consumer -- certain that the rules as I had 
always known them were somehow unalterable -- and left a shaken, half-broken, 
mostly broke man. 
</P>
<P>
The world had changed, and no one had bothered to tell me. 
</P>
<P>
OK, I knew some things were different. For instance, there is music now called 
hip hop. And though they don't sell box turtles anymore, they do market the 
teen-age mutant ninja model. It isn't like I'm not in tune with the pop 
culture. Most guys my age think Milli Vanilli is an ice cream flavor and not a 
pair of singing beauticians. 
</P>
<P>
But I didn't know and I still can't quite believe that a Don Mattingly rookie 
baseball card could cost $28. It was a birthday present for my nephew. Big 
spender that I am, as we waltzed into the store I told the kid to pick out any 
card he wanted. He picked out the Mattingly. When I spied the price tag, I 
said, gasping only slightly, "Gee, isn't that a very interesting Don Slaught 
card over there?" 
</P>
<P>
He didn't bite on that so-smooth sales pitch, so I ended up eating Mattingly, 
the 28 bucks breaking my personal high spent for a single baseball card by only 
$27.99. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I used to pay a nickel for five cards plus that slab of pink bubble 
gum that I, as the grandson of a dentist, was forbidden to eat. I could sniff 
it, though. 
</P>
<P>
I would spend every nickel I could get my hands on down at Minnie's, the local 
candy-toy store, collecting those cards as if they were gold. Now, it turns out 
they are. I had complete sets. I had doubles of every Dodger. My friends and I 
spent hours trading the cards, fondling them all the while. No one fondles 
baseball cards now. You put them in plastic, knowing that frayed edges hurt the 
resale value. 
</P>
<P>
We used to play a game, sort of like war, where we'd deal out the cards, and 
the card representing the best player would win. You probably used to flip 
them. But those were kids' games. Collecting these days is a grown-up affair, 
sort of. It's confusing because the card store I walked into Thursday is run by 
an 11-year-old entrepreneur named Robbie Davis. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bob Davis, his dad, who helps out at Robbie's First Base when 
Robbie is in school, they started last August with a card collection worth 
$8,500. Now, he says, their inventory is worth -- hold on to your Bill Ripken 
card, at $40 for the one with the interesting bat handle -- a cool $125,000. 
However you add it up, that's a lot of Don Mattinglys. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive card at Robbie's is Mickey Mantle's rookie card. That costs 
$2,000. When I was a kid, you couldn't put a price tag on a Mantle, for which 
you spent nickel after nickel in a vain search, only to have your little sister 
buy one with the one nickel your dad gave her. And then, even though she had 
never heard of the Mick, she wouldn't trade you the card for two Yogi Berras 
and a Whitey Ford. 
</P>
<P>
A rookie Nolan Ryan goes for $1,200. Jose Canseco will cost you $55. Bo Jackson 
$20. 
</P>
<P>
You buy cards on speculation. There was a well-dressed man who walked into the 
store and plunked down money, just as an owner would, for a Mark Langston and a 
Bret Saberhagen, saying he liked their futures. 
</P>
<P>
"If you buy a card of somebody you think is going to the Hall of Fame," Davis 
said, "you have a chance to make some money." 
</P>
<P>
The Jim Palmer rookie card, as an example, is priced at $175. 
</P>
<P>
It's no kid's game all right. Davis estimates that 60% of his customers are 
adults, which explains, in part, the price explosion as people find a way to 
recapture their youth and make a buck at the same time. Ah, nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
When I asked Davis how the cards have come to cost so much, he answered with a 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are your baseball cards?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
I told him my mom threw them out, by the drawer full, when I went to college. 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's mom threw their kids' cards out," he said. "That explains the 
prices." 
</P>
<P>
No one throws out coin collections or stamp collections. But, turn your back, 
and the baseball cards go in a Sandy Koufax minute. And we still celebrate 
Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
As the cards' value skyrocketed, there came a need for price guides. There's 
the annual guide, of course, and, lately, the monthly update. Even the monthly 
guide can't keep up with the market forces, though. 
</P>
<P>
And now there's even a video out, explaining card collecting as if it were a 
science instead of something you needed to go to business school to understand. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids know everything," Davis said. "They know the value of every card. 
They know who to buy and how much they're making." 
</P>
<P>
Warms your heart, doesn't it? Once upon a time, you wanted a baseball card for 
the romance of it. Now, it's the finance of it. 
</P>
<P>
Here's finance for you. The hottest card company is Upper Deck, which makes a 
designer card out of acrylic, instead of cardboard, and costs five times as 
much as your basic set of Topps. On the Upper Deck 1990 Ben McDonald card, 
there's no mention that he's a rookie, meaning the card, because of the error, 
suddenly is worth $110. That's not a misprint. That's the new age. You could 
look it up. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not all bad. Remember that Mattingly I bought back in the summer for 
$28? It's worth $55 now. As Ernie Banks would say today, let's buy two.
