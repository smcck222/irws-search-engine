ABEL WOLMAN; HELPED PERFECT WATER PURIFICATION TECHNIQUE

Abel Wolman, a Johns Hopkins University sanitary engineer who helped to perfect 
the use of chlorine to create safe drinking water for millions of people around 
the world, died at his home here Wednesday. He was 96. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy years ago, Wolman collaborated with the late chemist Linn H. Enslow to 
develop a method of purifying drinking water with precise amounts of chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jared L. Cohon, Johns Hopkins vice provost for research, remembered the 
revolutionary aspects of the concept: 
</P>
<P>
"Think about it. Take a substance which is otherwise toxic . . . and add it to 
water, and tell people to drink it. It's still the primary water treatment used 
today. It's in use throughout the world. That's a remarkable thing to say." 
</P>
<P>
The concept of chlorinating water was not new when the two men developed their 
formula in 1918 (it had been tried in Europe in the 1880s), but the technique 
had yet to be refined to take into account the bacterial content in a 
particular water source. 
</P>
<P>
Their formula specified how much chlorine should be mixed with a given source 
of water, taking into consideration the bacterial content, the acidity and 
other factors related to the water's desired taste and purity. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest of his life Wolman remained a consultant on water sanitation to 
local governments and to about 50 countries, including Egypt, Britain, India, 
Israel and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
He advised the U.S. Public Health Service, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the 
Atomic Energy Commission and the World Health Organization. 
</P>
<P>
He received the National Medal of Science from President Gerald R. Ford in 
1975. In 1976, he shared the Tyler Ecology Award, a $150,000 prize, with two 
other scientists. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, shortly after his 96th birthday, the Pan American Health 
Organization cited him for "extraordinary contributions to public health."

HANS H. KIRST, 74; SUCCESSFUL POST-WAR GERMAN NOVELIST

<TEXT>
<P>
Hans Hellmut Kirst, one of West Germany's most successful post-war novelists, 
died Thursday at the age of 74. 
</P>
<P>
Among his 46 books was the 1962 drama "Night of the Generals," which was made 
into a 1967 motion picture starring Peter O'Toole. 
</P>
<P>
Kirst's works, which were translated into 28 languages and sold more than 12 
million copies worldwide, focused on military life and modern historical 
events, such as the 1944 assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the East Prussian city of Osterode, Kirst left school in 1933 to become 
a career soldier with Hitler's army. He served through World War II and was 
imprisoned by U.S. occupation forces after the fall of Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
He began his writing career in the late 1940s and gained prominence with his 
"08-15" trilogy in the mid-1950s. "08-15" is a military designation for basic 
recruits, stemming from the name of a standard pistol issued to German troops 
during World War I.

 SUMMA'S PROJECT TO GET 'FRESH LOOK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Monica-based development company, known for its ability to win 
government approval for its projects, will attempt to resolve the controversies 
surrounding the $1-billion Playa Vista project south of Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Playa Vista, a massive planned community proposed for a 957-acre parcel owned 
by Summa Corp., has been mired in controversy over its density and threat to 
nearby wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
An official of Maguire Thomas Partners, which acquired an interest in Playa 
Vista for an undisclosed amount and will step in as managing general partner, 
said the firm will take a "fresh look" at the project to see how community 
concerns can be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose 6th District includes Playa 
Vista, won election in part because of her opposition to the project. Last 
August, she called for a 40% reduction in the amount of office space in the 
project, for expansion of the wetlands and for a new environmental impact 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the state Coastal Commission in 1986 approved plans allowing Summa 
to build up to 8,837 housing units, 5.9-million square feet of office and 
research space, 970,000 square feet of retail space, 2,400 hotel rooms and a 
40-acre marina with 700 to 900 boat slips.

GUATEMALA'S CRUEL SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even in Central America, where military men have never been overly concerned 
with the niceties of human rights, the Guatemalan army has a fearsome 
reputation. Its generals and colonels expound a fiercely protective doctrine of 
national security, which their soldiers enforce with cold-blooded efficiency. 
That is why most outside analysts agree that Guatemala, alone among the many 
nations fighting local insurgencies, was able to crush its guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
But that victory, achieved without assistance from the United States, produced, 
in addition to tens of thousands of deaths, some profound side effects. One of 
the more visible side effects was recently documented by Times correspondent 
Kenneth Freed, who visited several "model villages" built in Guatemala's 
hinterlands to resettle Indian peasants displaced by warfare. While government 
officials proudly display these villages as symbols of progress -- complete 
with running water, electricity and other modern amenities -- they are also 
plagued by underlying social tensions. Many of the residents cannot afford to 
pay for electricity. Males are forced to take part in civil-defense patrols 
organized by the military. Others are pressed into labor gangs, which are not 
paid for the work they do. Saddest of all, many refugees are so alienated and 
isolated in their new surroundings that drunkenness is common. As one resident 
told Freed, "Coming here was not our idea. The army told us we were going to do 
it. Life was hard before, but it was our life. Now it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Pondering Freed's graphic descriptions of the conditions in these villages, a 
reader in the United States might be reminded of the social problems on many 
Indian reservations in this country. In some important ways, the comparison is 
apt. Certainly the anti-guerrilla campaign in Guatemala had an undercurrent of 
racial warfare. Most of the war's victims were Indian, descendants of the 
ancient Maya. The victors were the Spanish-speaking Guatemalans of mixed 
ancestry who run the government and its institutions, including the army. And 
while some government officials claim the model villages are a solution to the 
social problems that plague Guatemala's Indian population, like illiteracy and 
poor health, the real reason they came into existence was to help the army wage 
its counterinsurgency campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has given only minimal aid to the Guatemalan military since 
the 1970s, when the generals then running that country refused to accept U.S. 
military assistance because the Carter Administration had the temerity to 
criticize their human-rights record. Given the harsh methods the Guatemalan 
army used to win its war, U.S. officials can be grateful that they have no 
blood on their hands. But for the same reason, there is probably little this 
country can do to rectify the conditions that exist in the model villages. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a civilian government in Guatemala City now, which technically has 
some authority over the military (although how much remains an open question). 
That government badly needs, and wants, U.S. economic assistance. The United 
States should provide whatever it can. But in doing so U.S. officials must make 
their disapproval of model villages clear, and do all they can to ensure that 
none of the aid this country gives Guatemala is used for such dubious 
experiments.

LITTERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have long been troubled by the litter and garbage that lines the city streets 
and highways of California. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, my husband and I drove across the southern United States. I was 
embarrassed as a California resident to note we found the highways and cities 
streets all across the country to be almost litter free. Even in depressed 
areas of large cities the streets were cleaner than our suburban areas. 
</P>
<P>
These cities also suffer, as we do, with a proliferation of fast-food 
restaurants, which I have found in walking my neighborhood streets, to be the 
single largest cause of the greatest amount of wayside trash. I'm sure if all 
of these towns, cities and states can practice a better means of eliminating 
litter, certainly California can also. 
</P>
<P>
Let us begin with each of us not littering with even a cigarette butt and 
insisting on the enforcement of litter laws by our law enforcement agencies. We 
insult ourselves by littering. This is the only world we have to live in, let's 
not bury ourselves in trash.

WARNINGS FROM SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill, the newest of Sacramento's independent 
experts on state finances, has declared that the Gann spending limit is a 
fiscal straitjacket for California state government. 
</P>
<P>
She also proposed Wednesday that the Legislature initiate a ballot proposition 
to repeal the 1979 voter initiative, Proposition 4, that set specific limits on 
how much state and local governments could spend with a provision that 
surpluses be returned to the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Hill told legislators that, primarily because of the Gann limit, there is a 
$1.6-billion gap between available tax revenues and program costs for the 
budget now under consideration by the Legislature for the next fiscal year. She 
said the limit prevents enough growth in state spending just to maintain the 
current level of services in state government or to keep pace with the state's 
economy. The limit tends to distort government decision-making, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Several good examples of such distortion are in Gov. George Deukmejian's 
proposed budget. In one, he proposed that $331 million of new tobacco-tax money 
approved by voters in passing Proposition 99 last fall be used to replace other 
state money that pays for health care for the poor. Proposition 99 specified 
that tobacco-tax income go for new or supplemental programs, not to supplant 
current spending. Hill joined those protesting the action and demanding that 
the governor restore the money for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Gail Greer Lyle, executive secretary of the Commission on 
State Finance, told a legislative committee that revenues will fall $1.4 
billion short of needs for the new budget year. A shortfall of roughly $1 
billion will occur in each year through 1994-95, the commission report said. 
After that, the commission believed that the revenue base would be sufficient 
to meet ongoing spending levels. That, of course, would not accommodate any new 
programs, such as additional gasoline taxes that desperately are needed to 
develop the state's transportation system. In the meantime, the state continues 
to resort to bond issues for many new programs in part because the bond money 
is exempt from the Gann limit. While no experts believe that the increase in 
debt financing has reached a danger point, Hill noted that it needs to be 
watched carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Gann itself is distorted by last November's Proposition 98, an initiative 
measure that guarantees roughly 40% of state revenues for public education. 
Proposition 98 also provides that when state revenues exceed the Gann limit, a 
portion of the surplus money go directly into school finance and not into 
rebates for taxpayers. Thus, much of the initial impetus for Gann -- the return 
of so-called excess revenues to the people -- has been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The limit has been exceeded once, in 1986-87, when about $1 billion was 
rebated. That turned out to be a major mistake. Revenues soared over the limit 
in part because of an unexpected windfall in capital-gains taxes paid by people 
who rushed to sell stocks before the new federal tax reform law went into 
effect with its increase in the federal tax on capital gains. In the following 
year, there was a tremendous drop-off in capital-gains taxes paid and the state 
ran $1 billion in the red because of the unexpected decline in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Repealing the Gann limit will not be easy, but having the support of 
independent experts like Hill helps. The legislative leadership, the governor 
and the California business community must work together to develop a reform 
measure that all can support -- the sort of unified support that will be needed 
to persuade the voters that retaining the Gann limit is pure folly.

<TEXT>
<P>
Mikhail Bakhtin was perhaps the greatest theorist of the novel in our century. 
His life, in a way, is as exemplary as his writings. Shunted off to remote 
areas of the Soviet Union by the minions of Stalinism for his unorthodox ideas, 
Bakhtin could not profit from rehabilitation when it came under Brezhnev, 
simply because he had never been accused of anything. A victim of faceless 
intolerance, his political nemesis was Stalin, but his literary symbol was 
Kafka. 
</P>
<P>
His case was and is not unique. I have thought a lot about Bakhtin while 
thinking about Salman Rushdie during these past few weeks. Rushdie's work 
perfectly fits the Bakhtinian contention that ours is an age of competitive 
languages. The novel is the privileged arena where language in conflict can 
meet, bringing together, in tension and dialogue, not only opposing characters, 
but also different historical ages, social levels, civilizations and other, 
dawning realities of human life. In the novel, realities that are normally 
separated can meet, establishing an encounter of dialogue, a meeting with the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
This is no gratuitous exercise. It reveals a number of things. The first is 
that, in dialogue, no one is absolutely right; neither speaker holds an 
absolute truth or has an absolute hold over history. Myself and the other, as 
well as the history that both of us are making, still are not. Both are 
unfinished and so can only continue to be. By its very nature, the novel 
indicates that we are becoming. There is no final solution. There is no last 
word. 
</P>
<P>
This is what Milan Kundera means when he proposes that the novel is a constant 
redefinition of men and women as problems, never as sealed, concluded truths. 
But this is precisely what the ayatollahs of this world cannot suffer. For the 
ayatollahs, reality is dogmatically defined, once and for all, in a sacred 
text. But a sacred text is, by definition, a completed and exclusive text. You 
can add nothing to it. It does not converse with anyone. It is its own 
loudspeaker. It offers perfect refuge for the insecure, who then, having the 
protection of a dogmatic text over their heads, proceed to excommunicate those 
whose security lies in search for the truth. I remember Luis Bunuel often 
saying: "I would give my life for a man who is looking for the truth. But I 
would gladly kill a man who thinks that he has found the truth." 
</P>
<P>
This Bunuelian, surrealist sally is now being dramatically acted out in 
reverse. An author who is looking for the truth has been condemned to death by 
a priestly hierarchy whose deep insecurity is disguised by its pretension to 
holding the truth. 
</P>
<P>
The ayatollahs, nevertheless, have done a great service to literature, if not 
to Islam. They have debased and caricatured their own faith. But they have 
shifted the wandering attention of the world to the power of words, literature 
and the imagination, in ways totally unforeseen in their philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
For the intolerance of the ayatollahs not only sheds light on Salman Rushdie 
and his uses of the literary imagination. By making this imagination so 
dangerous that it deserves capital punishment, the sectarians have made people 
everywhere wonder what it is that literature can say that can be so powerful 
and, indeed, so dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
In a deservedly famous commentary, Philip Roth once distinguished between 
reactions to literature East and West. In totalitarian regimes, Roth said, 
everything matters and nothing goes. In the liberal democracies, nothing 
matters and everything goes. Suddenly, "The Satanic Verses" has pushed the 
"nothing goes" of intolerance right out into the public squares of democratic 
indifference. Suddenly, we all realize that everything matters, whether it goes 
or not. I do not believe that there is a single intelligent writer in Europe, 
or both Americas, or Africa, Asia or Down Under, who does not feel threatened 
by the possibilities so melodramatically opened by the ayatollahs' crusade 
against the freedom of the imagination. It can't happen here? You can bet your 
bottom dollar, peso, franc or pound that it can. 
</P>
<P>
Saying the same thing as Roth, Italo Calvino once wrote that when politics pays 
too much attention to literature, this is a bad sign, mostly for literature. 
But, he added, it is also a bad sign when politics doesn't want to hear the 
word literature mentioned. It means that the society has become afraid of any 
use of language that calls into question the certitudes it holds about itself. 
</P>
<P>
I have always conceived the novel (at least those I try to write) as a 
crossroads between the individual and the collective destinies of men and 
women. Both tentative, both unfinished, but both only sayable and minimally 
understandable if it is previously said and understood that, in fiction, truth 
is the search for truth, nothing is pre-established and knowledge is only what 
both of us -- reader and writer -- can imagine. 
</P>
<P>
There is no other way to freely and fruitfully explore the possibilities of our 
unfinished humanity. No other way to refuse the death of the past, making it 
present through memory. No other way of effectively giving life to the future, 
through the manifestation of our desire now. 
</P>
<P>
That these essential activities of the human spirit should be denied in the 
name of a blind yet omniscient, paralytical yet actively homicidal dogmatism is 
both a farce and a crime in itself. Salman Rushdie has done the true religious 
spirit a service by brilliantly imagining the tensions and complements that it 
establishes with the secular spirit. Humor, certainly, cannot be absent, since 
there is no contemporary language that can utter itself without a sense of the 
diversification of that same language. When we all understood everything, the 
epic was possible. But not fiction. The novel is born from the very fact that 
we do not understand one another any longer, because unitary, orthodox language 
has broken down. Quixote and Sancho, the Shandy brothers, Mr. and Mrs. Karenin: 
their novels are the comedy (or the drama) of their misunderstandings. Impose a 
unitary language and you kill the novel, but you also kill the society. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that everyone, after what has happened to Salman Rushdie and "The 
Satanic Verses," now understands this. Fiction is not a joke. It is but an 
expression of the cultural, personal and spiritual diversity of mankind. It 
cannot express that diversity if it only expresses one truth. It is a harbinger 
of a multipolar and multi-cultural world, where no single philosophy, no single 
belief, no single solution, can shunt aside the extreme wealth of mankind's 
cultural heritage. Our future depends on the enlarged freedom for the 
multiracial and the polycultural to express itself in a world of shifting, 
decaying and emerging power centers. 
</P>
<P>
Salman Rushdie has given form to a dilemma previously embodied, at diverse 
levels, in the West, by the novels of Bernanos, Mauriac and Camus, as well as 
by the films of Bergman, Fellini and Bunuel. And that is: Can we revolt back 
into the sacred? Can the religious mentality thrive outside religious dogma and 
hierarchy? These are questions essential to any idea of freedom. But the 
burdens of freedom, as Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor well knew, can be heavier 
than the chains of slavery. Long live my chains! exclaimed the Spanish patriots 
painted by Goya as their revolutionary liberators, the Napoleonic troops, mowed 
them down. And, in another direction, Georg Buchner proclaimed, in "Danton's 
Death," that since God no longer existed, mankind was now responsible for its 
own destiny and could not shift the blame anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The modern age, by liberating both the freedom for good and the freedom for 
evil, has placed upon us all the obligation to relativize both. Absolute good 
is called Pollyanna. Absolute evil is called Hitler. Relative good is called 
Simone Weil. Relative evil is called Sade. But the name of relativity is no 
longer virtue; it is value. Bad literature stays at the level of virtue: It 
pits good guys against bad guys. Good literature rises to the level of values 
in conflict with one another. This is what Salman Rushdie has done in all of 
his novels. 
</P>
<P>
That Rushdie has dramatized the conflict within Islam does not, however, exempt 
those of us, within the Judeo-Christian tradition from looking at our own 
sources of intolerance or at our own limits when our own symbols are set into 
conflicting motion. Artists have been silenced or "disappeared" in Latin 
America for not spouting the official truth of our local, mostly military, 
ayatollahs. Jean Luc Godard in Europe and Martin Scorsese in the United States 
have been attacked for seriously exploring in the Catholic faith what Rushdie 
is exploring in the Islamic faith -- that is, the combinations, the 
possibilities, the ghosts beyond the dogmas. A number of Jewish writers and 
comedians have poked fun at Judaism. What are the limits? What if a Jewish 
writer imagined Anne Frank as a young whore? What if a Catholic writer depicted 
Joseph as a jealous husband and the true betrayer of Christ? 
</P>
<P>
The alarming thing about Salman Rushdie's experience in intolerance is that it 
has revealed a seething alliance of commercial cowardice and fundamentalist 
intolerance surrounding the self-proclaimed island of rationality in any given 
society. Sects coexist with commercialism in Georgia and Guatemala. Let these 
two factors -- booksellers and publishers succumbing to terrorist threats, and 
zealots of all faiths discovering their sectarian brotherhood, be it Muslim, 
Christian or Jewish -- prevail, and the margins of freedom in our world will 
quickly and frighteningly shrink. 
</P>
<P>
The defense of Salman Rushdie is a defense of ourselves. It is a matter of 
pride to say that Rushdie has given us all a better reason to understand and 
protect the profession of letters at the highest level of creativity, 
imagination, intelligence and social responsibility.

IF 'SATANIC VERSES' IS GRAVE FOLLY, WRITERS MUST STAND AND IMMORTALIZE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN MAILER, Norman Mailer's most recent novel is Tough Guys Don't Dance 
(Random House, 1984). His commentary is taken from remarks prepared for 
delivery at a reading in New York on Wednesday of Salman Rushdie's work, 
sponsored by PEN, an international writers organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
By my limited comprehension of the Muslim religion, martyrdom is implicit in 
the faith. While all faiths sooner or later suggest that a true believer may 
have to be ready to die for the governing God, it is possible that the Muslims, 
of all religions, have always been the most dedicated to this stern test. 
</P>
<P>
Now it seems as if the spiritual corruption of the 20th Century has entered 
Islam's ranks as well. Any Muslim who succeeds in assassinating Salman Rushdie 
will be rewarded with the munificent sum of $5 million. This must be the 
largest hit contract in history. Islam, with all its mighty virtues and vices, 
equal of the least to the virtues and vices of every other major religion, has 
now introduced a novel element into the history of theology. It has added the 
logic of the Syndicate. One does not even have to belong to the Family to 
collect. One has only to be the hit man. Of course, the novelist in me insists 
on thinking how I would hate to be that hit man trying to collect that $5 
million. My Iranian paymaster might say, "We really cannot afford the sum. So 
many men lost in the war with Iraq. So many widows in need of alms. Tell you, 
kind killer, we think you might make a charitable contribution." 
</P>
<P>
This is but a novelist's speculation. That is what we are here for -- to 
speculate on human possibilities, to engage in those fantasies, cynicisms, 
satires, criticisms and explorations of human vanity, desire and courage that 
the blank walls of mighty corporations like to conceal from us. We are 
scribblers who try to explore what is left to look at in the interstices. 
Sometimes we make mistakes and injure innocent victims by our words. Sometimes 
we get lucky and make people with undue worldly power a bit uncomfortable for a 
short time. Usually, we spend our days injuring each other. We are, after all, 
a fragile resource, an endangered species. It is not untypical of the weak and 
endangered to chew each other up. But now the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has 
offered us an opportunity to regain our frail religion, which happens to be 
faith in the power of words and our willingness to suffer for them. He awakens 
us to the great rage we feel when our liberty to say what we wish, wise or 
foolish, kind or cruel, well-advised or ill-advised, is endangered. We discover 
that, yes, maybe we are willing to suffer for our idea. Maybe we are even 
willing, ultimately, to die for the idea that serious literature, in a world of 
dwindling certainties and choked-up ecologies, is the absolute we must defend. 
</P>
<P>
We have had the example of our largest corporate chain of booksellers in 
America, Waldenbooks, withdrawing "The Satanic Verses" from its bookshelves in 
order to secure the safety of its employees. Honest motive, doubtless. What is 
the use of being upwardly mobile in one's job in a massive corporate chain if 
security cannot be guaranteed? Get killed selling a book? Worse! One could get 
killed buying a book on how to improve oneself. Who would ever forgive the 
corporate chain? Of course, the option of assessing such danger calmly and 
informing employees and customers of the real odds was never engaged. 
</P>
<P>
Waldenbooks has something like a thousand outlets. In one working week from 
Monday to Saturday, if one terrorist succeeded in making one successful attack 
on one store, the odds that it would not be the store you worked in would be 
6,000 to 1 in your favor. If, as a customer, you spent half an hour in any one 
of these thousand stores, while it was in the course of being open for eight 
hours a day for six days, the odds in your favor would increase to 16 times 
6,000, or close to 100,000 to 1 on your side. I think such odds, if loudly 
promulgated, would have brought in as many prospective customers looking for 
the spice of a very small risk as would have been frightened away; for the 
employees, a 10% increase for temporary combat pay could have been instituted. 
What are contingency funds for? 
</P>
<P>
No, the answer to why Waldenbooks shut down "The Satanic Verses" is that it 
sells its product like soup cans. Only the homeless will ever endanger 
themselves over a can of soup. The largest purveyors of our books do not care 
about literature, whether serious, half-serious or failed. The purveyors see 
books as a commodity that rots into the lively spirit of money if the books 
stay too long on the shelf. So they hire clerks who tend to reflect their own 
mores. If Saul Bellow were to purchase one of his own novels in a chain where 
he did not normally shop, and paid for it with his own credit card, the odds 
that the clerk would recognize his name are about the same as the odds in 
Russian roulette -- one in six. Saul Bellow could walk in and out of a chain 
bookstore like a ghost. So could I. So could many another established writer 
who has been around 30 or 40 years. Tom Wolfe might be recognized, but then 
Tom, for this year anyway, is the fastest selling can of soup around. 
</P>
<P>
No surprise, therefore, if retail chains of American booksellers seem to have 
more respect for terrorists than for culture. How then can they not help to 
accelerate the latest mega-farce down the media road? 
</P>
<P>
A serious book that may or may not have been irresponsible in part, as most 
serious books are -- I cannot pretend to define the issue more closely since I, 
I fear, in company with the people issuing the death threats, have not yet read 
it -- yes, this serious yet possibly irresponsible contribution to serious 
literature, if it had been treated like other serious novels, which are almost 
always in part sacrilegious, blasphemous and secretly against the state, would, 
if it had encountered no formal outrage, have suffered the fate of other 
serious books. It would have received good, even hearteningly good, but still 
modest sales, it would have been discussed, and taken its small place on the 
shelf of serious works to be picked up again by a few devoted readers. Islam 
might have been injured by one part in 100,000. Now Islam is injured vastly 
more. Oceans of publicity have been given to the sacrilege. I say the act of 
attracting such attention was a willful chosen act by the Muslim leaders. The 
wise men of Iran know that the Western moral conscience is dulled, and no one 
in our Yuppie overlay of skillful surface floating above incalculable horrors 
such as drug wars and acute poverty is ready to die for any idea, other, 
conceivably, than receiving a big payoff in cash. So the Ayatollah may have 
wished to show the great length of the whip he can crack, the whip whose secret 
name is found in our bottomless fear of the bottomless pit of terrorism. If we 
believe in nothing, how can we bear to die? The wise men of Islam know that 
about us. 
</P>
<P>
One would have to respect the incisiveness of such understanding, if not for 
the fact that the wise men of Iran are also wholly indifferent to the fate of 
our literature and are savagely opposed to those freedoms of expression we wish 
to believe we hold dear. 
</P>
<P>
In this week of turmoil, we can now envision a fearful time in the future when 
fundamentalist groups in America, stealing their page from this international 
episode, will know how to apply the same methods to American writers and 
bookstores. If they ever succeed, it will be due to the fact that we never 
found an honest resistance to the terrorization of Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
I would suggest, therefore, that it is our duty to form ranks behind him, and 
our duty to state to the world that if he is ever assassinated, it will then 
become our obligation to stand in his place. If he is ever killed for a folly, 
we must be killed for the same folly, and we may indeed be, since we will then 
vow to do our best to open all literary meetings with a reading of the critical 
pages in "The Satanic Verses." A folly repeated is no longer a folly but a 
statement of intent. If what Salman Rushdie wrote was grave folly, then by 
killing him you will be obliging us to immortalize that same grave folly. For 
if one writer can be killed on a hit contract, and all concerned get away with 
it, then we may be better off being hit each of us, one by one, in future 
contracts, until our chiefs in the Western world may be finally aroused by the 
shocking spectacle of our willingness, even though we are selfish creative 
artists, to be nonetheless martyred in a cause. 
</P>
<P>
I will not, however, put my name on such a list alone. Like others, I have my 
family, my projects, my life to see through to its conclusion. Join with me, 
rather, 10 good American authors, male and female, or 20, or 100 in such a vow, 
and we are relatively safe. At least, we are safer to a considerable degree and 
can feel honorable to ourselves. We will have struck a real blow for freedom. 
For the wise men of Iran will know then that we possess our spiritual wisdom 
too. Certain acts count for more than others in the defense of freedom, and the 
willingness to embrace an idea at perilous cost to our inner calm may be at the 
center of what the Western world is all about. If we would ask bookstore clerks 
to stand and serve, then we must demand more than that of ourselves.

BANE PUSHES PROPOSAL FOR BIGGER BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors would increase from five members to 
nine under a constitutional amendment introduced by Assemblyman Tom Bane 
(D-Tarzana) -- and strongly opposed by the board's Republican majority. 
</P>
<P>
An apparent beneficiary of Bane's bill would be state Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Tarzana), a political ally, business associate and self-described protege. 
Robbins has declared his intention to seek a supervisorial seat in the San 
Fernando Valley, which he hopes will be created through a lawsuit filed by the 
U.S. Justice Department to force the supervisors to redraw district lines. 
</P>
<P>
Bane's proposal would limit the size of any supervisor's district to 1 million 
constituents. Each of the five supervisors in Los Angeles County -- the only 
jurisdiction that would be affected by the measure -- represents an average of 
1.68 million of the county's estimated 8.4 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want a supervisor having to represent more than 1 million people," 
Bane said Thursday. "They can't really adequately represent 1 million people 
and . . . there's no way they can get any competition when they have to run for 
reelection." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Thinking of Robbins 
</P>
<P>
Bane said he did not introduce the measure with Robbins' ambitions in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't talk to Alan Robbins about that," he said. "I don't care what Alan 
Robbins is doing. I mean, that's his business." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview, Robbins said Bane had not discussed the constitutional 
amendment with him before introducing it Jan. 26. The first time Bane referred 
to it was during a chance meeting on an airplane about 10 days ago, the senator 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He mentioned it briefly and said I should like it," Robbins recalled. "My 
presumption was that his reference was that it would provide for more direct 
Valley representation and smaller districts." 
</P>
<P>
Although he supports those goals, "I don't know what I would do in terms of 
voting for it," Robbins said. "I do not contemplate lobbying for it. I'm not 
sure exactly how it would work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Path Expected 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which was sent to the Assembly Local Government Committee, faces 
numerous hurdles. As a constitutional amendment, it requires a two-thirds vote 
of both the Assembly and the Senate. It would then be put on the ballot for a 
statewide vote. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is uncertain whether a state constitutional amendment could, in 
effect, amend a county's governing charter, said Victor Potter, deputy director 
for legislative affairs for the County Supervisors Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious obstacle will probably be the Los Angeles County supervisors. 
Board Chairman Deane Dana voiced objection to Bane's methods, as well as to the 
bill's goal. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in Los Angeles County should make this decision and not some voter 
in Eureka or Sacramento," he said. "When the voters here see we have an 
unmanageable situation that isn't working, that's their prerogative to make 
that decision." 
</P>
<P>
Even Supervisor Edmund D. Edelman, a Democrat who has long advocated expansion 
of the board as well as creation of an elected county executive position, said 
Thursday: "It would probably be better to submit it to a vote of the people of 
Los Angeles County directly than go this route." 
</P>
<P>
Voters have resoundingly defeated past ballot proposals to expand the board to 
seven members. Dana and fellow Republican supervisors Mike Antonovich and Peter 
F. Schabarum have resisted more recent overtures to add new districts. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasing the size of government works against the interests of working 
people," Antonovich said Thursday. "Spending more dollars for government 
employees at the expense of fire, police and social services is wrong and would 
be rejected by the voters." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I don't foresee the legislation going anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help From Field Deputies 
</P>
<P>
Dana rejected Bane's contention that supervisors cannot effectively represent 
more than 1 million constituents. He said supervisors' field deputies across 
the districts work closely with the cities, which provide basic municipal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he maintained, a nine-member board would be so unmanageable that 
it would "almost destroy government in Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
Bane's bill represents a second attack on the supervisorial districts. The 
Justice Department has maintained that the boundaries violate the federal 
Voting Rights Act by diluting the electoral strength of the county's growing 
Latino population. Its lawsuit is tentatively scheduled to go to trial Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins -- hoping that the supervisors may eventually be forced to create both 
a Latino-dominated district in central Los Angeles and a new Valley district -- 
will begin raising money for a would-be supervisorial district at his annual 
birthday fund-raiser March 9. 
</P>
<P>
Bane and Robbins, who share many Valley constituents and similar political 
styles, have long been close. Robbins recalled Thursday that he passed out 
leaflets as a 15-year-old in Bane's first Assembly campaign in 1958. Bane later 
advised Robbins to become a successful businessman before seeking political 
office -- something Robbins did as an attorney and real-estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Work Closely Together' 
</P>
<P>
"Tom is a good friend of mine and in many ways has been a mentor," Robbins 
said. "We work very closely together on district matters." 
</P>
<P>
The two veteran lawmakers also have a shared economic interest, which Robbins 
said he initiated. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Bane joined Robbins as an investor in limited partnership units in 
Club California of Westwood, which owns an apartment house. Bane, in his annual 
economic interests report filed with the state, lists the value of his 
investment as more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Robbins provided Bane with an unsecured personal loan at an interest 
rate of 10% "to cover assessments on partnership units," Bane reported. Robbins 
said the loan, between $12,000 and $15,000, was for taxes on the Club 
California investment. Bane reported in 1984 that he had repaid the loan. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point in my life, he had advised me to go out and make money, and I 
was in the process of doing that," Robbins said, adding that he had introduced 
Bane "to what I felt was a good investment." 
</P>

ANTI-EXPANSION PROTEST FORCES LOPEZ CANYON LANDFILL TO CLOSE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of northeast San Fernando Valley community groups forced Lopez 
Canyon Landfill to close for an hour Thursday when members blocked the path of 
nearly 20 garbage trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The 7 a.m. protest was the second in as many days of a Los Angeles Bureau of 
Sanitation proposal to double the size of the Lake View Terrace landfill and 
extend its life through 2005. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials learned of the first protest and closed the dump an hour 
early Wednesday to avoid a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Bolstered by Thursday's success, the residents vowed to return unannounced and 
maybe even stay a whole day. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday we took a bite, today we took a larger bite and tomorrow we can take 
an even larger one," said Jules S. Bagneris III, president of the Lake View 
Terrace Home Owners Assn. and a City Council candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"All we are saying is close down the dump," the protesters chanted as passing 
motorists cheered them. 
</P>
<P>
Landfill manager John De La Rosa did not ask the protesters to leave, saying he 
would "just watch them." However, garbage truck drivers, many of them just 
starting their morning rounds, were visibly irritated by the protest. 
</P>
<P>
At least five full garbage trucks were stopped outside the gates by the 
blockade Thursday and another 13 empty trucks were trapped inside before city 
sanitation officials began diverting the trucks to private landfills. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do this. I've got to get to work here," shouted one driver. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to put the trash somewhere," said Craig Bierlin, another driver who 
was waiting out the protest inside the landfill's gates. 
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Sanitation officials echoed Bierlin's reaction. They said they will 
run out of space at Lopez Canyon in six months to a year without the expansion. 
They added that private landfills cannot pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Becomes Our Problem' 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with trash is that everybody loves us when they see us picking it 
up, but the moment it's in our trucks, it becomes our problem," said Delwin A. 
Biagi, city sanitation director. "By blocking the gate at Lopez Canyon, the 
people who live near there are just forcing us to take it to other landfills, 
near where other people live." 
</P>
<P>
Delays caused by public protests or by an extended period for written comments 
on the expansion's environmental impact report only add urgency to the city's 
garbage crisis, Biagi said. Councilman Ernani Bernardi has requested a 30-day 
extension to the 90-day comment period, scheduled to end Tuesday. Biagi said 
the extension probably will be granted. 
</P>
<P>
Biagi said that once he learned of the protest, trucks were sent to private 
landfills: Sunshine Canyon in Sylmar, Bradley West in Sun Valley and Calabasas. 
Drivers trapped inside Thursday who had to start their routes late will be paid 
overtime for any extra hours, he said. He added that this will "end up costing 
the taxpayers of the city of Los Angeles money." 
</P>
<P>
Only one driver talked his way through the blockade, saying: "I live in the 
neighborhood. I'm with you. Now may I go pick up the trash?" 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the residents' opposition is their belief that the northeast Valley is 
shouldering more than its share of Los Angeles' waste. Lopez Canyon is the 
city's only public dump. It receives more than half of the almost 6,000 tons of 
household garbage discarded in the city every day. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion plans call for spending $18 million to double that capacity and add 
sewage sludge to the substances that the landfill will accept. The dump was 
once scheduled to close in 1992, but under the new proposal, it could remain 
open 13 years longer.

TV ACTOR PLEADS NO CONTEST OVER COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aco-star of the television series "Fame" pleaded no contest Thursday to drunken 
driving in connection with a December accident in which he crashed into a car 
head-on and injured a Studio City man and his two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plea agreement with prosecutors, Kenneth C. Swofford, 55, who plays the 
principal in the show, could be sentenced June 13 to a maximum of four years in 
state prison for the accident that left George Charouhas, 37, disabled with a 
spine injury, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Pargament. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Charouhas, 11, suffered skull fractures and his brother, Stephen, 6, 
suffered a broken leg, Pargament said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred about 7 p.m. Dec. 17 at Ventura Boulevard and Eureka Avenue 
in Studio City. According to police reports, Swofford swerved over the double 
yellow line and hit Charouhas' car head-on. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford, who suffered facial cuts, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.18%, 
Pargament said. The legal limit under California law is 0.10%. 
</P>
<P>
Swofford, of Woodland Hills, had no prior history of arrests or convictions, 
Pargament said. But he said he believed that a prison sentence is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got an absolutely clean record," the prosecutor said. "He's a solid, 
middle-class, pillar-of-the-community type. Nonetheless I have a young man in 
his late 30s who's now got a life-crippling ailment. I don't know if he'll ever 
recover from his spine injury. The level of injuries in this case lead me to 
believe that this ought to be a state prison sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Swofford would not comment on the case when reached by telephone Thursday at 
his home.

$27,000 RESTORATION GIFT; 
</P>
<P>
CHARRED O'MELVENY PARK GETS A HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Restoration efforts at fire-ravaged O'Melveny Park in Granada Hills were 
boosted Thursday by a $27,000 donation to rebuild fences and repair sprinkler 
systems destroyed in December's Porter Ranch brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Christopher, chairman of the law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers, 
presented the check to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley during a brief ceremony at 
the 714-acre park, known before the fire for its pristine vegetation, chaparral 
and grasslands. 
</P>
<P>
"We were particularly saddened that the fire damaged so much," Christopher 
said. "This park has a particular sentimental value to our firm." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the land was donated to the city in 1973 for park use by the law firm's 
late senior partner, John O'Melveny. The hilly park, which has more than 10 
miles of trails, has become a popular hiking area. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which destroyed or damaged 40 homes and burned 3,200 acres, charred 
the hillsides of O'Melveny Park, burning nearly all of the area's trees, shrubs 
and wildflowers, and causing more than $300,000 in damage to park equipment. 
</P>
<P>
An old red barn that the city had planned to renovate for use as a visitors 
center was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city Recreation and Parks Department has applied for $310,000 in 
state disaster funds to rebuild the barn and replace equipment, the law firm's 
donation has allowed the city to purchase a truck and equipment to immediately 
begin restoration work, said James Hadaway, department general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Parks officials decided in late December to allow the ashen hillsides to 
regenerate naturally and will not seed the park with ryegrass, which is not 
native to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Green vegetation already tinges some of the park's slopes. It will take up to 
three years for chaparral to grow back, officials said. Park rangers said that 
despite the charred trails, hikers have been visiting the park on weekends.

LAZERS BEAT SOCKERS IN DOUBLE OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS ELLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a night when goals were being given away like cheap door prizes at a company 
picnic, and no lead was safe, 23-year-old Felipe Hernandez received his baptism 
as a goalkeeper in the Major Indoor Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, for much of the night, his Sockers teammates weren't around to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Collins finally put an end to the highest-scoring game of the season 
Thursday when he scored at 1:36 of the second overtime to give the Los Angeles 
Lazers a 10-9 victory over the Sockers at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
As was the case for most of the night, the Sockers' defense was late getting to 
the ball, and Collins squeezed into the penalty box to put home the 
game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
The defense rested on other occasions, too. And offensive stars such as the 
Lazers' Hector Marinaro (three goals, four assists) and the Sockers' Branko 
Segota (one goal, four assists) and Waad Hirmez (three goals in his return for 
the Sockers) frolicked. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Sockers' Coach Ron Newman and Lazers' defender Fernando Clavijo 
engaged in a shoving match in front of the Sockers bench. Newman claimed 
afterward that Clavijo punched him while the two engaged in a clinch. Clavijo, 
a former Socker, said he did not hit Newman but pushed the coach away after 
Newman had spit in his face. The two players were separated by players from 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who had waited a long time to make his MISL debut, will remember it 
even longer, though it's likely none of the defenders who played in front of 
him will want to. 
</P>
<P>
Another who will try to forget is Lazers rookie goalkeeper Kris Peat, who blew 
two three-goal leads and a two-goal lead in the final 2 minutes of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers (17-13) seemed doomed in the final moments, but Kevin Crow, wearing 
a sixth-attacker jersey, took a pass from Segota and blasted a shot in from the 
right boards to tie the game with 2 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, it was a night of barrages. Clavijo scored on the Lazers' first 
shot and started a 3-0 run in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers came back to lead, 4-3, at halftime, but then the Lazers scored 
four consecutive goals to take a 7-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers rallied again, tying the game, 7-7, when Hirmez -- traded this week 
to the Sockers from the Lazers -- sandwiched a pair of goals around one by Rene 
Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
But with 4:23 left, Marinaro scored his third goal to put the Lazers back in 
front, 8-7. When Doug Neely scored an empty-net goal and made it 9-7 with 2:07 
left, a Lazer victory seemed secured. 
</P>
<P>
But Hirmez completed a hat trick, scoring with 1:33 left, and then Crow beat 
the buzzer with his drive to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
After Clavijo scored on the Lazers' first shot, Marinaro scored on their 
second, driving a 25-footer just under the crossbar to make it 2-0 3 minutes 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Newman had said before the game that he hoped Hernandez would get a chance to 
make a couple of saves or at least handle the ball early in the first quarter 
in order to get his feet wet. 
</P>
<P>
That scenario wiped out, the rookie goalkeeper had to try and find another way 
to get settled. He did that with a couple of nice saves over the next few 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But then Crow sent a back pass toward Hernandez, and the rookie goalkeeper 
misplayed it, allowing Marinaro to score again and make it 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Crow's pass could have been one-touched out of danger by Hernandez, who instead 
chose to wait for the ball to bounce off the backboard. While he waited, 
Marinaro snuck in and kicked the ball into an empty net. 
</P>
<P>
That left Hernandez with that empty feeling. But he was able to revive himself 
in the second quarter while the Sockers scored four unanswered goals to take to 
take a 4-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Segota started the uprising by digging a loose ball out of the corner and 
passing across to Cacho who was all alone in front. 
</P>
<P>
Cacho tapped the ball in for his ninth goal and 14th point of the season, both 
career highs. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers made it 3-2 with just over 5 minutes remaining when Chris Chueden 
took a pass from Gus Mokalis on a three-on-two break and beat Kris Peat with a 
shot into the upper-right corner of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Segota assisted on a goal by Steve Zungul that tied the game, then took it upon 
himself to put the Sockers in front. 
</P>
<P>
Dribbling the ball just outside the red line, Segota let loose a surprise 
45-footer that weaved through traffic, beat a diving Peat, and made the score, 
4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Victor Nogueira didn't accompany the Sockers to Los Angeles Thursday night, 
staying in San Diego to be with his wife, Pamela, who gave birth to a six-pound 
three-ounce baby girl (Casey Nicole) at 5 a.m. Thursday. It was the couple's 
second child. Nogueira, who had started nine consecutive games, is expected to 
be in goal tonight when the Sockers play host to the Dallas Sidekicks at 7:35. 
. . . Zoran Karic, who leads the Sockers with 24 goals, missed Thursday night's 
game against the Lazers because of a bruised right foot. Karic missed three 
games earlier this month because of the injury is expected to be back tonight.

3 TEAMS BAY TRYING FOR SEMIFINAL SPOTS IN CIF AND CITY BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three South Bay basketball teams will attempt to reach the last round of the 
playoffs tonight in semifinal games in the Southern Section and L.A. City 
Section tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Carson (16-7) faces top-seeded Manual Arts (23-0), ranked fifth in the nation 
by USA Today, in the L.A. City 4-A semifinals at 7:30 at the Sports Arena. The 
other semifinal, matching Crenshaw (19-2) and Fairfax (13-11), follows at 9:15. 
</P>
<P>
Carson advanced in the City with a 66-61 win over Dorsey on Wednesday. Guard 
Ray Bennett led the Colts with 23 points and center Vince Washington added 18. 
Manual Arts advanced with an 80-69 victory over Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern Section semifinals, fourth-seeded Morningside (23-4) meets 
surprising Corona del Mar (18-9) in a 3-A game at Inglewood High, while El 
Segundo (15-10) faces Whittier Christian (20-6) in a 2-AA game at Sonora High 
in La Habra. Both start at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar spoiled an all-South Bay matchup by upsetting top-seeded Rolling 
Hills, 69-63, Wednesday. The Sea Kings, third-place finishers in the Sea View 
League, favor physical, low-scoring games. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to play physical, that's fine, but they'll have to play with us," 
said Morningside Co-Coach Ron Randle, whose team advanced with a 75-72 win over 
Brea-Olinda. "We can mix it up with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Forwards Eddie Scott and Chris Vance and guard Kenny Jones head a balanced 
attack for the Monarchs, who have won 19 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo, led by senior forward Shawn Foster, goes against fourth-seeded 
Whittier Christian after bumping off top-seeded Cabrillo, 73-70, last week.

<P>
The Loyola Marymount University women's basketball team will close out the 
season this weekend at Gersten Pavilion against Santa Clara tonight and San 
Francisco on Saturday. Both games begin at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, enjoying their most successful season at 16-10, are in third place 
in the West Coast Athletic Conference, trailing St. Mary's and Gonzaga by two 
games at 8-4.

<P>
Santa Clara, 7-18 and 3-8, and USF, 6-18 and 2-9, are at the bottom of the 
eight-team WCAC. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions are coming off a stunning 65-59 upset of Gonzaga in Spokane, 
Gonzaga's first conference loss at home in three years. Lynn Flanagan leads a 
balanced Loyola attack at 11.3 points per game, followed by Kristen Bruich at 
10.6 and Tricia Gibson at 10.3. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara is led by guard Jennifer Lucas at 14.7 points, and forward Ann 
Corbett, who set a WCAC record last week with a 21-rebound game. USF features 
guard Alice Solis (13.7 average) and forward Joy Boyenga (12.3) ALAN DROOZ

RALLY FALLS SHORT AND LIONS NINE DROPS ONE, 7-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola Marymount's ninth-inning rally fell short Thursday and the Lions lost a 
non-conference baseball game to nationally-eighth-ranked Cal State Fullerton, 
7-6, at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton took a 7-4 lead into the ninth but Loyola scored twice and left the 
bases loaded against reliever Sam Colaruso, who struck out the final batter. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton scored single runs in the first, third, fourth, fifth and seventh 
innings and two in the second in compiling 15 hits. Loyola, which managed only 
four hits before the seventh, struck for three runs in the second and one in 
the fourth against winning pitcher Huck Flener, who improved to 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Clancy, who relieved starter Steve Surico, took the loss. The Lions fell 
to 3-8 while Fullerton improved to 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Rick Allen had two of Loyola's eight hits, including a 
run-scoring single in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>

State at 2 p.m. today.

REDONDO ASSISTANT NAMED HEAD GRID COACH AT SOUTH HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Morrow, offensive coordinator at Redondo High and a former standout 
quarterback in the South Bay, has been named head football coach at South 
Torrance High, the school announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow succeeds Joe Austin, who stepped down after last season to enter 
business with his brother. Austin coached the Spartans to a 108-63-2 record in 
16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Griffith, assistant principal in charge of athletics at South, said Morrow 
had been the school's No. 1 coaching choice for several weeks but did not 
conclude the deal until there was a full-time teaching position for him. Morrow 
teaches chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased to have Don Morrow," Griffith said. "He came highly 
recommended from Redondo High, from the coach (Les Congelliere) there and from 
everybody who has played against him. He certainly was our top choice." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith said Morrow was chosen from a field of four or five candidates who had 
applied. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow gained a reputation at Redondo as an exceptional offensive coach with a 
flair for developing quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
He was an all-CIF quarterback for defunct Aviation High and played at El Camino 
College and Cal State Northridge. ROB FERNAS

OCEANSIDE CAN'T GET A GRIP, ENDS UP LOSING TO MADISON

Maybe if Oceanside High School hadn't treated the basketball as if it were a 
wet bar of soap, things would have gone better for the Pirates Thursday night 
at Madison. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if a couple of their 25 turnovers wouldn't have turned into 
fourth-quarter slam dunks for Madison's Monte Bohannon and Brad Eaddy, 
Oceanside would be preparing for Saturday's San Diego Section quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, thanks to a few breaks and a lot of guts, Madison slid past Oceanside, 
69-59, and will play host to San Pasqual Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The game wasn't 3 minutes old when Oceanside Coach Don Montamble pushed himself 
off the bench to call timeout. Madison (15-12) had roared off to a 9-2 lead, 
and Montamble was having nightmares of last season's playoffs, when his team 
fell behind Kearny, 8-0, and never came back. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not what happened. Oceanside (13-11) closed the gap to 17-14 and had 
Madison running scared. 
</P>
<P>
But then there were the Oceanside turnovers. Guards threw the ball away. 
Forwards turned perfect passes into out-of-bounds deflections. Once, two 
Oceanside players dove on a loose ball and were called for traveling. At least 
the Pirates were consistent: They had 13 turnovers in the first half and 12 in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big game, and the kids were nervous and wide-eyed," Montamble said. 
"We'd get a surge and make a run at Madison. . . . But then we'd turn the ball 
over, and then someone would get lost on defense and give Madison an easy 
layup." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Dunn, who led Oceanside with 17 points, had a simpler explanation: "We 
weren't using our heads tonight. We were throwing the ball around and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside was wounded once in each half by a Kirk Cumming three-point shot, and 
the Pirates were hurt plenty by Madison's Robby Robinson, who reached his 
average with 27 points. Monte Bohannon had 15 points and Cumming 14.

SOUTHWEST, DOWN 12 AT HALF, RALLIES PAST PATRICK HENRY

Trailing by 12 points at halftime, the Southwest High School boys' basketball 
team appeared headed to the off-season, where its next game wouldn't be until 
summer league. 
</P>
<P>
That may not be exactly what Southwest Coach Steve Selland thought. But summer 
league triggered his mind as he headed for the locker room with his team 
trailing Patrick Henry by 12 points in a second-round section Division I 
playoff game at Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, in the second half, let's play just like summer league basketball," 
Selland said. "With motion, pass and cut, pressure, running and gunning." 
</P>
<P>
Will Tate made three of three free throws in the final 23 seconds and had a key 
steal and layup as Southwest kept the season alive, rallying for a 57-55 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Southwest (21-7) will play at San Diego, a 62-51 winner over San 
Dieguito. 
</P>
<P>
With Tate (20 points) applying pressure on the full-court man press, Southwest 
outscored Patrick Henry, 21-11, in the final quarter, forcing seven turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"We got guys who get the ball with three guys guarding them and can't pass the 
ball to an open man," Patrick Henry Coach Fritz Ziegenfuss said. "Our 
ballhandling was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry (13-12) led, 44-36, after three quarters and 51-45 with 3:48 to 
play. Southwest then went on a 7-0 run to take its first lead, 52-51, with 46 
seconds left. Sean Swenson had five of those points, including a three-pointer 
that put the Raiders ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry's Bart Brandenburg then made two free throws with 39 seconds left 
for a 53-52 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Tate came right back, driving the baseline and drawing a foul from Terence 
Hamilton while attempting a reverse with 23 seconds. It was the fifth foul for 
Hamilton (13 points, 10 rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
Tate made both shots to put Southwest ahead, 54-53. The 6-foot senior then made 
the play of the game, slipping around Brandenburg in the back court, stealing 
the ball, driving for a layup and drawing a foul. There were only 11 seconds 
left when he made the free throw that clinched the game for Southwest.

MEEK, SAN PASQUAL UPSET SECOND-SEEDED EL CAMINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erik Meek topped all scorers with 23 points to lead San Pasqual (13-11) to a 
66-59 upset of second-seeded El Camino (20-6) Thursday night at El Camino in 
the boys' section Division II basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt real confident because we beat them in league once," San Pasqual Coach 
Tom Buck said. "It was the greatest game we've played by far." 
</P>
<P>
Meek also grabbed 24 rebounds and had seven blocks. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino, led by Travis Gilley with 21 points, sunk itself in the second 
quarter, converting just two of 16 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Banner scored 14 for San Pasqual, which will play Madison in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
In other boys' games: 
</P>
<P>
Division I second round 
</P>
<P>
Poway 89, Hilltop 46 -- Adam Jones made 13 of 16 field goals to lead host and 
top-seeded Poway with 27 points. Gabby Awbrey added 20 points and had eight 
rebounds for the Titans (20-4), who shot 39 of 70 (55%) from the field. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
San Diego 62, San Dieguito 51 -- Clark James scored a game-high 28 and had 15

took command. Matt de la Pena led San Dieguito with 27. 
</P>
<P>
Division II second round 
</P>
<P>
Crawford 54, Mission Bay 52 -- Chris Johnson, a 6-foot-2 senior, came out of a 
scramble with the ball and made a five-foot hook shot at the buzzer to give 
eighth-seeded Crawford (17-8) the victory and the right to play top-seeded 
Torrey Pines in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first playoff game at Crawford in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson finished with a game-high 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay's Brian Sorenson had made a 25-foot three-pointer to tie the game, 
52-52, with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines 71, Escondido 50 -- The Falcons, top-ranked by both the Times' and 
in the playoff draw, were trailing, 27-16, with 4:16 left in the second quarter 
when Torrey Pines Coach John Farrell called a timeout and changed personnel.

Flanagan (19) led the Falcons. Chris Heintschel (16) and Brooks Barnhard (14)

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: CANAL RESEARCHER LOOKING FOR A LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA VANDERPOOL GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My wife's ancestor, William James Rose, supposedly worked on the 
barges plying the Erie Canal in the 1870s or '80s. The family lived near 
Buffalo, N.Y. Are there historical and/or genealogical sources about people who 
worked on the Erie Canal? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Search in the miscellaneous federal papers of the Interstate Commerce 
Commission in Industrial and Social Branch (Record Group 134) at the National 
Archives -- in Washington and Bayonne, N.J. Explore your local public and 
university libraries for references under the topic of "American Canals" and 
"transportation -- canals" for possible leads. 
</P>
<P>
The Canal Museum, Weighlock Building, Erie Boulevard East, Syracuse, N.Y. 
13202, has a guide to its canal holdings, which relate to canal building and 
travel in New York. However, you probably will have to hire a researcher there 
as few of its manuscripts are indexed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My ancestor, Andrew Jackson Weaver, is shown as a 12-year-old boy in the 
1850 Garrard County, Ky., census. He is listed as a boarder with Nathan Storm, 
and in the 1860 census he is shown as a farm hand with this same family. His 
marriage bond says he was born in Jessamine County, Ky. Are there any records 
what would show who his parents were and why he was boarded? 
</P>
<P>
A: Check Garrard County and Jessamine County, Ky., probate records, from about 
1838 to 1860. Evidently his parents died, and there should be guardian papers 
in one of these counties that would mention his guardian and names of his 
parents. Start with Garrard County records. The Storm family may be related; 
search the marriage records of both counties to see if a female (possibly an 
older sister or an aunt) Weaver married a Nathan Storm. Another possibility is 
that Nathan Storm is his mother's brother or his maternal grandfather. Some 
census records enumerate individuals as boarders, when in fact they were 
relatives. However, probate records should clarify this relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How can I obtain a World War I registration card request form? 
</P>
<P>
A: These forms are available from National Archives Branch, FARC, 1559 St. 
Joseph Ave., East Point, Ga. 30344. There are more than 24 million World War I 
Selective Service records on file at this center. In order to conduct research, 
it needs the full name of the person, the city and/or county at the time of 
registration and, for certain cities, a home street address or other specific 
location information (such as ward) is required. The cities for which more 
information is required are: 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Atlanta, Chicago, Indianapolis, 
Louisville, New Orleans, Baltimore, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Boston, 
Minneapolis, St. Paul, Seattle, Milwaukee, Kansas City, St. Louis, Cincinnati, 
Cleveland, Providence, R.I.; Jersey City and Newark, N.J.; Albany, Syracuse and 
Buffalo, N.Y.; and Luzerne County, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How can I find the name of the ship that brought my ancestors from Austria 
to this country in about 1887? 
</P>
<P>
A: Find the naturalization papers first. However, you can read the passenger 
lists of vessels arriving at New York (most likely port of entry) at the 
National Archives. These are not indexed for 1887, but rather are in 
chronological order and then alphabetically by name of the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Try the Hamburg Emigration Lists (1850-1934), which are somewhat indexed, and 
available through the Family History Library in Salt Lake City.

Did anyone notice Sigourney Weaver's hosiery the night of the Golden Globe 
Awards? We hope so, because Weaver made a special trip to the Fogal hoisery 
store in Beverly Hills the day before to get black fishnet thigh-highs to wear 
with her gown. Joan Wills, co-owner of the store, tells us the stockings are 
worn without garters: "They have elastic and stay up on their own." We were 
particularly glad to hear that after Wills reminded us the actress' Globe gown 
had "a very high slit up the side."

After we once wrote about Rod Stewart selecting some trendy threads at Fred 
Segal on Melrose Avenue, we heard that a woman dropped by to buy for her 
husband everything on the rock star's list. So, dear lady, this detailed update 
is for you, but please keep in mind these clothes are meant for working. 
According to menswear manager George Grimball, Stewart's latest purchases are 
for his South American concert tour. His suitcases will now hold: one pair of 
1940s-style (baggy around the hips, narrow at the ankles, small cuff), 
cream-colored rayon slacks by Joe Da Hun; a brick-colored Go-Silk shirt and 
matching pants to be worn with a 1930s-style Art Deco tie in black and orange 
by Format; two oversize cream crinkle-rayon shirts with long sleeves and knit 
collars by L'Equipe; one butterscotch Go-Silk shirt with short sleeves, knit 
collars and knit cuffs; one teal Go-Silk shirt and a teal, cream and black 
Format tie, both to be worn with the above-mentioned cream rayon slacks; one A. 
Goldstein brown lizard belt with sterling silver buckle and loop to be worn 
with all of the above. Dear lady, we hope this helps. And please say "hello" to 
your husband for us.

Fred Hayman, who recently renamed his landmark Giorgio store for himself, has 
just been given another name. He is now fashion coordinator for the 61st Annual 
Academy Awards presentation. "He'll be responsible for coordinating designer 
gowns and accessories to be worn by key nominees and presenters that evening," 
according to store vice president Katy Sweet. News that Hayman would be 
offering the loan of European and American designer gowns went out last Friday, 
Sweet tells Listen. Geena Davis and Anne Archer have already been in to make 
their selections. Davis selected a Bob Mackie gown and Archer has opted for a 
design by Bernard Perris.

Revealing Costumer

Robert Turturice, costume designing kingpin, is ready to spill the beans about 
the perils of his profession. He's lived through dressing Cybill Shepherd and 
Bruce Willis for "Moonlighting," Dudley Moore for "Like Father, Like Son," 
Michael Keaton for "Clean and Sober," even little Pee Wee Herman for "Big Top 
Pee Wee." And he'll show and tell how, at a daylong UCLA seminar March 4. He'll 
go a few steps further and discuss the dishy details of what it's like to dress 
elephants and other circus animals for their roles in feature films. And you 
think you've got problems.

Light in the Tennies?

The immaculate athletic shoes of Hollywood actors have become a preoccupation, 
ever since Listen spied Timothy Busfield of "thirtysomething" in his perfectly 
white high tops. He was wearing them while ordering herb tea to go from a 
Beverly Hills restaurant. Ally Sheedy's white tennies were good as new too, the 
day Listen spied her in a downtown elevator. And Rosanna Arquette's white, 
Olive Oyl oxfords, shoes originally intended for serious walking, were pristine 
the day she put them on for a trip to a Venice studio. It begs for a follow-up 
report: Where do these people work out?

CASE OF AN IMPOSTOR DOCTOR PROVIDES RX FOR SUSPENSE

A Paper Mask by John Collee (Arbor House: $16.95; 232 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Drive with particular care next time you're in Gloucestershire, because the 
emergency room at Bristol Hospital could be even riskier than the M-5 
roundabouts at rush hour. Just plausible enough to keep skepticism at bay; 
succinct and compelling, "A Paper Mask" is the first-person account of a glib 
young orderly who manages to impersonate a doctor long enough to do 
considerable damage. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Harris is a middle-class drifter looking for a short-cut to success. As 
he says early in the narrative, "I had grown up with the burden of a promising 
childhood," but long before the novel begins, he'd dropped that burden to work 
at a succession of odd jobs; watching his contemporaries outstrip him, 
realizing that he could never catch up without going back to square one and 
starting over. Unwilling to take that arduous step at the age of 27, Harris 
settles for an orderly's pittance and amuses himself by trying to outguess the 
doctors. He's contemptuous of most of them, but one young resident earns his 
reluctant admiration. Simon Hennessey is less arrogant than his colleagues; 
confident, relaxed, witty and casually friendly to Harris, who fantasizes that 
he could be in Hennessey's position if "things had gone differently." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Excellent Credentials 
</P>
<P>
One foggy autumn day, Hennessey is killed in a motorcycle accident and Harris 
is given the sad job of collecting the young doctor's few possessions. There's 
not much -- clothes, textbooks, stethoscope, school and family photos, 
diplomas, his medical license and a couple of envelopes that Harris 
unhesitatingly opens. One is an invitation to Dr. Hennessey to interview at a 
Bristol Hospital; the other is Hennessey's unmailed reply canceling the 
appointment because he has decided to take a short sabbatical from medicine to 
act in a play. A copy of Hennessey's impressive resume is conveniently included 
among these personal effects. 
</P>
<P>
In that instant, Matthew Harris decides to "become" Simon Hennessey. He writes 
to say he will come for the interview early in January, correctly assuming that 
the officials of the Bristol hospital will not have been reading the London 
obits. By the time he appears before the committee, he has memorized 
Hennessey's C.V. Though his answers to their cursory medical questions are 
hesitant, the excellent credentials assuage their doubts and the examiners hire 
him as attending emergency room physician without checking references any 
further. They haven't exactly been inundated with applicants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closely Watched 
</P>
<P>
Telling his one friend at the London hospital that he's taken a job on a yacht 
bound for the Caribbean, Harris spends his last month in London absorbing all 
the medical information he can, diligently studying Hennessey's textbooks. For 
the first time in his disordered life, he has a goal. He gives away his only 
valuable possession, a gold cigarette case with his real name engraved inside, 
discarding everything else that might identify him as Harris, keeping only his 
passport, birth certificate and driver's license. As soon as he arrives at his 
assigned quarters in Bristol, he tapes these incriminating documents to the 
wall behind an armoire, hidden even from himself, and takes up his new life. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the Bristol emergency room is staffed with conscientious and 
competent personnel. Harris quickly ingratiates himself with the most capable 
of the nurses, who is delighted to be so appreciated. One way and another, 
absolute disaster is temporarily averted, though there are some terrifyingly 
close calls. Aloof and evasive, Harris reveals little about himself even after 
he and the nurse become lovers. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the best of luck, an emergency room will eventually live up to 
its definition, and one day the impostor makes the inevitable fatal error. 
There is an inquest and though Harris is technically absolved, he's watched 
closely from that point on. The romance with the nurse cools, and he can no 
longer depend upon her to cover his mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, Harris discovers that he has not eradicated his past quite as 
thoroughly as he had thought. Desperation leads to attempted murder, and when 
that fails, to murder itself. Superbly paced, the story mounts to a riveting 
climax guaranteed to make all but the most reckless readers vow to insist upon 
a second opinion, no matter what.

threat against author Salman Rushdie saying: "The Koran makes it clear: If 
someone defames the prophet, then he must die." Stevens, who became a strict 
Moslem and changed his name to Yusuf Islam in 1977, also called on Rushdie to 
stop publication of "The Satanic Verses" and to consider buying back copies of 
it. "Under Islam, if a man has done someone ill, he must make amends," Stevens 
told a meeting of Moslem students in Surrey, southern England on Wednesday. "He 
must ask his publishers to get back his books, and if necessary he must spend 
every penny he has to get them all." Stevens' Top 10 hits have included the 
1971 release "Peace Train." SHAUNA SNOW

The Grateful Dead has canceled a series of March concerts in Oakland because 
citizens complained that fans of the rock band would despoil their neighborhood 
and use their yards as restrooms. "The Grateful Dead does not want to be 
perceived as coming in and ruining the neighborhood," concert producer Bob 
Barsotti said after an emotional meeting Wednesday with Oakland Convention 
Center directors. "Until we can come up with some solution, I don't want to 
bring these concerts here." About two dozen convention center neighbors 
applauded his statements. Police issued 370 citations and made 28 arrests 
during three Grateful Dead concerts at the convention center two weeks ago. 
"The sex acts, urination, defecation, drug use -- it's unreal," neighborhood 
leader Elaine Schiano said. SHAUNA SNOW

A leader in the white supremacist movement hopes to host a two-day "White 
Power" rock festival on private land in Northern California next month, 
according to United Press International. Flyers that have turned up in some San 
Francisco Bay Area communities recently said the festival, billed as an "Aryan 
Woodstock," will feature at least four "skinhead" rock groups, with firearms 
among the door prizes. "It's simply going to be a gathering of like-minded 
people for music, relaxation and fun," said Tom Metzger, a former Ku Klux 
Klansman and founder of White Aryan Resistance. A message on the answering 
machine at Metzger's Fallbrook, Calif., organization said the festival would be 
the "first in a series of concert-rallies that will take place around the 
world." "This is a whites-only gathering," the taped message warned. "All you 
race mixers, stay home." The event supposedly will be on a private farm near 
Vallejo, although details were sketchy. Richard Hirschhaut, director of the 
local Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which studies white supremacists 
and other hate groups, said his group and others opposed to the neo-Nazis would 
hold a counter-demonstration near the proposed festival. SHAUNA SNOW

America's teen-queen Debbie Gibson looks as if she is about to be queen of the 
Billboard pop album chart. Her "Electric Youth" (No. 3) looks like the next No. 
1 album, once Bobby Brown's "Don't Be Cruel" -- on top for six weeks -- finally 
slips. Soul-singing newcomer, Karyn White, is headed for the Top 10. Her album, 
"Karyn White," is No. 20 and could make it to the elite circle with a boost 
from her fast-rising "Superwoman" single. Tone Loc's racy rap album, "Loc-ed 
After Dark," is red-hot -- to No. 17 in just three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
* Rod Stewart's million-selling "Out of Order" album isn't through yet. After 
more than 10 months on the pop album chart, it's on the rise again, thanks hit 
single, "My Heart Can't Tell You No."

'BERT RIGBY' A MUSICAL MISFIRE, DESPITE AFFABLE STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watching "Bert Rigby, You're a Fool" (citywide) you can understand how its 
English star, Robert Lindsay, was such a sensation on stage in the revival of 
the 50-year-old British musical, "Me and My Girl" -- and how Carl Reiner could 
get sufficiently carried away when seeing him perform to write and direct this 
misfired movie especially for him. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay is an affable, old-fashioned song-and-dance man but lacks charisma on 
screen. (Mary Martin and Ethel Merman had the same problem.) Not that he gets 
much help from Reiner, who encourages him to strive to please so endlessly that 
he becomes tiresome and bland. Lindsay's repeated homages to Fred Astaire and 
Gene Kelly end up underlining the inimitableness of the originals. (His Chaplin 
and Keaton are far crisper.) "Bert Rigby, You're a Fool" overdoses on 
nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
You know that you're in vintage musical comedy fantasy land when Rigby, a naive 
North of England coal miner dreaming of music hall stardom, emerges at the end 
of the day from the colliery performing "The Continental" and his fellow miners 
don't think he's out of his mind. Chance and a labor strike take him to 
Hollywood to do a Keaton routine for a jogging shoe commercial (easily the best 
thing in the film), but he's soon met with a struggle for survival rather than 
the promised fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
At this point the innocuous slides into the tedious, especially when Bert 
encounters Anne Bancroft, the least likely woman ever to have been a dancer in 
"Royal Wedding" and "Silk Stockings." Bancroft seems to be giving us her 
impression of Marilyn Monroe, had Monroe lived to a sexually predatory middle 
age, married a crass studio mogul (the late Jackie Gayle) and somehow acquired 
Kay Francis' well-known problem in pronouncing r. The total effect is simply 
appalling. More on target are Corbin Bernsen with his relaxed portrayal of an 
amiably caddish big star to whom Bert teaches a North of England accent and 
Robbie Coltrane as Bert's shamelessly ruthless English manager. Cathryn 
Bradshaw is Rigby's pert childhood sweetheart, wondering when he'll ever return 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Most everyone professes a longing for the return of the musical, but "Bert 
Rigby, You're a Fool" (rated R for crude language, much of it needless) and the 
more vital "Tap," both of which should have been set no later than the '50s, 
reveal how badly the form needs to be brought up to date. KEVIN THOMAS

VIOLIST CYNTHIA PHELPS IN PRO MUSICIS RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is always satisfying to attend a well-planned program delivered with 
technical accuracy, emotional feeling and precision of ensemble. Listeners 
heard all of these qualities at the County Museum of Art Wednesday evening as 
violist Cynthia Phelps and pianist Kirsten Taylor presented the latest recital 
in the Pro Musicis series. 
</P>
<P>
Hindemith's unaccompanied Sonata, Opus 25, No. 1, testified convincingly to 
Phelps' fine control and wide range of expression. The Los Angeles-born 
musician, currently the Minnesota Orchestra's principal violist, produced a 
full, penetrating sound in all registers of her instrument; she contrasted that 
with spellbinding pianissimos. Exhibiting unshakable accuracy, the former 
student of Primrose and McInnes made the 1923 work a powerful, dramatic 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor joined Phelps in the other works on the program. The two provided a 
model of teamwork in a well-balanced, rhythmically secure and consummately 
polished reading of Brahms' Sonata in E-flat, Opus 120, No. 2. Both proved 
alert to subtle nuances and implied rubatos; both brought arching lyricism and 
probing expressivity to their playing. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere performance of Stephen Paulus' "Seven for the Flowers Near the 
River" preceded the Brahms. Conservative without being reactionary, episodic 
but logically constructed, the evocative work exhibits captivating rhythms and 
interesting counterpoint. The Atlanta Symphony's composer-in-residence, Paulus 
shows a sure understanding of the viola's expressive capacity during the many 
moments of rhapsodic lyricism, on which Phelps artfully capitalized. The work 
is less successful in the fast passages, which seem to spin around aimlessly, 
but these moments do not last very long. 
</P>
<P>
The pair opened the program with a crisp, clean, and for the most part 
historically accurate (the piano notwithstanding) account of Bach's Sonata in 
G, BWV 1027. Only a slight degree of rhythmic disunity occasionally detracted. 
Beethoven's relatively insubstantial Variations in E-flat (WoO 46), in a 
refined, elegant reading, followed.TERRY McQUILKIN

JAPANESE PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA OF LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE BURROUGHS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Japanese Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles traditionally offers theme 
programs. Thus, Wednesday night's annual Dorothy Chandler Pavilion appearance 
constituted a "Goodwill Concert between U.S.-Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Akira Kikukawa paired Japanese violinist Yoshio Unno and American 
cellist Nathaniel Rosen in Brahms' Double Concerto. The Violin Concerto No.1 
(1963) by Yuzo Toyama got a hearing, but no American music turned up. 
</P>
<P>
Inconsistency ruled the evening. The orchestra produced fine moments 
side-by-side with bizarre harmonic and ensemble contretemps. A slow, rather 
logy go at Liszt's "Les Preludes," for example, found the brass in firm fettle, 
winds capable and cellos united in pitch-true songfulness. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the high strings had agreed in intonation, the whole would still 
have fallen short of the sum of its parts. Staggered attacks prevailed, each 
section playing well enough with itself, but often in unbidden syncopation with 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
Unno's impressive pyrotechnics and warm lyricism carried Toyama's concerto. The 
work begins with a difficult extended solo which commanded rapt attention. 
Thereafter, the composer waffles wanly between Oriental and Occidental 
modalities, and his orchestral requirements (especially of rhythmic intricacy) 
eluded this group persistently. 
</P>
<P>
Unno and Rosen (he of the big, burnished tone) served up a rousing Brahms 
Double Concerto, reveling in its polyphony and sculpting all those echoing 
"anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better" phrases with eloquent urgency. Welcome 
orchestral accuracy materialized here, too, adding to the glow. 
</P>
<P>
To open, Kikukawa led a messy but heartfelt reading of Ravel's "Pavane pour une 
infante defunte," in memory of Emperor Hirohito.BRUCE BURROUGHS

Talk about support groups! Gloria DeHaven, an actress-singer whose credits 
stretch back to the golden days of MGM musicals, had enough encouragement 
during the opening of her new act at the Hollywood Roosevelt Cinegrill on 
Wednesday night to reassure a whole chorus line of performers. 
</P>
<P>
It started with an introduction by Lucille Ball -- who looked fit and 
vivacious, bubbling with the wit and good nature that have made her an 
entertainment legend. DeHaven then arrived on stage, buoyed by the enthusiastic 
applause of an audience that virtually sparkled with images of a legendary 
Hollywood past. 
</P>
<P>
A bit nervous, even in the face of such unquestioning adulation, DeHaven 
launched into a set of songs associated, for the most part, with Hollywood 
musicals of the '40s and '50s. She sang effectively on a couple of numbers from 
her first musical film, "Best Foot Forward" (in which Ball was the star) and 
finally began to relax when she dug into a medley of ballad standards. 
</P>
<P>
DeHaven's voice did not have the sound of a particularly serviceable 
instrument, and one suspects that she pushed it hard enough to have a problem 
with hoarseness after the performance. She is, however, a superb actress, and 
more than compensated for her musical deficiencies with a vivid talent for 
telling a story. 
</P>
<P>
DeHaven was at her best, in fact, during those moments -- her singing of "Who's 
Sorry Now" was a particularly good example -- in which she came through less as 
a personality and more as a person, sharply recalling the sights and the sounds 
of a fascinating era in show business history. 
</P>
<P>
The final, and perhaps most important element in DeHaven's support group was 
provided by the estimable William Roy, a pianist-singer-musical director and 
all-around helpmate whose accompaniments were a nightclub singer's dream of 
on-stage heaven. 
</P>
<P>
DeHaven continues at Cinegrill through Saturday night and returns Wednesday 
through March 4. DON HECKMAN

MOVABLE FEASTS: UNEVEN TAKE-OUT PALACE IN WEST HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.N. HALLIBURTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small cafe with quite a few selections, El Abasto has a checked floor so 
glossy you could set a Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth tango scene there. And, 
the fact is, it does have a handful of things that could make you get up and 
dance. But it's the blacks and whites of the menu that stay in my mind when I 
think of El Abasto, the little Argentine take-out palace in West Hollywood -- 
those that are wonderful dishes and those that I'd banish from my door. Named 
for famed tango musician Carlos Gardel's hangout in Buenos Aires, El Abasto is 
owned by the same people who run the more elaborate Argentine-Italian 
restaurant, Gardel's, on Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
As at Gardel's, the most fully realized offerings are the appetizers and the 
desserts. Lovely empanadas, the traditional hand-worked pastries with braided 
edges, come filled with a cumin-scented mixture of either chicken or beef with 
olives and chopped hard-boiled eggs. They're $1.50 apiece. The deep-fried 
calamari is another good way to begin and, even when re-heated (which it really 
needs to be), remains crisp and light. Grilled sweetbreads set on a bed of 
spinach fettuccine were notably tender and, for $4, could make a full and very 
cheap meal. Yellow, red and green roasted peppers, also $4, are the best way to 
eat your vegetables here. Grilled chicken wings are plainer than plain, even as 
a foil to the chimichurri herb sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The salads are the nadir of the menu. Too many use canned pimentos, artichoke 
hearts or hearts of palm which impart that unmistakable and awful citric-acid 
edge. The vegetable and the meatball soup (which is really the vegetable soup 
with a great big juicy meatball plopped into it) both have too much cooked 
green pepper for my taste. 
</P>
<P>
There are seven pasta selections: Canelones salsa blanca, handmade canelloni 
stuffed with beef, spinach and ricotta ($7) was particularly delightful and 
cloudlike. Noquis al tomate, the South American gnocci equivalent, come wrapped 
in a clean marinara sauce. Dumpy as can be, they are, charitably, a filling 
dish for a rainy day. 
</P>
<P>
The meat is, well, you won't think you got your takeout from the Palm. I would 
skip most of the chicken and beef: This is tough protein territory. Pollo con 
ajo tastes as if it were mainlined with garlic and, even for the garlic-lover, 
it's just one, long, uninteresting note. One dish, the parrillada, the "typical 
Argentine barbecue," is a more welcome parade of meats. The lively peppery 
sausage and the meaty, chewy, seared ribs are the best things on this $10.95 
platter (really for two, unless you're a black-belt carnivore). For the 
adventurous, there's a dark, fat blood sausage tucked in. French fries 
accompany many of the entrees, arriving home in a fairly soggy state but 
tantalizingly absorbing the fragrance and juice of the meats. 
</P>
<P>
El Abasto's sandwiches are simple, delicious and made on the crustiest breads. 
That yummy meatball (encountered first in the soup) and that peppery sausage 
(of parrillada fame) are both fine tucked between slices of bread. The 
prosciutto sandwich ($6), on a crunchy baguette, is also tasty but beware: 
Unless you like your prosciutto with butter or mayonnaise -- I don't -- let the 
staff know in advance. 
</P>
<P>
You could have a fine meal with the appetizers and desserts alone. In any case, 
do not miss the lush Argentine sweet, panqueques con dulce de leche. El Abasto 
makes the real thing: crepes bathed in caramelized milk. The very light, 
not-too-sweet flan is also a good choice. It comes flooded with pure caramel 
and fresh whipped cream. After that, it might not be a bad idea to put on 
"Tango Argentino" and dance off those South American calories. 
</P>
<P>
 El Abasto, 809 N. Palm Ave., West Hollywood. (213) 652-1251. Monday-Saturday, 
noon-9 p.m. Closed Sundays. No credit cards. Personal checks accepted. Street 
parking. Dinner for two, food only, $20-$43.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: BIT OF PRE-CASTRO CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I was 8 years old my parents took me to Cuba. This is what I remember: the 
people seemed very poor, but life for us was very luxurious. When I ordered ice 
cream out at the swimming pool, a waiter in a tight uniform with very silly 
sleeves brought it out in an enormous coconut shell. We visited a lot of rum 
factories. And on our last day in the hotel, a bomb went off in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
But at the new El Mocambo, 8338 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles, (213) 651-2113, the 
revolution never happened. The waiters waltz around in tight uniforms, and 
almost half the menu consists of designer drinks made of rum (and other 
intoxicants) that have names like "Bay of Pigs" and "Babaloo-Loo Loo." 
</P>
<P>
The menu is made up of dishes that will be familiar if you know the menu at Cha 
Cha Cha (chef Toribio Prado is consulting chef here) or at Cuban restaurants 
like Versailles. Of the dishes we tried, the corn chowder ($5) and tostones 
($4.50) were very good, as was the grilled chicken marinated in garlic, lime 
and rum ($10.50). The Americano Loco steak ($18) was pretty respectable too. 
Paella, on the other hand, was a disappointment -- especially at $25. 
</P>
<P>
Don't skip dessert. If you order the coconut sorbet, a waiter with silly 
sleeves will bring it out in a coconut shell. RUTH REICHL

DRIVEN TO OSCAR'S MELTING POT OF CUISINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a view from this parking lot: a sprawling sea of light, the Hollywood 
Freeway spilling into the Valley. Walk indoors and the entrance to Oscar's 
Restaurant is gleaming too, a triumphal alcove of brass and glass. 
</P>
<P>
Great, all great. The question is, would you or I drive all the way up here? 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily we probably wouldn't. Oscar's is the restaurant in the Registry 
Hotel in Universal City and must be all things to all palates, while we who 
live in L.A. can target a specific cuisine when we go out to eat. 
</P>
<P>
However, if it happened that we couldn't decide between Californian, 
Southwestern, East Asian or Continental, or if we wanted to dine near the 
Universal Amphitheatre, Oscar's would be a good bet. It does have some very 
good things, like a wonderful appetizer of shrimp fettuccine in a hot and sour 
cream sauce or a tortilla soup that is like a tiny bit of enchilada in a whole 
lot of gritty, mild brown enchilada sauce. 
</P>
<P>
When it's being a California place, its appetizers have the usual problem of 
bitter baby vegetables, particularly the eggplant. On the other hand, the 
California entrees are about the best. The roast duck is flavorful and its 
passion fruit sauce makes surprising sense. An excellent roast veal chop with 
cherry tomatoes and sweet sliced onions becomes a wacky salad in a dashing 
sauce that is more or less a whole-seed mustard vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
A number of entrees are Southwestern, whether they sound so from the menu 
description or not. You expect something Southwestern of grilled swordfish in 
orange tequila sauce, with its tortilla chips and three caviars, but the 
steamed salmon in rice paper is unexpectedly topped with creamy black bean 
sauce and cilantro. And the New York steak, sliced into little rounds Nouvelle 
Cuisine style, comes with a tortilla shell full of salsa and both white and 
black beans. When some of the black beans escape into the Cabernet sauce, the 
effect is of a particularly sophisticated carne asada. 
</P>
<P>
In short, there's a broad range here, from an appetizer of grilled chicken 
pieces rolled up in wilted romaine with no sauce, like a half-hearted 
compromise between Southeast Asian and Nouvelle, to an unimaginative but 
excellent entree of cold shellfish with an herb sauce and a mild, tomato 
cocktail sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts are things like a plate of fresh fruit arranged in pretty patterns on 
the plate in champagne sabayon sauce or a rather stiff box of delicious bitter 
chocolate filled with raspberry mousse. The best is the seemingly least 
promising, a crisp pastry shell with a couple of balls of white chocolate ice 
cream on a plate coated with what at first seems to be an afterthought of 
raspberry jelly, but the wonderful jelly is really the whole point. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of nice touches here. When you order fish, they give you a 
proper fish knife and fork. A lot of chocolate-dipped strawberries show up 
along with the check. And when you order an espresso, they bring you a 
full-sized coffee cup of it. If I wanted a fancy sit-down meal in the 
neighborhood of the Universal Studio Tour's white shark, this is where I'd go. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar's, Registry Hotel, 555 Universal Terrace Parkway, Universal City. (818) 
506-2500. Open for dinner Monday through Saturday. Full bar. Validated valet 
parking. All major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $62 to 
$101.

BILLBOARD EXHIBIT LEAVES VIEWERS COMPLETELY FLAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talk about missed opportunities! On hearing the title of the current exhibition 
at the Municipal Art Gallery in Barnsdall Park, "Inside Outdoor: The Art and 
Technology of Outdoor Advertising," the mind does a cartwheel. Billboards, you 
say? Burma Shave! The Coppertone kid being pants by her pup! The mechanized 
Camel Cigarettes billboard that blew smoke rings! Sunset Boulevard's corridor 
of glorious billboard excess that stretches from Crescent Heights to San 
Vicente! The entire history of 20th-Century America as seen from the wheel of a 
car! 
</P>
<P>
But alas, rather than the colorful stroll down memory lane that this unsung 
genre of folk art deserves, rather than shedding any light on the American 
psyche as reflected in its relationship with the open road, we're given a 
series of turgid and technical how-to photographs chronicling the creation of a 
modern billboard -- just in case we're interested in doing a billboard at home 
in our spare time. Touting itself as "an exhibition focusing on the 
contributions of the billboard artist to the Los Angeles culture and 
landscape," "Inside Outdoor" fails miserably on every score. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions and the Patrick Media Group, 
the show features as its centerpiece a billboard that will be completed over 
the course of the show, which continues through March 5. So, if you want to see 
someone actually painting a billboard, the show does offer that. It also offers 
a very spotty pictorial history of billboards drawn from archival photographs, 
documentation of three conceptualist billboards recently completed by L.A. 
artists, explanations of computer-generated billboards and other modern 
technologies, and a video montage of current billboards -- just in case you 
want to see how they look on TV as opposed to on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, the show leaves most questions unanswered. How, for instance, 
do billboards differ regionally? What things are taken into consideration in 
designing a billboard? How have they shaped the urban landscape? What makes 
them an effective way to sell a product? Have billboards had a golden age, and 
if so, when was it? The show fails to address any of these questions, nor does 
it mention painter James Rosenquist, Pop art or Photo Realism, all of which 
drew considerable inspiration from outdoor advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Horribly installed, the show combines vast stretches of empty space with 
monotonous sequences of tiny photographs and a few chunks of actual billboards. 
This exhibit looks boring, turns out, on close examination, to be boring, and 
communicates none of the wonderfully crass spectacle of the art form it seeks 
to illuminate.

CARS AS PAYMENT FOR SLAYING;

AFFIDAVIT OUTLINES MURDER-FOR-HIRE PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
A teacher's aide at an Escondido high school promised her cars to a pair of 
teen-agers in exchange for carrying out the Jan. 31 slaying of her estranged 
husband, according to a court affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
Roberta Pearce, an aide at Orange Glen High School, hired the 15-year-old boys 
to kill her husband, Robert (Wayne) Pearce, so she could reap life insurance 
money and would not lose her Valley Center home in a divorce, the document 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Pearce, 40, was attacked by two men wielding a knife and hatchet in the 
parking lot of the Cardiff apartment complex where he had lived after 
separating from his wife over the Thanksgiving holiday. Prosecutors say the 
knife matches a set later found in the Valley Center home. 
</P>
<P>
Roberta Pearce was arrested shortly after her house was searched, but police 
did not capture the two youths suspected of carrying out the killing until 
several days later. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit, filed by San Diego County Sheriff's Department detectives in 
support of a search warrant issued Feb. 3 for the couple's sprawling, 
tile-roofed house, provides the first detailed look at what is expected to be 
the prosecution's case against Pearce, 41. The document also offers a dramatic 
description of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
It outlines statements made to investigators by several teen-agers who either 
visited or lived at Pearce's house in the weeks before the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators served the warrant shortly after midnight and reported collecting 
17 items, among them two cars, hairs, fibers, fingerprints and bloodstained 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce's attorney, William Fletcher of Carlsbad, said he received the court 
document Wednesday, had been unable to review it, and declined comment. But he 
said the allegations are "hard to believe," given the reputation of Pearce 
among friends and faculty as a warm, caring person. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Out of Character' 
</P>
<P>
"You've got some kids making some allegations that, if true, are serious," 
Fletcher said. "But, on the other hand, by all appearances and by what her 
friends say, this would be something completely out of character for someone 
like this. Could someone change so dramatically in the matter of a few weeks?" 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit, however, lays out in detail a scenario that investigators 
believe led to the death of Wayne Pearce. In particular, it highlights 
allegations made by a 16-year-old girl who had moved into the Valley Center 
house after Pearce and her husband separated. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Detective Russ Oliver said in the affidavit that the girl, a former 
Orange Glen student who was befriended by Pearce, was willing to cooperate 
because she did not participate in "the actual crime" and wanted to "clear the 
incident and cooperate with authorities." 
</P>
<P>
The girl told detectives she heard Pearce and several youths, including the two 
15-year-old suspects, plot the slaying on at least five occasions at the house. 
</P>
<P>
According to the girl, Pearce wanted her husband dead so she could have money, 
keep the house and adopt the girl, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corvette as Payment 
</P>
<P>
One of the boys told the girl that Pearce had promised to give him the couple's 
orange Corvette as payment, and that the other youth would get another of the 
couple's cars, the court document said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two boys discussed using a gun, Pearce suggested it could be 
traced to her, the court document said. Later, the girl saw the pair take a 
silver-colored knife and a silver-colored hatchet from the kitchen drawer of 
the house, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
The girl also said Pearce gave one of the boys her husband's address and showed 
them photographs of him, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the boys planned to steal a car to drive to the Cardiff apartment 
complex, the affidavit said. A truck seen by a witness at the complex matched 
the description of a vehicle later identified as stolen. 
</P>
<P>
The girl awakened on the morning of the slaying at 7 a.m. and was told by 
Pearce that her husband was in the hospital, the court document said. In 
addition, she discovered the two 15-year-old suspects wearing only towels while 
their clothing was in the washing machine, the document said. 
</P>
<P>
As the wash cycle completed, the girl removed the clothing and found that it 
contained what appeared to be blood, the court document said. She put the 
clothing back in the machine, and it went through another wash cycle. She also 
helped Pearce scrub up blood that remained in the showers and bathroom, the 
affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the boys described the slaying to the girl, saying that they had waited 
outside the Cardiff apartment complex for Wayne Pearce, the affidavit said. 
When he appeared, the girl said, one of the youths engaged Pearce in a 
conversation and the other crept up from behind and stabbed him, according to 
the affidavit. He told the girl Pearce was stabbed about 25 times, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Both boys remained at the Valley Center home until about 5 p.m. on the day of 
the killing, she said, then were picked up by another youth, the court paper 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conversations Overheard 
</P>
<P>
The girl's boyfriend, an Orange Glen student, also told investigators that he 
overheard conversations between Pearce and the youths leading him to believe 
the woman wanted her husband killed. 
</P>
<P>
After investigators contacted him on the day of the slaying, the boyfriend 
called Pearce, who said she would have "a hard time sleeping that night knowing 
she was going to jail," the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
The court document also said investigators contacted Wayne Pearce's divorce 
attorney, who indicated that "a substantial amount" of life insurance was in 
effect on her client, with Roberta Pearce as the beneficiary. During the 
woman's arraignment, however, her attorney said the insurance policies had 
lapsed.

KING COMPROMISE WAS IN DOUBT UNTIL LAST MOMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The author of a compromise proposal that would keep the name of the Rev. Martin 
Luther King Jr. off the San Diego Convention Center and instead set aside part 
of the structure's bay-side terrace in King's honor said Thursday that, only at 
the last moment did he know he had enough votes for approval. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Penner, a member of the Board of Port Commissioners who represents Chula 
Vista, said it wasn't until Dan Larsen, a commissioner representing San Diego, 
"began to speak" in favor of the proposal at the end of a contentious meeting 
Tuesday on the renaming, that he realized his idea would survive by a vote of 4 
to 3. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea how the vote would go," said Penner, a Chula Vista 
ophthalmologist. "It was an amazing moment for me personally." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, he said: "I thought this was a good idea whose time hadn't come." 
</P>
<P>
Larsen's decision took everyone by surprise. He and the two other commissioners 
who represent San Diego on the seven-member board, Bill Rick and Louis 
Wolfsheimer, had told the San Diego City Council, which appointed them, that 
they would vote for the renaming, seemingly assuring approval because National 
City's commissioner was also committed to the name change. 
</P>
<P>
But a vote on the renaming never occurred, and Penner's "Avenue of Honors" 
proposal will now go to the City Council because of the votes of Penner, Larsen 
and the representatives of Imperial Beach and Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Penner said Thursday he had thought about some kind of compromise proposal for 
a few weeks. "I bounced concepts off people. I asked my sons about it, and they 
had mixed feelings. I asked my fiancee. . . . I was just getting more 
feedback." 
</P>
<P>
He settled on his Avenue of Honors idea, a method he said was aimed at avoiding 
community division and racial strife, only in the last week. He asked the Port 
District's attorney, Joe Patello, to "put it into proper words" as a legal 
resolution. He also talked individually with other commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked them not for a vote . . . but that I had this alternative and this 
might be one to think about," he said. "I had absolutely no idea if they'd go 
for it or not." 
</P>
<P>
Penner said he didn't lobby members of either the San Diego or Chula Vista city 
councils, but that he "ran into" some San Diego City Council members informally 
at various places, and that they asked him about the King issue. He couldn't 
remember which council members he talked to, but said he gave them a general 
outline of his concept. 
</P>
<P>
The night before the commission meeting, Penner said, he barely slept, as he 
alternated from believing deeply in his proposal, to having second thoughts, to 
more vacillation, and, finally, with hope it would win approval. 
</P>
<P>
He praised Larsen for "having the courage" to vote for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Penner said he doesn't know how he will vote if the San Diego City Council 
turns down his idea and reaffirms its decision to ask the Board of Port 
Commissioners to rename the center after King. "I'm not prepared to say what 
I'll do," Penner said.

 PROTEST TRIES TO CAST SHADOW OF A DOUBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a novel -- if short-lived -- way to protest a building. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Achter, a film maker who lives in Santa Monica, led a group of residents 
in erecting a sculpture to protest a condominium project proposed for 12th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-foot sculpture, made of scaffolding and a tarpaulin, re-created the 
amount of shadows and darkness that the condos will cast, Achter said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she wanted neighbors to realize how the three-story building would 
block their daylight so that they would fight the project. 
</P>
<P>
Achter can claim partial success. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest comment everyone made was, will it really be that big?" she said. 
"That was exactly the response we wanted to hear." 
</P>
<P>
But within minutes of finishing the sculpture last weekend in an alley behind 
the construction site, police arrived to tell Achter she had to take it down. 
</P>
<P>
Achter admits she had failed to obtain a permit for the sculpture. She managed 
to avoid taking it down, but finally removed it this week, cutting short her 
planned protest. 
</P>
<P>
The condo project has received unanimous approval from the city's Planning 
Commission and goes before the City Council for final approval on Tuesday.

'BABY MARCOS' GUARDIAN TIED TO CRIMINAL PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The paternal grandfather and legal guardian of "Baby Marcos" has a lengthy 
arrest record and has used at least six aliases over the years, an Immigration 
and Naturalization Service spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
INS spokesman Rudy Murillo said that Rene Herrera Perez, 37, of Tijuana, who 
was awarded custody of the U.S.-born child in January after an eight-month 
search for the boy's parents, has an arrest record going back to 1969. 
According to Murillo, Herrera has been arrested many times for illegal entry 
and is known to the INS as a member of the "Frequent Crosser Club." 
</P>
<P>
Baby Marcos, whose real name is Marcos Antonio-Herrera, was discovered in May 
in a car with two Mexican smugglers who were attempting to bring a group of 
Uruguayans illegally across the border. When his identity became known in 
January, he was handed over to his grandfather, who works as a tile setter in 
Tijuana. The adoption was approved by a Mexican social service agency. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's father was identified as Marcos Antonio Herrera Perez, 17, who is the 
elder Herrera's son. Both father and mother were identified as drug users by 
the INS. The younger Herrera was said to be an undocumented worker living in 
San Ysidro and the mother was said to live in Mexicali. 
</P>
<P>
Murillo said the INS had "suspicions" about the grandfather before he was 
awarded custody of the boy. However, it was not until he was arrested Monday in 
San Ysidro on charges of illegal entry that those suspicions were realized, 
Murillo said.

LAWNDALE REFERENDUM SOUGHT ON VOTER APPROVAL OF CITY'S GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale Planning Commission will ask the City Council to hold a citywide 
referendum in November on a much-debated ordinance that requires the city to 
submit its General Plan to a vote of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is expected at its March 16 meeting to decide whether to put 
the controversial law, known as Ordinance 82, on the Nov. 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinance 82 was adopted by the City Council in 1963 in response to a 
successful petition drive. It requires the city to seek voter approval for 
Lawndale's General Plan, a formal document that sets forth the city's 
development goals and development guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a vote in November and Ordinance 82 is approved, the General Plan 
could go before the voters in April, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was adopted in 1963, Ordinance 82 was never followed because the 
state attorney general's office in 1974 issued an opinion stating that the law 
was unconstitutional. Relying on that opinion, the City Council in 1976 adopted 
the city's first General Plan by a 4-1 vote. It did not go before the 
electorate. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Lawndale activists Steve Mino and Herman Weinstein have 
challenged the 1974 state ruling, saying that a legal opinion cannot overturn a 
law adopted by initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Mino and Weinstein urged city officials to seek a re-evaluation by the state. 
They were elated when, in December, state legal officials reversed themselves 
and issued a finding that the 1974 opinion was "erroneous." 
</P>
<P>
The December opinion, written by Deputy Atty. Gen. Rodney O. Lilyquist, has 
broad implications that could affect all development in Lawndale, according to 
City Atty. David J. Aleshire. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, we believe this issue must be resolved either through the courts 
or through the ballot box," Aleshire said in a 15-page analysis prepared for 
the Planning Commission's meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The new opinion raises a number of significant legal and practical questions, 
including whether voters today would agree with the thrust of the 1963 
petitions, Aleshire said. "It is unclear whether Ordinance 82, which was never 
voted upon (by the electorate), would reflect the political sentiments of 
Lawndale residents today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also at issue, Aleshire said, is whether Lawndale has a valid General Plan 
since it was not adopted by the electorate. State officials have declined to 
express an opinion on that, Aleshire said. 
</P>
<P>
In his memo to the commission, Aleshire argued that the four-year time limit 
for residents to challenge the plan has expired. "Applicable statutes of 
limitations bar any challenges to the 1976 General Plan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mino, in an interview Thursday, said he supports the Planning Commission's 
recommendation that Ordinance 82 be placed on the Nov. 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not oppose the plan itself, but believes residents should be 
able to vote on whether to adopt it. He said plan changes such as variances and 
zone exceptions are made too readily by the council, and should also be subject 
to a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and residents generally agree that, as Aleshire said, the 1976 
plan "is out-of-date and needs major revision." 
</P>
<P>
A series of hearings should be held to solicit public comment and help achieve 
community consensus on development goals, said Gary McDonald, chairman of the 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revised General Plan 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the outcome on Ordinance 82 -- whether or not the General Plan is 
subject to voter approval -- the city should proceed as rapidly as possible in 
updating the General Plan, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
If the council puts Ordinance 82 on the November ballot and voters ratify it, a 
revised General Plan could be ready for voter consideration in April, 1990, 
McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
It could cost as little as $5,000 to put Ordinance 82 on the Nov. 7 ballot, 
which also will list local school district candidates, he said. But if each 
resident is to be provided a copy of the voluminous General Plan, the city's 
costs could mount to as much as $200,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission Wednesday ducked the question of whether amendments to a future 
General Plan, or to the General Plan adopted in 1976, should go to voters. 
</P>
<P>
The recent state opinion said that Ordinance 82 does not contain a requirement 
for a citywide vote on plan amendments. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to cover amendments, Aleshire drafted a proposed ordinance that 
would require a vote of the electorate on "major" plan changes, which he 
defined as those that would affect more than five properties or a substantial 
part of any portion of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
But the Planning Commission voted 5-0 to reject the proposal. Now the City 
Council must decide whether plan amendments should be submitted to the 
electorate. This would be a cumbersome process that could drastically slow down 
development in Lawndale, Aleshire said.

SOME SAY ADULT VIDEO RENTALS AT A HERMOSA BEACH STORE ARE ANTI-FAMILY, DEVIL'S 
WORK. OTHERS CITE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF FREE EXPRESSION. OUTSIDE GROUPS 
HAVE JOINED THE BATTLE A LOCAL CHURCH BEGAN. IT ALL MAY END UP IN COURT. 
</P>

<P>
A clash of values has disrupted Hermosa Beach's gentle melding of youthful life 
styles and traditional families, sharply dividing residents over the rental of 
X-rated adult movies by a downtown video store. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has been cast in emotional terms at the last two City Council 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the adult video rentals portray their efforts as a crusade against 
pornography. Hermosa Beach resident Tom Allen warned council members that they 
could "choose whether you are pro-family" or "cater to a different interest," 
which he likened to the "devil crawling out from the sewer." 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the video rentals cite constitutional guarantees of free speech. 
Resident Mark Hoffman told council members: "It is really not your job to 
reinterpret that Constitution or to act as a censor for this community." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign against Hermosa Video has its roots in a local church, the Hope 
Chapel, whose members were urged last fall to become more active in political 
issues close to home. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the fusion of religion and politics at the local level is 
something they have not seen here before. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman June Williams, a church member, took up the issue, and 
conservative organizations from across the state and Arizona joined the 
adult-video battle in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Louis P. Sheldon, Sacramento lobbyist for the Traditional Values Coalition, was 
the speaker who urged Hope Chapel members to get involved with "what we call 
Christian civility -- civic involvement." 
</P>
<P>
"Pornography is progressive and it is addictive," Sheldon said in an interview 
Thursday. "It is destructive of family values. . . . We must take a stand." 
</P>
<P>
But Scott Gallagher, owner of Hermosa Video, defends his right to rent and sell 
the adult videos, which make up about 85 of the 1,000 tapes available at his 
store. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Gallagher said nearly all video stores in Southern California 
rent adult tapes because customers want them. 
</P>
<P>
"They are popular enough that in order for us to be a successful video store, 
we should be able to carry them," he said. "Legally, the city has no grounds 
for preventing us from having adult movies." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher describes the tapes as adult entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Williams takes a decidedly different view. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are talking about here is definitely pornography," Williams said. 
"There is no question about it." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said her goal is to keep more adult video stores out of downtown 
Hermosa Beach and its neighborhood shopping areas. If such stores must go 
somewhere in the city, they should be restricted to the main commercial strip 
along Pacific Coast Highway, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bar situation in our downtown area is bad enough without adding to the 
atmosphere with pornography," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Only Downgrades' 
</P>
<P>
"It's sleazy. It does nothing to upgrade an area. It only downgrades," Williams 
added. "The one video store is not my concern. The proliferation in that zone 
is my concern." 
</P>
<P>
Williams and other members of the City Council have asked city planners to 
study the possibility of outlawing all video stores in the city's C-1 and C-2 
commercial zones, which include Hermosa Avenue but not Pacific Coast Highway. 
That would effectively confine all video stores to the commercial strip along 
the highway, which already has two chain stores that stock X-rated videos and 
an adult bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously requested the study after City Atty. James P. Lough 
warned that it would be unconstitutional for the city to regulate the type of 
movies for sale or rent in a video store. The only exception would be a store 
whose predominant trade is in adult material, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on that advice, a divided City Council voted 3 to 2 last week to approve 
a conditional use permit for the Hermosa Video store. 
</P>
<P>
The permit imposes a number of restrictions on the store. No more than 20% of 
its tapes can be adult videos, no window signs can advertise their availability 
and no X- or R-rated film can be shown on the store's television monitor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accepts Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher, who also owns a larger video store in Manhattan Beach, accepts those 
restrictions and pointedly notes that he has always kept the adult videos in a 
separate area, out of the view of most customers. 
</P>
<P>
He objects to the campaign against his business, saying the opposition is 
simply exploiting a controversial issue. "I don't care to be compared to a 
pornography shop," Gallagher said. "People are not coming in here in raincoats. 
Respectable members of the Hermosa Beach community come in here to rent adult 
movies." 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 customers signed petitions in support of Gallagher's business, 
saying the store's method of handling adult videos is neither offensive nor 
distasteful. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think that an adult should be able to rent and watch an adult 
movie in the privacy of his or her own home," Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
He said not only men but also couples and single women rent adult movies. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp divisions in the community over the question were evident at a public 
hearing last week. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Hoffman told the council that Hermosa Beach already has other video 
stores that rent adult videos, "and to my knowledge there has not been a great 
public outcry to remove them. I don't think there has been a problem so far." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Williams then accused Hoffman of being "in favor of pornography." 
</P>
<P>
He replied: "Each individual has the right to rent or purchase any type of 
entertainment that (he or she) would like." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents produced petitions objecting to the sale or rental of adult videos on 
Hermosa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"This is hard-core pornography," said David Fordyce, a Culver City resident. 
"We're not talking about a little nudity. We are talking about serious sexual 
activity being portrayed in blatant detail." 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Decency Through Law Inc. of Phoenix, Ariz., and the Rutherford 
Institute, a Santa Ana-based conservative legal defense fund, urged council 
members to restrict video stores that rent adult videos. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said Hermosa Beach "might end up with a test case" if an outside 
organization files suit to force the city to restrict adult videos.

2 TEENS SHOT IN DRIVE-BY ATTACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Two South Bay teen-agers were wounded Thursday in separate drive-by shootings 
outside public schools. Authorities said gang members were suspected in the 
shootings in the normally peaceful areas of Inglewood and Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, a shotgun blast fired from a van struck a junior at 
Hillcrest High School in Inglewood as he walked to class with fellow students 
near Inglewood High School. The student, Joseph Thomas Hardges, 17, was in 
stable condition last night at Martin Luther King Jr. -- Drew Medical Center in 
Los Angeles with birdshot wounds in his upper body and face, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Slogans 
</P>
<P>
In the second incident, a gunman in a black Camaro, whose occupants yelled gang 
slogans and threw bottles at students, shot a ninth grader as he left an 
afternoon tutoring session at Fleming Junior High School in Lomita. Adam 
Mendoza, 16, was in stable condition at county Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, 
where he was to undergo surgery late Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had not yet determined whether the victims were involved in 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third straight day of violence at schools in Los Angeles County. On 
Wednesday, a 15-year-old girl was stabbed more than a dozen times by a 
schoolmate as she walked to a bus stop at Huntington Park High School. She was 
in serious but stable condition late Thursday afternoon, according to a 
spokeswoman at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a 13-year-old student at La Crescenta High School pulled a gun on a 
teacher and was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Security Guard 
</P>
<P>
The shooting at Fleming, a Los Angeles Unified School District school that does 
not have a security guard, was the first suspected gang incident there since 
1974, said graphic arts teacher Jerry Roach. 
</P>
<P>
Police, administrators and students said the shooting near Inglewood High 
School, where the grounds are tightly monitored by administrators and security 
officers, was the first they could remember in about four or five years. 
</P>
<P>
Police were out in force at both schools Thursday afternoon as students 
gathered in groups to discuss the shootings. Officials said there would be 
extra security for the next several days at the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Supt. George McKenna said: "We don't feel the situation is unsafe, 
but we've beefed up security. There will be additional surveillance in the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood High School student Nina Lua, 16, said she was concerned about the 
possibility of a retaliatory shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'm worried," she said. "But what can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fatalistic Reaction 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at both schools said the generally fatalistic reaction of 
students was significant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a sign of the times," Roach said. "The kids are starting to 
accept this as an everyday affair." 
</P>
<P>
The Inglewood shooting occurred on Kelso Avenue next to the parking lot of the 
Inglewood Adult School, on the high school campus, two blocks from the city 
police station. The area is considered "extremely peaceful," said Inglewood 
Police Sgt. Harold Moret, and is heavily patrolled by police and school 
security officers. 
</P>
<P>
Hardges was walking with four other students next to Inglewood High School at 
10:45 a.m. on his way to the Hillcrest school about five blocks away, Moret 
said, when three or four youths in a yellow passenger van flashed gang signs 
and yelled gang slogans at the students. 
</P>
<P>
As the students kept walking, one of the occupants of the van fired a round 
from a shotgun. Hardges was hit in the face, neck, head and chest by birdshot, 
Moret said. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants are believed to be Los Angeles gang members, Moret said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hardges nor his companions are "known Inglewood gang members," Moret 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardges transferred to the Inglewood schools from Sylmar High School in 1988, 
according to a district official. He was placed in Hillcrest, a continuation 
high school for students who have disciplinary or academic problems or who work 
and cannot attend school full time. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred at a time when most students were in class, and did not 
disrupt school activities, said students and officials. 
</P>
<P>
Students said Inglewood Principal Lawrence Freeman, who is credited with having 
established a safe, orderly atmosphere at the school, used the public address 
system to tell students to keep calm and remain indoors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crips and Bloods 
</P>
<P>
Students said they believed the assailants are members of a Crip gang. They 
said the school is in territory dominated by rival Blood gangs. 
</P>
<P>
In the Lomita shooting, police and school officials are investigating a report 
that the shooting of Mendoza stemmed from a rivalry between Harbor City and 
Torrance-area gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza had just left a math tutoring session with Assistant Principal 
Constance Rupert when he was shot while standing in a courtyard between two 
shop buildings which face onto West 254th Street in the residential 
neighborhood, Rupert said. 
</P>
<P>
Between five and seven shots were fired from a black Camaro on 254th street at 
about 1:30 p.m. The car was seen cruising around the school several times 
during the day, officials said, and Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies had 
been patrolling the area earlier looking for the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The occupants of the Camaro shouted gang slogans and threw bottles at students 
on a playground just before firing, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Was Scary' 
</P>
<P>
Susan Bobar, a student in a wood shop class, said she heard shots and saw 
Mendoza holding his shoulder. "Our teacher made us lie down on the floor for 
about two minutes," she said. "It was scary." 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza walked to the nurse's office, bleeding, and was given first aid until 
an ambulance arrived, Rupert said.

WEEKENDER: A CHANCE TO DRIVE BY AND SEE REAL ARTISTS AT WORK.

<P>
Elegant outdoor dinner parties with entertainment and tours of fancy Palos 
Verdes Peninsula kitchens have been past attractions for raising money for the 
community-based Palos Verdes Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, working peninsula and San Pedro artists -- what they create and 
where they create it -- will be the stars as the center's largest support group 
tries to raise a sizable sum for programs that range from exhibiting art and 
giving classes to presenting arts programs in South Bay schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people want to know how artists work," said Susan McNeil, an artist and 
member of The Circle, the group putting on a six-hour "drive yourself" art tour 
Sunday. It will take visitors into the studios of 21 artists from Palos Verdes 
Estates to San Pedro, with San Pedro's Madrona Gallery of contemporary art as 
an added attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to drop in on an artist in his environment," she said. Visitors 
will see completed work and projects under way and be able to talk with the 
artists about their craft. "It really shows the creative life style." 
</P>
<P>
McNeil said the 21 artists were chosen to reflect a variety of styles and 
disciplines -- sculpture, ceramics, printmaking, assemblage art and painting 
that ranges from abstract to landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
One artist does miniature oil paintings with intricate detail rivaling the Old 
Masters, McNeil said. Another creates landscapes so vivid "that you can almost 
feel the wind blow and the sunshine in his things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists do op art that plays tricks on the eyes, paper sculpture, 
black-humored collages of colored photographs, works of textured wax on canvas 
or plywood, and paintings and sculpture that evoke dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"These are major, professional artists who have had exhibits, been in 
galleries, or are known artists," said McNeil, adding that San Pedro, and to a 
lesser extent the peninsula, has developed an "art energy" that has attracted 
creative people. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets at $15 will be on sale at the art center in Rancho Palos Verdes and the 
Madrona Gallery through the afternoon of the tour. Tickets come with a list of 
artists and a map with each studio numbered; people make up their own routes. 
</P>
<P>
Eva Kolosvary, who creates etchings with her husband, Paul, said she views 
their involvement in the art walk as a "donation of time" to the art center and 
a means of making South Bay people aware of the art community around them. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize they have artists right there at their fingertips," she 
said. "This is exposure for the artist and the public." 
</P>
<P>
The walls of the Kolosvary studio in Rancho Palos Verdes on Sunday will be 
covered with abstract etchings of rock formations at Joshua Tree National 
Monument. "The sun is setting, and it looks like the rocks are glowing from the 
inside with extremely bright colors of red and orange," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Working on the deck of his striking San Pedro home overlooking the harbor, 
artist Jay McCafferty conducts sunlight with a magnifying glass, burning 
abstract images on rag paper. He said creating one of his "burns," as he calls 
them, is like a "meditation" because it takes hours and requires careful 
focusing of the magnifying glass. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be here (on Sunday) to answer questions," he said. "Hopefully, they won't 
be 'Why is it art?'." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Cox, a Palos Verdes Estates assemblage artist, uses such cast-offs as wire 
and driftwood to create what she calls "small shrines" -- boxes with miniature 
figures that come out of myth and legend. Crushed bottle caps become shields in 
the funeral of a medieval lord, and bits of wood and trees are transformed into 
forest nymphs. 
</P>
<P>
Cox admitted being nervous about the tour. "I don't know what kind of art 
people will like," she said. "If it's the limpid-pool-surrounded-by-trees 
variety, they'll be puzzled, if not irritated, by what I do." 
</P>
<P>
Calling Sunday's art walk a first for the art center, McNeil said The Circle 
wants to make it an annual fund-raiser "if it works and the community is 
interested." 
</P>
<P>
Maudette Ball, executive director of the center, said she would like to see it 
become as successful as the Vence Art Walk. 
</P>
<P>
"That started as a gleam in someone's eye, too," she said. Gerald Faris

NORTHRIDGE WOMEN END LOSING STREAK TO POMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Was it the confidence boost? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was the fact that the victory was over the second-ranked women's 
basketball team in Division II? 
</P>
<P>
No, said Leslie Milke, Cal State Northridge coach, the best thing about 
Thursday night's 67-61 victory over Cal Poly Pomona was that no longer will she 
be asked about . . . the streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors had lost 29 games in a row to Pomona, which already had 
clinched the championship of the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
Northridge's only previous win over Pomona came on Jan. 20, 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"I am so glad that I won't be asked about that stupid streak every year," Milke 
said. "That's the biggest monkey off our backs." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Cavalin and Bridgette Ealy combined for 41 points as the 17th-ranked Lady 
Matadors improved their record to 19-7, 7-4 in the CCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, which also had won 29 consecutive games against CCAA teams, fell to 
21-5 overall. 
</P>
<P>
By winning, Northridge assured itself of not having to meet Pomona, which has 
won every CCAA title, in the first round of the conference tournament March 2. 
</P>
<P>
"From a player's standpoint, if this doesn't put them on a high, I don't know 
what would," Milke said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors are now likely to receive a Division II playoff invitation 
even if they fail to automatically qualify by winning the CCAA tournament.

3-A NEWCOMERS REACH SEMIFINALS; 
</P>
<P>
EL CAMINO REAL, FREMONT TO MEET IN DECLASSIFIED CITY SHOWDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two teams that have benefited from a drop in class will meet tonight in the 
semifinals of the City Section 3-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the key in that pronouncement is 3-A. El Camino Real and Fremont, which 
play at 7:30 tonight at Fremont, have flourished under the City's releaguing 
plan that bumped each school to the 3-A level in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Fremont advanced to the 4-A playoffs last season and even knocked off Cleveland 
and Taft in the first two rounds, but the Pathfinders were overmatched against 
Crenshaw in the 4-A semifinal, losing, 93-72. 
</P>
<P>
But a year later, Fremont is king of the hill in the 3-A. The top-seeded 
Pathfinders breezed to the Central League title with a 12-0 record and will 
take a 24-3 mark into tonight's game. Behind the play of 6-5 senior Tyrone 
Phillips, who has scored 50 points in postseason play, they squashed Eagle Rock 
in the first round, 96-57, and dispatched University, 58-51, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Four Fremont players score in double figures, led by Phillips at 18.8. He is 
followed by Chris Ford (16.5), Lionel Pandy (14.4) and Maurice McKenzy (10.5., 
8 assists, 5 steals), all of whom play guard in Fremont's three-guard offense. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real also has found life in the 3-A less hazardous to its health. The 
Conquistadores opened Northwest Valley Conference play with four games against 
North Valley League opponents, who compete at the 4-A level. El Camino Real 
lost three of the four but then won five of six West Valley League games to 
enter the playoffs as the league's first-place representative. Two rounds 
later, they are the only Valley-area boys' team still playing. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the drop in class, the Conquistadores (11-8) have benefited from the 
play of Brent Lofton. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-6 senior forward is averaging 23.1 points a game and 8.3 rebounds. He 
scored 33 in a 72-57 win over Lincoln and 19 in Wednesday's 67-63 victory over 
Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as critical to El Camino Real's success is senior Jason Steele, who 
averaged fewer than 10 points during the regular season but has blossomed in 
the playoffs. After an 11-point, 10-rebound effort against Lincoln, he scored a 
team-high 23 points and also blocked eight shots against Jefferson. Controlling 
his emotions has given him as much difficulty as opponents this season. He was 
suspended for a game this season for his role in an on-campus fight, and Coach 
Mike McNulty benched him for two minutes after receiving a technical foul 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those teams talk a lot and he has to tune it out," McNulty said. 
</P>
<P>
"But even though he lost his temper, that was the best game he's played. He was 
probably worth 15 or 20 points on defense. If he gets in foul trouble we're not 
the same team." 
</P>
<P>
Two days after recording one of the biggest wins in its history, the Reseda 
girls' team will make its third Sports Arena appearance in three years in 
today's 4 p.m. City 4-A semifinal against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Regents boosted their record to 16-4 with a 79-72 victory over Kennedy on 
Wednesday, the Golden Cougars' first playoff loss to a Valley team this decade. 
Apparently, the releaguing plan that promoted Reseda to the 4-A level has not 
hurt the Regents, City 3-A champions the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Regent Coach Andrea Francola is not thrilled about returning to action 
so soon after the Kennedy game, nothing can diminish the importance of that 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed we have only one day between games, but we're never going 
to forget that game," she said. "It will always be a good memory." 
</P>
<P>
Washington is no stranger to the Sports Arena, either. The Generals, 
co-champions of the Southern League, own a six-game win streak. Washington has 
reached the semifinals four of the past five years and twice has been 4-A 
runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is led by a pair of 5-6 junior guards. Detra Lockhart (17.6 ppg) and 
Remitha Houston (20.7) are cousins who run the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda will counter with a diversified attack featuring Jennifer Marzahl, 
Cheryl Hightower and Aggie Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-A semifinal, Canoga Park will travel to Roosevelt for a 7:30 p.m. game. 
The Hunters (9-7) won the West Valley League championship behind the play of 
Soo Yoon and her twin Joo, who emigrated from South Korea last year. Soo is a 
5-10 forward who averages 19 points and Joo is a 5-7 point guard averaging 7 
assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
Roosevelt (11-3), the Eastern League champion, is led by Luscinda Silva, the 
league MVP who averages 29.2 points.

CHATSWORTH'S TOMAC STEERS TOWARD NEW BIKE PURSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a recent winter day, John Tomac rode his mountain bike north on Owensmouth 
Avenue, slicing effortlessly through a bitterly cold head wind that flattened 
his long, blond hair. Ahead were the Santa Susana Mountains, which would 
provide him with shelter -- not only from nature but from man as well. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac, the 1988 National Off-Road Bicycle Assn.'s overall champion, trains in 
the mountains near his home in Chatsworth. But he also is becoming more 
involved in road racing, which has taken him out of the mountains and onto the 
asphalt. And as any bike rider in Los Angeles knows, the mountains, despite 
their rugged terrain, can be more hospitable than the mean streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to stay off Valley surface streets," Tomac, a 21-year-old bachelor, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But that is almost impossible for Tomac, who trains as much as 25 hours a week, 
mostly on streets. "People throw stuff at me," he said. "They get belligerent 
and think I'm taking up too much of the road and try to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Not that he has to duck tire irons. Mostly, it's ice from soft drinks. "A lot 
of people don't understand road racing here in the U. S.," Tomac said. "It's 
not like Europe. If you take a training ride in Europe, people cheer you. Here, 
they throw a Big Gulp." 
</P>
<P>
But drivers who make Tomac a drive-by icing victim should beware: He may catch 
up to you at the next light. Or next county. A member of the U. S. National 
Cycling Team and '88 Criterium national champion, Tomac is capable of sprinting 
40 miles an hour for short distances on flat land. He also can complete 
130-mile mountain races in 6 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac trains almost every day and, from March through September, races almost 
every weekend. His favorite road routes take him along Los Angeles Avenue in 
Simi Valley all the way to Port Hueneme, about an 80-mile round-trip. He also 
likes to ride the Sierra Highway into Antelope Valley, despite the constant 
buffeting as cars and trucks whiz past. 
</P>
<P>
"The major problem is traffic," he says. "I can only hope people pay attention 
to what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Riding up Owensmouth, Tomac turned at a light, cut diagonally across Lassen 
Street when the coast was clear and veered onto a bike path that paralleled a 
drainage ditch. Going north again, he hit the chilling wind, but it didn't 
bother him. Off-road racers, who often experience blazing heat and numbing cold 
on the same ride, have to learn to ignore discomfort. Tomac learned early. 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in the small Michigan town of Owosso, Tomac started BMX racing when 
he was 7, riding every day, even in winter. By the time he was 16, he was 
national champion in his age group. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac's sister Deana, older by four years, usually drove him to out-of-state 
races. At a race in Florida five years ago, she changed both their lives. 
That's when she met and fell for a pro BMX racer named Robby Rupe. They were 
married a year later and moved to the Valley. Rupe introduced Tomac to mountain 
racing in the winter of 1985, when Tomac was living with them on an extended 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we found out how good he was, we encouraged him to move here 
permanently," said Rupe, who works in the transportation department at The 
Times' Valley plant. 
</P>
<P>
The Rupes' small spare bedroom that Tomac first moved into is now filled with 
riding paraphernalia and medals. There is also a large color photo of Tomac 
winning a race, his face and body caked with mud. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to have pictures of all the top guys, but pretty soon he was beating 
them," Rupe says, "so he took their pictures down." 
</P>
<P>
Between them, Tomac and Rupe have turned their garage into a private bicycle 
repair shop. About a dozen bikes hang on hooks and a workbench is covered with 
specialized tools. Before he goes for a ride, Tomac feels his tires for 
pressure and adds a few pounds with a hand pump. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac's mountain bike is a Mongoose. It was given to him by his primary sponsor 
-- he also has deals for clothing, tires and sunglasses. Although still 
designated an amateur, Tomac "makes a pretty good living" on his bike. (He has 
won as much as $4,000 in one race. U.S. Cycling Federation rules state that a 
rider can win as much as $2,000 a day and remain an amateur; additional money 
must go into a trust). 
</P>
<P>
Tomac plans to become a pro road racer by 1991, which means he will have to 
move to Europe, where all the major races -- including the Tour de France -- 
take place and top riders can make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. To 
prepare for Europe, Tomac has been reducing his involvement in mountain biking. 
Last year, 70% of his races were in the mountains, but only half will be this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac is aware that a career in road racing usually ends when a rider is in his 
early 30s. Although he trained as an electronics technician at Edison Tech in 
Sherman Oaks, Tomac isn't sure what he wants to do when his racing days are 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll try to keep it fun," he says.

NORTHRIDGE BID FOR POSTSEASON PLAY DASHED DESPITE VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The elation of a second consecutive impressive outing wore off quickly for the 
Cal State Northridge men's basketball team Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
After taking care of business by defeating Cal Poly Pomona, 96-78, at Kellogg 
Gym, the Matadors learned that their postseason hopes had been extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman defeated Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 71-64, at the Hutton Sports Center 
in Orange, clinching the fourth and final berth in next week's California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The field: UC Riverside, Cal State Dominguez Hills, Cal State Bakersfield and 
Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said, "because I think we're one 
of the best teams in the conference." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps so. But the Matadors, after a promising start, took too long to hit 
stride during the conference season. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons: Injuries didn't help matters, Cassidy said. At one time or 
another, all but one of CSUN's front-line players sustained injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of continuity also played a role, Cassidy said. To that end, only three of 
the 11 players the Matadors suited Thursday played together on last year's 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge is 16-10 overall, 7-6 in the CCAA. If the Matadors defeat Riverside 
on Saturday and Chapman loses to Bakersfield, both teams would finish 8-6 in 
conference play. But the Panthers would advance by virtue of their two wins 
over Northridge this season. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, 6-19 overall, is one loss away from finishing 0-for-the-CCAA season. 
</P>
<P>
It was Derrick Gathers who rode roughshod over the Broncos on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers scored 24 points, made eight of 13 from the field -- including four of 
six three-point attempts -- and added 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
So what did Cassidy want to talk about afterward? Gathers' passing. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he played very much under control," Cassidy said. "Several times he 
made nice, easy passes for easy baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers finished with five assists. 
</P>
<P>
Four other Matadors reached double figures in scoring. Alan Fraser had 15 
points, Kendell McDaniels 14, Jemarl Baker 13 and Kris Brodowski 10. 
</P>
<P>
Nate Macon led Pomona with 24 points and Forrest Barnes added 17. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge led, 45-37, at the half, largely because of reserve forward 
McDaniels, who scored 10 points and had seven rebounds in eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers had 13 points as the Matadors broke open a close game with a string of 
four three-point shots -- two by Gathers -- in the closing minutes of the half.

TAFT TRACK TEAM BEGINS LIFE AFTER WATTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taft High has furnished the Valley's most renowned track program for the past 
three years, but when the Toreadors begin the season this afternoon in a 
non-scoring meet at Birmingham, they will be just another team seeking to 
establish itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely in a rebuilding year," first-year Coach Mel Hein said. "We've 
got some talent, but we're very young. The franchise is gone and now we just 
have to move ahead." 
</P>
<P>
The franchise was Quincy Watts, the heart and soul of the program for the past 
three seasons who led the Toreadors to consecutive City Section titles in 
1986-87 and the state championship in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Now at USC, Watts won three individual state titles and five City championships 
at Taft, but he is not the only talented Toreador to be lost to graduation last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Gone, too, are Yomo Smith (third in the triple jump in the City championships), 
Lawrence Killens (seventh in the long jump) and sprinters David Flores and 
David Feinstein, who with Watts made up three-fourths of Taft's City runner-up 
400-meter relay team. 
</P>
<P>
Pole vaulter Greg Sheets is the only individual scorer to return from last 
year's team that placed third in the City championships behind Washington and 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Sheets, who vaulted 15 feet in 1988, placed second to Jay Bettinger of 
Chatsworth in the City meet and is favored to win the title this season. 
</P>
<P>
Taft also has several returning athletes who performed well at lower levels in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
David Rodriguez, a junior, won the City title in the C 800 (2 minutes, 1.68 
seconds) last season and teammate Redrick Dixon, another junior, placed second 
in the C long jump (20-9). 
</P>
<P>
Taft, the City Section frosh-soph cross-country champion, also could get some 
help from its young, but talented distance corps that includes sophomore Brian 
Goodsey and freshman Michael Krentzin. 
</P>
<P>
In another meet today, Eddie Bowling of Canoga Park will lead the Hunters 
against North Hollywood at home. 
</P>
<P>
Bowling, the defending City champion in the high jump, has a personal best of 
6-9.

CITY COACHES TAKE PARTING SHOTS AT RELEAGUING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Levine of Grant and Steve Miller of North Hollywood were outspoken 
critics of the City Section's releaguing plan when it was announced last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Both basketball coaches objected because traditional East Valley League rivals 
Grant and North Hollywood were realigned in different leagues. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, Grant and North Hollywood met twice, setting up a 
playoff-like atmosphere during the regular season, according to Levine. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, the Lancers and Huskies met only once -- in a Valley Pac-8 
Conference opener won by North Hollywood -- and both coaches said that fact 
could have contributed to their first-round losses in the City Section 3-A 
playoffs last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all conjecture now," Levine said. "But I wonder if it would have made a 
difference if we had played them twice. After all, neither one of our teams 
were challenged during the league season. And that puts you at a disadvantage 
when the playoffs start. You need to experience those tight games." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, whose Huskies (15-5) had won 11 consecutive games before losing to 
Jefferson, 73-69, in the first round, agreed. 
</P>

"Those were big, playoff-intensity-type games," he said of the meetings with 
Grant. "And we only played in one of them this year. We really didn't get 
challenged after that." 
</P>
<P>
Grant (17-4) was 6-0 in East Valley League play and had an average victory 
margin of more than 21 points a game; North Hollywood's margin of victory was 
almost 24 points during a 6-0 Mid-Valley League campaign.

<P>
Record check: Although he has coached at three high schools in the past five 
years, Reseda's Jeff Halpern has compiled a varsity coaching record of 52-17.

Halpern coached Van Nuys to a 21-3 mark and the City Section 3-A semifinals in 
1984-85, guided Birmingham to a 22-3 record and the City 3-A final in 1986-87 
and his Reseda squad was 9-11 this season, losing to Wilson, 56-54, in the 
first round of the City 3-A playoffs last Friday.

David vs. Goliath, almost: Poly figured to be headed into a buzz saw when the 
Parrots traveled to Los Angeles High for last Friday's first-round playoff 
game. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Los Angeles had a front line that included 6-foot-9 Adam Henderson, 
6-6 Khari Jaxon and 6-5 Richard Champion, while Poly's tallest starter was 6-2 
Juan Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Parrots gave Los Angeles a scare before falling, 85-75. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had to shoot well to have any chance at all," Poly assistant Tim 
Bruen said. "And that's what we did. . . . There was no way we were going to go 
inside on them." 
</P>
<P>
Poly -- ignited by forwards John Bruner and Scott Cooper -- hit 26 of 42 shots 
from the field, including nine of 12 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Bruner finished with a game-high 28 points and Cooper had 27.

Residents of the Soviet autonomous republic of Kalmyk, where more than two 
dozen children were infected with the deadly AIDS virus, have been the objects 
of abuse by fearful neighbors, a newspaper reported. Writing in the government 
newspaper Izvestia, poet David Kugultinov said residents of nearby areas have 
begun throwing stones at cars bearing license plates from Kalmyk, located 
between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, "as if the cars are spreading AIDS." 
Kugultinov urged the Soviet Union to adopt measures to prohibit discrimination 
against victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

China and Indonesia agreed to normalize diplomatic relations suspended 22 years

Indonesian government. Indonesian President Suharto and Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen reached the agreement after meeting for more than two 
hours, according to a spokesman for the Indonesian Embassy in Tokyo. The two 
leaders are in the Japanese capital to attend Emperor Hirohito's funeral. The 
spokesman also said that details of the agreement would be worked out by 
ambassadors from the two countries at the United Nations in New York.

HOUSE ETHICS PANEL BEGINS REVIEW OF PROBE ON WRIGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The House Ethics Committee met in secret Thursday to begin reviewing an 
independent counsel's report in the investigation of Speaker Jim Wright, while 
the Texas Democrat warned Republicans not to try to make political hay out of 
his problems. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics panel, formally known as the Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct, met for about an hour to map out its procedures for considering a 
voluminous report by independent counsel Richard Phelan. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's proceedings were being conducted under heavy secrecy. Chairman 
Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) made a terse statement saying only that the 
committee would hold further meetings next week. The next session was scheduled 
for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The limited number of copies of Phelan's report were being kept in the 
committee's offices in the Capitol basement, and members were allowed to read 
them only on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said he knew nothing about the status of the case or Phelan's 
recommendations, but repeated his assertions that the charges were politically 
motivated and said the committee had "wasted their million dollars," a 
reference to the cost of the nine-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Among formal allegations are that Wright improperly lobbied for a constituent 
with whom he had financial dealings, that he used campaign and taxpayer funds 
to publish a book on which he received $55,000 in royalties, that he improperly 
lobbied officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and that he accepted use 
of a Ft. Worth condominium at a below-market price. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said continued Republican talk about capitalizing on his ethics problems 
in the 1990 elections could put an early end to cooperation with the GOP 
Administration of President Bush on the budget and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have it both ways, obviously," Wright told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Designated No. 1 Target 
</P>
<P>
He said comments Wednesday by Edward Rollins, director of the Republican House 
campaign committee, designating the Speaker as his "No. 1 target" in 1990 
proved that the ethics probe was a political reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is a little bit amusing," Wright said. "The day after Bush has 
Democratic leaders down to the White House and talks about being friendly and 
bipartisan on the budget, Rollins comes out and says that."

The Spanish state airline Iberia canceled some of its transatlantic flights on

<P>
"Faults have been detected which appear to be intentional," a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the faults coincided with a series of strikes by the maintenance 
workers' union ASETMA. The damage consisted of broken cables and panels but was 
not serious. 
</P>
<P>
The airline's entire 85-plane fleet will be inspected, and transatlantic 
flights will resume on Saturday, she added.

ACCUSED SLAYER CALLED OBSESSED BY SOCIAL WORKER

<P>
As David Smith was charged formally Thursday with the slaying of his 
psychiatric social worker, newly filed court documents detailed the suspect's 
murderous obsession with his victim and the inability of the judicial and 
mental health systems to prevent Smith's lethal outburst. 
</P>
<P>
According to 30 pages of police crime and interview reports filed by 
prosecutors in Santa Monica Superior Court, Smith, 26, admitted to homicide 
detectives Wednesday that he killed 36-year-old Robbyn Panitch because he saw 
her as the "Antichrist" and felt frustrated that she was unable to assist him. 
</P>
<P>
The documents also revealed that Smith had threatened Panitch, and that the 
social worker feared he was capable of "assaultive behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Shane Talbot, who interrogated Smith, said that Smith waived his 
constitutional Miranda protections from self-incrimination during an interview 
that lasted an hour and 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
According to the police documents, Panitch wanted Smith committed for a 72-hour 
observation period in a hospital psychiatric setting. But a court-appointed 
psychiatrist who evaluated Smith earlier this month "indicated that Smith was 
not gravely disabled and did not warrant a 72-hour hold." 
</P>
<P>
A county mental health worker who came into contact with Smith over the last 
two months told The Times on Thursday that, after a public outburst on a Santa 
Monica street Jan. 3, Smith had been committed for such a 72-hour hold in the 
psychiatric emergency room at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. When the holding 
period ended, Smith was released, said the worker, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Kwan, an assistant administrator at Harbor-UCLA, declined to verify 
whether Smith was treated at the center, citing regulations to protect patient 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. J. Richard Elpers, a professor of psychiatry at the hospital, said that 
"the resident who saw the patient in the (emergency room) was very good. I'm 
confident he did a good job. We did not make a mistake in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Elpers said that evaluations of disturbed patients can be difficult because 
they "become dangerous for brief periods of time in their lives" and may not be 
acting out their hostility during the period that they are under observation. 
</P>
<P>
The county mental health worker who saw Smith before he was committed to 
Harbor-UCLA on Jan. 3 said that Smith was in a jail cell, "talking to a pen as 
if it was an individual -- as if God's voice was emanating from it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gave Me the Willies' 
</P>
<P>
Concluding that Smith "was clearly psychotic," the mental health worker watched 
as Smith was transported from the jail cell on a gurney, strapped by leather 
restraints. "I've been doing this a long time," the worker said. "and this guy 
gave me the willies." 
</P>
<P>
Panitch was stabbed 31 times Tuesday in her office at the Santa Monica West 
Mental Health Service. Co-workers responding to her screams pulled Smith off 
her and held him until police arrived, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In the hours after Smith was arrested, he told detectives that he had killed 
her with a folding knife he had purchased to protect himself "on the streets," 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith told police he saw Panitch talking on the telephone and attacked her with 
the knife, stabbing "her multiple times." 
</P>
<P>
According to the interview reports, Smith believed that Panitch looked like a 
childhood friend he believed was the Antichrist. Smith also was "tired and 
scared of living on the street" and was "extremely angry" at Panitch for not 
finding him shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Smith told the detectives, according to the documents, that Panitch told him in 
a counseling session a week before that "Tuesday was going to be his day. Smith 
took this to mean that Panitch was going to kill him on Tuesday, and in order 
to save himself he must kill Panitch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reservation at Jump Street 
</P>
<P>
Mental health workers said they had difficulty placing Smith in residences. 
Panitch had made a Jan. 27 reservation for Smith at Jump Street, a 
county-funded facility for mentally ill homeless patients. Officials at the 
residence said Smith never showed up for the two-week program. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Flaherty, Panitch's fiancee, told police that Smith was "not receptive 
to instructions" to take medication for his precarious mental condition. 
Flaherty said that Smith threatened Panitch after he appeared in Santa Monica 
Municipal Court last Friday, four days before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing resulted in the re-instatement of Smith's probation stemming from a 
conviction for the 1987 assault of his mother. He was urged at the hearing to 
seek psychiatric help at the Brentwood Veterans Administration facility. Smith 
served two years in the Air Force and was discharged in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered Dangerous 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, police also said that a psychiatrist at Panitch's clinic 
believed that Smith was dangerous. Ralph Mitchell, the acting director of the 
clinic, told police that the psychiatrist thought "Smith was a serious threat 
without receiving proper medication." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, county health professionals and social workers gathered in 
Santa Monica for a candlelight vigil in Panitch's memory and a march protesting 
proposed funding cuts for county mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Smith's public defender, Lianne Edmonds, Municipal Judge 
Laurence Rubin postponed Smith's arraignment until March 2.

 7 CARD CLUBS AGREE TO DROP ASIAN GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proprietors of the seven card clubs in Los Angeles County have agreed to drop a 
controversial Asian betting game under a proposed revision of the state's 
98-year-old gambling law. 
</P>
<P>
In return, officials of the California Police Officers Assn. have tentatively 
agreed to support legislation that would allow the clubs to return to a 
recently banned fee system, under which the clubs collect a percentage of 
gamblers' winnings, according to Los Angeles County Undersheriff Robert A. 
Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise between the two sides is outlined in a proposal by 
administrators of the five Los Angeles County cities that contain the casinos 
-- Bell Gardens, Huntington Park, Commerce, Bell and Gardena -- to overhaul the 
state's gambling laws. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was announced one week after card club owners won a preliminary 
court battle against the Sheriff's Department, which has tried to stop clubs 
from offering three popular Asian games, saying they violate state law. 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, pai-gow, which is played with dominoes, would no longer 
be offered in card clubs throughout the state. But Asian poker and super pan 9, 
which are played with traditional playing cards, would be allowed.

 JUDGE REJECTS DELAY IN ECCLESIA TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oregon judge has rejected a petition filed by four Ecclesia Athletic Assn. 
members to halt their trial for the beating death of the group founder's 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Clackamas County Circuit Judge John Lowe ruled that the defendants have no 
legal standing to have the trial transferred to federal court after they 
claimed the state of Oregon prohibited them from free exercise of their 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants also asked that the trial be halted so their organization could

 EX-LAPD DETECTIVE GETS LIFE IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite an impassioned plea in which he steadfastly proclaimed his innocence, 
former Los Angeles Police Detective Richard Herman Ford was sentenced Thursday 
to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the contract killing of 
a Northridge businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, who did not testify during the nine-month trial, made a half-hour speech 
attempting to invalidate several pieces of evidence that led to his October 
conviction for the 1983 murder of Thomas Weed, 52. "I have not been a greedy 
individual, some kind of maniac running the streets. It's not true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Darlene Schempp told him: "You took the life of another in such a 
meaningless and cheap way. You have brought disgrace to the Los Angeles Police 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
Ford, 48, and his former police partner, Richard Von Villas, 44, were convicted 
by separate Van Nuys Superior Court juries of killing Weed in exchange for 
$20,000 from Weed's ex-wife. Von Villas was sentenced in January to life in 
prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Weed, a debt collector and small business owner, disappeared from his 
Northridge apartment in February, 1983, and his body has never been found.

 JUDGE REJECTS JAIL INFORMANT'S BARGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Thursday refused to accept a plea bargain that the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office had negotiated with jailhouse 
informant Leslie Vernon White. Judge Ernest Hiroshige said the convicted 
kidnaper and armed robber deserved to spend more than 16 months in jail for 
snatching an elderly woman's purse. 
</P>
<P>
White had negotiated the 16-month term last fall, just before county 
prosecutors began a massive review of cases involving informants because he 
demonstrated that, by posing as a law enforcement officer on a jail telephone, 
he could convincingly fabricate the murder confession of an inmate he had never 
met. 
</P>
<P>
Hiroshige said he rejected the bargain because of White's long criminal record 
and his failure to appear at a sentencing hearing Jan. 19. Over White's 
objection, he ordered the case returned to Municipal Court for a preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
White's attorney, John Polakovic, said afterward that he believes White is 
being punished because of his demonstration. "They're not happy with what he's 
done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
White faces a maximum sentence of three years on the purse snatching charge and 
perhaps as many as 25 years if all of his convictions are taken into account, 
Polakovic said.

NEWSWIRE: NCAA NOTIFIES MISSOURI OF INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Missouri officials said they have been officially notified that the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. is investigating possible violations by the school's 
basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
That marks the first time the NCAA has formally investigated Missouri's 
programs, said Chancellor Haskell Monroe, who announced the investigation after 
a meeting of the school's Intercollegiate Athletic Committee. Monroe said he 
received notice from NCAA officials Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe and Athletic Director Dick Tamburo said officials have not said when the 
investigation will be complete. The school has hired a Chicago law firm to 
review its compliance with NCAA rules, and both men said that investigation 
would continue. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of former Missouri player P.J. Mays has released to the media a tape 
recording of a conversation between herself and Bob Sundvold, a Missouri 
assistant coach. In the tape, Sundvold apparently talks about purchasing an 
airline ticket for Mays, in violation of NCAA rules, and asks Mrs. Mays to help 
cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
Mays has also said he and other freshmen players received $100 each from 
Sundvold, who has been suspended pending the school's investigation.

IN DEFENSE OF THE AK-47; 
</P>
<P>
THE CONTROVERSIAL WEAPON, LIKE OTHER SEMIAUTOMATICS, IS ACTUALLY PRECISE AND 
DURABLE AND HAS NOSTALGIC APPEAL, OWNERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a free-lance writer who lives in Santa Ana. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Squinting down the sights of his rifle at the paper target 100 yards away, 
yellow shooting glasses resting on his nose, Wayne Tom slowly squeezed off 
another round with a short, unremarkably loud bang. Nothing out of the 
ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
Tom, who was shooting one of his two semiautomatic AK-47s at Irvine's South 
Coast Gun Club, noted that the weapons are "part of a collection. And they're 
fun to shoot." 
</P>
<P>
"People say you can't hunt with them," said Tom, a production manager for a 
remodeling company who lives in Corona del Mar, "but that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
"They're excellent at medium range, for medium-sized game and plinking," he 
said, referring to shooting at objects such as cans and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Tom, like other shooters of assault weapons at the range, said the rifles add 
variety to his collection. "I have about a dozen guns . . . and I like all my 
rifles equally," he said. "These two are just something different." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weapons Called Practical 
</P>
<P>
To Tom Mancusi of San Pedro, shooting his American-made AR-15 assault rifle a 
few positions down from Wayne Tom, military assault weapons offer practicality. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a high-performance rifle," Mancusi said of his gun of choice. "It's 
a semiautomatic version of the military M-16, and it was meant to be abused. 
You can drop it, get it muddy. You don't have to baby it. Some other guns you 
have to clean every five rounds, but this gun was meant to have hundreds of 
rounds run through it." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, the AR-15's service in Vietnam -- as the M-16's -- enhances its 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little piece of history, really," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Patrick Edward Purdy walked into a Stockton schoolyard Jan. 17 and killed 
five children and wounded 29 others with a semiautomatic AK-47 rifle, he 
ignited a firestorm of revulsion against military assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the slayings, an entire nation became familiar with the 
Chinese-made AK-47 and, in the following days, other assault weapons such as 
the Israeli Uzi and the U.S. AR-15. 
</P>
<P>
With recognition came outrage. On Feb. 7, the Los Angeles City Council passed 
an ordinance barring the sale and possession of semiautomatic, military 
assault-type weapons. At least six more cities in the state have adopted 
similar laws, and at least 13 others are considering them. Throughout the 
country, nearly a dozen additional cities, from New Orleans to Boston, are 
pondering bans on assault weapons, as will the California Assembly and other 
state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
Assault weapons, their opponents say, are highly dangerous, are designed 
expressly for killing people, serve no other practical purpose and have, 
therefore, no place in the hands of private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Given all that, why would anyone want to own one? 
</P>
<P>
That question seems to genuinely puzzle the owners of assault weapons, who say 
the loathing directed at the guns makes no sense. To them, the weapons simply 
differ in look and feel, and possibly in capacity and caliber, from other, more 
conventional semiautomatic guns. 
</P>
<P>
They see them instead as objects of history or nostalgia, curiosities for their 
collections, accurate long-distance rifles, target-shooting weapons or as 
effective means of personal protection. 
</P>
<P>
Tihamer Bocz, a computer programmer from Buena Park, bought his AK-47 partly 
for protection. "If there's going to be a big earthquake, there's going to be 
some trouble, like looting," said Bocz, a Hungarian immigrant who has lived in 
the United States for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This gun has a lot of stopping power. I don't want to kill anybody, but if 
people loot or try to rape my wife, I'm going to shoot them. My father and my 
church have a different point of view, but I have a responsibility. My 
Christian mind says no, but for survival, I say yes." 
</P>
<P>
The weapon, he said, is also "fun for sharpshooting. And I will hunt with it, 
but not right now." 
</P>
<P>
Bocz said he "didn't know (the AK-47) existed here until the news media brought 
it up (after the Stockton killings). Before they came out with all this, I 
never would have bought it." 
</P>
<P>
For another gun enthusiast, the AK-47 presented a range-shooting challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'Now why would you need that AK-47?' " said Steven D. Bromberg, a 
lawyer with a practice in Encino and a former AK-47 owner. "And in some cases 
that would be a valid question. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were going to use it for hunting, they'd be right. But if you were 
going to use it for target shooting or self-defense, they'd be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
AK-47s, in particular, he said, appeal to the sport target shooter because of 
the weapon's accuracy at long distances but are "very cumbersome for hunting." 
</P>
<P>
They also have the disadvantage of looking fearsome and deadly, he said, which 
has probably pushed many a hot button. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the looks of the weapons have a lot to do with" opposition to the 
guns, Bromberg said. "When people see someone go into a schoolyard and shoot a 
bunch of children, their senses are so inflamed that all they see is an AK-47. 
If the crazies out there had been using something other than AK-47s, there 
wouldn't be so much going on now about AK-47s." 
</P>
<P>
When Bromberg, a Newport Beach resident, owned his AK-47, he said, he used it 
strictly as a target rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bromberg sold his AK-47 two years ago "because I had accomplished what 
I wanted to accomplish with it," he said he now regrets selling it and is in 
the market for another one. Its "capacity and maneuverability and accuracy," he 
said, recommend it as an effective self-defense weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a survivalist," he said, "and I don't believe that you or I have to 
turn our homes into arsenals against someone coming to get us. But if, God 
forbid, you are in a situation where you have to defend yourself with a handgun 
and your opponents are using a semiautomatic weapon, it would be like throwing 
rocks at them." 
</P>
<P>
(The AK-47, like the AR-15, the Uzi and all semiautomatic weapons, fires a 
round each time the trigger is squeezed. A fully automatic weapon, which fires 
a rapid, constant spray of bullets while the trigger remains pulled, is what is 
known as a machine gun and is illegal in California for the general public. 
Assault-type weapons sold legally in California are semiautomatic, although 
their military antecedents are fully automatic.) 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the shooters and owners interviewed for this story said they 
would not oppose registering assault weapons or having a 15-day waiting period 
imposed on their purchase. But every gun enthusiast interviewed strongly 
opposed legislation to bar the sale and possession of the rifles. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally think the AK is ugly," one said, "but there's no reason to hate 
it just because it's a semiautomatic weapon." 
</P>
<P>
And at a recent gun collectors' show and sale at the Orange County Fairgrounds, 
exhibitors selling assault rifles encountered not hatred but a great deal of 
enthusiasm for the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is booming," said Maurice Danaher, a dealer for Mitchell Arms Inc. of 
Santa Ana. "Those clowns up in L.A. have got everybody scared. Before all the 
attention . . . I'd sell one or two assault rifles at a show. Now I can't get 
enough. People who don't even know how to load them are buying them." 
</P>
<P>
And buying continues to be a simple process. 
</P>
<P>
By California law, such weapons can be taken home the same day, provided the 
buyer has the money and agrees to sign a form for the dealer asserting that the 
buyer: 
</P>
<P>
Is not a convicted felon or mental patient on leave from a mental institution. 
</P>
<P>
Has not been adjudicated by a court as being a danger to others. 
</P>
<P>
Has not been found incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Is not addicted to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Has not been found guilty by reason of insanity in any crime. 
</P>
<P>
(Buyers of handguns must wait 15 days to pick up their weapons while their 
backgrounds are checked. There is no waiting period for shotguns or rifles.) 
</P>
<P>
While many buyers may be snapping up the guns in reaction to the Los Angeles 
ordinance, Danaher said, others are motivated by nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the people who buy them," he said, "are Vietnam vets who are 
nostalgic for the type of gun they had then. With the younger guys, they buy 
them more for target shooting than anything else. That's what they're for: 
target shooting for fun." 
</P>
<P>
Standing nearby, Bill Spincola of Mission Viejo -- an Army veteran who said he 
carried the M-16 during his four-year hitch -- said "there's a kind of mystique 
about these weapons. I think it's kind of like a trend. When the Rambo movies 
came out, there was a run on these kinds of guns. For me, (the AR-15 displayed 
at Danaher's booth) has historical value, and it's just a neat machine." 
</P>
<P>
Non-veterans, said Bromberg, a former Marine reservist, probably "have a 
fascination with military-style weapons." 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people go for them because of the John Wayne syndrome," 
Bromberg said, "but that wears thin after a while." 
</P>
<P>
Still, at the gun show, John Wayne was served up as a selling tool. One dealer 
who was selling semiautomatic versions of the Ingram Mac-10 -- a small, 
pistol-like military assault weapon originally manufactured as an automatic gun 
-- attracted customers by playing a videotape of Wayne firing a Mac-10 in the 
film "McQ." 
</P>
<P>
In the picture, Wayne, who is introduced to the weapon at a firing range, 
riddles a barrel of water with a short, intense burst and walks away 
awe-struck. 
</P>
<P>
On another videotape monitor, a dealer advertised a lever-type trigger assembly 
that allows the semiautomatic weapon's shooter to modify the gun to fire a 
bullet when the trigger lever is both pulled and pushed. A gun modified with 
the device remains semiautomatic and, therefore, legal under federal law 
because the weapon is still not capable of expelling bullets in a steady 
stream. 
</P>
<P>
Semiautomatic assault weapons in their present legal incarnations are not 
inherently more deadly than their more conventional hunting-style cousins, Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Purdy, he said, "probably" could have wreaked equal havoc in Stockton 
had he used a more common semiautomatic weapon of a caliber and clip capacity 
similar to the AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not agree with those people who try to say that this (gun) is inherently 
more dangerous than that (gun)," Block said. "A semiautomatic rifle is a 
semiautomatic rifle, whether it was designed for military or other purposes, 
and the reality is that semiautomatic military weapons have been available for 
many years, certainly since World War II or thereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
"But the reality also is that it's only been in the last four or five years 
that semiautomatic weapons of this type have become a problem relative to 
criminal violence. This is a phenomenon that I really can't explain, but it 
almost seems to correlate with the beginning of importation of significant 
numbers of these weapons from foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason," he added, "the American-made, existing, semiautomatic 
military weapons don't seem to have any great appeal to gang members and drug 
dealers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular With Drug Dealers 
</P>
<P>
The foreign-made weapons, particularly AK-47s, are popular with drug dealers 
and gangs because of their easy accessibility and their low price, Los Angeles 
Police Department spokesman Don Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the rapid-fire weapons are in the price range of $600, $700 or $800," 
he said. "But you can buy an AK-47 for around $300 or so." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Lawrence said, a weapon such as the AK-47 may become "the weapon of 
choice because it's talked about a lot" in gang hierarchies. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say that I picked up an AK-47," Lawrence said, "and I have a lot of 
people who look up to me. They might say, 'Hey, Don has an AK-47. I want one 
too.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Favors Removal 
</P>
<P>
Block said he favors removing the guns that generate that appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"The effort I support," he said, "is one that tries to focus on that narrow 
range of weapons . . . (and) prohibit semiautomatic, military assault weapons 
generically, but provide an exemption for those semiautomatic or hunting 
weapons that have been on the scene for years." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, referring to the Los Angeles prohibition of assault weapons, "I 
do not subscribe to the recommendations for confiscation (of any weapons). If 
the weapon was obtained legally and in good faith by a law-abiding citizen, 
that person should be able to apply for a license for it and be scrutinized for 
criminal background or drug use or mental illness." 
</P>
<P>
In the current panic-buying climate, however, even people with an aversion to 
the weapons are buying them as a hedge against the day when they may be 
illegal, one Orange County gun show dealer said. 
</P>
<P>
"People tell me, 'I don't like the AK, but I'm gonna buy a couple of them now,' 
" said Darren Johnson, who said he had sold nearly 200 AK-47s in one week. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't need them," he said. "They don't really have a purpose for them. 
People like to go out into the desert and shoot and feel powerful." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Desert Firing Range 
</P>
<P>
The desert is where James Everett fired his assault weapons -- an AR-15, a 
Galil (an Israeli-made assault rifle) and an Italian Fie SPAS 12-gauge shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
However, he tired of them and took them to the gun show to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd buy an assault rifle," said Everett, who lives in Santa 
Ana and works in the personnel department on the battleship Missouri in Long 
Beach. "I bought these just basically to plink around. I also collect." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Everett said he does not know "what drives people to buy them. The 
animal instinct to destroy something, maybe. There's no purpose to having them 
in your home. The big revolution isn't coming." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Chris Draper, a Huntington Beach tool dealer, said he has no 
intention of using his AR-15 for protection. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the AR would be a fairly stupid home-protection weapon," he said. 
"There are pistols that would more than adequately accomplish that. Even if 
civil disorder should strike, using that weapon against people hasn't even 
crossed my mind." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Bought as Reaction 
</P>
<P>
Draper said he bought his AR-15 in reaction to the Los Angeles ordinance and 
the news coverage that accompanied it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in my plans to buy an assault-type rifle for my gun collection," he 
said, "but I wouldn't have bought it now if it hadn't been for the media hype." 
</P>
<P>
Draper said his AR-15 is a target-shooting weapon only. 
</P>
<P>
But why the AR-15 and not a more conventional target gun? 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good question," Draper said. "I probably would just have bought a .22 
(-caliber) long rifle before all the news media reports about the assault 
weapons. That and the fact that if I didn't it would probably be worth twice as 
much in 6 months. I bought mine for $735, and I figure I got a deal." 
</P>
<P>
For Draper, the long-distance accuracy of the AR-15 is the big plus. 
</P>
<P>
"My attraction to the AR," he said, "is that it's a very well-crafted piece of 
weaponry, very easy to handle, and when you're shooting it's a lot of fun. The 
object of target shooting is to lay in a fairly tight group of your shots. If 
you can't do that, the piece isn't fun to shoot. If you can, it is. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't that much different from getting up on Sunday morning and driving a 
ball accurately off the tee." 
</P>
<P>
Many foes of the weapons, of course, do not see such a relationship. They see 
killing machines. Their defenders assert, however, that had Patrick Purdy 
opened fire on the Stockton schoolchildren with a semiautomatic, hunting-style 
rifle with clip capacity, caliber and power similar to the AK-47 -- a gun just 
as cheap and easy to obtain -- the consequences would have been just as 
horrifying. 
</P>
<P>
Other semiautomatic guns "don't kill you any less," Bromberg said. "There's no 
good way to die."

MUSIC CENTER HONORS TOP DONORS; 
</P>
<P>
IT ISN'T ALWAYS EASY FOR CONTRIBUTORS TO FUND THOSE GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Contrary to common belief, those huge sums given by major donors to charity 
aren't always easily given. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, at the Music Center reception Wednesday evening in The Founders, 
feting Gold Circle Patrons of the Arts (donations of $500,000 or more), 
Distinguished Patrons of the Arts (known as DPA's -- $250,000 or more) and 
Benefactors ($100,000 or more), Peggy Parker, who this year became a DPA, noted 
when asked how she was feeling, "I feel very poor." She added, "But I feel very 
committed to the Music Center." 
</P>
<P>
Club 100 president Diane Morton told how she and her husband, Leon, arrived at 
their $100,000 gift: "When I began working for the Music Center, we pledged 
$5,000, and then we bought a 'treewell' (a gift of $20,000 for a tree at the 
Music Center), and then I told Leon, 'If we're ever going to give, we've got to 
give now, because the price (to become a Benefactor) is going up to $150,000 in 
July. And you've got to put your money where your mouth is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Auerbachs 
</P>
<P>
Holding hands, Lisa and Ernest Auerbach smiled for the photographer and seemed 
relaxed about their Gold Circle gift. Auerbach, a Southern California 
commercial developer, wanted only to discuss his wife: "Married 42 years -- I'm 
ready to kiss her again. I'm giving a 70th birthday for her at the Regency Club 
on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph J. Pinola, chairman of the Music Center Board of Governors and chairman 
and CEO, First Interstate Bancorp, was at the podium to introduce special 
guests Fred Nicholas, chairman of the Walt Disney Concert Hall Committee, and 
Daniel Dworsky, chairman of Dworsky Associates, who has recently been named 
executive architect to work in association with architect Frank O. Gehry to 
design the future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Joe and Dorie Pinola 
are among the Music Center's Benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
Getting kudos from Esther Wachtell, the Music Center's president, were 
Distinguished Patrons in attendance -- Lila and Roy Ash, Sally and Robert Hunt, 
Hedy and Ted Orden, Esther and Abe M. Zarem, and Peggy Parker, attending with 
Walter Grauman. Distinguished Patrons James and Sally Thomas couldn't come. 
</P>
<P>
New Benefactors of recent months attending, in addition to the Pinolas and the 
Mortons, included Martin and Ann Albert, Denise and Jeffrey Berg, Alice and 
Joseph Coulombe, Betty Freeman, Louise and Herold Held, Keith and Bill 
Kieschnick, Eugene and Maxine Rosenfeld and Hope and Lee Warner. Also 
Benefactors, but not there, were Douglas S. Cramer, Warren and Alyce Williamson 
and Susan and David Wilstein. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Givers in Attendance 
</P>
<P>
To welcome them all to the fold, big givers such as Dan Frost (honorary Music 
Center chairman and a Distinguished Patron of the Arts), Gerald and Virginia 
Oppenheimer and Annette and Peter O'Malley were in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Nicholas, who also is chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art (the 
Disney Hall will form a glass-roofed oasis to link the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion and the MOCA), paid special tribute to the Disney Foundation: "I have 
never met a more generous donor . . . . She (Lillian Disney, widow of Walt 
Disney) told me: 'All I want is a building I can be proud of -- that reflects 
Walt Disney -- and that provides great music.' She does not want her name on 
it."

SEMINARS OFFER BEAUTY TECHNIQUES FOR CANCER PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eighteen months ago, Fay Fox of Northridge woke up to find 50% of her hair 
strewn all over her bed. She touched her head and more fell out. That afternoon 
she got out a razor and shaved her head. Today, her chemotherapy treatment for 
breast cancer completed, there are traces of new growth on her scalp, but she's 
not sure she wants a head full of hair any more. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had so many people tell me how beautiful I am before," admits Fox, 
who, wearing high-fashion makeup and clothing and bold jeweled earrings, 
presents a dramatic, confident image. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I could just be a bald woman or I could do everything to look like 
I'm making a fashion statement," she explains. "Looking my best has helped me 
to get through this." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of cancer patients like Fox have faced the same problems when they 
underwent chemotherapy. Unfortunately, many patients don't know how to face 
what they see in the mirror. They not only lose scalp hair, but eyebrows, 
eyelashes and body hair. With radiation treatments, skin can turn sallow or 
blotchy. With cancer surgery, a patient's positive self-image can be 
undermined. 
</P>
<P>
As an aid to women who are attempting to overcome the emotional side effects of 
the disease, Diane Doan Noyes, a victor over ovarian cancer, and Peggy Mellody, 
an oncology nurse, have written "Beauty and Cancer" (AC Press, $12.95). 
</P>
<P>
The book, available at Nordstrom stores, provides information and helpful hints 
about how to look better, and thus feel better, while undergoing cancer 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"I found that people treated me like I was sick when I looked sick," Noyes told 
a group of more than 100 cancer patients who had gathered at Nordstrom's 
Topanga store for a Beauty and Cancer seminar Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked good they treated me like a normal person." It was that thought, 
she said, that inspired her to collaborate with Noyes on their book. 
</P>
<P>
The authors write about special cosmetic techniques that simulate the look of 
eyelashes and eyebrows. They also discuss the use of foundations and blushers 
to add sparkle to a complexion sallowed by the disease and its treatment. There 
is also a major section devoted to wigs and head-wrap techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"Most women aren't comfortable shaving their heads," Seattle-based Noyes says. 
"I certainly wasn't. So I wore head wraps -- dramatic ones -- every single 
day." 
</P>
<P>
She learned by trial and error that a hairless head requires cotton scarfs -- 
they don't slip off and they help to retain body heat. She also learned that 
most stores don't stock them. 
</P>
<P>
She also found that most cosmetics advisers are not trained to show cancer 
patients new techniques for applying eyebrow pencil where there are no brows or 
eyeliner where there are no lashes. In addition, salespeople don't always 
understand the functional fashion needs of cancer patients who have had 
mastectomies or wear some form of prosthesis. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing her problems with a Nordstrom salesclerk eventually resulted in a 
meeting with the president of the Seattle-based chain. 
</P>
<P>
Now Nordstrom carries a wide selection of cotton scarfs in every store, has 
trained the cosmetics advisers in special beauty techniques and has clothing 
available that suits patients' special needs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Noyes and Mellody were instrumental in creating the Beauty and 
Cancer seminars held this month in selected Nordstrom stores. More than 250 
cancer patients have already participated. 
</P>
<P>
Noyes and Mellody are demonstrating many of the cosmetic and head-wrap tricks 
at their seminars at selected Nordstrom stores. Seminars will be held Saturday 
at the MainPlace/Santa Ana store at 8:30 a.m., telephone (714) 972-2020. Also, 
on Sunday the seminars are repeated at the South Coast Plaza store in Costa 
Mesa at 9 a.m., telephone (714) 549-8300. Reservations recommended.

BACK TO THE FUTURE

<DATELINE>
<P>
PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some designers took a giant leap into the past when they showed their fall and 
winter menswear to press and buyers here earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Frock coats reminiscent of those worn by Edwardian dandies looked even dandier 
when shown with knee breeches and ruffled jabot shirts. Brocade vests and 
crushed-velvet trousers added to the time-warp effect. 
</P>
<P>
Strong endorsers of this remembrance of things past were London's Katharine 
Hamnett and Paris' Jean Paul Gaultier, who added to the fun by having all his 
models wear "Lone Ranger" face masks and Dali-esque waxed mustaches. 
</P>
<P>
Both designers, however, frequently anticipate worldwide trends before they 
happen. And if they feel there's a frock coat in your future, maybe there is. 
</P>
<P>
For several seasons now, these French menswear showings have been growing in 
importance. There were more than 30 runway presentations this time around, and 
audiences are larger than before. American retailers who traipsed all over town 
to catch the action included contingents from I. Magnin, Macy's California, 
Bloomingdale's, Barney's and Charivari in New York and a big group from 
Marshall Field in Chicago, which will start a four-month French promotion in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Hamnett made her impact with a small collection. Gaultier kept his audience 
entertained for more than an hour with an extravaganza of ideas: a zip-front, 
checked shirt worn with a checked suit, a version of the Chairman Mao jacket 
over Charlie Chaplin baggy pants, jackets detailed to look as if they're 
inside-out and sophisticated camel overcoats with underarm slits for a 
cape-like effect. 
</P>
<P>
Gaultier's classic, six-button jacket is cut slightly longer and easier for 
next fall, to balance the very narrow stirrup pants tucked into brown leather 
shoes, which looked to have built-in bunions. When that narrow pants shape 
didn't have stirrup straps, it had the update that was seen in every menswear 
collection: cuffs at least 6 inches deep. 
</P>
<P>
Gaultier's colors are usually his favorite murky browns, purples and spinach 
greens, but this time there were explosions of bright orange and red for 
cropped blouson jackets or drawstring-waist parkas, while several of those 
frock coats took on an extra dimension when cut in sunflower yellow or Pacific 
blue. 
</P>
<P>
Bowler hats, fringed silk and wool scarfs bowed high on the neck, those face 
masks and mustaches were the Gaultier accessories. 
</P>
<P>
If Gaultier dazzled with his ingenuity, Claude Montana dazzled with his 
perfectionist approach. As he has been doing for several seasons, Montana 
continues to avoid the tough-edged aggressiveness that once characterized his 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
For winter, everything looked supple, soft, easy and comfortable. Shown his 
way, in muted shades of gray layered from the shirt out to the coat, or in a 
navy and eggplant palette, this was still very much a collection for the 
faithful follower. The individual pieces, however, were such that even the most 
conservative dresser could find lots to buy here, starting with the marvelous 
Montana greatcoats and continuing to his adaptations of classic one-, three- or 
double-buttoned suit jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Pants silhouettes were either loose and pleated, breaking on suede laced shoes, 
or narrow shapes with that deep cuff previously mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Suedes and leathers, usually important here, were less so this season. 
Montana's pumpkin suede blouson added color to a monochromatic color story. He 
also had a version of the Mao -- or could it be an early Beatles -- suit: the 
mid-thigh jacket buttoned to the neck and was worn over narrow pants. 
</P>
<P>
Nino Cerruti sometimes lets his young design assistants try their hands at 
menswear. But before this show, he said: "I wanted to do it all myself; my way 
with comfort and ease." 
</P>
<P>
There were signature touches, such as deep cuffs and Cerruti's sportier version 
of the Mao suit (his looked more like a Chinese worker's outfit), but done 
simply and with elegance. 
</P>
<P>
As at Montana, almost all his suit looks were shown tie-less. The few ties 
Cerruti did show were the tie news of the season: wide and soft. 
</P>
<P>
Cerruti called the evening portion of his show "cocooning," and instead of 
sending out traditional black-tie looks, sent out the models in faded tartan 
dressing gowns edged in blanket fringe or at-home velvet smoking jackets on 
tartan stay-at-home trousers. 
</P>
<P>
Thierry Mugler has his own strong menswear look, but even he seemed to be 
softening up for fall/winter. Colors like violet and lime took some of the 
sternness out of those Mugler uniforms: collarless jackets snapped shut at the 
waist over narrow pants. Here too, the collarless coat was great looking in a 
murky brown. 
</P>
<P>
Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garcons seemed in a more relaxed 
mood. But both collections, with their navy jackets tipped or piped in white 
and shown with white corduroy pants, looked more summer than winter. 
</P>
<P>
Yamamoto's approach was more straightforward than it has ever been, with the 
proportions of jackets, sweaters and trousers well within norms acceptable to 
most men. 
</P>
<P>
In a more extravagant mood were Marithe and Francois Girbaud, where pant shapes 
ranged from knickers to jodhpurs to knee breeches. Some jackets, in this 
bicentenary year of the French Revolution, looked pure Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
They, as well as London's Paul Smith and Nikos Apostolopoulos, were big fans of 
velvet fabric, using it in everything from vests to jackets and trousers. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's best looks were his dark-background, printed velvet floral shirts and 
vests, which were worn with pinwale cords. 
</P>
<P>
Nikos, who made his reputation with sexy men's underwear, now does an entire 
collection ranging from Count Dracula capes to Flash Gordon silver motorcycle 
jackets. The more commercial items included layered blousons, the underneath 
one in denim, the top one in brushed wool.

ALL THAT JAZZ HARDLY PAYS FOR GROCERIES

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asked about making a living in San Diego, local jazz musicians don't mince 
words. 
</P>
<P>
"Short story, huh?" joked Mark Hunter, the bass player for the group 
Fattburger. 
</P>
<P>
"You can do it if you're 22 years old with no responsibilities and you live at 
home where food is good and rent is cheap," said jazz pianist Shep Meyers, 52. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the scene is very bad," said jazz vocalist Coral Thuet. "There 
aren't any clubs to play in. The only ones for locals are Croce's and the Loft. 
It's really a drag." 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting desperate for these guys," said David Fargo, general manager at 
Vic's in La Jolla, which books jazz. "I get more calls than I ever had before 
about playing our restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
The weak local scene has caused players like pianist Art Resnick and bass man 
Dave Marr to leave for greener pastures in Europe and elsewhere. That probably 
wouldn't include Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, it's worse up there," said bass player Bob Magnusson. "I lived 
there for a while. The reason is, you have that whole group of guys who are 
fine studio players. They want to come out and play, and they aren't concerned 
with money, because they make six figures in the studios. Many nights their bar 
tabs at places like Donte's and the Baked Potato are more than their pay. Guys 
make $28 or $32 to play for three or four hours. It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
The tendency in San Diego is to peg club owners as penny pinchers, and blame 
them for the low pay. But they aren't entirely at fault. After all, they have 
their own financial realities, and San Diegans just don't seem as interested in 
hearing live jazz as they are in Top 40 or rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the clubs can't afford to pay any more than they do. 
</P>
<P>
Local 325, the musicians union, might be expected to act as a go-between, 
helping to improve wages for members. The union classifies clubs as A, B or C, 
according to their size and what they can afford to pay. Croce's is a B, for 
example, Diego's Loft, an A. But the union doesn't seem forceful when it comes 
to money. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty dollars for four hours is the going rate in the clubs," said Edward 
Arias, the union's local business representative. 
</P>
<P>
"The union has kind of faded here," said bass man Magnusson. "Most everyone's a 
member, but the union doesn't seem able to do much." 
</P>
<P>
The demise of key local jazz clubs, and format changes at other night spots 
that previously featured jazz have made the situation worse. When Our Place in 
Hillcrest closed two years ago, San Diego jazz musicians lost a good friend. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a club that everyone could play without restrictions," Thuet said. 
"It was sort of a neighborhood bar, kind of a dive, but in a good sense. That 
was where all the musicians hung out. They always had great bands. Even though 
the money wasn't good, they made up for it because you could play whatever you 
wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the Bella Via in Cardiff was sold and, under the new name 
Pastels, no longer offers jazz. Musicians once viewed the Bella Via as the 
prime local venue, with its second-story bar offering white-water views and a 
great sound system. PAX in La Jolla, a restaurant which booked jazz, went out 
of business. Presto, which replaced it, features mostly rock and reggae. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Croce's in downtown San Diego and Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach 
aren't the only local clubs regularly booking jazz, just the most active when 
it comes to "straight ahead" jazz, with its roots in the jazz of the '40s and 
'50s. The Horton Grand Hotel downtown features jazz in its Palace Bar. Vic's in 
La Jolla offers jazz several nights a week. The Jazz Mine record store in La 
Jolla holds occasional concerts. Several clubs host KIFM's brand of "Lites Out 
Jazz," hybrid music scornfully dubbed by purists as "elevator" or "Valium" 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
And there is Elario's, which features big-name national jazz talents, often 
backed by local musicians. But only a few locals get to play; the house rhythm 
section generally consists of pianist Mike Wofford, drummer Jim Plank and bass 
player Magnusson. 
</P>
<P>
The pay for the "name" acts is surprisingly modest. Steve Satkowski, who does 
the booking, declined to give specific figures, but said name players earn more 
than $150 per night. Many earn an additional $230 if they tape a half-hour 
KPBS-TV "Club Date" show when they're in town. Other sources said the pay at 
Elario's has been as little as $400 per week for five nights. The local backup 
musicians get $70 or $80 for a four-hour gig. 
</P>
<P>
At least one nationally known jazz man reportedly turned down an Elario's 
invitation because of the money. Other musicians, though, like playing the La 
Jolla club. They view a two-week gig there, with meals and an ocean-view room, 
as a vacation from the craziness of Los Angeles or New York. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, name acts earn thousands when they do one-night stands in San 
Diego, according to San Diego Jazz Festival promoter Rob Hagey. The San Diego 
Jazz Festival is a foundation set up by Hagey to offset losses when jazz dates 
fail to cover expenses, as it did recently when drummer Art Blakey made an 
appearance at Bacchanal in Kearney Mesa. Hagey said the show cost about $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Salaries for one-night dates by comparable luminaries range from $4,500 for 
pianist McCoy Tyner to $12,000 to $15,000 for trumpeter Miles Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The money for local musicians is especially slim for those who play 
traditional, or "straight ahead" jazz, rather than the more lucrative, light 
jazz often heard on KIFM (98.1) and KSWV-FM (102.9). Straight ahead players' 
pay ranges from $30 for a three-hour afternoon gig at Croce's to $75 to $100 
for four hours at Diego's Loft, where local musicians play about two-thirds of 
the dates, with the rest taken by national acts. 
</P>
<P>
Bands playing on KIFM's "Lites Out Jazz" circuit, which hits a different San 
Diego club every night of the week, can make $400 to $700 a night playing such 
spots as the Rusty Pelican, Humphrey's, the B St. Cafe and City Colors. 
</P>
<P>
"The circuit is really good," said David Ochs, the guitarist in Most Valuable 
Players, which appears often in the "Lites Out" clubs. Ochs, married with kids, 
works as a plumber to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck's Steak House, which is not a "Lites Out" participant but a place where 
that kind of jazz is often heard, is reportedly one of the lowest paying rooms 
in town. Sources say that bands at Chuck's Steak House get $150 plus 10% of the 
bar, which can amount to about $200 total. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego jazz musicians often turn to "casuals" to make ends meet. Such 
occasions as weddings and corporate parties actually pay better than club 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
Piano man Meyers said a casual performance can easily earn him $150. Jazz 
pianist Joe Azarello said the range for a three-hour casual by a solo piano 
player is $75 to $250. 
</P>
<P>
To make it financially, musicians find themselves expanding their repertoires 
to meet a variety of requests -- not necessarily jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist and bass player Richard James, who plays piano three nights a week at 
the U.S. Grant Hotel downtown, and three days a week inside the La Jolla 
Village Square shopping mall, said that he knows between 500 and 1,000 songs, 
ranging from "Hello Dolly" to obscure Delta blues numbers. He'd rather play 
pure jazz, he said, but there is the matter of earning a living. Even so, he 
doesn't seem bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm doing is working on a lot of things," he said. "The notion is what I 
was last year and what I am today are related. The notion of growth, of 
learning, is extremely important to a musician. Trying to keep up with the 
marketplace, to keep the money rolling in, forces you to be perceptive." 
</P>
<P>
Commercial work is even more lucrative for the lucky few musicians who get the 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"This afternoon, I was in the studio doing jingles," Fattburger's Hunter said 
recently. "We taped a theme for the 'Attitudes' show on the Lifetime channel. I 
made $300 in six hours." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter also played on radio and TV commercials for American Savings, fruitful 
jobs because they offer musicians royalty payments every 90 days as long as the 
commercial is in use. Royalties amount to 75% of the original fee, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how they scrape a living together, life is hectic for the jazz 
musicians. Meyers recently went two weeks without a day off. During a 
particularly hectic week, he played as many as three gigs a day. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best week I ever had," Meyers said, adding that he had made $700 
to $800. "You don't want to be 50 years old and playing clubs all your life. 
I'm always going to play, but it would be nice just to be recognized for your 
own material. I think every artist in town feels the same way. You play other 
material as a springboard for your own, to show off your talent. I'm one of the 
more successful musicians in town, and I can't imagine I'm living beyond the 
poverty level."

AMERICAN FILM MARKET OPENS WITH HIGH HOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 10,000 film buyers, sellers and gawkers are expected to converge here 
during the next week for the biggest-ever American Film Market exposition. The 
ninth annual event opened Thursday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, hoping to rival 
Cannes as an international marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to giving film distributors and producers a showcase for their 
latest wares, the Culver City-based American Film Market Assn. will be hosting 
a series of seminars, focusing on controversial topics in the entertainment 
business. This year the seminars range from selling movies inside the Iron 
Curtain to the use of European money to pump new life into the flagging 
fortunes of many of Hollywood's independent producers. 
</P>
<P>
But the chief subject being discussed among film marketers this year centers in 
Europe, not Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address, a former cultural affairs commissioner for the 
Commission of the European Communities zeroed in on the topic that seems to be 
driving the most fear into the hearts of moguls and would-be moguls these days: 
the possibility that European nations might begin imposing a quota system on 
American film and television producers after 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the U.S. and Europe are producing around 600 films per year, give or take 
10 or 20% . . . ," said Italian-born Carlo Rippa di Meana. "Now, American films 
account for 60%, on an average, of films in European theaters." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, on the other hand, only about 3% of the films shown each 
year are European products, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you find this appalling?" he asked an audience of about 500 exposition 
delegates at the keynote luncheon on Wednesday. "I do." 
</P>
<P>
Di Meana remained optimistic when questioned from the floor about quotas, 
however, stressing that "a quota system will not solve our problem" and 
suggesting that such a proposal has limited support among European Common 
Market nations. 
</P>
<P>
Of the movies that European film makers produce, only about 20% are ever 
distributed out of their country of origin, said Di Meana. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, delegates from the 12 member nations of the European Executive 
Commission suggested that a ceiling of 60% might be imposed on the number of 
non-European produced films and TV programs that could be shown in Western 
European countries by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
According to some industry estimates, the lucrative European market ($1 billion 
in TV sales alone in 1987) could double by 1992. If quotas are imposed, 
however, the American share of that windfall might shrink. 
</P>
<P>
The American Film Market will wind up next Friday with a seminar on television 
programming opportunities and pitfalls in Europe, circa 1992.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: THEATER / NANCY CHURNIN: INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS ARE LEFT OUT 
IN COLD BY COMBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, an artist with a dream could apply for money from the county 
fund-raising arm, the Combined Arts and Education Council, also known as COMBO. 
</P>
<P>
This year, there is no point in applying. Money once earmarked for the projects 
of individual artists is no longer there. And so far, no new money has surfaced 
to take its place. 
</P>
<P>
Such a prospect could leave the talented but unaffiliated producers so 
necessary to the growth of San Diego's artistic community without hope. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year National Endowment for the Arts grant earmarked for individual 
artists' projects ran out in December. The $150,000, distributed by COMBO, was 
supplemented by $300,000 from the city of San Diego. The city has since taken 
back its contribution and earmarked it for the newly formed Cultural Arts 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming a lack of sufficient funds to award individuals, Michael Lyon, director 
of community relations for COMBO, said his organization now funds projects for 
groups with at least two years' tax status as nonprofit companies. The 
semiannual allocations, to be announced Monday, include more than $100,000 to 
25 groups. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon said he lobbied the city to take over the job of funding individual 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cultural Arts Commission, which had considered setting up four support 
levels -- three of them for arts organizations with budgets of $2 million-plus, 
$300,000 to $1,999,999 and less than $300,000 -- indefinitely postponed plans 
for the level that would have addressed the needs of the independents. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Hamilton, head of the Cultural Arts Commission, said the commission 
will process the newly released applications for organizations, due back March 
17, before addressing the issue of individual artists. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission has recommended designing a special-projects category which 
might be a challenge grant or a one-time-only funding program for individual 
artists," Hamilton said. "We have not identified any sources of funding, and we 
don't know what the program is going to look like yet." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Schuette, artistic director of Sushi Gallery, who works largely with what 
she calls "generative" artists (because they generate original work), believes 
the commission will take care of individuals -- eventually. 
</P>
<P>
Schuette said she's optimistic because people are at least aware that there's a 
need to fund individuals -- a concept, she said, that wasn't around before the 
NEA, the city and COMBO began distributing these funds three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a whole institution of never funding the generative artist," she 
said. "The generative artist keeps an artistic community healthy. But they've 
always been left out in the cold." 
</P>
<P>
Bary Odom, the new costume director for United States International University, 
found designing costumes for the current USIU production of "My Fair Lady" a 
challenge -- if a sumptuous one. 
</P>
<P>
In his designs, Odom battles the temptation to imitate the lavish, lauded "My 
Fair Lady" costumes of Sir Cecil Beaton, the artist whose works are now on 
exhibit at the San Diego Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Odom, whose own designs are wonderfully lavish, said he's admired Beaton ever 
since Beaton photographed the costumes Odom supervised for the film "Nijinsky." 
</P>
<P>
"He was wonderful, inspirational and eccentric, just like the characters in 'My 
Fair Lady,' " Odom said. 
</P>
<P>
Even more challenging than this job, he said, was the time he designed for 
Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so big. By the time you have the barest costume on him, you have 25 
yards." 
</P>
<P>
And the sweetest job? 
</P>
<P>
Fitting Elizabeth Taylor for her first wedding to Richard Burton. 
</P>
<P>
"She wore a very pretty lemon chiffon affair with tendrils of flowers and 
leaves," Odom recalled. "She was a nice lady, and a beautiful bride." 
</P>
<P>
John Highkin, the director of "Conversations in Exile" at the Big Kitchen 
Dinner Theatre, has a hot date after his twice-extended show continues this 
weekend. The assistant director on the Old Globe Theatre productions of "Tea" 
and "There's One in Every Marriage," will fly to Seattle March 7 to become the 
assistant director to Daniel Sullivan, artistic director of the Seattle 
Repertory Theatre, on Sullivan's adaptation of Carlo Goldoni's "The Servant of 
Two Masters." Highkin, who made the acquaintance of Big Kitchen owner Judy 
Forman when he prepared food, briefly, in her not-so-big kitchen, was 
originally to start work in Seattle this Wednesday. But Sullivan, whose theater 
is represented by two smash-hit New York plays ("Eastern Standard" and "The 
Heidi Chronicles"), had to fly to New York to transfer "The Heidi Chronicles" 
from Off-Broadway to on. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Glasnost may be an oft-heard expression at the upcoming Soviet 
Arts Festival, but the concept does not seem to have traveled to the Soviet 
satellite of Czechoslavakia. Renowned playwright Vaclav Havel was sentenced to 
nine months in prison for showing up at a rally to commemorate a student 
protester of the Soviet-led invasion of Prague in 1968. . . . "Sister Mary 
Ignatius Explains It All for You" comes to the Lyceum Space March 3-April 9 via 
Catfish productions, a local independent company. The Christopher Durang satire 
of Catholicism was banned in St. Louis because it upset the Archdiocese there. 
. . . One of the co-authors of "Tango/Orfeo," the newly named third production 
of the La Jolla Playhouse season, is Jim Lewis, who finished his graduate work 
at UC San Diego. His co-author, Graciela Daniele, was the co-director and 
choreographer of "Blood Wedding," which opened the Old Globe Theatre's season 
last year. . . . Sledgehammer Theatre plans to be back in the old Re-In 
Carnation Building on April 20 for "Endgame." The audience will not follow the 
production around in the chilly warehouse as it did in the last Sledgehammer 
production, "Blow Out the Sun," said Scott Feldsher, the company's artistic 
director. Samuel Beckett's play will be performed in a different, warmer part 
of the theater, and the audience will even get to sit.

COLD HITS DEEP SOUTH; FLORIDA GETS SNOW

Bitter cold swept into the Deep South, dropping snow on Dixie and plunging 
temperatures below freezing as far south as Florida. The National Weather 
Service said the cold wave stretched from northern Minnesota and New England to 
central Texas and the Florida Panhandle. Snow fell in northern Florida and a 
quarter-inch was reported at Demopolis, Ala. Freeze warnings were posted over 
northern and east-central Florida, and advisories were posted across Georgia 
for record-breaking cold and below-zero wind chills. The weather service said 
low temperature records would be broken or tied over much of Arkansas also. In 
Tennessee, nearly 2 feet of snow fell in the Great Smoky Mountains, closing the 
heavily traveled Highway 441. In Memphis, the temperature fell to 17 degrees, 
breaking a record that had stood for a century.

A judge in Oxnard declared a mistrial for a defendant in a drug possession 
trial when three jurors made an unauthorized visit to the alleged crime scene 
to see how long it takes a toilet to flush. The jury foreman told Ventura 
County Superior Court Judge Robert Bradley that the jurors visited an apartment 
to test the truth of defendant Nelson Cortez's testimony that he was awakened 
by the sound of a toilet flushing. Cortez had said he went into the bathroom 
and was immediately arrested by waiting police after officers found a bag of 
cocaine in the bowl. Based in part on their investigation, the panel voted to 
convict Cortez, the foreman said. Bradley declared the mistrial because the 
apartment visit was "serious misconduct." Jurors had been told not to visit the 
crime scene.

Residents of the Soviet autonomous republic of Kalmyk, where more than two 
dozen children were infected with the deadly AIDS virus, have been the objects 
of abuse by fearful neighbors, a newspaper reported. Writing in the government 
newspaper Izvestia, poet David Kugultinov said residents of nearby areas have 
begun throwing stones at cars bearing license plates from Kalmyk, located 
between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, "as if the cars are spreading AIDS." 
Kugultinov urged the Soviet Union to adopt measures to prohibit discrimination 
against victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

Austrian Social Affairs Minister Alfred Dallinger was one of 11 people killed 
in the crash of a twin-engine plane into Lake Constance near the Swiss-Austrian 
border. The plane, a Commander AC 90, belonging to an Austrian air company, was 
on an internal flight from Vienna to the province of Vorarlberg, carrying nine 
passengers and a crew of two. Police said the plane crashed after the pilot 
aborted an approach to the airport at Hohenems because of fog and tried to fly 
over Lake Constance to Alterhein in Switzerland. The cause of the crash was not 
immediately known.

MARRIAGE LAW CHANGE URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bar Assn. of San Francisco has voted to support a change in the law that 
would permit legal marriages between people of the same sex, a legal newspaper 
reported. The Banner Daily Journal said the 8,000-member association voted to 
support a change in California's Civil Code that would have the effect of 
putting to rest all debates over "domestic partners" legislation. State law now 
defines marriage for legal purposes as specifically involving one man and one 
woman. The suggested wording would define marriage as a "personal relation 
arising out of a civil contract between two people." Association President 
Peter Keane said the resolution was intended to correct "invidious 
discrimination against non-heterosexuals."

Israeli-backed militiamen patrolling southern Lebanon shot and killed three 
guerrillas from a radical PLO faction who were on their way to attack a target 
in Israel, an Israeli army spokesman said. The Marxist guerrilla group said in 
a statement that the three fighters killed three Israeli soldiers and two 
Christian militiamen before they were gunned down, but the army spokesman said 
no militiamen from the South Lebanon Army were injured in the clash. The three 
were reportedly killed about a mile north of the Israeli border. Documents on 
the bodies of the heavily armed guerrillas showed they were members of Nayef 
Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical faction 
of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

The decision last week by the nation's two biggest bookstore chains to pull 
Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses" from their shelves has brought a new 
outpouring of complaints about the chains' tremendous influence on how widely 
books are distributed and even which ones get published. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the B. Dalton-Barnes &amp; Noble chain reversed its position not 
to sell the novel, and Waldenbooks has promised to resume selling the book from 
its stockroom when new copies arrive from the publisher. But all the same, many 
in the book world say the incident again demonstrates how much power the chains 
have acquired since their explosive growth began in the mid-1970s. When the 
chief executives of the two top chains yanked the book, they blocked sales in 
about 2,200 of the country's roughly 7,000 general-interest bookstores, critics 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The critics, who include writers, publishers and independent bookstore owners, 
say the chains' power is exerted quietly every day as they decide which books 
to carry. With the huge orders that they place with publishers, and with their 
enormous promotional budgets, the chains' decisions help assure that some works 
will be best sellers while others are consigned to obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
And as the chains offer their mass-market inventory at discount prices, they 
can also force out of business the independent stores that try to make their 
way selling a broader selection of less popular works, as well as blockbusters, 
the critics say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Amendment Defenders 
</P>
<P>
The chains, of course, have staunch defenders in the book industry, who see 
merit in their concern about their employees' safety and praise the big firms 
for bringing low-price works to neighborhoods that have never had book outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Since the furor over "The Satanic Verses" began last week, booksellers have 
confronted questions of whether they have an obligation to bring books -- even 
controversial ones -- before the public. Some say that they do and that the 
chains have not lived up to that obligation, as the independents have. 
</P>
<P>
"The chains are brilliant at marketing, and they've changed the face of the 
bookselling industry," said Mona Mangan, executive director of the Writers 
Guild of America East. "But they don't have that commitment to getting books 
before the public. It's the little neighborhood bookstore that's out there 
today defending the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
The president of the booksellers' trade group that includes the Waldenbooks and 
B. Dalton-Barnes &amp; Noble chains also said he found "some merit" in 
criticism of the chains' withdrawal of the book. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this illustrates the Achilles' heel of centralizing the 
industry," said Edward Morrow, president of the American Booksellers Assn. and 
owner of an independent store in Manchester, Vt. The chains' decisions meant 
that the book wouldn't be available at all in some communities, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
As the chains pulled the book, Morrow said, independent bookstores continued to 
take orders for it, including several that had received bomb threats. "I've 
talked to a lot of independent stores in the last couple of days, and I haven't 
talked to one that said it didn't want to sell the book," Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Remain in Stockroom 
</P>
<P>
But Morrow and others in the book trade also saw the rationale behind the 
chains' decision. "They're extremely visible and extremely vulnerable because 
of their size and locations in so many shopping malls," Morrow said. "It's not 
as easy to ensure everybody's safety at these little outlets as it is if you 
just own one store." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an example of the venal corporate mentality taking over the book 
business," added William Kramer, president of the two-store Sidney Kramer Books 
in Washington. "There are legitimate concerns at stake." 
</P>
<P>
The B. Dalton-Barnes &amp; Noble chain announced Wednesday afternoon that it 
would begin selling the book again in about 10 days, when it receives its next 
supply. The chain said it reversed the decision after a poll of employees found 
"overwhelming" support for selling the book. 
</P>
<P>
The Waldenbooks chain, which last week decided to take Rushdie's novel off its 
shelves and sell it only on request, said it would resume selling the book when 
it comes back in stock. The chain also said it would continue "to use 
discretion in displaying the book." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, a spokesman for Waldenbooks denied that the chains have 
excessive influence on the bookselling business. "We account for only 10% of 
the books sold in this country," the spokesman said. "There are thousands of 
other places books can be sold." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
45% Market Share 
</P>
<P>
The B. Dalton-Barnes &amp; Noble chain did not respond to repeated requests for 
comment, nor did Crown Books. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the comment of the Waldenbooks spokesman, the influence of the chains 
is enormous and growing, although at a slower rate than in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
If Waldenbooks accounts for only 10% of all book sales, Waldenbooks, B. 
Dalton-Barnes &amp; Noble and Crown Books together account for nearly 45% of 
the general-interest fiction and nonfiction works known as trade books, 
according to Jim Baker, editor of Publisher's Weekly. While exact figures are 
not available, the three leading chains' market share is believed to have risen 
from about 40% in the early 1980s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
B. Dalton-Barnes &amp; Noble has about 1,250 stores, while Waldenbooks, a unit 
of K mart, has about 1,200. Crown operates about 200 stores. 
</P>
<P>
The chains' influence has been felt in many ways by authors, publishers and 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
They have brought a new management expertise to the business, with slick 
promotion and marketing techniques, computerized inventory control and other 
features that make traditional booksellers look stodgy and outdated. With the 
chains' backing, a book's sales can quickly climb into the hundreds of 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
But without the chains, publishers and authors lose their access to huge chunks 
of the American audience. And this often makes them desperate to get their 
books onto the chains' shelves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blockbuster Syndrome 
</P>
<P>
Without a large chain order, "you have to consider whether you can raise the 
price for each copy of the book" to cover costs, says Los Angeles publisher 
Jeremy P. Tarcher, who heads a firm that bears his name. Or "you may decide 
that, with such a small press run, the book just isn't economically viable" and 
decide not to publish. 
</P>
<P>
Writers complain that the rise of the chains has increased publishers' interest 
in the mass-market blockbuster at the expense of worthy books that might 
interest a smaller group. 
</P>
<P>
"The publishers were always interested in promoting the potential blockbuster 
at the expense of other books, but the chains have made it worse," said Alec 
Dubro, president of the National Writers Union. 
</P>
<P>
The chains' emphasis on the potential blockbuster often comes at the expense of 
so-called mid-list books, which are neither the best sellers ("front list") nor 
classics ("back list.") These can be the work of first-time or less well known 
authors. 
</P>
<P>
For the most efficient use of display space, the chains also typically keep 
books in inventory for shorter periods, to the dismay of writers and 
publishers. 
</P>
<P>
And the chains' presence can put pressure on small publishers, though most 
small publishers aim at narrow rather than mass markets. 
</P>
<P>
Small publishers are confronted with a dilemma when the chains offer them a 
large order. If they decline to accept the full order, they may risk losing 
future business from the chain; if they accept the full order, they may later 
face the crushing expense of a large number of returned copies. 
</P>
<P>
"A giant leaves large footprints," said publisher Tarcher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unfair Treatment Charged 
</P>
<P>
Independent bookstores have long complained about the difficulties of competing 
in a world where the chains have narrowed profit margins to razor-thin size. 
"You've got to love books to be an independent, because there's just not that 
much money in it," said Glenn Goldman, president of Book Soup, a bookstore in 
West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the Federal Trade Commission sided with independent booksellers 
when it filed complaints against six of the largest trade publishers for 
allegedly selling hardback books at lower prices to chain stores than to 
independents. The agency also charged that the publishers treated the chains 
better in joint advertising programs and in providing promotional displays. The 
publishers have denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Book lovers have sometimes found that their sympathies lie with the independent 
bookstores in their competition with the chains. When the elegant, 75-year-old 
Scribner's bookstore on New York's Fifth Avenue closed last December, some book 
lovers took it as another sign of the decline of the old-fashioned bookstore -- 
though the store had recently carried only a limited inventory. 
</P>
<P>
But the chains' admirers argue that the growth of the chains has brought stores 
to many neighborhoods that had no book outlets and reduced book prices to 
within the reach of many who could not afford them in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the past several years, there has been a resurgence of the 
independent bookstores, though there are no firm statistics to describe the 
trend precisely. This is partially attributed to a greater interest in books 
among the aging baby boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some industry officials, pointing to the slowing growth of the chains, 
believe that their importance may decline in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Big companies like CBS and RCA got into the book business and got right out of 
it when they discovered it was no gold mine," said Jack Shoemaker, 
editor-in-chief of North Point Press in San Francisco. In the years ahead, 
"corporate America may get out and leave it entirely to the little guy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BIG GET BIGGER 
</P>
<P>
The three largest bookstore chains have steadily increased their market share 
in the period between 1980 and 1987. Percentages are based on total retail 
revenue (including trade, mass market and religious book sales) of $2.3 billion 
in 1980 and $3.8 billion in 1987.

S&amp;LS MAY HAVE OUTLIVED NEED, GREENSPAN SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
BUT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS EXPRESS STRONG SUPPORT FOR SEPARATE LENDING INDUSTRY 
</P>

<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday that the nation may 
no longer need a separate savings and loan industry, but members of Congress 
staunchly defended S&amp;Ls as vital suppliers of money for home mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, who is the first official of his stature to suggest that S&amp;Ls 
may have outlived their usefulness, told the Senate Banking Committee that he 
doubts "whether specialized fixed-rate residential lending institutions are 
needed today." 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately it's going to be the markets that are going to determine the 
banking structure in this country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the House side of the Capitol, meanwhile, banking committee Chairman Rep. 
Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said: "I did not become chairman of this committee 
to preside over the liquidation of the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a strong advocate of the industry," said Gonzalez, as his House committee 
gave a hostile reception to a Bush Administration plan to solve the S&amp;L 
financial crisis through the possible liquidation or sale of hundreds of 
S&amp;Ls within the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
In an immediate step to calm nervous depositors, officials said Thursday that 
the Federal Reserve will provide reserves of cash to stem any rush by 
depositors to withdraw funds from S&amp;Ls. There was an unusually heavy 
outflow of funds, $15 billion, in the last two months of last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Supply Cash 
</P>
<P>
The President and members of Congress have repeatedly pledged that the full 
backing of the government stands behind S&amp;L deposits, which are insured up 
to $100,000. However, the drumbeat of publicity about the financial crisis of 
the federal fund that insures thrift deposits continues to cause widespread 
concern. This prompted an announcement Thursday that the Federal Reserve, the 
Treasury and the Federal Home Loan Banks will all cooperate in supplying the 
cash needs of S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand ready to make certain the liquidity needs of the thrift institutions 
are met," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady insisted repeatedly Thursday that 
the S&amp;L industry would emerge stronger from President Bush's proposed 
rescue package, House banking committee members are fearful that the 
Administration would be happy to see S&amp;Ls disappear into the banking 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than heal the wounds of this industry, your plan may put it out of its 
misery," Rep. Richard H. Lehman (D-Sanger) told Brady at the House Banking 
Committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Fed Chairman Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that 
S&amp;Ls may have outlived their usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
There have been "important changes in the mortgage market" he said, which may 
make it "unnecessary to provide special government-subsidized facilities for 
mortgage lending." Home loans, once offered on a strictly local basis, are now 
bundled into packages and sold as securities throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promotes Home Ownership 
</P>
<P>
The Fed chairman said his agency plans to make it easier for bank holding 
companies to acquire troubled thrifts, another move that should help wipe out 
much of the traditional distinction between banks and S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L financing system was created during the Depression to promote home 
ownership. Previously, lending institutions offered loans running for just a 
few years and required a large portion of the full purchase price as a down 
payment. Federal legislation made possible the Home Loan Bank system, owned by 
the S&amp;L industry, which made available a steady stream of funds for 
mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. was created to 
insure deposits up to $100,000. S&amp;Ls made most home loans until the 
industry was deregulated in the early 1980s, but after that mortgage bankers 
and other institutions actively entered the market on a large scale. 
</P>
<P>
A new price tag for the S&amp;L rescue plan, $175.4 billion over 30 years, was 
issued Thursday by the Administration, following criticisms in Congress that 
the total cost had not been accurately disclosed. The Office of Management and 
Budget said previously that the plan would cost $126 billion over 10 years, 
including interest payments on the bonds to pay for S&amp;L liquidations and 
sales. The bonds have a 30-year life, and Thursday's new total of $175.4 
billion reflects the full interest cost. The taxpayers will be responsible for 
$89.2 billion of interest payments on the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assume Higher Rates 
</P>
<P>
However, members of Congress offer conflicting tallies. Sen. John Heinz 
(R-Pa.), a member of the Banking Committee, believes the program will cost $200 
billion, with about $110 billion of that paid by taxpayers. A House Banking 
Committee analysis puts the cost at $335 billion, with $183 billion coming from 
the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The congressional figures are higher because they assume much higher interest 
rates, which drive up the ultimate cost of the bonds. Congress also is more 
pessimistic than the Administration about the amount of money that will be 
recovered through the sale of homes, apartments, office buildings and other 
properties taken by the government from failed institutions. 
</P>
<P>
A key provision of the plan, aimed at preventing a future collapse of S&amp;Ls, 
would require the thrifts to increase their financial strength substantially. 
Only 1,200 of the 2,500 solvent S&amp;Ls now have enough capital to meet the 
standards that would be required by 1991 if the Bush plan is approved by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Thomas J. Ridge (R-Pa.) suggested that S&amp;Ls falling below the capital 
standards, but showing improvement, should be given additional time beyond 1991 
to meet the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury secretary was polite but adamant in his refusal. "With all due 
respect, we feel very strongly we ought to adhere to the 1991 deadlines," he 
said. "Our feeling is the requirement could be met, and you will have a strong 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Banks, which are generally stronger financially, would be able to buy weaker 
S&amp;Ls and will "become the beneficiaries of all this," complained Lehman, 
referring to the Administration plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congress Suspicious 
</P>
<P>
Brady responded: "We have no intention whatsoever to deliver up the S&amp;L 
industry to the banking industry." 
</P>
<P>
However, many members of Congress fear that that is precisely the 
Administration's secret goal. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Gonzalez, and Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), whose subcommittee will 
write the S&amp;L legislation, will fight hard against what they perceive as 
efforts to dismantle the S&amp;L industry or convert thrifts into banks. 
</P>
<P>
"I support a separate home lending industry in this country, and I will oppose 
any attempt to do away with such an industry," Annunzio said.

Safety Study Launched: Boeing said it is taking several steps to ease concerns 
by the Federal Aviation Administration about procedures for reporting aircraft 
defects as well as cross-wiring problems found in Boeing planes. Boeing is 
modifying its procedures for reporting incidents to the FAA to ensure the 
reports are made in a timely manner. The concerns arose after several 757s were 
found with miswired fire-suppressions systems. Boeing also has launched a study 
to develop common design solutions to prevent possible errors in assembling and 
maintaining smoke and fire detection and extinguishing systems on its aircraft.

SWEETENED DEAL APPROACHES $3 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
WEST POINT-PEPPERELL ACCEPTS FARLEY INC. OFFER

Farley Inc. won a four-month battle for West Point-Pepperell Inc. Thursday as 
the textile giant accepted a sweetened buyout bid of nearly $3 billion by the 
Chicago-based conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperell and Farley said in a joint announcement that Farley will pay $1.53 
billion, or $58 per share, in cash for Pepperell's outstanding stock and 
refinance Pepperell's debt. 
</P>
<P>
Farley will contribute about $300 million in equity, with the remaining being 
financed by high-yield bonds and bank loans, Chairman William Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the resulting company would be the world's largest textile and apparel 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Farley, manufacturer of Fruit of the Loom underwear and Acme boots, initially 
offered $48 a share, or $1.4 billion, for Pepperell on Oct. 24, and later 
raised the bid to $52 per share, or a total of $1.54 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperell's board turned down both offers as inadequate during an often bitter 
struggle with Farley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Terms Called Fair 
</P>
<P>
However, Thursday's announcement said Pepperell's directors "determined that 
the terms of the offer and the merger are fair" to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperell stock closed Thursday at $57.25 a share, up $1.25 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
At an Atlanta news conference, Farley said there would be no production line 
layoffs. But he said Pepperell Chairman Joseph L. Lanier Jr. and President 
Donald J. Keller will leave the company after the merger is completed, within 
30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would need to sell parts of the company to pay off the debt, Farley 
said: "I love all the company and I haven't made any decision on what part, if 
any, I would sell." 
</P>
<P>
But he later identified Saturday's, a high-fashion line produced by Pepperell 
subsidiary Cluett-Peabody, as a likely candidate to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said they agreed to cancel a special shareholders meeting set for 
March 2. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting had been called at Farley's request in a bid to unseat the 
Pepperell directors and replace them with a board more sympathetic to the 
conglomerate's bid. 
</P>
<P>
Farley said it has received commitments from Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Bankers 
Trust Co. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. for financing necessary to 
complete its tender offer for Pepperell stock. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperell, founded in 1886, became the nation's largest publicly traded textile 
company last year through the acquisition of most of J. P. Stevens &amp; Co. It 
was left with about $1.1 billion in debt from that deal. Pepperell has 41,000 
employees and 22,000 stockholders. For the fiscal year ended Sept. 24, the 
company had revenue of $2.15 billion and earnings of $84.36 million.

UES to Shed Schools: United Education &amp; Software, a troubled Encino 
operator of trade schools, said it plans to close or sell about seven of its 32 
schools, which will result in a loss of about $8 million in its fiscal fourth 
quarter ended Jan. 31. UES, which lost $6.7 million in its third quarter, said 
the decision reflects dwindling enrollments at some UES inner-city schools 
caused by recent drops in unemployment and tighter federal restrictions on 
student loans.

IBM Confirms Settlement: International Business Machines Corp. confirmed that 
it has agreed to settle a $100-million lawsuit charging that its personal 
computers violated a basic patent on word processing held by Berkeley Limited 
Partnership, a small Rockville, Md.-based company. The settlement calls for IBM 
to acquire the patent held by Berkeley Limited, IBM spokeswoman Cynthia Stevens 
said. She declined to comment on how much if anything IBM was paying Berkeley. 
Berkeley had sought more than $100 million in lost royalties from IBM and an

Paris, Tokyo Most Expensive: The typical business traveler staying in a 
first-class hotel and eating in business-class restaurants for a month would 
find that Paris and Tokyo cost the most money, a private survey said. A 
monthlong stay in Paris would cost $7,260, with Tokyo close behind at $7,185, 
according to the meal and lodging survey by travel consultant Runzheimer 
International. Living costs in other major cities are considerably less for the 
businessman or woman on the move -- a month's stay in Hong Kong runs up a bill 
of $5,670, London $5,925, and Geneva, $5,115. Runzheimer said costs can be 
roughly halved by putting employees up in furnished rental apartments complete 
with a maid and a cook to serve half their meals at their home away from home.

USAIR AGREES TO $1-BILLION ORDER FOR 40 DOUGLAS JETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USAir Group announced Thursday a preliminary agreement to buy 40 MD-82 
aircraft, worth an estimated $1 billion, from McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
The order is the latest in a cascade of sales of a billion dollars or more by 
the firm's Douglas Aircraft unit in Long Beach, along with other major aircraft 
builders. The USAir order, however, ranks well behind recent Douglas sales to 
American Airlines and Delta Air Lines. 
</P>
<P>
USAir said it had signed a letter of intent stating its plan to place firm 
orders for 20 of the two-engine airliners and to take options for the purchase 
of 20 more. Douglas spokesman Don Hanson said Thursday that USAir chose to make 
the announcement even though final terms of the sale are still being 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
The first plane would be delivered to USAir, the nation's ninth-largest 
airline, in 1992 and the rest would be delivered at the rate of one a month 
starting in January, 1993, Hanson said. If USAir exercises all of its options, 
production would continue through mid-1994. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas is currently increasing its production rate of MD-80-type jetliners to 
2.5 aircraft a week. The firm is increasing its employment in the Long Beach 
area by 5,000 workers this year, which will put the total at 45,000, to 
accommodate its growth in production of commercial and military aircraft. The 
USAir order will not change the planned production rate and is not expected to 
have a direct effect on employment. 
</P>
<P>
The MD-82s ordered by USAir will have eight first-class seats and 135 coach 
class seats. The MD-82 is the most popular version of the MD-80 class of jets, 
which include five models of varying range, capacity and cockpit features. 
</P>
<P>
Washington-based USAir said it is a longtime operator of McDonnell Douglas 
aircraft. The aircraft manufacturer has built the DC-9 and DC-10 airliners, as 
well as the new MD-11, which is still under development.

CONTINENTAL GETS OK TO SUE 2 RIVALS ON RACKETEERING CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Continental Airlines Inc. said Thursday that a Los Angeles federal court has 
agreed to let it proceed to trial with a $1-billion racketeering claim against 
American and United airlines involving their computer reservation systems. 
</P>
<P>
Continental said U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie denied motions from the 
other two airlines to dismiss the charges. Continental has complained under the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) that American and 
United have committed mail and wire fraud in the operation of their ticket 
reservation systems. American operates the Sabre reservation system; United 
operates the Apollo system. 
</P>
<P>
American said Continental's contention that it has engaged in racketeering "is 
a moral outrage." United representatives could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Continental said the focus of its suit is the "manipulation by American and 
United of information on their Sabre and Apollo computer reservations systems," 
which are used in more than 70% of ticket sales by travel agents. Claims in the 
Continental suit include charges that the reservation system screens display 
the operators' flights first and suppress the fares and schedules of 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
A Continental spokesman in Houston said that even though the federal court 
ruling was made on Feb. 17, it did not get the court transcript until Thursday.

CHRYSLER PLANS NEW 'ZJ' SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES

<P>
Capitalizing on growing consumer demand for Jeeps, Chrysler Corp. said Thursday 
that it will spend $1 billion to develop and build a new line of sport utility 
vehicles to be introduced in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement is the latest in a series of production ventures by the No. 3 
U.S. auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said the model, nicknamed the ZJ, will be built at its new Jefferson 
Avenue plant in Detroit. Construction on the plant, which replaces an aging 
factory now at the site, is to begin in April. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 2, Chrysler and the French auto maker Renault announced that they will 
jointly build the small JJ sport utility vehicle at plants in Europe and North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, Chrysler said it would market a version of the Sonata sedan 
produced by the Korean auto maker Hyundai. Chrysler also will begin 
distributing Alfa Romeo vehicles built by Italy's Fiat starting late in 1989 or 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Potential for Growth' 
</P>
<P>
Steve Torok, Chrysler director of sales operations planning, said the moves are 
an effort by Chrysler to minimize its risk while expanding its product lineup. 
"We can't do everything ourselves so we are actively pursuing ventures where we 
think it makes sense internationally," Torok said. 
</P>
<P>
Sport utility vehicles, which include Chrysler's Jeep line, the Bronco models 
built by Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet Blazer, are among 
the fastest selling vehicles in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Sport utility sales in the United States, which were about 500,000 annually in 
the early 1980s, reached 933,988 in 1988, or nearly 20% of the light truck 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"The sport utility market still has some potential for growth," said analyst 
Michael Luckey of the Luckey Consulting Group. "The Jeep has become a status 
symbol among upper-income people. You see a Mercedes in the driveway alongside 
a Jeep Cherokee." 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said the ZJ will be sold by Dodge dealers, who do not currently have a 
sport utility vehicle, and another version will be sold by Jeep dealers 
alongside the current Cherokee. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said the ZJ will be slightly larger and more aerodynamic than the 
current Cherokee models. It did not offer further details, but last month 
Chrysler displayed to reporters a concept version of a future Jeep vehicle that 
closely matched the description of the ZJ. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the auto maker said it hesitated to replace the current Cherokee 
with the more aerodynamic version because of strong customer loyalty to the 
current boxy Cherokee model. 
</P>
<P>
The Cherokee and the ZJ have been nicknamed "Jeep classic" and "new Jeep" 
within the industry, mimicking Coca-Cola's products, and analyst Luckey said he 
wondered whether both would be popular. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ohio Plant at Capacity 
</P>
<P>
"My priority would be to stick with the current lineup," said Luckey. "It's the 
old cliche: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' The Jeep has a tremendous 
following -- it's almost like a cult." 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said it will continue to build the Cherokee in Toledo, Ohio, as long 
as there is market demand for the vehicle. It said it decided to build the new 
sport utility vehicles at Jefferson Avenue because the Toledo plant is at full 
capacity.

A FINNISH FIRM'S PURCHASE OF WILSON INSTANTLY MAKES IT A CONTENDER IN THE 
MARKET FOR SPORTING GOODS AND ENDORSEMENTS.

By buying Wilson Sporting Goods Co., a little-known Finnish company has won the 
endorsements of some of the biggest names in sports -- a move that will make it 
a top player in the global sporting goods market. 
</P>
<P>
Amer Group Ltd.'s agreement this week to buy Chicago-based Wilson brings with 
it names such as tennis star Chris Evert and golfers Nick Faldo of Britain, 
U.S. veteran Sam Snead and Bernhard Langer of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The diversified Finnish group already owned 80% of the MacGregor Golf Co. 
golfing equipment maker, with the rest owned by U.S. golfer Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important that big stars are using our products. For instance, in 
golf there are something like 100 professionals with Wilson and it's the same 
with MacGregor," said Heikki Salonen, Amer chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Amer said Monday it was buying Wilson for $200 million from Wesray Capital 
Corp., a New York-based investment firm founded by former U.S. Treasury 
Secretary William E. Simon. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen said the purchase was the third biggest by a Finnish company. 
</P>
<P>
Sports are only part of Amer's sprawling businesses. The company imports Toyota 
and Suzuki cars from Japan and Citroen cars from France and also has a license 
to produce Marlboro cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen said big names are the company's business, even if the Amer name 
remained in the background. "It is not important that the parent company's name 
is as well-known as the brand name, like MacGregor or Jack Nicklaus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope for Exposure 
</P>
<P>
"Our basic philosophy is in the consumer brand-name business, but now we have 
made such a big acquisition, the Amer group will become better known throughout 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
Amer, traded on the Helsinki and London stock exchanges and in American 
Depositary Receipt form in the United States, had prior to the Wilson purchase 
estimated its net sales in the financial year ending Feb. 28 at $1.1 billion, 
with about 25% coming from overseas operations. 
</P>
<P>
It said the acquisition of Wilson would boost sales to $1.76 billion, of which 
sporting goods will account for 28% and overseas operations about 45%.

BUSH VOWS FLOOR FIGHT ON TOWER NOMINATION; 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS IN TOKYO ALREADY PLANNING STRATEGY FOR WINNING 
CONFIRMATION BY FULL SENATE 
</P>

<P>
President Bush, stung by the Senate Armed Services Committee's rejection of 
former Sen. John Tower as defense secretary, vowed this morning to carry the 
confirmation battle to the floor of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before leaving his hotel suite to attend the state funeral of Emperor 
Hirohito, Bush led a hasty discussion of strategy for the floor fight with 
senior aides -- some of whom had been up most of the night in a last-minute 
effort to salvage what they had long considered a sure victory. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the committee's action, White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater had called a press conference about an hour before the 11-9 vote and 
said that the President had not lost "one iota of confidence" in his embattled 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
Bush believes that Tower will emerge from the ordeal of the nomination fight as 
a stronger, rather than weaker, defense secretary, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had not spoken with Tower by the time he departed for the Hirohito funeral 
but, according to White House aides, he has no intention of discussing with 
Tower the possibility of withdrawing the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
The events 7,000 miles away in Washington cast a shadow on a trip intended to 
introduce the new American President to world leaders gathered for the Hirohito 
funeral but which, instead, left his senior aides working feverishly on an 
embarrassing political development. Questions about Tower had, in fact, dogged 
Bush and his assistants all the way across the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of domestic politics, the impact of the committee defeat was magnified 
by the fact that the White House seems to have been so slow to see it coming. 
Although Senate Democrats, ambitious to shape defense policy themselves, had 
always regarded the former GOP senator as an obstacle and had steadily fueled 
the controversy over his private life, it was only at the last minute that 
Bush's inner circle recognized the danger. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had continued to issue confident predictions of Tower's confirmation, as 
did his aides, throughout the week. And, according to White House 
communications director David F. Demarest, it was only in the last 12 hours 
before the committee vote that the President's aides became concerned that the 
panel's Democrats would vote to scuttle the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Demarest said that the White House is confident of a solid Republican vote in 
Tower's favor on the Senate floor and that the Administration will lobby for 
enough Democratic support, especially among Southerners, to allow Tower to 
squeak by. Democrats outnumber Republicans, 55 to 45, in the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sununu Called Senators 
</P>
<P>
Bush became concerned about the nomination late Thursday and had White House 
Chief of Staff John H. Sununu begin making telephone calls to senators and 
others working on behalf of the nomination in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The President telephoned Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), but Sununu's 
pace was portrayed as feverish. Fitzwater said that Sununu made "any number of 
calls throughout the night and this morning." 
</P>
<P>
Although the committee vote represented a stunning political setback for Bush, 
Fitzwater described the President as "very relaxed about this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal Held Possible 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Tower is in for the duration, and so is the President. We want to take 
this to the floor and believe he will be confirmed," the White House spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Fitzwater's insistence that Bush would carry the fight to the Senate 
floor, there was widespread speculation among political operatives in 
Washington that Tower would be prevailed on to withdraw his nomination and 
rescue the new President from what could become an even more damaging defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater insisted that Bush was not surprised by the committee vote because 
the White House had been kept constantly apprised of developments regarding the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, seeming to draw the battle lines, said that all senators who 
intend to vote against the nomination "should publicly register their 
concerns." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Seen as Partisan Issue 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that Bush refused to portray the vote as a partisan issue that 
would chip away at his effort to conduct national security affairs on a 
bipartisan basis. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just one vote. We don't believe this speaks to any larger question of 
bipartisanship," said the spokesman, who attributed the timing of the 
committee's action to normal work procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Although White House aides in Tokyo refused to ascribe partisan motives to the 
Democrats, Peter Teeley, a Bush adviser and former press secretary, said in 
Washington that the committee vote was "not exactly a stand-up performance by 
the Democrats while the President is in Tokyo, making it difficult for him to 
communicate and lobby for Tower, especially when he's there to attend funeral 
services and meet with other heads of state." 
</P>
<P>
One Bush adviser said that Tower was a victim of "Chinese water torture." But 
he said also that, although he had thought for the last week that Tower would 
be approved, the FBI report on its investigation of the former senator 
"apparently was not as cleansing as some people thought." 
</P>
<P>
That document, delivered to the White House over the weekend, was portrayed by 
Bush and several top aides as giving Tower "a clean bill of health."

BALIAN GUILTY IN VIET BOAT CASE, TO GET REPRIMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Alexander G. Balian, former skipper of the U.S. warship Dubuque, was 
convicted today of dereliction of duty for failing to give adequate aid to a 
boatload of Vietnamese refugees adrift in the South China Sea last June 9. 
</P>
<P>
The six Navy captains who heard the case ordered that Balian be issued a letter 
of reprimand for his handling of the refugee incident. The panel could have 
sentenced the 26-year Navy veteran to up to three months confinement, fined him 
as much as $8,994, the equivalent of two months' pay, and dismissed him from 
the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
In a bitter, half-hour speech to reporters this morning after the sentencing, 
Balian said he had made a "scapegoat" by top Navy officials in Washington and 
complained about "really dirty" behind-the-scenes maneuvering in the Navy legal 
system. He called himself a "hero," who "was hung out to dry" and said he will 
appeal the conviction through Navy legal channels. 
</P>
<P>
Balian also urged Navy legal officials to take action against four crew members 
of the Dubuque for mistakes he believe they made on the ship during the refugee 
incident and for lying on the witness at his court-martial here. He would not 
name the four, however. 
</P>
<P>
Further, he urged that Phung Quang Minh, the refugee who took control of the 
foundering junk, be brought to justice. "I don't feel that enough emphasis was 
placed on the conduct of the tyrant on that boat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The captains deliberated for nearly six hours Thursday and today before 
announcing their finding this morning. They acquitted Balian of the more 
serious charge of disobeying orders stemming from an incident during the 
encounter with the junk in which Dubuque crew members allegedly shook a rope 
hanging from their ship, causing a refugee to fall into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Balian, 48, a highly decorated veteran of the Vietnam War, was expressionless 
as he stood, wearing his dress whites, and faced the panel of captains. 
</P>
<P>
The court-martial, rare for an officer of Balian's rank, focused on the 
long-held Navy doctrine that a commanding officer is responsible for the 
actions of his crew as well as his own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Balian was the commanding officer of the Dubuque, an amphibious transport ship, 
when it encountered the foundering junk in the South China Sea. He gave the 
refugees food, water and directions to the nearest land but decided not to take 
them aboard. The refugees drifted for 19 days after the Dubuque passed them by 
and said they resorted to cannibalism to keep alive. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Lt. Cmdr. Raymond H. Carlson, said in his closing argument 
Thursday that Balian's action was "inexcusable." He said Balian was so 
concerned with hurrying to an assignment in the Persian Gulf that he decided 
against picking up the refugees before he assessed their condition and the 
seaworthiness of their vessel. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a fool could think that this vessel could effectively sail anywhere," 
Carlson said. "Capt. Balian is no fool." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson said Balian's assignment in the Persian Gulf was not so pressing that 
he could not have taken the refugees aboard the Dubuque. 
</P>
<P>
"Providing humanitarian assistance is a mission of the Navy, clearly and 
unequivocally," Carlson said. "On the 9th of June he was not concerned, as he 
should have been, with the humanitarian assistance mission of the United States 
Navy." 
</P>
<P>
Balian's lawyer, Dan Donato of San Diego, argued that Balian, a native of Los 
Angeles, had made a reasonable decision based on information reported to him by 
his executive officer and members of his crew. 
</P>
<P>
He said they assessed the situation from a launch in which they approached the 
refugees and told him that the refugees' vessel was seaworthy and that they 
needed no medical attention. Balian ordered that the refugees be given food, 
water and directions to the nearest land. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 110 refugees boarded the vessel at Ben Tre in southern Vietnam 
last May 22 for what they believed would be a four- or five-day voyage to 
Malaysia. But the craft's engine failed on the third day out. Only 52 survived. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Dubuque encountered the refugees, about 20 of them had died of 
dehydration and starvation, or had drowned while attempting to swim to passing 
ships. After the Dubuque steamed away, some of the refugees killed two of their 
companions for food, according to survivor accounts. The bodies of three others 
who died were also consumed, a survivor said. 
</P>
<P>
Balian said that at the time of the encounter he believed the refugee craft to 
be seaworthy, and that the supplies he provided would sustain the refugees for 
the seven days it would take them to reach land. 
</P>
<P>
Balian said he realizes that he should have taken the refugees on board his 
ship. He blamed his crew for giving him erroneous and incomplete information. 
</P>
<P>
Donato argued Thursday that it was "not unreasonable to assume that if you give 
them food and water, you've restored them to the vitality they need to 
continue." 
</P>
<P>
"Capt. Balian as commanding officer could reasonably expect to be assisted by 
the members of his crew," his lawyer went on. "He could not possibly do it all 
himself. I think he had a right to depend on them and rely on them." 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials have said there are no plans to press charges against any other 
members of the Dubuque's crew.

In a cluttered storage room behind a Roman Catholic church, Phung Quang Minh 
lives quietly, marking time until it is safe for him to join the others in the 
teeming U.N. refugee camp here. 
</P>
<P>
Minh, 33, keeps to himself. He rarely smiles, and he has no friends. 
</P>
<P>
By his own admission, Minh was the man who assumed control of a foundering 
Vietnamese refugee vessel last year and killed at least one of the people on 
board in order to feed himself and the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the other people on the boat, I did this thing and I hoped God 
blessed me," Minh said this week in an interview. "I am a Christian. I killed 
this man on the boat to help the living. Personally, I think it's wrong, but so 
many people needed to eat." 
</P>
<P>
Minh was among 10 men arrested and imprisoned when the refugees were rescued by 
Philippine fishermen last June 28 after 37 days at sea. Philippine officials 
investigated the stories of killing and cannibalism but determined that they 
had no authority to prosecute -- the incident did not take place in Philippine 
waters, and the vessel involved was not registered in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 have been released, but Minh has yet to join the others. He has been 
free for about a month, and camp authorities are watching to see whether there 
will be any attempt on his life. 
</P>
<P>
"We feared a bit that he might be mauled," said Jan Top Christensen, field 
officer for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, when the refugees arrived at the camp, there was great animosity 
toward those who were thought to be the leaders, Christensen said. The 
committee of refugees who help run the camp sent a note to Christensen asking 
that the 10 who had been investigated be barred from living among them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, almost eight months later, the anger apparently has subsided. So far, 
Christensen said, there has been no trouble as Minh moves between his cot in 
the storage room and the camp hospital, where he works as a janitor. 
</P>
<P>
Minh said that much of what has been said about him and reported in the press 
is not true. He said the killing and the cannibalism were not just his idea, 
that it was agreed to by all of the remaining refugees among those who had set 
out ill-prepared for what they thought was to be a voyage of only a few days. 
The others turned on him later, he said, because they did not want to accept 
the blame for what they all had done. 
</P>
<P>
"They did not want to take the responsibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Accounts of the voyage have come out in interviews with the survivors and 
through documents and testimony at the court-martial of Capt. Alexander G. 
Balian, who was commanding officer of the U.S. amphibious transport Dubuque 
when it encountered the refugee vessel last June 9. 
</P>
<P>
Balian was charged with dereliction of duty and disobeying orders for failing 
to rescue the refugees, although he provided them with supplies and directions 
to the nearest land. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Balian was convicted of dereliction of duty and given a letter of 
reprimand. But the six Navy captains hearing the case acquitted him of the more 
serious charge of disobeying orders. The six captains had heard almost two 
weeks of testimony at the court-martial at Subic Bay Naval Base in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
There is general agreement that more than 110 refugees were on board the vessel 
when it set out from Ben Tre in southern Vietnam last May 22 and headed for 
Malaysia. But the vessel's engine gave out after three days, and by the time 
the refugees sighted the Dubuque in the South China Sea, between 10 and 20 had 
died of starvation or drowned when they tried to swim to passing ships. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Charge of Boat 
</P>
<P>
Before the encounter with the Dubuque, according to most accounts, Minh had 
already taken control of the leaderless group and was rationing rainwater they 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
After the Dubuque moved away, Minh took charge of the food and water that Capt. 
Balian had given the refugees. But the supplies were soon exhausted, and on the 
28th day at sea, according to Minh, the refugees decided "to use the dying to 
help the living." 
</P>
<P>
Some survivors have said that they disapproved, that they agreed only because 
they were too weak to resist. As the refugees weakened, some said, Minh and his 
men became more cruel, using sticks and a knife to force starving passengers to 
bail water. 
</P>
<P>
Vo Thi Bach Yen, whose 4-year-old daughter died on the refugee vessel, said in 
an interview last November that Minh beat her with his shoe when she attempted 
to distribute water from the Dubuque to emaciated children. 
</P>
<P>
Another refugee, Dinh Thuong Hai, said he protested when Minh and his men 
suggested killing Hai's best friend, Dao Cu Cuong. The protest was ignored and 
the man was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Minh tells a different story. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the 28th day, all of the dead were thrown into the sea," he said. 
"After the 28th day we decided to use the dying to help the living. . . . The 
people in the boat came to me. All of the people in the boat agreed with this 
idea. It was June 18, and we decided to use this date to remember the dying in 
the boat." 
</P>
<P>
Cuong, 30, was near death and had no hope of surviving, Minh said. He was 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
"All of them agreed, including the close friends of the dying man," Minh said. 
</P>
<P>
Some refugees sang songs, he said, and about 10 who were Christians offered a 
prayer for the dying. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not want to do the wrong thing," he said. "There were so many people. 
All of these people believed in me and asked me to keep discipline in the boat, 
and when they decided to use the dying, they asked me to do it." 
</P>
<P>
According to most accounts, two people were killed for use as food and three 
others who died were eaten. 
</P>
<P>
Minh admitted killing the first victim, Cuong, but would not say who killed the 
other, a 13-year-old boy named Pham Quy. 
</P>
<P>
"I am afraid the people of the world misunderstand," Minh said. "I was only a 
member in a group of persons, so I didn't have the ability to force all of them 
to follow me. I was only a man who was thinking more clearly than the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Please explain to all the people of the world that I had to do that to keep 
all the people living. We were at sea in huge waves. I had no other choice." 
</P>
<P>
Minh said he is particularly upset that his mother, who lives in San Jose, 
Calif., has rejected him. She sent him a newspaper article and demanded to know 
if the allegations about him were true. He tried to explain in a letter, but 
she did not believe him and will no longer communicate with him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Minh said he fled Vietnam because he had been in the air force of South Vietnam 
and that after the Communists took over in 1975, he became an outcast. Last 
summer's voyage was his 10th attempt to escape, he said. He had been caught 
twice and spent four years in prison, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He denied reports that he had been a paratrooper in a South Vietnamese infantry 
unit known as the Red Berets. He said he was never in combat, and was a student 
at a school for officers when the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen said that Minh's account of his past appears to be true. He said 
that as the truth is separated from the rumors about Minh, the other refugees 
have become more willing to accept him. In recent days, he said, several people 
have offered to take Minh into their homes in the camp. 
</P>
<P>
The other refugees "are kind sometimes," Minh said, and added: "They invite me 
to their homes for dinner or to do things. I always feel lonely because I have 
no friends, no brother, no sister, no family in this camp." 
</P>
<P>
Minh said that he hopes someday to "join in the life of the camp and help the 
people of the camp." But more than anything, he wants to resettle in another 
country, preferably the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The other refugees among the 52 who survived do not talk about what happened. 
According to Yen, the woman whose daughter died, they wish to put the voyage 
behind them. She said Minh came to see her after his release and seemed to be 
seeking forgiveness for the way he treated her. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked me how I was getting along," she said. "I was kind to him." 
</P>
<P>
Minh has recovered from a deep depression that followed his mother's rejection 
and "seems very stable and well now," Christensen said. "He's doing a good job 
as a volunteer at the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later, he said, some country will accept him.

ABANDONED BABIES: WHY THE SURGE?

<P>
The infant girl, wrapped in a man's shirt, had been left on the cold floor of 
an Inglewood supermarket a few weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
Now she lay with her head against a social worker's shoulder, large dark eyes 
staring while news photographers took her picture. 
</P>
<P>
Once again a public appeal was under way to identify an abandoned baby in Los 
Angeles. Once again, as happened numerous times in the last year, police had no 
witnesses, no leads and no clues. 
</P>
<P>
"All we've got is the baby," Inglewood Detective Ken Bush told reporters at a 
Feb. 9 press conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recent Abandonments 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few days before, Covina police had reported a newborn abandoned in the 
front seat of an unlocked car. Last month, an infant boy was left on the 
doorstep of a Downey house, and died in a local hospital shortly after the 
homeowner found him. About the same time, another baby boy was found in a trash 
can in Gardena, strangled. These were only the most dramatic cases. 
</P>
<P>
Child abandonment, some authorities fear, is an increasing criminal and social 
problem. While it is believed to occur in only 1% of reported cases of child 
abuse and neglect, nationally there were an estimated 20,860 abandonments in 
1986. The Denver-based American Humane Assn., which collects such statistics, 
said that the number had more than tripled in a decade, and is probably too 
low. 
</P>
<P>
"It's vastly increased over the last two years," said Michael Glenn, a 
supervisor for the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services, which 
assumes responsibility for abandoned children when they are found. His 
observation was echoed by many social workers. 
</P>
<P>
No one is really sure why this is so because abandonment is virtually 
unstudied. "It is a form of neglect, part of the child abuse field, but isn't 
often considered such," Randy Silverston, research director for Childhelp, USA, 
the Woodland Hills-based anti-child abuse organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dates to Antiquity 
</P>
<P>
In a newly published book studying abandonment through the Middle Ages, Yale 
University professor John Boswell found the practice was a widespread and 
common one, dating to antiquity, and increased in times of war, pestilence or 
social unrest. 
</P>
<P>
There is no comparable study of today's abandoned. "I'm curious to know what 
the rate of abandonment was during the Depression, and are we going to have 
more now with more homelessness and drugs," said Jeanne M. Giovannoni, 
professor of social welfare at UCLA. "But these are unknowns." 
</P>
<P>
The motives of abandoning mothers are largely unexplored as well. Giovannoni, 
who studies child abuse, believes this is so because abandonment is still 
statistically rare and because often the mothers remain missing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a problem of fear and ignorance," Thomas Hicklin, USC assistant professor 
of clinical psychiatry said. "This is a move of desperation." Others believe 
that the drug epidemic fuels the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In 16 cases tracked by The Times over the last year, eight babies remained 
unidentified, with the mothers never found. Among the eight mothers who were 
identified by authorities, all seemed to be on the low end of the socioeconomic 
scale. Four had drug problems. One was an illegal alien who felt overwhelmed 
and confused after a bad traffic accident. Two were teen-agers; one apparently 
was a prostitute and the other hid her pregnancy from her family by being 
tremendously overweight. 
</P>
<P>
Another abandoning mother was worried that she was financially unable to care 
for her child, and one, after being evicted from an apartment and living with 
her baby in a cardboard box, left her child with transients while she committed 
a burglary. She was caught, and is now in prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Churches, Trash Cans 
</P>
<P>
Four of these abandoned babies had been left at churches, and five in trash 
cans. Such cases, because they are often publicized as officials try to 
identify the children, are the best known. But according to Children's Services 
Director Robert L. Chaffee, they are the least common type of abandonments, 
occurring in Los Angeles County "on the average of one baby a month." 
</P>
<P>
Accurate statistics on baby and child abandonment are difficult to obtain, 
since no separate figures on the problem are recorded by the federal 
government, California or Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The county, for example, includes abandoned children in a category called 
"caretaker absence or incapacity." While those numbers have increased 154% in 
three years, from 4,237 in 1984 to 10,780 in 1987, department officials do not 
know how many of these are abandonments. 
</P>
<P>
Most abandonments are cases where mothers dump their babies or young children 
with relatives or baby-sitters, and disappear. Out of the five new cases she is 
assigned weekly, social worker Deborah Bennett said, "You could say (there are) 
roughly two cases where the mother abandoned her responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Drugs, particularly cocaine use, seems to be a major factor when mothers do 
this, she noted: "With cocaine, they don't care about anything or anybody. They 
negate all responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Last July, for example, a 2-month-old baby boy and his 1-year-old sister were 
left with a baby-sitter in East Los Angeles, who only knew the mother as Maria. 
When she didn't return, the baby-sitter went to authorities the next day. 
</P>
<P>
These abandoned children are usually quickly identified. "In most cases 
children are identified within a two-week time period," Children's Services 
spokeswoman Ray LaMotte said. 
</P>
<P>
The baby boy and girl were identified about 1 1/2 months later. Children's 
Services held a press conference, and an aunt came forward. 
</P>
<P>
The mother, whom the department would not identify in accordance with its 
policy of confidentiality, had a drug problem, La Motte said. Those babies now 
live with a maternal cousin. 
</P>
<P>
An arrest warrant was issued for the mother, but she is still being sought. By 
state law, abandonment can be treated as either a felony or a misdemeanor, at 
the discretion of the prosecutor. But Bruce Campbell, deputy in charge of the 
district attorney's sexual crimes and child abuse division, said he couldn't 
say how many parents are eventually charged. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 cases followed, only three mothers were charged. In one, a 
17-year-old South Los Angeles resident put her four children, ranging in age 
from 3 months to 2 years, in a shopping cart and walked three miles to the home 
of a man to whom she had reportedly prostituted herself. He had failed to pay 
her, officials said, so she left her children for him. 
</P>
<P>
She was charged with eight felony counts of child endangerment and desertion, 
and four misdemeanor counts of abandonment. She did not appear at her 
arraignment, however, and a bench warrant has been issued for her arrest. Her 
children were placed with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, a woman left her sons, ages 3 and 5, with a baby-sitter near 
the Los Angeles Convention Center and never returned. After Children's Services 
held a press conference seeking public help in identifying them, the woman came 
forward at the prodding of her boyfriend, who saw the children on television. 
The woman pleaded guilty to one count of misdemeanor child abandonment, 
according to the city attorney's office, and was sentenced to 30 days in Los 
Angeles County Jail. Her children are in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
A third case involved a teen-ager who had hidden her pregnancy through her 
obesity, and had left her baby in a trash can in Carson. The baby wasn't 
discovered for four nights, but miraculously survived. This mother pleaded 
guilty to a charge of attempted murder, and awaits sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Thoreson, a detective in the LAPD's Rampart Division, who says he sees 
abandonment cases "a couple of times a month," said, in his experience, "Very 
rarely does the D.A. prosecute in these cases. They're just really human 
tragedies." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to prove intent," Sheriff's Detective Alice Goodsby, who 
investigated the Carson case, commented. "I've had some that walk away and then 
say, 'I didn't mean it; I panicked."' 
</P>
<P>
An abandoning parent who ends up keeping the child is likely to become an 
abusive parent, Childhelp's Silverston believes. "The baby is either not wanted 
or can't be cared for," he said. "The mind-set may be very similar to an 
abusive parent, a person who doesn't view the child other than as an object." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that relatively few such babies apparently die after being left 
exposed -- in a church yard, trash can, car, or store -- can be explained 
medically, said Michael P. Sherman, associate professor of pediatrics at UCLA. 
The crucial factors, he said, are outdoor temperature, whether the child is 
left clothed or covered, or if the child was full-term and thus more likely to 
have natural fat insulation. "If they have no nutrition at all, people have 
calculated seven to 10 days before they would use up their body water," Sherman 
added. 
</P>
<P>
When a baby or young child is found, Children's Services workers and police try 
to identify the parents or relatives. Meanwhile, the baby is either placed in a 
foster home or with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
If no parent comes forward and no relative is found, Children's Services can 
make recommendations to the Juvenile Court to put the child up for adoption, 
under a legal guardianship or in a long-term foster home. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that abandonment could be mitigated were there more services 
available to distraught mothers and better dissemination of what help is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"We need more public information to let people know you don't have to abandon 
babies," Children's Services Director Chaffee said. "There needs to be better 
information in the schools, in newspapers, a variety of ways so that if anybody 
is considering abandoning a baby, they could get some help." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there are enough support services in general for single parents 
and mothers to make alternative decisions," said Childhelp's Silverston. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the investigations continue. 
</P>
<P>
The search for the identity of the Inglewood baby has centered on the Ralphs 
Giant supermarket, where she was found by an employee on a restroom floor, 
Detective Ken Bush said. "We couldn't find anybody that had previously used the 
bathroom. Nobody saw anybody enter," he said. "Nobody saw anybody leave." 
</P>
<P>
The baby is still officially a Jane Doe. Children's Services placed her in a 
foster home, where she is called Olivia. 
</P>
<P>
The newborn boy found on a car seat in Covina is also still an unknown, Sgt. 
Chuck Rosales said: "We've canvassed the neighborhood. We've sent out flyers. 
We put a plea out to the newspapers. At this point the investigation is 
stalled." Children's Services has placed the baby in a foster home. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena Detective William Moreno, investigating the death of the strangled 
7-pound infant boy found in a trash bin, said his search has so far been 
nothing but dead-ends. Witnesses saw a brown 1977 Chevrolet Nova near the trash 
bin about the time the baby was left there, but he has not been able to locate 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Since the infant was only about 5 hours old, and clearly born outside of a 
hospital, Moreno also put out a "medic alert" to area hospitals, he said, to 
find "any females having aftereffects from birth." That has brought nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Downey detectives have had no better luck tracing the mother who left her now 
deceased infant on a doorstep in a residential neighborhood of that city. 
Officers went house to house in the area, contacted churches, local schools and 
unwed mother agencies, Detective Larry Pollin said, looking for "somebody who 
was pregnant and no longer is, and there's no baby." 
</P>
<P>
The search led nowhere. "There's not much I can do," Pollin said. "The only 
thing I can do is hope somebody calls me." 
</P>
<P>
The baby's body, like that of the Gardena infant, is at the county coroner's. 
Eventually both will be sent to the county morgue for cremation, a spokesman 
said. The ashes will be kept three years, in case relatives are ever found.

HIGH COURT BANS USE OF BAR'S MANDATORY DUES FOR BALLOT RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer

<P>
The California Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday that the State Bar may 
not spend the compulsory dues paid by lawyers on election campaigning for the 
justices or other candidates and measures on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
However, the court also ruled in a separate 4-3 vote that the Bar may use such 
funds for a broad range of other, non-election activities -- such as lobbying 
for legislation, filing advisory briefs in court and adopting stands on 
political issues. Such activity is permissible so long as it promotes "the 
improvement of the administration of justice," Justice Allen E. Broussard wrote 
for the court majority. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came in a widely watched test of the constitutional rights of the 
state's 110,000 lawyers, all of whom are required to join the Bar in order to 
practice law in California and now pay $417 a year in dues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Partial Victory 
</P>
<P>
The decision was a limited victory for a group of 21 prosecutors and lawyers 
who filed suit seven years ago contending that the Bar was violating their 
First Amendment rights by using their money to support candidates and causes 
they oppose. 
</P>
<P>
The justices agreed with the attorneys that the Bar improperly used their dues 
in a "public education" program in support of four high court members who 
successfully sought voter confirmation in the 1982 general election. 
</P>
<P>
The court cited the widespread distribution of a speech made three months 
before the election by Los Angeles attorney Anthony Murray, who was Bar 
president at the time. While Murray did not mention the justices by name, he 
denounced what he called the "idiotic cries of . . . self-appointed vigilantes 
and unscrupulous politicians" who were opposing retention of the four jurists. 
</P>
<P>
The "nature and timing" of the speech's publication indicated it was meant to 
"assist in the election campaign on behalf of the justices," Broussard wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The Bar, with special power to regulate the legal profession, is closely akin 
to a "governmental agency," and thus by law cannot spend money on election 
campaign ing, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Broussard -- along with then-Justices Frank K. Richardson, 
Otto M. Kaus and Cruz Reynoso -- who were candidates for retention in the 1982 
election. The Bar did not participate in the 1986 election in which Reynoso, 
Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and Justice Joseph R. Grodin were defeated by 
the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard's opinion was joined by Justices Stanley Mosk and John R. Arguelles 
and Appellate Justice Clinton W. White, sitting by special appointment. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Justice Marcus M. Kaufman agreed that the Bar's involvement in the 
1982 election was improper but said the majority was wrong in concluding that 
its other political activities posed no threat to the rights of free speech and 
association of dues-paying Bar members. 
</P>
<P>
"Resistance to coerced association and intolerance of government-enforced 
support of philosophical, religious, political causes animated the founding of 
our nation and the drafting of its Constitution," Kaufman wrote in an opinion 
joined by Justice Edward A. Panelli and Appellate Justice Nat A. Agliano, 
sitting by special appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice David N. Eagleson did not 
participate in the case. 
</P>
<P>
State Bar President Colin W. Wied of San Diego welcomed the decision, saying 
the court had recognized "the important public purpose of our administration of 
justice functions." 
</P>
<P>
The Bar remains free to take stands on any issues related to the administration 
of justice, Wied said. "But if it's on the ballot, we can't talk about it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wied noted that the ruling will not prevent lawyers from individual 
participation in the political process, nor will it prohibit local bar 
associations, with voluntary memberships, from endorsing candidates for 
judicial office. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony T. Caso of the Pacific Legal Foundation, an attorney representing the 
lawyers who challenged the Bar's use of dues for political activity, said he 
was "very pleased" the court banned Bar involvement in election campaigning. 
But he expressed dismay with that part of the decision allowing a wide range of 
other activity. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the Bar's Conference of Delegates had taken positions on a 
nuclear freeze, handgun control, prison conditions and environmental concerns," 
Caso said. "Now, with this decision, they're not going to feel at all 
restrained . . . about furthering their own political and ideological concerns 
at the expense of the members." 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Eddie T. Keller, the lead plaintiff in the suit against 
the Bar, said it was likely the ruling would be appealed to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. "The constitutional issues in the case may be ripe for a decision up 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose when Keller and the other attorneys filed suit in Sacramento 
Superior Court against the Bar and its Board of Governors, a 22-member group 
that supervises the Bar and its testing, licensing and discipline of 
California's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
A trial court dismissed the suit. In 1986, however, a state Court of Appeal in 
Sacramento reinstated the action, finding that the distribution of Murray's 
speech and other material amounted to election campaigning and thus violated 
the rights of members whose dues were used to finance the education program. 
</P>
<P>
Broussard, in the 35-page majority opinion, ruled that because the Bar was more 
like a governmental agency than a labor union, it was free to use any of its 
funds for lobbying, public education or other activity so long as it does not 
engage in election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling on another issue in the case, the court held that members of the Bar's 
Board of Governors may not be held personally liable for reimbursement of the 
unauthorized expenditures made in the 1982 election.

DEUKMEJIAN VENTS ANGER OVER BUDGET DEFICIT TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian scolded independent state officials and the news media 
Thursday for creating a "confusing, contradictory" debate over a reported 
budget deficit that he argues never existed. 
</P>
<P>
In his angriest comments yet on the debate over the reported deficit in last 
year's budget, Deukmejian said in a speech to the California Taxpayers Assn. 
that talk of the state being in the red "is little more than a bookkeeper's 
fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
"Our state Department of Finance has determined that California ended the 
1987-88 fiscal year in the black. We had cash in the bank, and we were able to 
pay all of our bills," Deukmejian told more than 200 business and government 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the Republican governor refused to answer reporters' questions about why 
he is virtually the only state official who still insists that the last budget 
had no deficit. 
</P>
<P>
During the speech, Deukmejian disclosed that he and other state leaders have 
agreed to try to establish a uniform method of accounting that will prevent 
such disputes in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he is concerned that "the solid fiscal state of our state is 
called into question by a confusing, contradictory, after-the-fact bookkeepers' 
debate about whether California ended the last fiscal year with a deficit or 
with a surplus." 
</P>
<P>
The debate, at least for everyone but Deukmejian and his staff, is not whether 
there was a deficit but just how big it was. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, using Department of Finance budget figures, insists that the state 
ended the 1987-88 fiscal year last June 30 in the black by $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone else with a say in forecasting budget figures is in disagreement, with 
estimates of the deficit ranging from $97 million to perhaps as high as $1.4 
billion, depending on who is making the estimate and what expenditures they are 
counting. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the deficit was triggered last month when Deukmejian released 
his proposed $47.8-billion budget for the 1988-89 fiscal year and disclosed 
that certain expenditures from 1987-88 no longer were being counted for that 
particular year. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the accounting changes were made to avoid having to admit to a 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The lowest estimate of the deficit is $97 million, which comes from Treasurer 
Thomas W. Hayes, chairman of the Commission on State Finance, and is based on 
accounting methods closest to the ones used by Deukmejian. Hayes actually is a 
Deukmejian political ally, having been named to the treasurer's office by the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
The highest estimate, $590 million and perhaps as high as $1.4 billion, was 
made by acting Auditor General Kurt R. Sjoberg, based on the same generally 
accepted accounting principles used by other government agencies and private 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
In between are Legislative Analyst Elizabeth G. Hill, who pegged the deficit at 
$200 million, and Democratic state Controller Gray Davis, who says it was $343 
million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Different Bottom Line' 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, who boasts frequently of taking over a deficit-plagued state in 
1983 and restoring it to a AAA credit rating, said each state official "is 
using a different accounting method to reach a different bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
He cracked, "I guess accountants are like economists. If you line them up end 
to end, they never reach a conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Deukmejian revealed a display of four newspaper headlines that 
reported the various estimates of the deficit and accused the press of being 
"drawn into the confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Departing from his prepared text, Deukmejian said, "It is a little strange, I 
suppose, that there are no headlines that say that the Department of Finance 
says that we ended the year in the black." 
</P>
<P>
To underscore his point, Deukmejian said he wore a black tie for the speech. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is that apparently it doesn't make news when you end up in the 
black. It only makes news when somebody says you ended in the red," the 
governor said. 
</P>
<P>
After the speech, Deukmejian hurriedly left the Hyatt Regency without answering 
reporters' questions. Typically, Deukmejian will stop to answer a few 
questions.

BUONO CHALLENGE TO VOID MURDER CONVICTION FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday refused to set aside the conviction of 
Angelo Buono in the grisly murders of nine young women in the Hillside 
Strangler case. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, in a brief order, declined to hear Buono's challenge to a ruling 
last November by a state Court of Appeal that rejected his contention he had 
been denied a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
Buono was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 1977 and 1978 
murders. His cousin and accomplice, Kenneth Bianchi, pleaded guilty to five of 
the murders and two other killings in Washington and is serving a life sentence 
in that state. 
</P>
<P>
In other criminal cases Thursday, the state high court upheld the death 
sentences of two convicted murderers, including one case in which the 
prosecution removed all blacks, Asians and Jews from the panel of prospective 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, by a vote of 5 to 2, affirmed the sentence of Andrew Edward 
Robertson for the stabbing deaths of two young women in San Bernardino County 
in 1977. The court in 1982 had overturned a previous sentence of death and 
ordered a new penalty trial for Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
In another 5-2 decision, the court upheld the conviction and sentence of James 
Willis Johnson for the murder of a Milpitas jewelry store owner during a 1980 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The court, in a majority opinion by Justice Edward A. Panelli, rejected 
Johnson's contention that the prosecution improperly removed minority jurors 
from the case, depriving him of the right to trial by a jury reflecting a fair 
cross-section of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Under previous rulings by the state high court and the U.S. Supreme Court, 
challenges to any prospective jurors are permissible, so long as they are made 
on individual grounds and do not reflect bias against an entire racial or 
religious group. 
</P>
<P>
The justices upheld the trial judge's finding that the prosecution had offered 
acceptable reasons for excusing each of the jurors for specific reasons, such 
as apparent prejudice against policemen or disapproval of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
However, in an unusual 83-page dissent, Justice Stanley Mosk, joined by Justice 
Allen E. Broussard, said the majority was retreating from previous rulings 
designed to guard against group bias in jury selection. Mosk urged Johnson's 
lawyers to press the issue in further appeals to the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
Mosk noted that the prosecutor, in defending his challenge to four Jewish 
jurors, had denied prejudice by asserting, among other things, that he had 
often entertained Jews in his home and that "some of the more diligent 
prosecutors in our office" are Jews. 
</P>
<P>
"This ritual recitation of the hoary excuse, 'Some of my best friends are 
Jewish,' is obviously insufficient as a matter of law," Mosk observed. 
</P>
<P>
In the Buono case, lawyers for the defendant contended that the appellate court 
improperly rejected his challenge to the credibility of testimony by Bianchi 
that implicated Buono. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal panel found that Bianchi's testimony was "abundantly corroborated" 
by independent evidence that was sufficient itself to support Buono's 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, in an opinion by Appellate Justice Lynn D. Compton, conceded that it 
might seem improbable that anyone could be capable of the brutality of the 
crimes at issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet it is certain that Bianchi and one other person were so capable," wrote 
Compton. "Once such a premise is accepted, and its validity is neither 
challenged nor rationally susceptible to challenge on the record before us, the 
probability that (Buono) was that other person is an essentially inescapable 
conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Buono, noting that 1,300 pages of briefs had been filed before the 
appeal court, said the panel, in its 29-page opinion, had "not adequately or 
fairly addressed" virtually any of the issues raised by Buono.

DEPUTY REPORTEDLY SEIZED IN SERIES OF PROSTITUTE SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy has been arrested in connection with a 
series of slayings of prostitutes who sold sex for drugs in South-Central Los 
Angeles, a source close to the investigation said late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy, whose identity was not disclosed, was arrested while driving an 
official county vehicle about midnight Wednesday by officers from the Los 
Angeles Police Department's 77th Street Division, the source said. Police have 
recovered a weapon that may have been used in the killings, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Cmdr. William Booth would not comment 
on the case except to say that Chief Daryl F. Gates and Sheriff Sherman Block 
will hold a news conference today to announce a "significant development in a 
case of mutual interest." 
</P>
<P>
Police have refused to acknowledge that they were looking for a serial killer. 
They would only say that they were investigating a series of crimes that 
involved women who traded sex for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, 1985, at least nine such women, known in street slang as 
"strawberries," have been found shot to death. The same small-caliber handgun 
had been used in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
The first victim was found in an alley off West Gage Avenue. The body of the 
last of the women was found in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A 77th Street officer, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that a deputy 
had been "detained" Wednesday night on a "Vehicle Code violation." 
</P>
<P>
"He was turned over to the Sheriff's Department for administrative 
investigation," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harshly Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Community activists harshly criticized police for keeping the investigation of 
the killings a secret until it was leaked to a television reporter last week. 
Police said publicizing the current murders would have hindered their 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are outraged that you have made so deadly a calculation when so many lives 
were at risk," Margaret Prescod, founder of the Black Coalition Fighting Back 
Serial Murders, told members of the Police Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Prescod, whose group was formed during a separate wave of prostitute murders in 
South-Central Los Angeles, charged that the department's refusal to publicize 
the slayings unnecessarily endangered the lives of poor, black women in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 14 of those earlier murders, then-believed committed by a the 
so-called Southside Slayer or Slayers, occurred between September, 1983, and 
July, 1986, a period overlapping the current investigation. 
</P>
<P>
One man has been convicted in one of the deaths, and two other suspects have 
been charged separately in seven of the slayings.

COMMITTEE APPROVES SULLIVAN FOR CABINET AFTER HIS APOLOGY FOR ABORTION 
CONFUSION 
</P>

<P>
The nomination of Louis W. Sullivan as secretary of health and human services 
won swift approval from the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday after Sullivan 
apologized for "having misspoken . . . and having caused confusion" over his 
position on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I am opposed to abortion, except in the case where the life of the mother is 
threatened, or in cases of rape or incest," he said in his confirmation 
hearing. "I support a human life amendment, embracing the exceptions just 
noted. Like President Bush, I would welcome a Supreme Court decision 
overturning Roe vs. Wade," the 1973 decision that made abortion legal. 
</P>
<P>
Further, he said, he would work to encourage adoptions and other alternatives 
to abortion if confirmed as secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The vote to approve him was 17 to 0, with one member of the committee, 
conservative Sen. William L. Armstrong (R-Colo.), voting "present." The 
nomination is scheduled to be voted on next week by the full Senate, where it 
is expected to be approved easily. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Sullivan, president of the Morehouse School of Medicine in 
Atlanta and the only black named to Bush's Cabinet, ran into some turbulence 
shortly after his selection when he was quoted in an Atlanta newspaper as 
favoring a woman's right to abortion. Several weeks ago, he fueled the 
controversy when he reportedly told Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), a member of the 
Senate Finance Committee and a supporter of a woman's right to have an 
abortion, that he privately opposes reversing Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, members of the committee, including Packwood, were 
gentle with Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to go with my blessing," Packwood said. "You're going to have to 
make some decisions that -- because of the Administration's position -- that 
I'm going to disagree with . . . but we're going to make the final decisions, 
and it's clear you're going to follow the law." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's only tense moments occurred during an exchange with Armstrong over 
the use of fetal tissue in scientific and medical research, which Armstrong 
strongly opposes. Now, there is a moratorium on the federal funding of such 
research. But, last fall, an independent federal advisory panel of the National 
Institutes of Health recommended that the research be allowed to continue as 
long as there were safeguards to discourage women from seeking abortions for 
the purpose of providing fetal tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that the transplantation of fetal tissue holds extraordinary 
promise for the treatment of such illnesses as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, 
leukemia, Alzheimer's disease and a growing list of other serious conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old hematologist insisted that he could make no decisions involving 
fetal tissue research until he had received the National Institutes of Health 
report. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that "society has reaped benefits . . . as a result of our 
broad research efforts" and that he has "reservations about any blanket 
prohibition concerning research." But he said: "I would certainly not want to 
do anything that would encourage abortions to be done in order to get fetal 
tissue . . . . I would find that ethically unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong accused Sullivan of "ducking the question" and refused to vote in 
favor of his nomination. He said, however, that, after he has had an 
opportunity to "sort (Sullivan's responses) out," he "may still vote for him on 
the floor" when the full Senate considers his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's hearings had been postponed for more than three weeks while the FBI 
completed its background investigation. During that time, questions arose about 
whether Sullivan could still receive income from the college during his 
government service, including $300,000 in accumulated benefits and separation 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the FBI was examining the relationship between Morehouse and a Fulton 
County commissioner, Reginald Eaves, who was hired as a part-time lecturer at 
the college. Eaves was paid more than $34,000 during a four-year period when he 
sat on the commission and reportedly used his seat to promote issues of benefit 
to the school. During that time, in an unrelated matter, Eaves was convicted of 
extortion. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan told the committee Thursday that, if confirmed, he will resign as 
president of the school and take an unpaid leave of absence as professor of 
medicine. However, he said, he would continue to participate in the school's 
benefit programs, such as life, health and disability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he would forfeit the $300,000 so that conflict-of-interest 
questions would not be raised. Morehouse, which gets federal funds for many of 
its programs, received $5.8 million from the Health and Human Services 
Department last year. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the senators expressed sympathy with Sullivan's financial situation 
and said that they would look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we ought to take a look at the ethics laws we promulgate around this 
place," said Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R. I). "I don't think you should have to go 
through a tollbooth where the charge is $300,000." 
</P>
<P>
In response to questioning about Eaves, Sullivan said that the school had erred 
in "not monitoring the situation carefully and closely" and had since "taken 
steps to see that this will not happen again."

TOWER CASE MAY SIGNAL THREATS TO HIS LEADERSHIP;

<P>
With Thursday's vote by the Senate Armed Services Committee against the 
nomination of John Tower as secretary of defense, the Bush Administration ran 
smack into the limits of "bipartisan" government. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, Bush has basked in the glow of bipartisanship -- on issues ranging 
from the budget to the savings and loan crisis. Now, the President's own 
political vulnerabilities and the strength of the Democratic majorities in 
Congress have brought him face-to-face with what could be the first in a series 
of significant threats to his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate committee's rejection of Tower, coming as it did on the same day 
that House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) declared 
the President's plan to cut the capital gains tax dead-on-arrival, suggests 
that the Tower case may be only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, Administration aides vowed Thursday to fight on. "We're going to 
work hard and try to turn it around on the Senate floor," said one senior aide. 
Asked, however, if he thought the effort was likely to succeed, the aide 
reluctantly said: "No." 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a Bush victory in the full Senate cannot be discounted. The 
power of the presidency can be formidable in such struggles. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in keeping with his overall strategy of seeking peace with the Democrats, 
Bush so far has avoided a fight-to-the-death battle over Tower. And that is 
exactly the sort of battle that probably would be needed to turn the nomination 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Already, some Bush advisers have begun talking about who might be able to go to 
the former Texas senator and ask him to withdraw. They are convinced that 
unless Tower quits voluntarily before next week's scheduled floor vote, Bush 
has little choice but to follow along as the nominee goes down to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they can back away from him," said one longtime Bush adviser. 
"If necessary, they have to lose with him." 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of the potential loss is reflected in the long-standing though 
unwritten rule that Presidents have virtually total discretion in picking the 
members of their team. Only five Presidents in U.S. history have ever had 
Cabinet nominees rejected by the full Senate. Of the eight nominees rejected, 
the last one came some 30 years ago in the lame-duck days of the Dwight D. 
Eisenhower administration. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, however, entered the White House with particular vulnerabilities. He has 
less partisan support in Congress than any other President in this century. He 
lacks the rock-solid base of personal and ideological support that gave Ronald 
Reagan a measure of political strength even after the political going got tough 
in his second term. And changes in the climate of political morality have given 
the opposition new weapons to use against presidential appointees such as 
Tower. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Bush strategists from the outset have felt constrained to seek at 
least the appearance of cordial relations with the other side. Throughout the 
debate over the nomination, some members of the White House staff privately 
have accused Tower's senatorial opponents of partisanship and unfairness. 
Periodically, they have suggested that the White House was about to go on the 
offensive, defending Tower by attacking his critics as Reagan did when his 
nominees were in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush has limited himself to objections about "innuendo" directed against 
Tower. The President has avoided criticizing anyone by name. Mindful of the 
enormous struggles ahead over defense spending and national security policy, 
Bush has gone out of his way to praise the leader of the opposition, Senate 
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.). 
</P>
<P>
"You have not had a real nasty fight between the White House and the Hill" over 
Tower, one Bush adviser said. As a result, he added: "I don't think the 
honeymoon is over" because of the Senate committee's vote. 
</P>
<P>
But the downside of that cautious strategy is both the perilous state of a key 
nomination and grumbling by Tower supporters that the White House did not do 
its all for their man. 
</P>
<P>
In part, White House officials, including Bush, may have simply misread the 
depth of opposition to Tower. Bush aides repeatedly told reporters that Tower 
would be confirmed because the FBI report on him contained no "smoking gun." 
</P>
<P>
At least until Wednesday, many leading Democrats also thought that an absence 
of hard evidence of impropriety would be enough to get the nomination through 
the committee vote. 
</P>
<P>
It was not. As Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), the Senate's former majority 
leader, put it Thursday: "There is no smoking gun in the FBI reports. But there 
is enough smoke to cause one to be most uneasy with this nominee for this 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Even allowing for the element of miscalculation and surprise, the White House 
effort for Tower has been noticeably less intense than campaigns waged for 
other troubled nominees. When Louis W. Sullivan, Bush's nominee for secretary 
of health and human services, got into verbal trouble over conflicting 
statements on abortion, even Sullivan's strongest opponents conceded that he 
was sure to be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that assurance, Bush assigned Peter Teeley, a longtime aide, and Tom 
Korologos, Washington's top GOP lobbyist, to shepherd the nomination through 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast in Tower's case, White House aides had told reporters that Tower 
himself would have to make the case for his nomination with the Senate, a 
stance that appeared to distance the White House from the nominee. As late as 
Thursday afternoon, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Tokyo that 
Bush had not made any calls to senators on Tower's behalf and had no plans to 
do so. Friday morning in Tokyo, Fitzwater said that Bush had made some calls 
back to the United States, including one to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu also called some senators, as did 
Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
As Fitzwater tacitly acknowledged after the committee vote, it will take much 
more than that to win the fight on the Senate floor. And whatever the final 
outcome, Thursday's turn of events demonstrated conclusively that appeals to 
"bipartisanship" offer no easy path to success for the Bush Administration.

REHNQUIST COURT RESTRICTING CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With Wednesday's ruling that government has no constitutional obligation to 
shield citizens from danger, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist added yet another flourish to its strict view of the protections 
afforded by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
In matters ranging from education in rural areas to utility rate regulation and 
collecting evidence at crime scenes, the Rehnquist court has taken the same 
view -- that the Constitution imposes no "affirmative obligation" on government 
to provide services to citizens or to protect them from harm. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist maintains that the Constitution was intended to prohibit government 
agents from interfering with citizens' rights by such actions as banning books 
or breaking down doors without search warrants. Its intent, he said, is to 
"protect the people from the state, not to ensure that the state protected them 
from each other." 
</P>
<P>
Since the departure of moderate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. last year, 
Rehnquist has been in firm control of the high court. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan, when he elevated Rehnquist to chief justice in 
1986, cited his "judicial restraint." And, since his appointment to the high 
court in 1971, he has lived up to President Richard M. Nixon's description of 
him as a "strict constructionist." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controls Key Cases 
</P>
<P>
But, until Powell was replaced last February by Reagan-appointee Anthony M. 
Kennedy, Rehnquist could not count on obtaining a five-vote majority. Since 
then, Rehnquist's control in key cases has been unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
The high court has not moved quickly to overturn liberal rulings by past courts 
-- although it may overturn several in pending cases -- but Rehnquist has used 
his position to send a message to lower courts on how the Constitution should 
be read. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the ambiguous phrase in both the 5th and 14th Amendments 
saying that the government may not "deprive any person of life, liberty or 
property, without due process of law." Much of 20th-Century constitutional law 
has turned on those words. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, a conservative Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional many 
of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs, such as the 
establishment of a minimum wage, on the grounds that "due process" gave a 
person the right to make contracts without government interference. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the court under liberal Chief Justice Earl Warren relied on the 
"due process" clause in ruling that police officers may not use evidence of 
criminality at trial if they have violated a suspect's rights in obtaining that 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, the Supreme Court relied on the same clause to give women the right to 
abortions, on the grounds that "liberty" encompasses an implied right to 
privacy. That ruling, still under attack by anti-abortionists and the Bush 
Administration, will be reconsidered by the high court in April. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clause Seen as Limited 
</P>
<P>
But Rehnquist has made his position clear. He believes that the due process 
clause is quite limited in its meaning. The question before the court in 
Wednesday's ruling was whether a Wisconsin social worker had violated the 
"liberty" of a child when she failed to intervene to protect him from an 
abusive father. 
</P>
<P>
Many state judges, and a few federal judges, have concluded that, when public 
employees -- whether policemen, school officials or ambulance drivers -- are 
grossly negligent, they may be sued for violating the rights of a citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist disagrees. "Nothing in the language of the due process clause itself 
requires the state to protect the life, liberty and property of its citizens 
against invasion," he wrote. "The clause is phrased as a limitation on the 
state's power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety 
and security. Its language cannot fairly be extended to impose an affirmative 
obligation on the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The 14th Amendment was intended to prevent government from abusing its power 
or employing it as an instrument of oppression," Rehnquist continued. "Its 
purpose was to protect the people from the state, not to ensure that the state 
protected them from each other. The framers were content to leave the extent of 
government obligation in the latter area to the democratic political 
processes." 
</P>
<P>
The rule set down by Rehnquist was sweeping, as illustrated by an exchange 
during the court's argument in the Wisconsin child abuse case. If a policeman 
saw a person being assaulted on the street and walked on by, could he be sued 
for violating the victim's rights under the Constitution? No, replied an 
attorney representing the state, a view that the high court opinion 
subsequently endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
If states want to permit damage suits against their employees or agencies, they 
may do so, Rehnquist said. If local agencies want to employ more child care 
workers or set more demanding standards on them, they may do so. "But they 
should not have (these obligations) thrust upon them by this court's expansion 
of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
His opinion, supported by five other justices, will force lower court judges to 
throw out dozens of suits in which citizens are seeking damages from government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Rehnquist wrote a blunt opinion rejecting the view of an Arizona 
court that a rape suspect was denied due process of law when police lost 
evidence from the crime scene that might have exonerated him. 
</P>
<P>
"The police do not have a constitutional duty to perform any particular tests" 
at a crime scene, the chief justice wrote for the five-member majority. "We 
therefore hold that . . . failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does 
not constitute a denial of due process of law." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Pennsylvania utility company contended that its constitutional 
rights had been violated because it did not receive a large enough rate 
increase to pay for an abandoned nuclear plant. Again, taking a hands-off 
approach, Rehnquist disagreed. "The Constitution is not designed to arbitrate 
these economic niceties," he said, sending the case back to the state 
regulatory body. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the court, with Rehnquist in the majority, turned down a plea from a 
low-income mother in rural North Dakota who argued that a required fee to bus 
her children to school was unconstitutional. The state law setting the fees 
"interferes with no fundamental right," wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, 
because education is a matter for the states and is not guaranteed by the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, justices who often subscribe to liberal views -- William J. 
Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and, sometimes, John Paul 
Stevens -- have a profoundly different view of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
They say that free public education is a fundamental right in today's society, 
that the due process clause requires "fundamental fairness" in criminal trials 
and that citizens have a right to sue government officials who are charged with 
protecting them and do not. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the last year, their views have been expressed only in impassioned 
dissenting opinions.

AFGHAN REBEL ASSEMBLY ELECTS GOVERNMENT IN EXILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two weeks of bitter infighting between moderates and fundamentalists, an 
assembly of Afghan guerrillas Thursday elected a government in exile. 
</P>
<P>
The election came as an anticlimax that delegates described as a popularity 
contest among old guard political leaders of the moujahedeen, as the Islamic 
rebel movement is called. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalist-controlled Afghan News Agency announced Thursday night that 
Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, a moderate, had been elected to the figurehead post of 
president and that Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, a Saudi Arabia-backed fundamentalist, 
had been named to the more powerful position of prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Mojaddidi heads the Jibbeh Nijat-i-Milli, or National Liberation Front, rebel 
group, and Sayyaf heads the Ittihad-i-Islami, or Islamic Unity, group. 
</P>
<P>
The only candidates were the leaders of each of the seven political parties in 
the rebel alliance. The five parties whose leaders missed getting one of the 
top two jobs were each awarded three Cabinet posts. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel leaders have promised that the government will soon move into Afghanistan 
and, in time, take over in place of the Soviet-backed regime of President 
Najibullah, at least until national elections can be held. 
</P>
<P>
The voting constituted rejection of an unpopular fundamentalist government that 
had been proposed by the guerrillas' political leaders, a sign of independence 
that Western diplomats said helped the assembly regain some of the credibility 
it had lost in several days of bickering. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the rebels' staunchest supporters -- among them the 
United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran -- will recognize the rebel 
government. Western diplomats and independent analysts have said that its 
success will depend on whether it is recognized officially by other countries. 
</P>
<P>
International recognition, they say, would make the government a powerful 
psychological tool in the effort to dislodge Najibullah, whose armed forces 
still control Kabul, the Afghan capital, and other important cities. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the delegates to the assembly, or shura, as it is called, said the 
assembly had been discredited long before the voting. Several even urged that 
the government not be recognized because it does not represent the majority of 
Afghanistan's 9 million inhabitants and the 5 million Afghan refugees in 
Pakistan and Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest blow to the assembly's credibility came from within the seven-party 
rebel alliance, the Pakistan-based umbrella group dominated by fundamentalists 
that organized and ran the shura. The alliance has been used throughout the 
guerrillas' nine-year war as a channel for arms and other supplies for the 
guerrilla commanders in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the alliance's news agency issued a false announcement that the 
shura had elected a government headed by fundamentalist Ahmad Shah. Actually, 
there had been no vote, and the announcement was interpreted by many delegates 
as an attempt by the fundamentalists to "hijack" the election. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement triggered a backlash among moderates and religious leaders, 
who forced the seven party leaders to give the delegates more authority in 
choosing a government. 
</P>
<P>
One of the religious leaders, Mullah Nasim, from the Afghan province of 
Helmund, declared to the shura, "In Islam, it is acceptable to eat spoiled or 
rotten meat in times of war, but we have not yet reached the stage where we 
must accept the Ahmad Shah government." 
</P>
<P>
The seven party leaders then backed down and formed a 14-man committee, made up 
of two delegates from each party. This led to Thursday's popularity poll, in 
which the largest vote-getter was named president and the runner-up was named 
prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 420 delegates stayed on at the shura after Saturday's announcement, 
and they voted Thursday. But at least 100 others, among them representatives of 
the 2 million refugees and rebels based in Iran, were either barred from the 
voting or had left in disgust.

PROP. 103 CHIEFS WON'T BACK HAYDEN FOR INSURANCE POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leaders of Voter Revolt, which sponsored Proposition 103 on the November 
ballot, said Thursday they are searching for a candidate to endorse for the 
newly elective post of state insurance commissioner, but it will not be 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
The only one of five insurance initiatives to win approval on the November 
ballot, Proposition 103 provides for sweeping changes in state insurance law, 
including making the commissioner's job, which now is filled by gubernatorial 
appointment, an elective post starting in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden, who will say only that he is considering running for the job, emerged 
as the leading prospective Democratic candidate in a recent California Poll. 
</P>
<P>
But Proposition 103 leaders, Harvey Rosenfield and Bill Zimmerman, expressed 
concern that the assemblyman, with his reputation for radicalism, might weaken 
the statewide Democratic ticket in 1990. They also charged that he was more 
closely aligned with a rival November ballot initiative, Proposition 100, 
backed by the California Trial Lawyers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Their statements raised the possibility of a continuing split in consumer and 
liberal ranks in the fight over the future of the insurance system, just as 
last year Propositions 100 and 103 competed against each other for consumer and 
liberal support. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield and Zimmerman said that by making it known they would endorse 
someone other than Hayden, they hoped to encourage other candidates to come 
forward. Rosenfield said he has been told in recent weeks that many prospects 
on the Democratic side are discouraged because they think Hayden may have a 
lock on the party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
A Hayden spokesman, Bill Schulz, said later that the assemblyman "had no 
comment except to reiterate his position that he intends to run for reelection 
to the Assembly in 1990 and will continue to explore the option of running for 
insurance commissioner, feeling that the office deserves the strongest possible 
consumer advocate for Californians." 
</P>
<P>
"He intends to make his decision known sometime later this year," Schulz added. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman was manager of several Hayden campaigns in the 1970s and early '80s 
but has since had what he would only describe Wednesday as a "personal" falling 
out with the assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of the Voter Revolt organization, and particularly Rosenfield, 
might be of considerable importance in any race for insurance commissioner next 
year, presuming that the constitutionality of Proposition 103 is upheld by the 
state Supreme Court and the post does become elective. Rosenfield has said he 
will not run himself. 
</P>
<P>
He and Zimmerman listed as other possible Democratic candidates Assembly 
members Lloyd G. Connelly, Sacramento, and Maxine Waters, Los Angeles; 
Consumers Union West Coast Director Harry Snyder, and state Sens. Gary K. Hart, 
Santa Barbara; John Garamendi, Walnut Grove; Alan Robbins, Tarzana, and Daniel 
E. Boatwright, Concord. Also listed were Contra Costa County Supervisor Sunne 
McPeak, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn and state Board of Equalization 
member Conway Collis.

TENANT LEADERS DEMAND VOICE IN PROJECT'S FATE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tenant leaders at the Jordan Downs public housing project, bolstered by nearly 
1,000 signatures of support sent by residents of other projects citywide, 
demanded on Thursday a year's time and a city-paid consultant to explore the 
Housing Authority's controversial plan to sell the tattered project in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
Citing reports of other troubled housing projects in Washington and St. Louis 
being modernized under innovative tenant management programs, tenants assailed 
Los Angeles housing officials for "taking a backward step" by devising a plan 
without tenant involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"The Housing Authority has been secretly working on this proposal for a year . 
. . and I can tell you the residents have not been consulted," said Lillian 
Browning, a tenant leader at Jordan Downs. "Why can't it be tenant-owned or 
nonprofit-owned, instead of sold to a private developer? 
</P>
<P>
Housing Authority officials did not return a reporter's telephone calls 
Thursday. They previously have acknowledged, however, that the plan to sell 
Jordan Downs to a private developer has been in the works for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants at the project, home to 3,150 people, were taken by surprise by the 
proposal and were told that they were being given only until late February to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people who have never lived in public housing making decisions that 
effect our lives," said Claudia Moore, chairwoman of a tenant organization that 
represents all 21 projects in the city, who spoke at a press conference 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although tenants of the city's projects have had trouble organizing in the past 
because of their far-flung locations and cultural barriers, the announcement 
Thursday drew support from several leaders at projects with heavy Latino 
populations who fear that Jordan Downs, which primarily houses blacks, could be 
the first of many sites sold to private landlords.

Contra leader Adolfo Calero told a federal court jury Thursday that Oliver L. 
North was the financial "savior" of the resistance movement at the time 
official U.S. aid was banned and that a monument may one day be erected in 
Nicaragua to the retired Marine lieutenant colonel. 
</P>
<P>
Calero, although called as the second witness for the prosecution, sought also 
to defend North against charges that he had misused $4,300 in Contra funds, 
declaring that he would trust North with his life. 
</P>
<P>
The former manager of a Coca-Cola bottling plant who became the non-military 
president of the Contra movement in 1983, Calero praised North for funneling 
millions of dollars in privately raised funds to the Nicaraguan rebels in 1985 
and 1986, when Congress had prohibited U.S. military aid. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious of 12 felony counts against North are that he misled Congress 
and obstructed congressional inquiries by lying about his relationship with the 
Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"For us he became sort of a savior . . . when we felt abandoned and were in a 
desperate situation," Calero said. "They are going to erect a monument to him 
once we are in power." 
</P>
<P>
Calero said that North, while a top staff official of the National Security 
Council, directed the flow of at least $32 million in private funds to a Contra 
bank account in Miami. Evidence has shown that North and other U.S. officials, 
including former President Ronald Reagan, solicited the donations from other 
foreign governments and from private U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Calero said that on numerous occasions he gave North a total of about $90,000 
from this bank account, in the form of travelers checks, when North told him he 
was short of funds to carry out another secret project, freeing U.S. hostages 
overseas. North said that he also needed money to cover other costs associated 
with funding the Contras, Calero testified. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have charged that North used at least $4,300 of this money as his 
"personal piggy bank." 
</P>
<P>
Associate independent counsel John W. Keker, the prosecutor, asked Calero: "Did 
you ever give him any money for his personal use?" 
</P>
<P>
"No sir, that was not one of the purposes," Calero replied. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., North's attorney, said to Calero: "The 
prosecutor says Col. North stole $4,000 in Contra funds. Do you think that is 
conceivable?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," said Calero, adding that he saw North write down figures on a sheet of 
paper whenever he gave him money. North never gave him a formal accounting of 
how the funds were spent, "but I didn't demand an accounting -- I trusted him 
absolutely," Calero declared. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said that North "would often reimburse himself in connection with 
expenses. You'd have no problem with any of that, would you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," Calero replied. 
</P>
<P>
Keker asked Calero if he knew that North had used $1,000 of the money as a 
wedding present for Robert W. Owen, a private citizen who often acted as 
North's go-between with the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Calero said that Owen once had mentioned the gift to him "and I thought the 
wedding present was compensation for his services." 
</P>
<P>
"Col. North was the representative of U.S. government authority. I never 
questioned the legality of our arrangement," Calero testified. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell leaned forward to ask Calero: "Who did 
Col. North say he was representing?" 
</P>
<P>
Calero replied that North was not specific "but he brought us in to see the 
President (Ronald Reagan) two or three times." 
</P>
<P>
"Was any business ever transacted?" Gesell wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked mostly in generalities," Calero replied. "We told him (Reagan) we 
had gotten help from other countries -- he seemed happy to hear it -- and help 
from the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), former chairman of the House 
Intelligence Committee, concluded testimony he began Wednesday by declaring, in 
response to questioning by Sullivan, that he was not told in 1985 and 1986 that 
former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and former National Security Adviser 
Robert C. McFarlane were soliciting aid for the Contras from some U.S. allies.

DURAN, WANTING MORE, TAKES ON BARKLEY;

<P>
EX-CHAMPION, NOW 37, SEEKS A FOURTH TITLE

<P>
At the dawn of the 1980s, Roberto Duran was stepping out of the ring a loser 
after telling Sugar Ray Leonard, no mas. No more. 
</P>
<P>
But as the sun sets on the '80s, here is Duran, still in the ring, still asking 
for mas, mas. 
</P>
<P>
At 37, his legendary "hands of stone" having turned, in the opinion of some, to 
hands of clay, Duran will return to the ring tonight in search of a fourth 
world title. The Panamanian will face Iran Barkley, the World Boxing Council's 
middleweight champion, in a 12-round match at the Atlantic City Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley is favored, but the doubters are out in force on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley couldn't have a more fitting first name than Iran, considering how 
explosive and unpredictable his career has been. 
</P>
<P>
He surprised a lot of people by knocking out highly touted Michael Olajide last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Then he shocked people last June when, bloody and seemingly beaten, he reached 
back for a devastating, third-round knockout punch against Thomas Hearns to win 
the WBC title. 
</P>
<P>
"People said it was a lucky punch," Barkley said, obvious bitterness in his 
voice. "Thomas Hearns didn't think it was a lucky punch. There is no such thing 
as a lucky punch." 
</P>
<P>
This fight represents vindication for the 28-year-old Barkley, but not for 
himself so much. No, this one's for Davey Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly six years ago, Duran knocked out Moore to win the World Boxing Assn. 
junior middleweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
Moore and Barkley went even farther back, to common roots in the South Bronx. 
Barkley was a sparring partner and Moore's best friend. And he always felt that 
Duran cheated to beat his old buddy by thumbing him. 
</P>
<P>
Moore never got a rematch. Then, last June, just three days before the 
Barkley-Hearns fight, Moore was killed in a freak accident when his unoccupied 
Jeep ran over him in his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
In Barkley's mind, Moore gets his rematch tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Davey plays a big part in this," Barkley said. "This is going to be 
vindication for everything. I told myself a long time ago that Duran would 
venture into the middleweight division someday and we would meet." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley believes that Moore was never the same after the Duran fight. "It's not 
that Duran killed Davey," Barkley said. "But he killed his spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Duran, who has also held the undisputed world lightweight and WBC welterweight 
championships in his 21-year ring career and is the only man to ever beat Sugar 
Ray Leonard, in the first of their two fights, isn't impressed with Barkley's 
crusade. 
</P>
<P>
"Barkley better fight for himself, not Davey Moore," said Duran through an 
interpreter. "Davey Moore is dead, but I didn't kill him." 
</P>
<P>
Also featured on tonight's card are five '88 Olympians making their pro debuts 
-- four Americans and welterweight Robert Wangila of Kenya, in separate 
four-round fights. 
</P>
<P>
The star of the group is the Olympic heavyweight gold medalist, Ray Mercer, 
from Augusta, Ga., who will fight Jerry McGhee of Welch, W. Va. Mercer has yet 
to throw a punch for pay but has already set his sights on heavyweight champion 
Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try to fight every two weeks," said Mercer, who is already 27. "I 
can see myself fighting Tyson in about 18 months." 
</P>
<P>
Wangila, another winner of gold in Seoul, will face Sidney Gomez of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The bantamweight gold medalist, Kennedy McKinney of Memphis, will go up against 
David Allers of of Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Maynard, the light-heavyweight gold medalist from Cheverly, Md., meets 
Troy Jackson of Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
And Michael Carbajal of Phoenix, silver medalist in the light-flyweight 
division, will meet Willy Grigsby of St. Paul, Minn.

COACH'S MEMORY OF NO-SHOW IN SEOUL LINGERS ON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It has been five months since that dark day in Seoul, but the question still is 
asked: What happened? 
</P>
<P>
So Ken Adams keeps the answer in his briefcase. And shows it to all who ask. 
And some who don't. 
</P>
<P>
Adams is here as a trainer for five boxers from the Seoul Olympics in their 
professional debuts tonight. But he inevitably gets asked about the fighter who 
is not here, middleweight Anthony Hembrick, who has yet to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
Hembrick was the famous no-show in Seoul, the man who was knocked out of the 
Olympics because he arrived too late for his scheduled bout. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, coach of the U.S. team, took the blame then, and still does. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
When the question arose again Thursday, Adams came up with a mysterious 
scenario. 
</P>
<P>
"No way did we make a mistake," Adams told a reporter. "You see, we were told 
we were going to have the fifth bout that day. But what people don't know is 
that the night before, some Korean guy gave us a new schedule that showed us 
with the 11th fight." 
</P>
<P>
That, Adams insists, completely changed his game plan. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't want to get there too early because they put you in this crowded 
room where a bunch of people were smoking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So when the first bus came along and it was real crowded and there were elbows 
everywhere, I told our guys to wait. I didn't want them to get hurt. We'd get 
the next bus. That was 9:50 (a.m.). The first fight was at 10. You figure about 
10 to 12 minutes for each fight. They told me another bus was coming right 
along. Well it didn't show up until 10:30. We walked in there at 10:45, and 
they had just announced we were out." 
</P>
<P>
And did he ever find the shadowy Korean figure who handed out the revised 
schedule? "No I never did," Adams said. "But I know we were set up. We were the 
only ones who got that schedule. We were operating on the idea we had the 11th 
bout. We figured we had plenty of time. If I had known we were fifth, I'd have 
made sure we were there an hour and a half before." 
</P>
<P>
Adams reached into his briefcase to produce the schedule. Looking at it, a 
reporter pointed out that although there might be some confusion over the order 
of the bouts, the schedule clearly showed Hembrick's match scheduled for 10 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it. I know it," Adams said. "But we were set up. We may have even been 
set up at the bus when that crowd got on." 
</P>
<P>
And with that, Adams put the schedule back in his briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
Until the question is asked again.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: HERNANDEZ'S DREAM JOB GONE, BUT NOW THERE'S A FANTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By most standards, Tony Hernandez has had a successful career in sportscasting. 
</P>
<P>
After a few brief stints in such places as Cedar Rapids, Iowa, he went on to 
work in four major markets -- San Francisco, Philadelphia, New York and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a sports anchorman and reporter in L.A. for 10 years, having spent 
5 1/2 years at Channel 7 and the last 4 1/2 at Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
But what Hernandez always dreamed of was announcing major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
After he had long given up on that possibility, it finally happened a year ago 
when Z Channel hired him as its Dodger play-by-play announcer. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought if I was to ever become a baseball play-by-play announcer, I'd have 
to go to a small market and start all over," he said. "And I didn't want to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who played baseball at San Jose State, spent one season, 1967, with 
the Chicago Cubs' rookie league team at Caldwell, Ida. He then returned to San 
Jose and, while working as a radio disc jockey, also announced games for the 
San Jose Bees of the California League. 
</P>
<P>
But that was the extent of his baseball play-by-play experience. 
</P>
<P>
After Philadelphia-based Spectacor bought Z Channel in January, 1988, and 
acquired rights to Dodger games, the pay-cable station tried to recruit Jim 
Lampley to be its Dodger play-by-play man. 
</P>
<P>
Because of an already overloaded schedule, Lampley had to say no. But knowing 
Hernandez's love for baseball, he recommended his Channel 2 colleague for the 
job, and Hernandez got it. 
</P>
<P>
And Hernandez improved as the season progressed. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, neither Hernandez nor commentator Rick Monday is coming back. 
</P>
<P>
Monday left to take a full-time announcing job with the San Diego Padres, and 
last week it was announced that Eddie Doucette, a more experienced baseball 
announcer, will replace Hernandez and work with new commentator Don Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really looking forward to this season," Hernandez said. "That job was 
the highlight of my career, and now it has been taken away from me." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez may sound a little bitter, but he understands the politics involved. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of foresaw what was going to happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Z Channel has been undergoing an ownership change the last few months, and this 
week it became official. Z Channel is now owned by Rainbow, a New York-based 
company that operates SportsChannel America's regional networks. 
</P>
<P>
John Mohr, executive producer of sports programming for Los Angeles' ON TV from 
1977 until it went off the air in 1983, is now the head of those regional 
networks, including Z Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Jim Zrake, formerly of the USA cable network, is Z Channel's new 
executive producer of sports. 
</P>
<P>
Both Mohr and Zrake have ties to Doucette. Mohr, although he says he was not 
the one who hired Doucette for Z Channel, selected Doucette as a Dodger 
announcer when he was at ON. And Zrake hired Doucette to work for USA. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Dodger job has fallen through, other things are going well for 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
He is still Z Channel's blow-by-blow man on boxing, and tonight has a separate 
boxing assignment. He will serve as host of the pay-per-view telecast of Iran 
Barkley-Roberto Duran fight. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Hernandez and a few friends have started a new business, called Big 
League Fantasy, Inc., which caters to the needs of those involved in rotisserie 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Rotisserie leagues are a craze in which a group of fans get together and draft 
imaginary football or baseball teams made up of actual pro players. How each 
team fares is based on the statistics of the players. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hernandez, a couple of New Yorkers came up with the idea while 
they were in a restaurant called La Rotisserie Francais. 
</P>
<P>
"I originally thought the name had to do with barbecues and the Hot Stove 
League," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez became the commissioner of Channel 2's rotisserie league three years 
ago and was spending about three hours a day going through box scores to keep 
up statistics in eight different hitting and pitching categories. 
</P>
<P>
He eventually invested in a computer, and late last year, spurred by a friend 
who asked if he could buy his daily computerized statistical data, Hernandez 
formed his company. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which he plans to expand to include football and basketball, is 
located in an office above a bank in Redondo Beach. For more information call 
(213) 316-1120. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez lives in Torrance, not far from his company's Redondo Beach location. 
He has a 10-year-old son who, coincidentally, is named Torrance -- Tory for 
short. 
</P>
<P>
"When my wife Dale was pregnant, we were on vacation in California," Hernandez 
said. "We drove through Torrey Pines and then Torrance. That's how we came up 
with the names, although Tory is spelled T-o-r-y. At the time, we never thought 
we'd ever end up living in Torrance." 
</P>
<P>
The Hernandez family also includes Josh, 16, Dale's son by a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Boxing highlights the weekend fare. Tonight's Iran Barkley-Roberto Duran 
pay-per-view fight at Atlantic City, N.J., is being sold for $14.95 or $19.95 
to cable and SelecTV subscribers, but Saturday night's Mike Tyson-Frank Bruno 
bout at the Las Vegas Hilton is free to HBO subscribers. Figure that one out. . 
. . Tonight's Barkley-Duran card, which has five Olympic medal winners making 
their pro debuts in separate four-rounders, begins at 6 o'clock. 
</P>
<P>
For Tyson-Bruno, the prefight coverage, which begins at 7 p.m., figures to be 
more interesting than the fight itself, which is scheduled to begin at 7:28. 
Ross Greenburg, HBO executive producer, says the prefight coverage includes a 
lengthy Tyson profile, with flashbacks shown in black and white. About 4 1/2 
minutes will be devoted to Bruno. . . . Tyson will also be the subject of a 
half-hour special on CNN Saturday night at 6. Nick Charles is the host. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the fight will be the regular HBO team of Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant 
and Sugar Ray Leonard. . . . An HBO first for this fight is a Spanish-language 
audio being offered by selected cable companies, including those in South Gate, 
El Monte and Bellflower. . . . The fight will also be on radio, beginning at 7. 
KNX, not KABC as earlier announced, will carry the Radio Sports Network feed, 
with Rich Marotta and Seat Williams calling the action. In San Diego, KSDO has 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended viewing: This weekend marks the 25th anniversary of the first Sonny 
Liston-Cassius Clay fight, and it is the subject of NBC's "SportsWorld" Sunday 
at noon. Producer David Neal has put together an outstanding show, which 
includes footage of Clay, who changed his name to Muhammad Ali after the fight, 
wanting to quit when he got some medication in his eye after the fourth round. 
Also included are the pre- and post-fight press conferences, in which Clay 
gained notoriety by proclaiming, "I am the greatest." There are also old 
interviews with a number of reporters who were covering the fight. All said 
Clay had no chance. Among those is Times columnist Jim Murray. . . . Steve 
Ellis and Joe Louis are the fight announcers. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic volleyball players Bob Ctvrtlik and Missy McLinden are scheduled to 
appear on the "Pat Sajak Show" on CBS tonight at 11:30. . . . The Ironman 
Triathlon, held last October on the big island of Hawaii, will be on ABC's 
"Wide World of Sports" Saturday. . . . More signs that Channel 9, now owned by 
Disney, is beefing up its sports coverage: The station is sending free-lance 
reporter Randi Hall and producer Tony Richards to Vero Beach, Fla., to file 
reports on the Dodgers next week during the 9 o'clock news shows. And this week 
the station did a five-part series on learning high to ski with Scott St. 
James, himself a beginner. It was taped at Mountain High. 
</P>
<P>
ABC has dropped Gary Bender as its No. 2 play-by-play announcer on baseball and 
hired former New York Mets and new Chicago White Sox announcer Gary Thorne to 
replace him. . . . ABC's regular-season baseball coverage this season, its 
last, involves only eight Thursday night telecasts, beginning June 8, plus the 
World Series. . . . Tom Seaver is the front-runner to replace Joe Garagiola at 
NBC. . . . Guess who NBC opens with on the first of its 32 Saturday telecast 
April 8? The Dodgers, of course, who play at Atlanta that day. 
</P>
<P>
The best news about this week's sale of Z Channel is that SportsChannel 
America's national hockey package will be picked up, probably in mid-March. 
There are no plans at this time for Z Channel to change its name. . . . CBS has 
taken some heat for missing the start of last Sunday's Laker-Boston game. It 
was bad enough that the Daytona 500 ran late. CBS made things worse by going to 
a number of commercials before switching to the Forum.

<P>
Loyola Marymount will finish its regular-season basketball schedule this 
weekend with West Coast Athletic Conference games tonight at Santa Clara and 
Saturday at USF. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions (16-9 overall, 9-3 in the WCAC) are a game behind co-leaders 
Pepperdine and St. Mary's. They go into Santa Clara averaging 115 points per 
game, nearly five ahead of the national scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara (17-8) goes into the weekend tied with USF for fourth place in the 
WCAC at 6-6. Loyola defeated Santa Clara last month, 87-80, and beat USF in 
their first meeting, 113-95. ALAN DROOZ

TROJANS NOTCH 2ND WIN IN 3 GAMES; 
</P>
<P>
THEY HOLD QUINNETT TO 9 POINTS AND BEAT COUGARS, 78-63

George Raveling, USC's basketball coach, has maintained that his team isn't as 
bad as it is perceived to be. Maybe Raveling was correct in his assessment of 
the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
USC, which defeated Washington State, 78-63, Thursday night at the Sports 
Arena, is ending its season on a positive note. After winning their first home 
game since Dec. 13, the Trojans received a standing ovation from the crowd of 
1,827. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to win a home game," forward Calvin Banks said. "Actually, it 
feels good to win any game." 
</P>
<P>
Losers of 13 straight games during one stretch, the Trojans have now won two of 
their last three. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you one thing, I definitely nominate that game for one of the longest 
of the season," Raveling said. "That was a two-hour second half. 'Gone With The 
Wind' didn't last that long. I thought we were going to serve breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
USC's defense contained Brian Quinnett, Washington State's star forward. 
</P>
<P>
Quinnett, who scored 44 points in the Cougars' 72-65 win over the Trojans last 
month at Pullman, Wash., was held to nine points. It was only the second time 
this season that he hasn't scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
"Quinnett didn't shoot the ball well and that's not like him," Washington State 
Coach Kelvin Sampson said. "We depend on him so much. We competed well, but we 
don't have very many other weapons." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans played defense in relays on Quinnett, who made just three of 15 
field goals, including a three-point shot. Center Chris Munk and Banks started 
out on him, but they got help from Andy Olivarez and Ken Countryman. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make life as difficult as possible for Quinnett," Raveling said. 
"We kept them out of their tempo, pressured their guards and kept the ball away 
from Quinnett." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans dispatched the Cougars with ease, leading by as many as 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Chris Moore led the Trojans with a career-high 26 points, and forward 
Ronnie Coleman scored 15 points before fouling out. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State has not won a road game since beating Eastern Kentucky on Dec. 
29 in the Toledo Holiday tournament. They have lost six straight road games and 
are 1-8 on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Wright led WSU with 16 points, and Reco Rowe had 13 off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
USC is 9-18 overall and 2-13 in the Pac-10. Washington State fell to 8-16 and 
3-12. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
After being benched for the second half of Monday night's 68-52 loss to 
Stanford, Trojan guard Anthony Pendleton was benched against Washington State. 
USC Coach George Raveling said he didn't use Pendleton because the player 
failed to follow instructions. Although he's the Trojans' third leading scorer, 
Pendleton has been ineffective on defense. . . . Forward Alan Pollard suffered 
a right hip pointer when he was knocked down while going after a rebound in the 
first half. The injury is expected to sideline him for Saturday's game against 
Washington. . . . Raveling plans to start USC's graduating seniors -- Rich 
Grande, Andy Olivarez and Chris Moore -- in the Trojans' final home game of the 
season against the Huskies. . . . Washington State faces UCLA Sunday afternoon 
at Pauley Pavilion.

Former football star and convicted drug offender Chuck Muncie was sentenced to 
one year in jail for violating the probation he received after pleading guilty 
to failing to file state income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
The former Charger running back did not appear in court in San Diego when Judge 
E. Mac Amos Jr. passed sentence and ordered Muncie to pay a $3,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
In June 1987, Muncie pleaded guilty to violating the California Revenue and Tax 
Code. Muncie admitted he did not file returns in 1983 and '84 when he had 
income from the Chargers estimated to be $371,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a plea-bargain agreement, Muncie agreed to file these tax returns, pay a 
$2,000 fine to pay for investigative cost, and pay his back taxes, estimated to 
be more than $20,000 by the Franchise Tax Board. 
</P>
<P>
Tax Board spokesman Jim Reber said Muncie violated probation because he has yet 
to file for these tax years, and he has not filed any state income tax return 
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Muncie was sentenced Tuesday to 2 1/2 years in federal prison on a cocaine 
possession charge and for lying to a federal judge about his use of the drug 
while free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
The additional one year will be served concurrently.

Mark Calcavecchia, the dominant figure in golf this season, shot a 
seven-under-par 65 Thursday and took a two-stroke lead in the first round of 
the $1.3-million Doral Open tournament at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't make a bogey, so that makes it a good day. A lot of good shots, a lot 
of good putts, a lot of good everything," said Calcavecchia, who has won two of 
six events this year and missed a playoff for another title by a single stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the game's leading lights found the chilly, gusty winds less than easy, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus, playing with Calcavecchia, struggled to a 78. 
</P>
<P>
But he wasn't alone. None of the current holders of the Big Four titles could 
break par 72 on the famed Blue Monster course at the Doral Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
PGA champion Jeff Sluman shot a 75; U.S. Open titleholder Curtis Strange had a 
73; Masters champion Sandy Lyle of Scotland took a 74, and British Open champ 
Seve Ballesteros of Spain had a 73 in his first American start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
A trio of Texas buddies -- Ben Crenshaw, Bruce Lietzke and Tom Kite -- were 
Calcavecchia's closest pursuers. Playing in a threesome, Crenshaw had a 67, 
Lietzke a 68 and Kite a 69. Wayne Levi was tied with Lietzke at 68. 
</P>
<P>
The Women's Kemper Open, already shortened to 54 holes by heavy rains at 
Princeville, Hawaii, could extend into next week if the rain continues, 
tournament officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rain has deluged the course at the Mirage Princeville Resort since Saturday, 
but tournament director Kerry Haigh said the regular tournament was still 
scheduled to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
However, the forecast called for rain through the weekend.

PELTASON PICKS WALTER HENRY; 
</P>
<P>
UCI NAMES CARDIOLOGIST AS HEALTH SERVICES CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moving quickly fill an important vacancy, UC Irvine Chancellor Jack Peltason on 
Thursday named a respected staff cardiologist to be the university's new vice 
chancellor of health services and dean of its medical school. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Walter Henry, chief of cardiology at UCI's College of Medicine, also will 
be in charge of the deficit-plagued UCI Medical Center in Orange, the hospital 
that is the main care provider for most of the county's poor. He now is 
president of the hospital's medical staff. 
</P>
<P>
In appointing the 48-year-old Henry, Peltason dispensed with plans to conduct a 
nationwide search to replace Dr. Edward J. Quilligan, who resigned Feb. 15. The 
appointment is effective March 15, subject to approval by the UC Board of 
Regents. 
</P>
<P>
Henry is regarded as a politically astute administrator who is credited with 
luring some of the nation's top heart researchers to UCI's cardiology program. 
While working at the National Institutes of Health in the early 1970s, Henry 
helped develop the two-dimensional echocardiogram, now a standard tool for 
diagnosing heart disease. A member of the UCI faculty since 1978, he was the 
strong choice of faculty members for the post, according to Peltason, who 
sought recommendations during an intensive week of evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Thursday, Peltason emphasized the importance of making a quick 
selection rather than conducting a long national search that one professor said 
would leave the medical school "in limbo." 
</P>
<P>
"There became a clear consensus among the many faculty with whom we consulted 
that the best interests of the College of Medicine would be served by an 
immediate appointment of new leadership, and Walt Henry was the overwhelming 
choice to assume that leadership," Peltason said. "There are decisions that 
need to be made now regarding the health sciences and those decisions could not 
be carried out as effectively by an acting dean and vice chancellor." 
</P>
<P>
Henry, who was reached in Chicago where he will be attending a medical 
conference today, said he would not have taken the vice chancellor's job 
without such assurances of faculty support. 
</P>
<P>
"When you take an appointment like this, without the national search process, 
it is important that there is a concensus of staff," he said. "It's a difficult 
job and a challenge, and I will have to rely on the support of faculty and the 
chancellor and the director of the medical center." 
</P>
<P>
Henry fills a vacuum left by the departure of Quilligan, whose exit has 
alternately been described as a resignation and a dismissal. Quilligan had lost 
faculty support in a dispute over a pay plan for physicians and had been unable 
to contain the medical center's growing deficit, which had surged from $8.5 
million to an estimated $12 million during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
The medical center, Orange County's only public hospital, has been an 
increasing financial drain on the university because it is required to treat 
indigent and uninsured patients. It has rarely operated in the black, and its 
deficit has leaped from $1 million in 1986 to the projected $12 million in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, blamed primarily on stingy reimbursement rates by the county and 
the Medi-Cal assistance program, is considered virtually unsolvable without 
changes in state law, according to university officials. In addition, medical 
center officials have charged that other hospitals in the area have contributed 
to the flood of poor patients by steering those who are unable to pay for 
treatment to UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Henry called current reimbursement rates "inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important issue and something that we need to discuss with the 
president (UC President David Gardner) and the Board of Regents," Henry said. 
"We need to look at indigent care in Orange County and how that will be 
addressed." Henry was deputy director of the medical center for two years and 
brings intimate knowledge of the public hospital's problems to his new post. He 
was in the running for the vice chancellor's job in January, 1987, when 
Quilligan was brought in from UC Davis, and was one of three or four faculty 
members immediately named as leading candidates after Quilligan's sudden 
departure. Henry will be paid $176,000 a year, $18,000 more than Quilligan's 
1988 salary. 
</P>
<P>
Microbiology chairman Dr. Dennis Cunningham, who headed the medical school's 
search for Quilligan and, briefly, for his successor, said a lengthy search 
could take 2 years and probably would result in the same choice. In the 
meantime, the College of Medicine would be "in limbo" under an acting dean. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had a national search, we were all convinced we could not come up with 
anybody better than Walt Henry," Cunningham said. "He is a really good 
academic, and that was an important consideration because it is clear our next 
dean will have as one of his important charges to develop academic strengths in 
the College of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jonathan M. Tobis, director of the division of cardiology's Catheter 
Laboratory, said that "Walt Henry is the only reason why I stay at this 
institution." 
</P>
<P>
Tobis, who has conducted research in collaboration with Henry on a method to 
record heart images using computers to aid in treatment of heart disease, 
called him "a fair-minded leader who is very open to ideas. Everybody respects 
him. If anybody can bring this medical school together, it would be Walter." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Cyril Barton, who led a call for a no-confidence vote in Quilligan after 
the imposition of a plan requiring doctors to return up to 60% of their outside 
incomes to the university, said the selection of Henry happened so quickly that 
factions had not formed in support of other inside candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Barton said, "Henry would be my choice. . . . He steps into a 
hard situation where there is so much turmoil. I think most of the staff 
consider him a well-respected, well-liked person." 
</P>
<P>
Henry was praised as "quiet and effective," by Dr. Stanley van den Noort, who 
was dean for 12 years before Quilligan. 
</P>
<P>
"Walt Henry is an excellent cardiologist, and he has done a fine job as chief 
of staff," said Van den Noort, who said he was surprised by the speedy 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
Henry, who came to UCI from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, 
received his medical degree from Stanford University and served his residency 
at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. His undergraduate 
degree was in electrical engineering, an expertise that he has used in 
developing medical technologies. 
</P>
<P>
He served as governor of the Southern California area of the American College 
of Cardiology and is the recipient of a Fulbright Professorship. 
</P>
<P>
UCI faculty leaders are again calling for an on-campus hospital facility.

CYANIDE KILLED SCHOOL TRUSTEE, CORONER FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Capistrano school trustee Jan Overton died 13 months ago of cyanide poisoning, 
officials confirmed Thursday. They declined to discuss how the poison might 
have gotten into her body. 
</P>
<P>
Overton, 46, collapsed at her Dana Point home Jan. 24, 1988, as she prepared to 
leave for a family outing. Paramedics temporarily revived Overton after she 
collapsed, but she was declared dead at San Clemente General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman Robert Rivas said Thursday that 
cyanide poisoning caused Overton's death, but he declined to discuss the 
investigation or how long officials have known about the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
"An investigation is continuing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Overton was on the seven-mem ber Capistrano Unified School District Board of 
Trustees from November, 1976, until her death, said Jackie Cerra, a district 
spokesman. She was also president of the Orange County School Boards Assn. in 
1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
Overton had been suffering from an unknown illness, according to friends and 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Richard, said his wife was taking at least 13 types of medicine at 
the time of her death. He declined to say what she was being treated for but 
said "she had a number of complaints." 
</P>
<P>
"It's still hard to realize Janet is gone," he said. "Now this comes along. 
It's really just impossible to believe it." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to speculate on how his wife died. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bernard Huss, Overton's doctor, would not discuss her treatment but said he 
is surprised by the coroner's office report. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be darned," Huss said. "I guess it would make you wonder." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is not aware of any medication he prescribed for Overton that might 
have contained cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
Huss declined to give specifics about Overton's treatment, except to say that 
she had lost some weight in the months before she died. 
</P>
<P>
News of the coroner's report shocked Overton's neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said Overton was a "very 
friendly" woman. 
</P>
<P>
"It really bothers me," he said. "It's so strange. We're just wondering what 
happened. She was a fine woman." 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor said Overton appeared to be healthy despite her weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
"She was as healthy as a horse," the neighbor said. "I watched her build a 
wooden fence in the yard. Now it (the death) makes sense."

COSTA MESA; 
</P>
<P>
TIMES TO PAY $5,000 FINE AFTER ACCIDENTAL SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without admitting guilt, The Times Orange County Edition has agreed to pay a 
$5,000 fine in connection with an Oct. 27, 1988, chemical spill at the 
newspaper's Costa Mesa plant, a company spokeswoman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a chemical spill, a discharge of chromium, that was contained in the 
water in the computer room cooling system in Orange County," said Laura Morgan, 
Times spokeswoman. "We began a cleanup procedure and contacted the fire 
department." 
</P>
<P>
The chromium was accidentally discharged with 300 gallons of waste water at the 
Times, 1375 Sunflower Ave., into a storm drain that flowed into the 
Greenville-Banning Flood Control Channel, Times attorney Rhonda Heth said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Santa Ana Region, filed a 
complaint against The Times seeking a fine of $5,000 and alleging that a report 
had not been filed prior to the spill, Heth said. Companies that plan to 
discharge waste are required to file a report before they do so. But in this 
case, The Times said, the discharge was accidental. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has reached a tentative agreement with the water quality agency in 
which the newspaper will pay $5,000 and the Regional Water Quality Control 
Board will drop the term negligent from the complaint, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
"By agreeing to pay the $5,000, we are not acknowledging wrongdoing or 
violation of the law," Morgan said. "We are merely trying to resolve this in 
the most expeditious way possible." 
</P>
<P>
Heth said the Regional Water Quality Control Board is expected to approve the 
agreement at its March 10 regular meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Regional Water Quality Control Board could not be reached 
for comment Thursday.

SIDESWIPED TO RETALIATE, CAR FLIPS ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A driver who was apparently angry because another motorist had flashed an 
obscene gesture sideswiped the offending driver's car, causing the vehicle to 
strike the center divider and overturn on the San Diego Freeway shortly before 
noon Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Gelinds, 24, of Yorba Linda, was thrown from the car when it rolled over, 
suffering a separated shoulder and cuts, CHP Officer Mike Lundquist said. 
Police were searching for the driver of the car that struck Gelinds' auto, 
described as an older-model black Chevy or Ford pickup. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lundquist, Gelinds made the hand gesture to a motorist in the lane 
beside him. Witnesses corroborated Gelinds' report that the driver deliberately 
swerved into Gelinds' car, sending him into the center divider of the highway 
north of Culver Road. The unidentified driver then exited at the Culver ramp 
heading westbound. 
</P>
<P>
Gelinds was treated at Western Medical Center and released.

BIG SODA POP SPILL CAUSES FREEWAY DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soda spilling from a Pepsi truck caused a mess and a big delay around a major 
Orange County freeway intersection Thursday, the California Highway Patrol 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Mike Lundquist said a ramp between the northbound Orange Freeway and 
the eastbound Riverside Freeway was closed for about 2 hours after the 
semi-truck spilled about half its load. Leaking cola spilled over all lanes of 
the ramp and onto the eastbound lanes of the Riverside Freeway. The ramp was 
closed between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. while Caltrans cleaned up the soda 
using a water truck, a sweeper and a scraper.

HOPES OF AEGEAN HILLS FOR ANNEXATION DOUSED; 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO CHIEF OPPOSES REQUEST TO JOIN DISTRICT WITH MISSION VIEJO; PANEL TO 
CONFER WEDNESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior official for the county Local Agency Formation Commission has 
recommended rejecting the proposed annexation of unincorporated Aegean Hills to 
the adjoining city of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member LAFCO panel is scheduled to consider the request at its meeting 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Aegean Hills had petitioned for annexation last year. Initially, 
at least, Mission Viejo indicated a willingness to accept, but after an updated 
feasibility report -- showing that the annexation would put more of a financial 
strain on Mission Viejo than at first thought -- the City Council voted Jan. 23 
to rescind support. 
</P>
<P>
The new report said the city would collect just $435,000 in surplus revenues 
from an annexation, not the $1 million that was previously estimated would be 
available to cover municipal services for the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reason for Rejection 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO Executive Officer James J. Colangelo said in a report released this week 
that the city's reversal on annexation is a major reason for his opposition to 
the request. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that Mission Viejo has been incorporated only since March 31, 
so the city is not comfortable with expansion yet, he said, citing the City 
Council's 3-2 vote withdrawing support for annexation. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council believes additional time is necessary to fully staff city 
departments and functions before taking on the additional responsibility of the 
Aegean Hills area," Colangelo wrote in his report to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Two City Council members, however, continue to actively support annexation. 
</P>
<P>
Many Aegean Hills residents support annexation because of close cultural and 
social ties to Mission Viejo and because they already have a Mission Viejo 
mailing address. 
</P>
<P>
Aegean Hills, a 593-acre planned community, has about 7,000 residents. Mission 
Viejo, a separate, 10,500-acre planned community, has about 70,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Many Aegean Hills residents say they also fear annexation by another city. Last 
year, the district was included in a proposed Saddleback Valley city. That 
plan, fiercely opposed by many Aegean Hills residents, was killed at the polls 
Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO can accept or reject Colangelo's recommendation. If it chooses 
annexation, the commission would first have to expand Mission Viejo's sphere of 
influence. Even though the city has withdrawn its proposal to expand its sphere 
to include Aegean Hills, the commission can still vote on the original request. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Annexation Question 
</P>
<P>
If Mission Viejo's sphere is expanded to include Aegean Hills, the commission 
at the same meeting could also approve annexation. 
</P>
<P>
If so, the annexation question would be sent to the City Council for a special 
hearing. At such a hearing, only residents of the area to be annexed would be 
allowed a voice to protest or support the plan. 
</P>
<P>
If the council is advised that less than 25% of the area's registered voters 
object, the annexation would automatically become official. If 25% to 50% of 
registered voters protest, the annexation question would have to be placed on 
the ballot for Aegean Hills residents to decide. 
</P>
<P>
If more than 50% protest, the annexation proposal would be killed 
automatically.

RESERVIST HELD IN ALLEGED INSURANCE SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies arrested an Army Reserve sergeant who allegedly tried to 
collect more than $100,000 for a phony life insurance claim, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Dwayne Peterson, 59, of Laguna Beach is accused of forging the seal used 
by the Orange County coroner's office and the county recorder's office on death 
certificates in an effort to collect $100,000 from Minnesota Mutual Life 
Insurance Co. in St. Paul, Sheriff's Department Lt. Robert Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, a full-time reservist based in Santa Ana, was arrested Wednesday 
about 11 a.m. at the Airporter Inn Hotel on MacArthur Boulevard in Irvine by 
undercover sheriff's officers, who set up a meeting with him to deliver a bogus 
check from the Minnesota company, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Rivas said, Peterson collected $119,037 in insurance from 
American Founders Life Insurance Co. in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson was arrested on suspicion of attempted grand theft and forgery and 
taken to Orange County Jail, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said Peterson took out a life insurance policy in April, 1982, on a 
friend who had died 14 months earlier. He allegedly stole or forged the county 
seal required on death certificates and gave a phony death certificate to the 
Minnesota company, claiming that the friend died Dec. 27, 1988. Peterson used 
phony stamps that were facsimiles of the recorder's office seal and the 
sheriff-coroner's seal, Rivas said. The stamps might have been made in Hong 
Kong, which Peterson visited during his Army travels, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
When sheriff's officials searched Peterson's home, they found phony printing 
stamps, several other death certificates and evidence that he used the same 
kind of certificate for the Texas and Minnesota claims. 
</P>
<P>
Officials raised Peterson's bail from $50,000 to $500,000 when they learned 
about money put out by the Texas company. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unknown if any other companies have lost money because of forgeries by 
Peterson," Rivas said.

KRAFT JURORS LIKELY TO BE SEQUESTERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The judge in the mass-murder trial of Randy Steven Kraft told attorneys 
Thursday that he probably will sequester the jurors at a hotel during their 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Although movies and television shows often show jurors sequestered, it rarely 
occurs in California trials. Alan Slater, Orange County Superior Court 
administrator, said he knows of only one jury being sequestered overnight in 
the county in the past 10 years, and only "two or three others" in his 17 years 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rarely, rarely done, but if that is what the judge wants, then we will 
make plans to accommodate," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Donald A. McCartin told Kraft's attorneys after the jurors were excused 
Thursday that he wants to keep the 10-woman, two-man jury at a hotel during 
deliberations but that he is concerned about the scheduling because he doesn't 
want the jurors away from their families over Easter. 
</P>
<P>
But Kraft's attorneys said it was difficult to tell the judge how soon they may 
be finished with their case. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 43, a computer consultant from Long Beach, was arrested May 14, 1983, 
when two California Highway Patrol officers found a dead Marine in his car. He 
is charged with 16 murders, but Orange County Sheriff's Department 
investigators have linked him to a total of 45 killings in Southern California, 
Oregon and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution testimony began in September and took about 2 months. Since a 
2-month hiatus, Kraft's attorneys have put on witnesses for 4 weeks and expect 
their case to take several more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Once the defense concludes, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown will have a 
chance to present any rebuttal witnesses. The defense can then present their 
rebuttal witnesses. That is followed by closing arguments to the jury and the 
reading of jury instructions. 
</P>
<P>
If Kraft is convicted, his trial will go into a penalty phase, when jurors 
would be asked to decide between a death penalty or life without parole.

JAIL ESCAPEE'S ACCOMPLICE IN JEWEL ROBBERY CAPTURED IN FLORIDA

<P>
Florida police have captured a man who allegedly robbed a Chicago jewelry store 
earlier this month with Michael Douglas Taylor, the mastermind of one of Orange 
County's largest jailbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 35, led five Orange County Jail inmates on an escape Nov. 20 by 
rappelling from the top of the four-story building in downtown Santa Ana. Four 
of the inmates were captured or turned themselves in; Taylor is still a 
fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Taylor has stolen about $2 million in jewels from two dozen 
Southern California stores, including seven in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Wayne Gettic, 32, who told police that he was Taylor's accomplice, was 
captured in Pensacola, Fla., on Feb. 10, after he attempted to sell stolen 
jewelry to an undercover officer in Florida, according to Detective Steve 
Kazarian of River Grove, a small town 3 miles west of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Kazarian, who is investigating the jewelry heist, said Gettic confessed to the 
Chicago robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Gettic, who remains in a Pensacola jail on stolen property charges, told 
authorities that he and Taylor kidnaped Elsa Pacini, a 42-year-old jewelry 
store manager, from her Chicago home the night of Feb. 2 and forced her at 
gunpoint to take them to her brother's jewelry store in River Grove. They made 
off with at least $450,000 in gold and diamonds, Kazarian said. 
</P>
<P>
Gettic and Taylor apparently fled south to Gary, Ind., and then on to New York 
City where they parted on Feb. 6, Kazarian said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're friends, but we don't know where they met," Kazarian said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Gettic and Taylor apparently staked out Pacini's home and the jewelry 
store for several weeks before the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Kazarian said Gettic would probably not be returned to Chicago until the 
Florida case is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is also suspected of numerous jewelry store heists in Chicago, his 
hometown, Kazarian said. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's escape from Orange County Jail was not his first. He also escaped from 
California's Chino state prison in 1975 while serving a sentence for an armed 
robbery.

KATELLA LOSES 14-POINT LEAD BUT EDGES WOODBRIDGE, 59-57

Lisa Wehren stepped to the free-throw line with 3 seconds to play and a chance 
to send Thursday night's Southern Section 4-A girls' playoff game between 
Woodbridge and Katella high schools into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
How Wehren, Woodbridge forward, got to the line was at least as amazing as the 
fact that she actually had a chance to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
But Wehren missed the front end of a one-and-one opportunity and Katella's 
Wendy Carlson grabbed the rebound and dribbled out the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
And Katella, which almost let a 14-point lead slip away in the final 3 minutes 
10 seconds, held on for a 59-57 quarterfinal-round victory at Katella. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Katella (24-3) advances to the semifinals to face top-seeded 
Palos Verdes Saturday. Woodbridge ends its season 21-6. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the game, it appeared Katella had a lock on the semifinals. But a 
scrappy Woodbridge team outscored the Knights, 16-4, in the final 3:10 and came 
within two free throws of pulling off an upset. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge had the lead down to 59-57 on a three-pointer by Wehren with 45 
seconds left. Katella worked the ball around, but Wehren tied up Katella's 
Karen Jensen and Woodbridge regained possession of the ball with 18 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
What followed wasn't particularly well-executed basketball, but it sure was 
exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge, with the ball under its basket, inbounded the ball to point guard 
Leslie Rathbun, just as Coach Eric Bangs had directed during a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball goes to Rathbun and she goes to the basket," Bangs said after the 
game. "She's won three games for us with that play." 
</P>
<P>
Rathbun got to the midcourt line, then lost control of her dribble. For roughly 
10 seconds, players from both teams scrambled after the ball. Finally, Wehren, 
flat on her stomach, got enough control to tap it toward Rathbun, who was 
standing in front of the Woodbridge bench. 
</P>
<P>
Katella's Chris Gellel dove across Wehren's back, trying to get the ball before 
it got to Rathbun, and was whistled for a foul. 
</P>
<P>
Katella called timeout in order to freeze Wehren. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just hoping she was as shaky as I was," Katella Coach Barb Bausch said. 
</P>
<P>
Wehren's shot was just a shade too long and Carlson pounced on the rebound, 
dribbled into the corner and was tackled by Woodbridge players as the buzzer 
sounded. 
</P>
<P>
Joni Easterly had 25 points and Angie Gomez 15 to lead Katella. Rathbun had 22, 
Kris Willis 11 and Wehren 7 for Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes 66, La Habra 26 -- Host Palos Verdes took a 23-2 first-quarter 
lead then extended it to 38-8 at halftime. Heidi Burge scored a game-high 23 
points and sister Heather added 12 for Palos Verdes (24-3), which advances to 
Saturday's semifinals against Katella. Ana Kristiche led La Habra (19-7) with 
10 points.

CANYON DEFENSE, ERKENBRACK STOP WESTLAKE, 47-38

<P>
Canyon High School has two of Orange County's busiest and productive athletes 
this week in Keri Erkenbrack and Christa Ramirez. Both play on Southern Section 
playoff teams in two sports. 
</P>
<P>
They were key figures in Canyon's 47-38 4-AA girls' basketball quarterfinal 
victory over Westlake Thursday night at Anaheim. Erkenbrack scored 13 points 
and had 14 rebounds and Ramirez, the county's leader in assists, had nine 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Erkenbrack and Ramirez also play soccer for the Comanches, who play a 3-A 
quarterfinal match today at Moreno Valley. Erkenbrack is a goalie; Ramirez 
scored the goal in Canyon's 1-0 victory over Canyon on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Against Westlake, the Comanches (21-4), survived a fourth-quarter comeback by 
the Warriors with a 9-2 spurt over the game's final 3:24. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically we just outpowered them inside down the stretch," Canyon Coach Bill 
Fitzgibbons said. "That was the difference in the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors (18-9), who never led, closed to within two points at 38-36 after 
a Melissa Gische basket with 3:48 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarter they came at 
us and took us by surprise," Erkenbrack said of Westlake's comeback bid. 
</P>
<P>
But in the final minutes Canyon went inside to 6-foot-3 junior center Sheri 
Rhyne. Rhyne finished with eight points and eight rebounds, including four of 
the Comanches' nine fourth-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main objective was to get the ball inside and take advantage of our 
height," Erkenbrack said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wondering when they (my teammates) were going to start doing that 
(coming inside to me)," Rhyne said of her play late in the game. "I think I can 
actually play better underneath." 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, the Warriors shot just 18%, on seven of 39 field goal 
attempts. And they were only slightly better for the game, at 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgibbons credited the Comanches' defense for closing down the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to a 2-3 zone in the second half," he said. "They didn't handle the 
pressure very well." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon plays Camarillo on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo 56, University 45 -- Guard Nicolle Victoria scored 25 points to pace 
Camarillo (21-6) overvisiting University (20-7). Center Shelley Davis led 
University with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 60, North Torrance 59 -- Forward Derrie Nauta hit a 17-foot 
jumper with 5 seconds left in the game to give visiting Mission Viejo (23-4) 
the victory. Nauta scored 19 points and teammate Kristen Okura added 15. Laura 
Collins paced North Torrance with 19 points.

ATASCADERO TOPS LA QUINTA AFTER JALEWALIA FOULS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
La Quinta High School's Amy Jalewalia fouled out of the game with 2 minutes 
remaining, and Atascadero pulled away for a 70-60 victory in a Southern Section 
3-A girls' basketball game Thursday at La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
"When she went out it was ours," Atascadero Coach Jim Stecher said. 
</P>
<P>
Atascadero will play Palm Desert on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It should have been ours earlier, but we didn't take advantage of it," Stecher 
said. "When she sat down with four (fouls with 3:34 left in the third quarter), 
we should have made a run. We should have been up by eight." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, La Quinta (23-4) pressed to force turnovers and was only down by three 
at the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Atascadero (19-5) scored four consecutive points to open the final quarter 
and had difficulty even getting a good shot, which prompted La Quinta Coach 
Kevin Kiernan to put in Jalewalia with 7 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia, who was called for three fouls in a 50-second span early in the 
third quarter, played tentatively in her first few minutes upon returning to 
avoid getting a fifth foul. 
</P>
<P>
But she led a run with her rebounding and defense that brought La Quinta to a 
59-56 margin with 3 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia was called for her fifth foul a minute later with Atascadero leading, 
62-58. She had 21 points. Atascadero pulled away with strong guard play. 
</P>
<P>
"Our weakness was guards, we knew that all year," Kiernan said. "We don't have 
any seniors or a true point guard, what we have is a point-center (in 
Jalewalia)." 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta was also without All-Garden Grove League guard Tanya Krill, who 
missed the game with the chicken pox. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia's 21 points led La Quinta, with Heather Brennan scoring 19.

Aimee McDaniel made 15 of 16 shots and scored a season-high 35 points to lead 
top-seeded Brea-Olinda High School to an 86-40 victory over St. Lucy's of 
Glendora Thursday in a Southern Section 3-A girls' basketball quarterfinal game 
at Brea. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel, a junior point guard who also had three assists, scored 11 of her 
points in the first quarter as Brea-Olinda (24-2) jumped to a 26-11 lead after 
scoring the game's first seven points. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel missed her second shot from the field 1 minute 57 seconds into the 
game when she failed to connect on a layup. She then made her next nine shots 
and finished the half with 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel made five more shots in the third quarter before Wildcat Coach Mark 
Trakh took her out of the game with 20 seconds gone in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the game, Coach reminded us of what happened in the quarterfinals last 
year (when Brea-Olinda lost to Los Altos at home)," said McDaniel, whose 
previous high was 28 points against Valencia on Jan. 10. "That got me psyched 
up because I didn't play very well that game and I was determined that it was 
wasn't going to happen again this year. I just kept shooting the ball and it 
just went in." 
</P>
<P>
Said Trakh, whose team will play Lakewood St. Joseph in Saturday's semifinals: 
"She took it upon herself to get us going, and she did that. She and (Tammy) 
Blackburn both had very exceptional games." 
</P>
<P>
Blackburn, who scored 12 points in the first half as the Wildcats took a 51-27 
lead, finished with 18 points. Jinelle Williams added 11 points, five in the 
Wildcats' 7-0 game-opening spurt. 
</P>
<P>
"We just tried to get into the rhythm of the game, but if you get down, 7-0, 
that kills you," St. Lucy's Coach David Confair said. "There were times that we 
played really good defense against McDaniel, but she still put the balls in the 
basket. That's what happens when you have a shooter who's on a roll like she 
was." 
</P>
<P>
Kristin Triepke scored 15 points and Jennifer Allen added 10 to lead St. Lucy's 
(19-9). 
</P>
<P>
The game was the last at Brea-Olinda's campus site on Brea Boulevard. The 
Wildcats, who play their semifinal game on a neutral site, will play their home 
games next season on their new campus located near Lambert Road.

Abe Gomez was working on short notice Thursday and he made even shorter work of 
Luis Hernandez in the main boxing event in front of about 1,000 at the Irvine 
Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez was credited with a second-round knockout after the fight was stopped 
because of a gash over the left eye of Hernandez. The junior lightweight fight 
was scheduled for 10 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, of Los Angeles, had been training for a March 15 bout with Carlos 
Marquez. But a week ago, he got a call from promoter Don Fraser asking if he 
could step into Thursday's bout. 
</P>
<P>
Genaro Hernandez, the California super featherweight champion, was supposed to 
fight but hurt his hand training, and had to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it was over quickly and that I didn't get hurt," Gomez said. "This 
all worked out OK." Gomez said he will be ready for his March 15 fight. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez is 13-2 with seven knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
The fighters could not agree on how the cut started over Hernandez's eye. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a butt in about the first minute," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez: "I very truly believe it was a right hook that got it started. We butted 
heads a few times but that was in the second round." 
</P>
<P>
None of three ringside judges said they saw a head butt. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, of Redlands, falls to 11-7-5. He has never gone down for a 10-count. 
</P>
<P>
"They can cut me and they can knock me down but they can't knock me out," he 
said.

Lena Dufrene thinks a car should express her personality. Look at her sporty 
Nissan 280ZX, and her Kawasaki motorcycle, "and you see who I am," the 
24-year-old Dufrene says. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Murrell says dependability is the key for him. 
</P>
<P>
Loren Bingaman, a retiree, considers comfort to be paramount. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat in cranes for a lot of years, so a comfortable seat is the most 
important thing to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For many Orange County residents, a car is more than a means of transportation 
-- it is an expression of identity and life style. 
</P>
<P>
And thousands of car buffs, including Dufrene, Murrell and Bingaman, have paid 
$4.50 each to inspect, photograph and touch some of the 450 new cars on display 
at the Orange County International Auto Show at Anaheim Stadium. The car lovers 
stalk new cars the way groupies hound their favorite stars. 
</P>
<P>
"The car is my office. If my car dies, I'm dead," said Murrell, a Balboa Island 
resident who travels 60,000 miles a year, mostly because of his work in 
electronics sales. Murrell drives a 1987 Mercury Sable station wagon for work 
and a Ford Bronco truck for pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
Murrell attended the show this week because he wanted an early peek at the 1990 
Bronco, which he plans to buy when the vehicle hits dealer show rooms in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Others at the 9-day auto show, which ends Sunday, were car enthusiasts who have 
no plans to buy but wanted to see the latest automobiles from three continents 
all under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Plett, who plans to drive his 1979 Volkswagen as long as it lasts, was 
among those just looking. "I read a lot about cars. Here I can see them and 
lift the hoods," he said while inspecting the engine of a Dodge Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Car makers court Southern Californians not only for their purchasing power but 
also because buyers here signal tastes that the rest of the country will likely 
develop in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
"When we introduced the Ford Taurus, people in the Midwest and East were saying 
it looked like a jellybean," said Len Alaimo, a customer satisfaction planning 
manager for Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn, Mich. "They asked what happened to the 
square look. Well, it was selling in Southern California. . . . And now it's a 
hit everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But in California, American auto makers generally don't have the market 
leadership they enjoy in other parts of the country. Since the 1970s, Japanese 
models have been the most popular in Orange County, according to R.L. Polk 
&amp; Associates, an automotive research firm in Carson. Toyota is consistently 
Orange County's biggest seller. 
</P>
<P>
Price may account for much of the popularity of the Japanese cars, and the 
attention paid to Daihatsu, a newcomer to the American car scene. The 
manufacturer has only one model to display, a subcompact economy model, and 
still managed to draw a respectable number of onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll get you there," sales representative Christy Armstrong said of the car. 
"It won't give you any trouble."

Ropak Corp.'s net income for 1988 totaled a record $2.9 million, 86% higher 
than the $1.6 million reported for 1987. Revenue rose 29% to $88.8 million from 
the $69 million posted a year earlier. Net income for the fourth quarter 
increased 30% to $493,000 from the $378,000 reported for last year's comparable 
period. Revenues rose 21% to $21.6 million from $17.9 million. Ropak's chairman 
and chief executive, William H. Roper, attributed the higher earnings to 
improved plant efficiencies and to quickly passing through raw material price 
increases. Ropak, based in Fullerton, makes plastic packaging and handling 
products for foods, coatings and a variety of agricultural and industrial 
materials.

Carl Karcher Enterprises is planning to add 65 stores to its Carl's Jr. 
restaurant chain this year. 
</P>
<P>
The stores will be mostly in California, said Loren Pannier, Karcher 
Enterprises's vice president, finance and administration. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 2 years, the company plans to build or acquire enough stores to 
add more than 100 company-owned restaurants to its inventory in the Western 
United States. That same area is also targeted to be the site of 20 more 
franchised Carl's Jr. stores. 
</P>
<P>
Those new units are largely planned for sections of Northern California and 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Karcher is planning to open 10 Carl's Jr. restaurants in Osaka 
beginning in May, 1989. The company also is exploring other licensing 
opportunities in the Pacific Rim, Pannier said. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher Enterprises now operates Carl's Jr. restaurants in four states.

OWNERS, DEVELOPERS OF CAR CARE CENTERS FORM TRADE ASSOCIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a trade association for Realtors. One for builders. And another for 
developers. There's even an association for trade associations. So why not one 
for people who develop and own car care centers, thought Taylor B. Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Car care centers -- for the uninitiated -- are strip shopping centers that 
cater to motorists with repair shops, auto parts stores and the like. 
</P>
<P>
Grant, a Newport Beach developer, is sometimes credited with developing the 
first such center in the early 1980s in Huntington Beach. That one started as 
an ordinary industrial development, but so many automotive companies wanted in 
that Grant says he hit upon the idea of developing centers from scratch. Now 
the centers are all the rage with some developers, who have put them up all 
over the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
So Grant started the Council of Car Care Centers, which he first ran out of his 
office but has now turned over to a retired tire store executive in Arizona who 
acts as part-time executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Matters that the association deals with aren't exactly burning issues, Grant 
admits. They tend to center on things like educating members about local 
regulations on the storage of used oil and other nuts-and-bolts issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of it's pretty basic stuff," says Grant. 
</P>
<P>
The association already has enlisted 25 members, Grant says, about half 
developers and the other half tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Credit car-crazy Southern California as the mother of this invention, a place 
where motorists can get their cars lubed and tuned up, buy new tires or a pair 
of fuzzy dice for the rear-view mirror and -- in some of the newer centers -- 
also get fast food, rent a video or buy a quart of milk while they're waiting 
for their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Grant, 39, whose American Commerce Centers has developed 10 of the little 
centers, likes to add other types of retailers in order to broaden his market 
for tenants and add to the allure of the centers. 
</P>
<P>
What's behind the rapid growth of these centers, which by some estimates could 
number as many as 500 nationwide? Several factors, it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
Cars are becoming so sophisticated that they're rapidly making the neighborhood 
gas station mechanic obsolete, and that makes specialized repair services more 
appealing. At the same time, the neighborhood mechanic is becoming an 
endangered species as the corner station leans more and more toward 
self-service. 
</P>
<P>
For the consumer, having all those services and products in one location simply 
makes things more convenient, too. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the best corners have already been monopolized by McDonald's, gas 
stations and convenience stores, so it's often tough for even big companies 
like Firestone to find a good place to locate its tire stores. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, some cities are insisting that these kinds of businesses band 
together in architecturally appealing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get to build willy-nilly anywhere we want anymore," said Grant. "With 
communities getting more sensitive about architecture, a lot of cities don't 
want free-standing automotive stores anymore. The car care centers are a 
benefit to automotive companies because, in some cases, they're the only way 
they can get a facility in some cities anymore." 
</P>
<P>
That is the case with car care centers Grant is developing in two cities, 
Upland and Mission Viejo, the developer says. 
</P>
<P>
While the centers are primarily a Sunbelt phenomena, they are starting to 
spread to the Midwest and the Northeast, Grant rays. 
</P>
<P>
Grant is the first president of the Council of Car Care Centers, and is trying 
to recruit into the group owners of centers, real estate lawyers, tenants, 
lenders and consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The cost: $475 a year for a big nationwide retailer or a developer, $200 for a 
regional retailer with fewer than five stores and other small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the big chains (of tune-up places, muffler shops and the like) are 
looking hard for places to put stores," said Grant. "These centers give them 
another good choice."

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW;

SCR SHOW ON GROWTH PAINS PROVES A PLEASURE

<P>
Making choices and feeling self-worth are the themes of "When I Grow Up," an 
inventive new musical from South Coast Repertory's 1989 Educational Touring 
Production for older elementary school-age children and early teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Usually given in schools, the show will be presented to the general public 
Sunday at the Long Beach Jewish Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
A character called Friend (Keith Devaney) stays on the sidelines and guides the 
action of three sixth-grade loners who want to be accepted. Tina (Victoria 
Hoffman), the worrier, is anxious about going into junior high. Hugo (Michael 
Alvarez), a budding writer, is being pressured to join a gang. Melody (Martha 
J. New) wants to be cool like the "in" kids. 
</P>
<P>
Friend's advice -- to go along with anything, just to belong -- gets them in 
trouble, and some of it is scary, particularly Tina's experimentation with 
drugs. In the process, three lessons are learned, although Hugo's ability to 
deal with the gang's threats when he decides not to join is somewhat cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Jerry Patch, with music by Michael Silversher and directed by 
John-David Keller, the show may be just a little too ambitious. The issues it 
deals with are complex and can only be touched on superficially here. 
</P>
<P>
And, although it is well acted, the adult actors lack the voices to deliver the 
show's tuneful musical messages with sufficient impact. 
</P>
<P>
The cast does put the humor over with style, however, and there's plenty of it, 
from a demonstration of just what "cool" is to costume and set designer Dwight 
Richard Odle's innovative way of extending the cast: Each actor "wears" two 
friends of the inanimate, stuffed and sewn variety. The effect is startling and 
worth more than one grin. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, Friend serves as devil's advocate, helping the on-stage kids go 
wrong but also pulling the audience in by asking for advice and reactions. That 
may be the show's biggest strength: how well it knows its target audience, and 
how intimately it involves that audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I Grow Up" will be presented Sunday at 1:30 p.m. at the Long Beach 
Jewish Community Center, 3801 E. Willow St., Long Beach. Tickets: $3. 
Information: (213) 426-7601.

ONE OF THE REAL MYSTERIES OF THE ORIENT -- TASTY BUT RATHER PRICEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese grandmothers might swoon over a clever young businessman like Michael 
Kang, but most of the dishes that Kang serves in his Laguna Beach restaurant, 
Five Feet, bear no resemblance to anything they would have ever seen before. 
Kang's food is a combination of performance art, buzz-word ingredients and 
Taoist philosophy. It is as controversial as it is contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, almost everything about this small, ultra-chic, gallery-like 
restaurant is subject to controversy -- even the name, which is rumored to be 
derived from three possible sources: owner Kang's height, the height of the 
restaurant's sign, or the building's elevation above sea level. I couldn't get 
our waiter to commit. 
</P>
<P>
People either love or hate the restaurant's warehouse-like demeanor: Art 
Nouveau on gray brick walls, a Pompidou Center-style jumble of exposed pipes 
and twisting ducts, classy Deco lights hanging from a high wooden ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
And just try to find another restaurant heady enough to charge a full-price 
corkage fee for wines already on their list. The food isn't exactly cheap 
either; a pretty pastel plateful of kung pao chicken costs $15; that's about 
three times what it would cost served on a plain white plate in a more 
traditional Chinese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
But consider the novel joys of listening to Anita Baker and Tracy Chapman while 
picking beluga caviar out of a bed of vegetable-fried rice. Arrogant? Perhaps. 
Boring? No chance. 
</P>
<P>
As my friends and I approached Five Feet for our first visit, my eyes 
immediately were drawn to a flash of neon and a pale blue glint of light 
emanating from one of the paintings hanging inside. It was a cool Thursday 
night, and steam was pouring from the open kitchen. People with no place to sit 
were crowded around the doorway; stories we had heard about overbooking seemed 
very real. But surprise! In less than 5 minutes, the doorway cleared, and our 
table was ready in time for our reservation. 
</P>
<P>
The waiter came soon, noticing that we had brought our own wine and immediately 
informed us that if our wines were on the house list, we would have to pay the 
price written on the wine list for the privilege of drinking them with dinner. 
Checking the list, we made the lucky discovery that they were not, and settled 
on a less outrageous $10-per-bottle corkage fee. Nevertheless, I felt as if I 
had been sold short by Gordon Gekko. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, though, I was in the mood to forget. Appetizers arrived on glazed ceramic 
plates with rich, warm colors, and looked beautiful. Four servings of warm goat 
cheese won ton got to the table first, surrounded by perfect slices of apple. 
They tasted wonderful, but the filling was astonishingly hot: Someone at our 
table burned her tongue on molten cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Golden cup, minced Muscovy duck breast wokked with pinenuts in a plum-ginger 
sauce, turned out to be thoroughly delightful -- tiny, light and complex. 
Bangkok beef satay, skewer-size beef in an orange-lime-peanut sauce, was 
ordinary, though there was a delicious slice of grilled onion on the side. Only 
the salad, advertised as mixed baby greens and toasted walnuts dressed with 
sesame-walnut vinaigrette, was a disappointment. It came full of burnt pine 
nuts, no walnuts, far too much dressing and a mealy, sliced tomato. 
</P>
<P>
But the tomatoes were not mealy with the second course, blackened yellow-fin 
tuna with marinated English cucumber and luscious vine tomatoes, which had a 
firm, juicy texture. Everyone except me seemed to think the dish was a stroke 
of genius, because of the "complexity and contradiction" (the pretentious name 
that the restaurant has chosen for it) of flavors. Still, it struck me as 
something I had had before at Santa Monica's Chinois on Main, a restaurant many 
like to compare with this one. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think that's a good comparison: Some dishes may be similar in spirit, 
but I find Chinois and Five Feet vastly different. The chef at Chinois, Kazuto 
Matsuzaka, is Japanese, as are many of his inspirations. The only things 
Japanese about Five Feet are the lacquered black chopsticks and service plates 
which have become a cliche in contempo Oriental dining circles. To its credit, 
Five Feet is an original, a clone of nothing, and most of what the restaurant 
serves has real character. Despite the presence of raspberries, radicchio, goat 
cheese and other things Chinese cooks wouldn't go near, the food at Five Feet 
manages to come off as oddly Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
We confirmed the Chinois-Five Feet differences as we dug into main courses. The 
restaurant's signature dish is 5'0" sweet and sour catfish, and the fish is as 
soft and fragrant as it is possible for catfish to be. All four of us 
positively devoured the crispy skin that had been drenched in a tasty red sauce 
-- piranhas couldn't have done much better. Sonoma lamb Mongolian-style in a 
scallion-mint sauce was so tender I tried to cut it with chopsticks. 
</P>
<P>
My dish was veal a la Szechuan-Mex, and although the meat was superb, the dish 
failed. The sauce was too pungent, and the flavor of the meat totally 
disappeared. Much better is boneless quail grilled with shiitake mushrooms, wax 
beans, snow peas and Roma tomato on two-color fettucine tossed in a spicy 
papaya, ginger, and basil sauce -- I poached several bites off a neighboring 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
The four of us could hardly manage half of what was on our plates. Perhaps that 
is why Five Feet can be so expensive. Then again, there seems to be a great 
demand for this artfully experimental Chinese cooking, but the supply appears 
rather short. Until the Chinese restaurant community realizes this on a 
meaningful scale, continue to expect to pay $5 to $10 for appetizers, $12 to 
$24 for main courses, and healthy mark-ups for wines, even if you bring them 
along from home.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Crocodile Cafe in the Brea Marketplace, 975 E. Birch St., Brea. (714) 529-CAFE. 
Open 7 days 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., till 12 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Smith is doing more than just promoting the new American cuisine; he's 
making it into a populist movement at this small, laughably inexpensive cafe. 
Enjoy wonderful hamburgers grilled over smoking embers of oak, wood-fired 
pizzas with designer toppings, and trendy homemade pastas like fettucine with 
roasted Pasilla chili and ancho-cream. Sit under the thirty foot vinyl 
crocodile sipping boutique wines. You can bet your Beamer that this restaurant 
is a good value. 
</P>
<P>
Almagreb, 23700 El Toro Road, in the Saddleback Valley Plaza, El Toro. (714) 
859-9393. Open Tuesdays through Sundays 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Almagreb, a Moroccan restaurant in El Toro, has one of the most dramatic 
dining areas anywhere: clustered tent canopies among a maze of mirrors with an 
almost mystical dimension. Meals are taken in the traditional style, with no 
utensils, and are finger-licking good. Among the better offerings: b'stilla (a 
sugar-dusted chicken pie), couscous (cracked semolina wheat in a savory 
vegetable stew), and Tanya, belly dancer extraordinaire. The Arabic music 
accompanying her is deafening. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh, 5423 W. 1st St., Santa Ana. (714) 554-7260. Open weekdays 10 a.m. 
to 10:30 p.m., weekends till 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh is more than just one of the area's best restaurants: It is a 
crossroad of Vietnamese and American culture: The crowd is as diverse as the 
menu. Cua rang muoi (cooked salted crab) and bo dam (garlic centered beef) are 
two dishes not to miss, but lighter appetites can indulge in more than 50 
noodle dishes. While away the day listening to Asian pop music, gawking at the 
new wavers and sipping filter coffee and tropical freezes made from durian and 
jackfruit. 
</P>
<P>
Felix Continental Cafe, 36 Plaza Square, Orange. (714) 633-5842. Open 7 days 
from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
You can smell the garlic for blocks around this European-looking, Cuban-style 
cafe in the old downtown of Orange. The menu abounds with exotica. Papa 
rellena, a potato and egg croquette rolled in bread crumbs, is about the best 
appetizer. Roast chicken Cubano, a crispy half chicken with bitter orange peel 
added for extra dimension, is definitely the best entree. Save room for dessert 
-- it is the best course here. Pineapple-raisin bread pudding, a soft, buttery 
suspension of rum, eggs, flour and fruit, is good enough to make Betty Crocker 
blush. 
</P>
<P>
Caffe Piemonte, 1835 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 532-3296. Open Tuesdays 
through Fridays 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Tuesdays through Sundays 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Two brothers from Piemonte, one of Italy's most scenic provinces, have opened 
this handsome, spotless little trattoria in the city of Orange, and already it 
has become a county hotspot. Start any meal here with the wonderful, sumptuous 
antipasto and then move on to one of chef Luigi Ravetto's hand extruded 
homemade pastas (such as chewy ruotelle, little, six-spoked wheels perfect for 
soaking up sauce). Ravetto's cooking is somewhat generic, but he has included 
polenta, the cornmeal staple of his province, and you really should try it. His 
polenta Piemontese, with a light, grainy cheese sauce, is most appealing. 
</P>
<P>
California Pizza Kitchen, Fashion Island, 1151 Newport Center Drive, Newport 
Beach. (714) 759-5543. Open Mondays through Thursdays 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., 
Fridays and Saturdays to 11, Sundays to 9. 
</P>
<P>
 With the eighties has come the designer pizza, and it looks as if the phenom 
is here to stay. That's what the California Pizza Kitchen is banking on, 
anyway. This slicked down operation, designed for flash and staffed with young, 
beautiful people, serves an eclectic, almost futuristic array of pizzas topped 
with everything from goat cheese to peanut sauce. Service is somewhat 
indifferent at present; high energy owners Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfeld should 
fix that problem soon. Best to stick with the pizzas that don't fall too far 
from the tree; five-cheese, homemade sausage, and a delicious bar-b-cued 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
1520 AD, 821 S. Beach Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 995-5464. Seatings are Fridays at 
7:30 p.m., Saturdays at 6:30 and 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The food at 1520 AD may not be authentic Tudor, but who cares? When you eat 
with your fingers, everything tastes better. The opening course at this 
re-creation of a Merrie Olde England roadhouse is a hearty lentil barley soup, 
drunk from large draughts and eaten with hunks of brown bread. There is a 
choice of four entrees: slow cooked chicken, lamb shank in a white sauce, steak 
kabob, and a most modern filet of halibut with a heathen Spanish sauce on top. 
The abundant platters of rice and vegetables, the fine, lemony pound cake, and 
the bottomless mugs of ice cold beer make for a dinner that King Henry himself 
would have enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
Granville's, in the Disneyland Hotel, 1150 W. Cerritos Ave., Anaheim. (714) 
778-6600. Open Tuesdays through Saturdays 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Disneyland Hotel might not immediately spring to mind when the subject of 
restaurants comes up, but it ought to: Granville's, its flagship restaurant, is 
one of the best around. The room is designed for elegance, with mahogany 
sideboards, Regency-style chairs and overwhelming shades of burgundy. Chef Tim 
Owen trained with Boston cooking teacher Madeleine Kamman, and his cuisine is 
original and delicate. Such appetizers as Little Neck clams steamed in Pernod 
with spinach are wonderful, as are such entrees as loin of lamb in an anise 
crust, oven roasted with thyme and rosemary. There is an extensive wine list 
(featuring American wines only), and the service is impeccable.

<P>
Which foods marry best with which wines, and vice versa? You'll find numerous 
opportunities to learn -- and enjoy -- during March. 
</P>
<P>
Nine restaurants and 20 California wineries will participate in "A Toast from 
the Heart" March 9 at 6:30 p.m. in the Grand Ballroom of the Westin South Coast

wineries during March and April will include Robert Mondavi, Kendall-Jackson, 
Rutherford Hills, Callaway, Clos du Bois and Simi. 
</P>
<P>
TURN BACK THE CALENDAR: To mark its 10th anniversary, The Cat &amp; the Custard 
Cup in La Habra is bringing back its original menu -- with original prices 
(except for liquor and desserts) -- on March 6 and 7. Prime New York steak with 
fried onions, basted with hazelnut butter, for instance, will cost a mere 
$11.95. 
</P>
<P>
CANO ON THE MOVE: Larry J. Cano, who resigned after 24 years as president of 
the El Torito restaurant chain last year, has bought Cano's in Newport Beach, 
which he originally opened as part of the El Torito family in April, 1977. And, 
with Fred Le Franc, Cano has purchased the Studio Cafe in Corona del Mar from 
Hovik Abramian. At Cano's, he has remodeled the bar; at the Studio, he foresees 
no radical changes, but does plan kitchen and menu "improvements." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abramian, who will concentrate his efforts on his Balboa Studio 
Cafe, welcomes the slowdown in his "crazy" life style. ("I actually went 
skiing. . . .") 
</P>
<P>
MORE NEWS ABOUT Hans Prager, who owns the Ritz in Newport Center: He is opening 
the Yankee Tavern on the first of April at Bayside Drive and Coast Highway in 
Newport Beach because he thinks the Ritz has become a special-occasion place 
and that the Tavern will fill the need for "a casual dinner house," offering 
such things as pan-fried pork chops with apple-jack country gravy and mashed 
potatoes, Yankee pot roast with buttered noodles, and rice custard pudding. 
</P>

Close to the harpist. Near the waiter's station. Next to the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Spots to get the very best food service? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. Spots the cognoscenti say are simply "Siberia" inside of power 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
At Antoine, that divinely chic salon that perches like a royal jewel box inside 
Le Meridien hotel in Newport Beach, you will never see a power couple like 
Renee and Henry Segerstrom sipping vintage bubbly in the same chamber as the 
woman strumming the heavenly strings. Never. Never. Never. The Segerstroms are 
always escorted to Table 21, in a chamber once removed from the harpist. 
</P>
<P>
At Antonello in Santa Ana, where Orange County supervisors dine frequently, and 
where Forbes 400 member George Argyros regularly sinks his teeth into power 
lunches, you won't see heavy hitters at Table 1, the "worst seat in the house," 
says a laughing Antonio Cagnolo, the debonair Italian who owns the place. 
"That's next to the waiter's station. 
</P>
<P>
"The A spot is Table 27. It sits in the corner of our villa area and has all 
the things an A table should have: it's up front enough to have a view of the 
dining room but private enough to keep people from bothering you." 
</P>
<P>
Argyros, Cagnolo says, frequently requests Table 6, a larger table where more 
power folks can dine and still see, and be seen, but not be pestered. When 
Henry Segerstrom was courting the powers-that-be of Tiffany &amp; Co., he 
requested round Table 6. 
</P>
<P>
Never-never land at the Ritz restaurant in Newport Beach is around Table 20, 
located immediately outside the kitchen exit, manager Craig Schisler says. "The 
A table is No. 38, the booth that sits under an oil painting of Auguste 
Escoffier." 
</P>
<P>
An A table never had it so good. Sitting under the toque-topped, dashing master 
of French cuisine, guests get to sip an extra-dry martini and drink in the 
panorama of the smart set as they dine in the plush main room. And one also 
gets to gawk at the goings-on within the clubby bar (where, overhead, owner 
Hans Prager has posted the saying: "It's my life. I live it. I love it. Critics 
be damned.") 
</P>
<P>
Other power spots at the Ritz include the posh Ritz Brothers' room, where the 
power booths are 10, 11 and 12. And then there are those ritzy, curtained 
tables in the piano room that look rather like posh church confessionals. 
(Irvine Co.'s Gary Hunt -- billionaire Don Bren's right arm -- and Forbes 400 
megadeveloper William Lyon were recently spotted there doing a power lunch 
behind drawn curtains.) 
</P>
<P>
At the private Center Club in Costa Mesa, the only table is Table 56, the spot 
where diners can pick at poached salmon while gazing upon the curvy bronze 
sculpture "Sun Glitter" by Sweden's Carl Milles, located in the water gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the ocean view of Costa Mesa," says the club membership chairwoman, Susan 
Stebbins. 
</P>
<P>
Siberia at the Center Club, Stebbins says, is Table 70, the first table you see 
as you enter the dining room. "If you sit there, you feel like everyone is 
coming directly at you, like you're about to throw a huge dinner party!" 
</P>
<P>
Dear Miss Manners: What do you do when the star of your party, a celebrated New 
York society queen who just happens to be the wife of Henry Kravis -- the 
corporate buyout king -- calls to say, boo-hoo, she has the flu? Janice Johnson 
knows. You smile at your guests as they sweep into your cliff-hung Laguna Beach 
home. You bubble. You make sure everyone has a drink. 
</P>
<P>
And you have a tiny nervous breakdown before guests arrive. "It's 
embarrassing," said Johnson on Wednesday after learning fashion designer 
Carolyne Roehm would not attend her patron party that night. The sparkling 
soiree kicked off "The Guilds Take Manhattan," a benefit for the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center that, on Thursday at the Irvine Hilton, featured Roehm's 
breathtaking spring collection and netted more than $70,000. "But Carolyne 
called me personally and she sounded very sincere. She said she was from the 
Midwest and never breaks a promise, that she would be at her fashion show on 
Thursday night." Among the 100 missing Roehm at the patron bash were: Johnson's 
husband Roger, CEO of Western Digital; Willa Dean and William Lyon; Gus Owen 
and Kathryn Thompson; Harry and Shari Esayian; Barbara and Jim Glabman and Bob 
and Gayle Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Stuff: Watch for the Round Table West, a high-level book club that formerly 
met at the now-defunct Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, to begin meeting at the 
Balboa Bay Club (Fay Wray plans to promote her new book there soon) . . . Pilar 
and Aissa Wayne, along with author Joseph Wambaugh, will be among the celebrity 
waiters Monday night at Dizz's As Is restaurant in Laguna Beach to benefit the 
Orangewood Children's Foundation . . . Watch for designers Bob Mackie and Oscar 
de la Renta to make back-to-back charity appearances at the Amen Wardy boutique 
at Newport Center Fashion Island this spring. De la Renta will appear at a 
luncheon May 12, and Mackie will appear the next night at a black-tie soiree. 
Both events will be staged by Angelitos de Oro, a highly sophisticated support 
group of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Orange County.

<P>
TEEN-AGE PARENTS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW RESPONSIBILITIES WEIGH HEAVILY ON 2 YOUNG COUPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORENZA MUNOZ, Lorenza Munoz is a senior at Capistrano Valley High School, 
where she is editorial editor of the school newspaper, Paw Prints, and a member 
of the varsity swimming team. She has been accepted at UC Berkeley, where she 
plans to major in political science/international relations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
For most teen-agers, the toughest part about high school may be deciding 
whether to go out for the football team, passing their driver's license test, 
deciding who to ask to the prom or passing a few exams and quizzes along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
But some are forced to make mature decisions before they become adults. Of 
Orange County's 81,083 girls ages 15 to 19, 3,049 gave birth in 1986, according 
to Adolescent Pregnancy ChildWatch, a volunteer survey of local health and 
community groups, churches, schools and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that in 1986, one in 27 girls ages 15 to 19 gave birth, 
slightly fewer than in recent years. But in the same year, 40 children were 
born to mothers ages 10 through 14, up from 24 in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Eric and Cathy (who asked that their real names not be used) and Laura LaFlamme 
-- all 1988 graduates of Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo -- are 
among those for whom parenting has come early. 
</P>
<P>
A tall brunette walked across a football field during a windy graduation 
ceremony last June. The breeze pressed her gown against her stomach, which was 
becoming round as a baby grew inside. 
</P>
<P>
As Laura LaFlamme, 18, walked in front of hundreds of spectators, she endured 
stares and whispers. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kind of put my chin up and walked across," she said. "I think I 
would've been really upset with myself if I hadn't." 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Laura gave birth to her daughter, Amber. When she discovered 
that she was pregnant, Laura and her fiance, Steve Carter, 20, considered both 
abortion and adoption. In fact, they were at the abortion clinic when they 
decided to keep their child. 
</P>
<P>
"She waited 3 1/2 months before she told me she was pregnant," Carter said. 
"You just don't wait 3 1/2 months and not know that you will probably have it. 
So I took her out to lunch, and we decided not to have it done." 
</P>
<P>
Laura said she had never discussed birth control with Steve. "Of course I knew 
(birth control) existed, but I thought (pregnancy) wouldn't happen to me," she 
said. "That was basically the attitude I'd taken, which was obviously the wrong 
attitude. In a way I do regret it. I think back and say, 'Gosh, what if I had 
done this or that,' but it was my own mistake and since I did get myself into 
this situation, I'm glad I made this decision to keep the baby." 
</P>
<P>
Laura found the difficulties of attending school while pregnant to be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really that hard if I was with my friends, but when I was alone I 
would sort of put my books in front of my stomach," she said. "The faculty and 
students were really nice. They really showed a lot of support." 
</P>
<P>
However, Laura found it hard to continue a positive relationship with her 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't accept Steve; they don't talk about him. It angers me," Laura said. 
"I live with him. I like to talk about things we do, but I can't." 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with their daughter's pregnancy hasn't been easy for Roberta and George 
LaFlamme. "We were very disappointed," Roberta LaFlamme said. "We had trusted 
her and her boyfriend. My husband thought she was quite immature for her age. 
He went into a real depression." 
</P>
<P>
Roberta LaFlamme acknowledges that neither she nor her husband has accepted 
Steve as a member of their family. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he planned the whole" pregnancy, she said. "It was his way of holding 
on to Laura. She should have been stronger. Hopefully, she won't marry him." 
</P>
<P>
The LaFlammes did not see their daughter for the last 5 months of her pregnancy 
and have only seen their grandchild about five times in the past 6 months. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think she's too happy where she is," Roberta LaFlamme said of her 
daughter. "We want her to live at home and go back to school." 
</P>
<P>
Laura moved out of her family's house a year ago and lives with Steve and his 
mother in Laguna Hills. "If I had wanted to (move back home) in the first 
place, I would have," Laura said. "But I don't think I could live away from 
Steve." 
</P>
<P>
Steve works for a health maintenance company in Laguna Hills, and Laura has 
become a full-time mother and a part-time baby-sitter of other children. She 
said she and Steve plan to marry within the year. 
</P>
<P>
Laura added that she would like to attend college someday and earn a diploma. 
</P>
<P>
"I think education is really important, but I don't really know what I'm going 
to (study). I'm really undecided. (Not continuing my education) came with my 
making the decision to have my baby. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still young. I can go back maybe when Amber is in kindergarten. Right now, 
my life is fulfilled. I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
Eric and Kathy, both 18, had known each other throughout high school and began 
dating their senior year. The couple had planned to marry next August, but 
because their baby is due next month, they decided to get married last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tough, time-consuming, and I'm worried," said Eric, who has worked 
full time as an electrician since high school graduation. "How am I going to 
support a wife and kid? I'm growing up fast." 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't turn to his family for support. "It was World War III with my 
parents," Eric said. "They are stuck on (my getting) a college education, 
building a foundation and not struggling to have a home your wife can come home 
to. They just don't care how I feel. They kicked me out of the house. As long 
as I went to school, they paid for everything. . . . Not anymore, though." 
</P>
<P>
Not every family member turned against Eric. His grandmother supported his 
decision to marry, but his parents and brothers were not as sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
"They kind of despise Kathy," Eric said. "They say she took me away from my 
family. I'm totally sure of my decision to get married, though. I love her a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
Eric's father said his son's decision to get married and raise a family will be 
detrimental to his future. "Eric had so much going for him," his father said. 
"It's hard enough to go out and find work with a diploma. Without one, it puts 
much more of a strain on the relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Eric plans to attend Saddleback College on a part-time basis -- attending night 
and summer school -- and work toward a degree in engineering. Kathy, who works 
part time at a preschool, hopes to take child development classes. 
</P>
<P>
Eric's parents were against the couple marrying from the start. "We took them 
out to dinner and we asked what (Kathy) really wanted out of life. She said she 
wanted to get out and start a family," Eric's father said. "There was no real 
ambition." 
</P>
<P>
Eric's parents went so far as to accuse Kathy of getting pregnant to trap Eric, 
a claim she flatly denies, adding that she didn't try to get pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't take any blame," Kathy said. "I didn't make him do anything he didn't 
want to do." When asked why the couple hadn't used any birth control, Kathy 
said, "We never really thought of it or thought that we would be the ones." 
</P>
<P>
Said Eric's father: "The initial reaction to Eric's decision to marry was one 
of shock and disbelief. Then when we were told of the pregnancy, the shock was 
too much to bear. I don't know what response I had." 
</P>
<P>
Eric's decision to marry affected his parents deeply, but it virtually ended 
the close relationship he had once shared with his twin brother. 
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer be close to each other," Eric's brother said. "He's 
restricted on time -- taking care of his wife, his family. He has to be more 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
The day of his wedding, Eric said, he was full of all sorts of emotions, 
ranging from love and excitement to sadness and anxiety. "I thought, 'What am I 
getting into? What does this all mean? No more single life.' It was a scary 
thought. I couldn't believe it, but it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Eric's family was not going to attend the wedding, but they decided 
to go, as his father put it, out of a "respect for Eric." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Eric now faces the struggle of maintaining a balance between being an 
18-year-old, a husband and a father-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm climbing up walls," he said. "I try to kid about it. It's not 
going to do any good to dwell on the bad. Sometimes I get down, and I feel I 
can't be a good father or that I'm not ready for the world. But I'm happy and 
I'll never regret it."

It might be as lofty as bringing about world peace or an end to hunger. Or it 
could be as simple as getting through the day or your homework. Everyone has 
goals -- both long- and short-term varieties -- and many of these have probably

IVY LEAGUE APPLICANTS TAPER OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-expected "baby bust" and spiraling tuitions are causing a drop in the 
number of applications at some Ivy League colleges and other top-flight private 
schools this year, although most public institutions such as the University of 
California continue to see increases. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford University, for example, reports a drop of about 6% in applications 
after a similar decline the year before. At Harvard University, applications 
are down between 5% and 10%, the first decline in 20 years. Dartmouth College 
has seen a decline of about 20%, after a big jump last year and then some 
adverse publicity about political trouble on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"There is clearly a smaller pool of 18-year-olds, and it's a surprise that we 
weren't down prior to this," Marcia Connolly, Harvard's associate director of 
admissions, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly contributing to the decline is the practice of charging application 
fees that range as high as $50, causing some students to apply to fewer 
colleges, admissions officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, expectations may be coming back to earth. In recent years, 
counselors say, high school seniors have been pressured by parents and society 
to apply to prestigious colleges even if there was little chance of acceptance. 
This year's numbers suggest that is changing. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the decline in applications, admissions officers caution, very 
selective colleges still will accept fewer than one in three applicants and 
sometimes fewer than one in seven. 
</P>
<P>
For the UC system, applications are up slightly this year, to 49,134 from 
48,335 last year. The relatively low cost of a UC education is probably a 
factor in the increase. Not including room and board, fees for in-state UC 
students next year will average $1,577, compared to $13,000 or more at many 
well-known independent institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the number of 18-year-olds has been declining since 1980 and will 
continue to drop for a few more years. About 2.76 million students graduated 
from high school last year, and the total is expected to bottom out at 2.44 
million in 1992. Then the so-called Echo Generation comes of age -- the 
children of people born during the post-World War II Baby Boom. That is why UC 
is planning to build as many as three new campuses by the end of the century.

18-YEAR DEPUTY HELD IN PROSTITUTE SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sheriff's deputy arrested in connection with a series of prostitute murders 
in South-Central Los Angeles was identified today as Rickey Ross, 40, a 
narcotics investigator who has been with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who had been smoking a substance believed to be cocaine with a prostitute 
when he was arrested about 1:30 a.m. Thursday, was under investigation in the 
murders of three street walkers in the area where at least nine prostitutes 
have been killed recently, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Ross was spotted with the woman in his unmarked car by police officers 
patrolling South-Central Los Angeles, Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At Least Nine Murders 
</P>
<P>
Police have been investigating a recent series of slayings in the area of at 
least nine and possibly as many as a dozen "strawberries" -- women who trade 
sex for drugs -- since August, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
A gun was recovered from Ross' car, and after a ballistics test linked the gun 
to the three killings, Ross was placed under arrest by investigators who had 
accompanied him to his home in the San Bernardino County city of Rialto. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said the woman in the car had no indication that Ross was a deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not stop her (by) using his badge," Gates said. "He only identified 
himself (as a deputy) after the officers stopped him." 
</P>
<P>
Police were investigating whether Ross was linked to the other recent slayings, 
Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block said Ross, married with two children, 
ages 20 and 5, is currently assigned to a unit at Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a very fine record," Block said. "He has been a very effective 
investigator in the narcotics bureau." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Known to Be a Prostitute 
</P>
<P>
The name of the woman in the car with Ross was not released. A police news 
release said she was a prostitute. Gates said she told officers that she was 
getting scared before they arrived because she had been "well briefed" by 
police on the area's killings. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told investigators "simply that he (Ross) wanted to go to the trunk 
of his vehicle," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
The gun that was recovered was in the trunk, although the woman didn't know 
that. 
</P>
<P>
A 77th Street Division police unit on routine patrol spotted Ross' car parked 
near the Harbor Freeway and Gage Avenue. The car pulled away from the curb in 
an "erratic" manner as the police officers approached and they made a traffic 
stop, the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers alleged that Ross was under the influence of an intoxicating 
substance. Gates said the woman told investigators they had been smoking 
cocaine but he noted that tests were still being conducted to confirm the type 
of substance.

2 CHILDREN DIE, 7 STRICKEN BY ILLNESS BELIEVED SPREAD AT CHURCH SOCIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two children died and at least seven others were hospitalized after suddenly 
coming down with an unexplained illness they apparently developed while 
attending a social gathering at a Samoan church in Hacienda Heights, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
A number of adults who were at the gathering also became ill. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Fire Department spokeswoman Arden Beer said the children who 
died lived in the same house, although it was not immediately known whether 
they were related. 
</P>
<P>
Toby Staheli, a spokeswoman for the Communicable Disease Control section of the 
county Health Department, said the agency is investigating what may have caused 
the deaths but has not reached any definite conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
She said investigators are looking into the possibility the illness may be 
related to a recent outbreak of measles in Long Beach that left two other 
Samoan children dead.

NATIONAL GOP CHIEFS CUT ALL TIES WITH EX-KLANSMAN DUKE

<P>
The national Republican Party leadership, spurred by chairman Lee Atwater, 
today cut all ties to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, the newly elected 
Louisiana Republican state lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Party spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said 28 voting members of the party's 
executive committee unanimously repudiated during a telephone vote Duke's 
racist and anti-Semitic views and barred financial or other assistance for him. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, 38, a former klan grand wizard, was elected to the Legislature Saturday 
from a suburban New Orleans district in a narrow victory over builder John 
Treen, 63, who was backed by President Bush and former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted by the national Republicans in effect "excommunicates" 
Duke, according to Atwater, who said Duke is neither a Republican nor a 
Democrat but "a charlatan and a faker" using Republicans to promote his racist 
agenda.

A man described as the boyfriend of a nurse who was ambushed and fatally shot 
in the hills above Studio City, apparently after she was tricked into stopping 
her car to give medical aid, was arrested this morning on suspicion of murder, 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the suspect as Giles Aubery, 53, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was arrested shortly after 9 a.m. at his wife's home in southwest 
Los Angeles and was taken to the North Hollywood police station, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucille Marie Warren, 40, of Inglewood, the divorced mother of two teen-agers, 
was shot at 6:45 a.m. Wednesday in the 7400 block of Woodrow Wilson Drive. She 
had been employed as a night nurse at a nearby home in the exclusive hillside 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Warren apparently halted her car when she saw a man who appeared to 
have collapsed in the street and got out to see if she could help. The man then 
stood up and shot her repeatedly. She died four hours later. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of the investigation, police said they suspected that Warren 
may have known her killer.

The head of Mexico City's police intelligence branch, accused by opposition 
groups of torturing prisoners during the 1970s and under U.S. indictment, has 
resigned his post, a City Hall spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
He said Miguel Nazar Haro, director of the newly created intelligence services 
of the city police force, tendered his resignation after just over two months 
in the job. Nazar, 60, was previously deputy director of the federal security 
office between 1975 and 1982, when he resigned after being indicted by a U.S. 
grand jury in San Diego on charges of participating in a stolen car ring. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials reject the charges, but the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City 
said a warrant for his arrest is still standing in San Diego.

A congressional agency that monitors U.S. aid programs in Latin America plans 
to close its six-person office in Panama because of unsettled conditions in 
that country, an official said today. 
</P>
<P>
David Littleton, director of operations for national security and international 
affairs at the General Accounting Office, said he expects that all personnel 
will have left the office by the middle of the year. They will begin leaving 
shortly before the presidential election set May 7, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of official U.S. personnel from various government agencies in 
Panama has been scaled back considerably since 1987, when relations between the 
two countries began to deteriorate.

<P>
Snow pounded the East Coast today, causing blizzard conditions from North 
Carolina to Delaware, and tourists hoping to escape winter's fury shivered in 
record 37-degree cold in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The heaviest snow battered northeastern North Carolina, snarling traffic, 
canceling schools and closing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got blowing snow," said Gates County Sheriff Elmo Benton. "It's 3 1/2 
feet deep in some places. I walked through it this morning. It's up past my 
knees at one point and 12 feet from it it's 2 inches deep." 
</P>
<P>
Gusting winds were clocked at 61 m.p.h. in Duck, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said the snow blanketed an area stretching from 
North Carolina to Massachusetts and was headed toward southern Maine. 
</P>
<P>
"Very strong winds were rotating counterclockwise around the center of the

DOLLAR RISES MARGINALLY IN EUROPE IN MILD REACTION TO FED RATE HIKE

The dollar finished marginally higher in Europe today as the market reacted 
without enthusiasm to a hike in the U.S. discount rate. Gold prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's move to raise 
the discount rate to 7% from 6.5% initially caused the dollar to steam to a 
session high of 1.8330 West German marks. 
</P>
<P>
Although dealers had been complaining about the lack of strong action from the 
Fed for months, some thought that the rate hike was not strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It should have been a full point, many people thought, and the dollar then 
went down," said a trader at a large Frankfurt bank. 
</P>
<P>
Others said the move came too late and had only a symbolic effect that wore 
off. The dollar then traded in quiet ranges.

Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter said today "we'll find a way" to meet 
President Bush's demands to cut $2 billion from farm subsidy spending while 
preserving leverage for world trade reform. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter, in office since Feb. 8, said he hopes to announce his first major 
appointments of top positions at the department next week. "We'll find a way to 
do so because that's a requirement of the process," Yeutter said when asked if 
$2 billion could be removed from subsidy spending. "The deficit must be cut. . 
. . Agriculture will have to play its part, its proper role in that process. 
We'll find a way to do so."

Bank employees went on strike today throughout Greece to press demands for a 
new collective agreement to include salary raises linked to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour walkout at private and state-controlled banks was called by the 
50,000-member Greek Federation of Bank Employees after the socialist government 
declined to discuss its demands. 
</P>
<P>
"The walkout was a complete success. We haven't had such participation in 
years," said union President Theocharis Papamargaris. 
</P>
<P>
The union demands that wage increases linked to the inflation rate be 
calculated on an employee's overall salary, which includes fringe benefits, and 
not on their base pay. Inflation last year reached 14%.

Union Carbide today handed over $465 million to the Indian Supreme Court to 
compensate victims of the Bhopal poison gas tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
The Danbury, Conn.-based chemical company delivered the money ahead of the 
March 23 deadline set by the court last week when it handed down its 
$470-million judgment. About $5 million had been dispersed previously. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people were killed on Dec. 3, 1984, when poison gas escaped 
from Union Carbide's pesticides factory in the central Indian city of Bhopal in 
history's worst industrial disaster. The death toll now stands at more than 
3,400 with victims dying at the rate of one a day.

TODAY'S INCIDENT EERILY REMINISCENT;

BOEING BESET BY RECENT SAFETY PROBLEMS

<P>
The Boeing Co., maker of the 747 jumbo jet that lost part of its fuselage after 
takeoff from Hawaii today, has been beset by recent safety and production 
problems and has hired a public relations firm to spruce up its image. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on the cause of today's incident, in which eight to 
11 people were sucked from the plane when a 10-by-40-foot vertical hole opened 
in the jet. 
</P>
<P>
It was eerily reminiscent, however, of an accident last April 28, also over 
Hawaii. A flight attendant was killed and 61 people were injured when part of 
the fuselage of a Boeing 737 peeled off during an Aloha Airlines flight from 
Hilo to Honolulu, exposing the first-class section to the open air at 24,000 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
That incident led to widespread concern about the safety of aging jets like the 
Aloha 737. Tiny cracks were found later in nearly half the aging Boeing 737 
jetliners inspected in the months after the Aloha accident. 
</P>
<P>

Boeing Still Sells 
</P>
<P>
Airlines have voted with their dollars, however, in expressing their continuing 
confidence in Boeing airplanes. All Nippon Airways on Wednesday ordered 20 new 
747-400s in a deal valued at $3.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But Boeing has been plagued by various safety and production concerns of late: 
</P>
<P>
* The company confirmed Wednesday that crossed wires were found in two more 
airplanes. The latest cases involved cargo-hold fire-extinguisher systems in 
two Air Canada 767s. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration on Feb. 1 ordered checks on the plumbing 
and wiring of fire-suppressant and monitoring systems in cargo holds and 
engines of Boeing planes built since 1981. Over the last year, 30 such problems 
have been found by airlines worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing has said it is taking steps to find the cause of the problems and to 
make changes so they will not happen in the future. 
</P>
<P>
* The FAA said earlier this month that it had asked Boeing and McDonnell 
Douglas to determine whether inadequately tested nuts, bolts and rivets made by 
Voi-Shan Aerospace Products were used in making aircraft. Voi-Shan, of 
Chatsworth, Calif., is being investigated because of reports that test 
documents on the fasteners were falsified.

Michela Figini of Switzerland, ending her Colorado jinx, rocketed to her sixth

Figini, who had finished no higher than seventh in her eight previous races in 
Colorado, led a Swiss sweep of the top three places in the final women's 
downhill of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Figini, whose two downhill victories in Canada last week gave her the season's 
downhill title for the third straight year, was clocked in 1 minute, 25.90 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Walliser was second in 1:26.49, and Chantal Bournissen took third in 1:26.99. 
</P>

Walliser won the other two downhills this season as the Swiss women claimed all 
eight events for the second straight season.

West Germany's Michaela Gerg wound up fourth in 1:27.20, and Veronika Wallinger

The Los Angeles Raiders today signed free agent lineman Dale Hellestrae, who 
finished the 1988 NFL season as a starting guard for the AFC East champion 
Buffalo Bills. Hellestrae, 26, was left on the Bills' unprotected list when the 
NFL's new free-agency system went into operation Feb. 1. Hellestrae, a 6-foot-5 
285-pounder, was a fourth-round draft choice of the Bills in 1985 after he 
completed his college career at Southern Methodist. He was a reserve interior 
lineman and long snapper for Buffalo until earning a starting berth last 
season. Among the games started by Hellestrae was one Dec. 11 when the Bills 
beat the Raiders 37-21 at Buffalo.

Lawyers for Los Angeles Lakers center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and an Italian man 
who claims Abdul-Jabbar injured him during a shoving incident in a Phoenix 
shopping mall have failed to reach an agreement. The negotiations Thursday 
before Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Barry Schneider could have avoided 
a trial scheduled to begin Tuesday in Municipal Court. Abdul-Jabbar, 41, the 
NBA's all-time top scorer, faces two misdemeanor charges in the April 21, 1988, 
incident. Fernando Nicolia, 40, of Rome claims he suffered facial injuries when 
Abdul-Jabbar stiff-armed him as he was trying to videotape the basketball 
player in the Metrocenter mall.
